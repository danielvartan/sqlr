AB  - Objective. To determine which treatment should be offered to women with a non-ruptured tubal pregnancy: a single dose of methotrexate (MTX) or laparoscopic surgery. Design. Prospective, randomized, open multicenter study. Setting. Seven Danish departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Sample. A total of 106 women diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy (EP). Methods. Between March 1997 and September 2000, 1, 265 women were diagnosed with EP, 395 (31%) were eligible, 109 (9%) were randomized of whom 106 had an EP. The study was originally powered to a sample size of 422 patients. The women were randomized to either medical (MTX; 53) or surgical (laparoscopic salpingotomy; 53) treatment. Follow-up by questionnaire and through national patient databases for a maximum of 10 years. Main outcome measures. Uneventful decline of plasma-human chorionic gonadotropin to less than 5 IU/L, rates of spontaneous, subsequent intrauterine, and recurrent ectopic pregnancies. Results. The success rates were 74% following MTX treatment and 87% after surgery (n.s.); the subsequent spontaneous intrauterine pregnancy rate was 73% after MTX and 62% after surgery; and the EP rate was 9.6% after MTX and 17.3% following surgery (n.s.). Conclusions. In women with an EP, who are hemodynamically stable and wishing to preserve their fertility, medical treatment with single dose MTX tends to be equal to treatment with laparoscopic surgery regarding success rate, complications, and subsequent fertility. Although the two treatment modalities seemed to be similar in outcome, it is crucial that the diagnosis is based on a high-quality ultrasonographic evaluation, as two patients had intrauterine pregnancies despite fulfilling the diagnostic algorithm for EP.

AB  - A suite of changes in circadian rhythms have been described in nocturnal rodents as females go through pregnancy and lactation, but there is no information on such patterns in diurnal species. As the challenges faced by these two groups of animals are somewhat different, we characterized changes in activity and core body temperature (Tb) in female diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as they went through a series of reproductive states: virgin, pregnant, pregnant and lactating, lactating only, and post-weaning. The phase of neither rhythm varied, but the amplitude did. Females increased their overall levels of daily activity from early to late pregnancy, regardless of whether they were also lactating. The pattern of activity was less rhythmic during early than mid-lactation, in both non-pregnant and pregnant females, as a consequence of a decrease in daytime relative to nighttime activity. The Tb rhythm amplitude dropped from mid-pregnancy through mid-lactation, and there were rises in Tb troughs during the mid-light and mid-dark phases of the day, though pregnancy and lactation affected Tb at these times in somewhat different ways. This study demonstrates that rhythms in diurnal grass rats change during pregnancy and lactation in different ways than those of nocturnal species that have been studied to date and that the effects of pregnancy and lactation are not additive in any simple way. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Kisspeptin (a product of the Kiss1 gene) and its receptor (GPR54 or Kiss1r) have emerged as key players in the regulation of reproduction. Mutations in humans or genetically targeted deletions in mice of either Kiss1 or Kiss1r cause profound hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Neurons that express Kiss1/kisspeptin are found in discrete nuclei in the hypothalamus, as well as other brain regions in many vertebrates, and their distribution, regulation, and function varies widely across species. Kisspeptin neurons directly innervate and stimulate GnRH neurons, which are the final common pathway through which the brain regulates reproduction. Kisspeptin neurons are sexually differentiated with respect to cell number and transcriptional activity in certain brain nuclei, and some kisspeptin neurons express other cotransmitters, including dynorphin and neurokinin B (whose physiological significance is unknown). Kisspeptin neurons express the estrogen receptor and the androgen receptor, and these cells are direct targets for the action of gonadal steroids in both male and female animals. Kisspeptin signaling in the brain has been implicated in mediating the negative feedback action of sex steroids on gonadotropin secretion, generating the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge, triggering and guiding the tempo of sexual maturation at puberty, controlling seasonal reproduction, and restraining reproductive activity during lactation. Kisspeptin signaling may also serve diverse functions outside of the classical realm of reproductive neuroendocrinology, including the regulation of metastasis in certain cancers, vascular dynamics, placental physiology, and perhaps even higher-order brain function.

AB  - Couples are waiting longer to have children, and advances in reproductive technology are allowing older men and women to consider having children. The lack of appreciation among both medical professionals and the lay public for the reality of a male biological clock makes these trends worrisome. The age-related changes associated with the male biological clock affect sperm quality, fertility, hormone levels, libido, erectile function, and a host of non-reproductive physiological issues. This article focuses on the potentially adverse effects of the male biological clock on fertility in older men. Advanced paternal age increases the risk for spontaneous abortion as well as genetic abnormalities in offspring due to multiple factors, including DNA damage from abnormal apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. Increased paternal age is also associated with a decrease in semen volume, percentage of normal sperm, and sperm motility. Older men considering parenthood should have a thorough history and physical examination focused on their sexual and reproductive capacity. Such examination should entail disclosure of any sexual dysfunction and the use of medications, drugs, or lifestyle factors that might impair fertility or sexual response. Older men should also be counseled regarding the effects of paternal age on spermatogenesis and pregnancy.

AB  - Similar to females, males have biological clocks that affect the quality of their sperm, fertility levels, and hormone levels. Advanced paternal age increases the risk for occurrence of spontaneous abortion as well as genetic abnormalities in offspring due to multiple factors including DNA damage from abnormal apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. Increased paternal age is associated with a decrease in semen volume, percentage of normal sperm, and sperm motility. Males of advanced age must have a thorough physical examination with disclosure of sexual dysfunction and any medications that impair ejaculation or sperm formation. Men of advanced age should be counseled regarding the effects of paternal age on spermatogenesis and pregnancy. Future research will clarify novel treatments to increase fertility, reduce adverse genetic consequences, and increase the chance for a couple to have healthy children. © 2009 Humana Press.

AB  - Background: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation. Aim: This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age. Participants: A national infant cohort (N = 35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N = 36) of low-risk infants born in the same period. Outcome measures: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups. Results: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness patterns. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Purpose of review: This review summarizes the currently available data concerning risk and management of venous thromboembolism in pregnant women with inherited thrombophilia. Summary: Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, and inherited thrombophilia increases this risk further. Despite the risks, the actual incidence of venous thromboembolism remains low, and therefore, the widespread use of anticoagulants for pregnant women with inherited thrombophilia is not advised. Although randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating the risks and benefits of anticoagulation have not been performed, there are data to support the use of low molecular weight heparin for high and intermediate-risk women. We will review these data and treatment recommendations, which are based on retrospective and case-control studies as well as expert opinion and consensus statements. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a molecule with diverse physiological functions. This neuro-hormone affects reproductive performance in a wide variety of species. In most animals, but not exclusively all, melatonin has an antigonadotrophic effect. The seasonal changes in the number of hours per day that melatonin is secreted mediate the temporal coupling of reproductive activity to seasonal changes in day-length. These observations stimulated a search for a role for the pineal gland and melatonin in human reproduction. Clinical experience related to this issue has yielded inconclusive and sometimes conflicting results. This article reviews the current available evidence concerning the effects of melatonin on human reproductive processes (e.g., puberty, ovulation, pregnancy, and fertility). Possible reasons for the vagueness and elusiveness of the clinical effects are discussed. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seasonal variation in serum melatonin levels and their relationship to the changes in the serum progesterone level, ovarian steroidogenesis, and embryonic development during two successive pregnancies of Cynopterus sphinx. Circulating melatonin concentrations showed two peaks; one coincided with the period of low progesterone synthesis and delayed embryonic development, whereas the second peak coincided with regressing corpus luteum. This finding suggests that increased serum melatonin level during November-December may be responsible for delayed embryonic development by suppressing progesterone synthesis. The study showed increased melatonin receptors (MTNR1A and MTNR1B) in the corpus luteum and in the utero-embryonic unit during the period of delayed embryonic development. The in vitro study showed that a high dose of melatonin suppressed progesterone synthesis, whereas a lower dose of melatonin increased progesterone synthesis by the ovary. The effects of melatonin on ovarian steroidogenesis are mediated through changes in the expression of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme, and LH receptor proteins. This study further showed a suppressive impact of melatonin on the progesterone receptor (PGR) in the utero-embryonic unit; this effect might contribute to delayed embryonic development in C. sphinx. The results of the present study thus suggest that a high circulating melatonin level has a dual contribution in retarding embryonic development in C. sphinx by impairing progesterone synthesis as well as by inhibiting progesterone action by reducing expression of PGR in the utero-embryonic unit. © 2009 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

AB  - Somites are formed progressively from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) in a highly regulated process according to a strict periodicity driven by an oscillatory mechanism. The Notch and Wnt pathways are key components in the regulation of this somitic oscillator and data from Xenopus and zebrafish embryos indicate that the Notch-downstream target Nrarp participates in the regulation of both activities. We have analyzed Nrarp/nrarp-a expression in the PSM of chick, mouse and zebrafish embryos, and we show that it cycles in synchrony with other Notch regulated cyclic genes. In the mouse its transcription is both Wnt- and Notch-dependent, whereas in the chick and fish embryo it is simply Notch-dependent. Despite oscillating mRNA levels, Nrarp protein does not oscillate in the PSM. Finally, neither gain nor loss of Nrarp function interferes with the normal expression of Notch-related cyclic genes. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low versus physiologic plasma progesterone concentrations during the ovulatory wave on fertility in cattle. Suckled beef cows (Bos taurus; n = 129) and pubertal heifers (Bos taurus; n = 150) at random stages of the estrous cycle were given a luteolytic dose of prostaglandin F2α (500 μg cloprostenol; PGF) twice, 11 d apart. Ten days after the second PGF treatment, cattle were given estradiol benzoate im (1.5 and 1.0 mg for cows and heifers, respectively) and a progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (Cue-Mate) with a single pod containing 0.78 g progesterone (Day 0). Cattle in the low-progesterone group (n = 148) received a luteolytic dose of PGF on Day 0, whereas those in the high-progesterone (i.e., physiologic plasma concentrations) group (n = 131) were allowed to retain their corpora lutea. On Day 8, the Cue-Mate was removed, and PGF was given to both groups. Fifty-four hours to 56 h later, cattle received 12.5 mg of porcine LH (pLH) im and were concurrently artificially inseminated. The dominant follicle in the low-progesterone group was larger (P &lt; 0.001) than that in the high-progesterone group on the day of insemination (14.9 ± 0.3 mm vs. 12.7 ± 0.3 mm, mean ± SEM). At 7 d after ovulation, the low-progesterone group had a larger corpus luteum (24.5 ± 0.54 mm vs. 21.9 ± 0.64 mm, P &lt; 0.01) and higher plasma progesterone concentration (4.0 ± 0.3 vs. 3.1 ± 0.2, P &lt; 0.01) than that of the high-progesterone group. However, pregnancy rates did not differ (79 of 148, 53.4%, and 70 of 131, 53.4%) for low- and high-progesterone groups, respectively). In summary, low circulating progesterone concentrations during the growing phase of the ovulatory follicle resulted in a larger dominant follicle and a larger CL that produced more progesterone, with no significant effect on pregnancy rate. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cyanotoxins are the metabolites of cyanobacteria, belonging to different chemical groups and of diverse mechanisms of toxicity. Generally, they are divided into hepatotoxins, neurotoxins and dermatotoxins/irritant toxins. There is a growing evidence, that besides the above mentioned toxicity, exposure to cyanotoxins may also induce other effects, among others the disruption of neuroendocrine and immune systems. The purpose of that paper is to sum up the current information obtained from the literature and from our own studies about the influence of cyanohepatotoxins on neuroendocrine and immune systems of fish. From the presented data it appears, that microcystins, nodularin and cylindrospermopsin, except for their hepatotoxic activity, are potent to exert such effects as HPI axis activation resulting in physiological and behavioural changes, disturbances in thyroid hormones release/metabolism, as well as impairment of immune responses in fish. However the studies in that area are still incomplete and many questions remain to be answered, especially what consequences for fish population health status it brings. © 2009 Neuroendocrinology Letters.

AB  - The authors have shown that, via activation of its MT1 receptor, melatonin modulates the transcriptional activity of various nuclear receptors and the proliferation of both ERα+ and ERα- human breast cancer cells. Employing dominant-negative (DN) and dominant-positive (DP) G proteins, it was demonstrated that Gαi2 proteins mediate the suppression of estrogen-induced ERα transcriptional activity by melatonin, whereas the Gαq proteins mediate the enhancement of retinoid-induced RARαtranscriptional activity by melatonin. In primary human breast tumors, the authors' studies demonstrate an inverse correlation between ERα and MT1 receptor expression, and confocal microscopic studies demonstrate that the MT1 receptor is localized to the caveoli and that its expression can be repressed by estrogen and melatonin. Melatonin, via activation of its MT1 receptor, suppresses the development and growth of breast cancer by regulation of growth factors, regulation of gene expression, regulation of clock genes, inhibition of tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and even regulation of mammary gland development. The authors have previously reported that the clock gene, Period 2 (Per2), is not expressed in human breast cancer cells but that its reexpression in breast cancer cells results in increased expression of p53 and induction of apoptosis. The authors demonstrate that melatonin, via repression of RORαtranscriptional activity, blocks the expression of the clock gene BMAL1. Melatonin's blockade of BMAL1 expression is associated with the decreased expression of SIRT1, a member of the Silencing Information Regulator family and a histone and protein deacetylase that inhibits the expression of DNA repair enzymes (p53, BRCA1 &amp; 2, and Ku70) and the expression of apoptosis-associated genes. Finally, the authors developed an MMTV-MT1-flag mammary knock-in transgenic mouse that displays reduced ductal branching, ductal epithelium proliferation, and reduced terminal end bud formation during puberty and pregnancy. Lactating female MT1 transgenic mice show a dramatic reduction in the expression of β-casein and whey acidic milk proteins. Further analyses showed significantly reduced ERα expression in mammary glands of MT1 transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that the MT1 receptor is a major transducer of melatonin's actions in the breast, suppressing mammary gland development and mediating the anticancer actions of melatonin through multiple pathways. © The Author(s) 2009.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to assess possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and sleep disturbances in 2-month-old infants. Subjects and methods: The study comprised 200 apparently healthy infants from community settings selected by chance (88 boys, 112 girls), aged 2 months, who were singletons born in St. Petersburg in 2007. The mothers were asked to complete the questionnaires addressing major infant, maternal and demographic characteristics with particular emphasis on maternal smoking during pregnancy. As a part of the interview, the mothers were requested to describe possible sleep disturbances in their infants, divided into five major sleep domains: bedtime problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, awakenings, regularity and duration of sleep as well as snoring. Results: Of 200 mothers, 63 (31.5%) smoked during pregnancy. The babies born to smoking mothers more commonly were reported as having bedtime problems [odds ratio (OR)=2.75; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-6.58], and this association remained significant after adjustment was made for major potential confounders. Maternal smoking after delivery did not significantly add to the risk. Babies born to smoking mothers more often had irregular sleep, but this association was markedly influenced by the confounding effect of maternal education. No statistically significant differences were found for total night time sleep duration, the frequency of night time awakenings, excessive night time waking and daytime sleepiness as well as for snoring and noisy breathing during sleep. Conclusion: Maternal smoking during pregnancy should be considered as a risk factor for infant bedtime problems, emerging as early as 2 months of age. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Obesity in pregnancy (pregravid body mass index ≥ 30) has been linked to several adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal macrosomia, cesarean delivery, and wound complications post-cesarean section. Intrapartum and postpartum management of obese gravidas requires multidisciplinary consultations between obstetricians, anesthesiologists, nurses, and pediatricians in order to improve the pregnancy outcomes of the mother and neonate. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently supports risk-reducing strategies for obese pregnant patients, including limiting weight gain to 15 lb (standardized by the Institute of Medicine). Interventions to reduce gestational weight gain may be important modifiable risk factors for maternal and fetal perinatal complications. Interventions have targeted modifications of diet and exercise with educational methods such as radio broadcasts, pamphlets, and counseling. Interventions have also focused on motivational methods, such as individual and group classes, and have been implemented both before conception and immediately after birth. Effective interventions appear to be individualized in approach, but there is a lack of data to support any specific model. Prospective interventional studies are needed to demonstrate the benefits of weight limitation on pregnancy outcomes. © 2009 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

AB  - Pregnant women diagnosed with major depression were given 12 weeks of twice per week massage therapy by their significant other or only standard treatment as a control group. The massage therapy group women versus the control group women not only had reduced depression by the end of the therapy period, but they also had reduced depression and cortisol levels during the postpartum period. Their newborns were also less likely to be born prematurely and low birthweight, and they had lower cortisol levels and performed better on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment habituation, orientation and motor scales. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability is promising for assessing fetal condition. Before using spectral analysis for fetal monitoring it has to be determined whether there should be a correction for gestational age or behavioural state. Aims: Compare spectral values of heart rate variability between near term and post term fetuses during active and quiet sleep. Study design: Case-control. Cases had a gestational age of ≥ 42 weeks; controls were 36 to 37 weeks. Fetuses were matched for birth weight percentile. Subjects: STAN® registrations from healthy fetuses. For each fetus one 5-minute segment was selected during active and one during quiet sleep. Outcome measures: Absolute and normalized low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency power (0.4-1.5 Hz) of heart rate variability. Results: Twenty fetuses were included. No significant differences were found between cases and controls in absolute (481 and 429 respectively, P = 0.88) or normalized low (0.78 and 0.80 respectively, P = 0.50) or absolute (41 and 21 respectively, P = 0.23) or normalized high frequency power (0.08 and 0.07 respectively, P = 0.20) during active state. During rest, normalized low frequency power was lower (0.58 and 0.69 respectively, P = 0.03) and absolute (16 and 10 respectively, P = 0.04) and normalized high frequency power were higher (0.21 and 0.14 respectively, P = 0.01) in cases compared to controls. Absolute and normalized low frequency power were higher during active state compared to rest in both groups (all P values &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: We found sympathetic predominance during active state in fetuses around term. Post term parasympathetic modulation during rest was increased compared to near term. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%) reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525 (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This article will suggest that moderate sleep apnea may have an adaptive benefit, the reduction of nocturnal, respiratory heat loss, that may have caused it to be selected for despite the associated disadvantages. Sleep apnea is caused by the collapse of the throat, specifically the pharyngeal airway, during sleep and can result in discomfort and hypoxia. The large size of the fleshy structures in the pharynx and hypotonicity of the pharyngeal musculature are what cause humans, and many other species of mammals, to be susceptible to apnea. There are many functional and anatomical parallels between sleep apnea and a well known, thermoregulatory response that minimizes respiratory cooling in the lower airways known as reflex bronchoconstriction. Bronchoconstriction involves the constriction of the inner airways, the bronchioles, in response to cold air, a reaction that acts to warm inspired air before it makes contact with the more sensitive lower airways and alveoli. Because air is colder at night and body temperature drops severely during sleep, sleep apnea may represent a similar protective, thermoregulatory adaptation. When the pharynx is collapsed, the diameter of the pharyngeal airway decreases, allowing increased intermolecular collisions between inspired air and the epithelial walls of the upper airway. An increase in the number of collisions facilitates the transference of both warmth and humidity to inspired air before it reaches the more sensitive lower airway resulting in the maintenance of internal, core temperature and alveolar heat retention. In fact, sleep apnea can be conceptualized as a functional reversal of the thermoregulatory process of panting, where the pharynx is highly dilated instead of collapsed. Given the disorder associated with sleep apnea, the absence of a disease state secondary to surgical correction, the fact that the disorder is exclusive to warm-blooded animals, the high proclivity for collapse documented in pregnant mothers, and the functional similarities between collapse and reflex bronchoconstriction, it appears that the phenomenon may represent an evolutionary trade-off that helped to minimize respiratory cooling. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Prevalence studies show that 1 in 5 women experience an episode of major depressive disorder during their lifetime. The peripartum period is a prime time for symptom exacerbation and relapse of depressive episodes. Health care providers, specifically those in obstetric care, should be aware of: (1) the frequency of depression in pregnant and postpartum women; (2) signs, symptoms, and appropriate screening methods; and (3) the health risks for the mother and growing fetus if depression is undetected or untreated. Because management of depressed peripartum women also includes care of a growing fetus or breastfeeding infant, treatment may be complex and requires input from a multidisciplinary team, including an obstetrician, psychiatrist, and pediatrician, to provide optimal care. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To examine the extent and clinical sequelae of fetal exposure to zolpidem, a commonly prescribed hypnotic agent. Pregnant women with psychiatric illness participating in a study of psychotropic pharmacokinetics were included. Zolpidem concentrations were analyzed in maternal and umbilical cord plasma collected at delivery. Outcomes were compared between the zolpidem-exposed group and a 1:1 matched comparator group. Forty-five women taking zolpidem during pregnancy were studied. Rates of preterm delivery and low birth weight were 26.7% and 15.6% respectively in the zolpidem-exposed group versus 13.3% and 4.4% in the matched comparator group, but no significant differences were found. The ratio of umbilical cord to maternal plasma zolpidem concentrations in 6 pairs ranged from 0.48 to 2.75. Zolpidem crosses the human placenta and rapidly clears the fetal circulation. Pregnant women with psychiatric illness treated with zolpidem may have less optimal obstetrical outcome, though it is unclear if this was related to the medication. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to statistically evaluate the independent and interacting effects of biological and environmental risk factors that influence lateralization of deformational plagiocephaly (DP) in an attempt to provide future guidance for clinical treatment. METHODS: A database of >20 000 children treated for DP was examined by using 2-and 3-way factor analyses for categorical frequency data, representing the largest statistical analysis of DP to date. Data on parity, zygosity, intrauterine presentation, birth number and weight, sleep position, lateralization, and sex were collected from parents of children with DP who were treated at Cranial Technologies, Inc, from 1990 to 2007. RESULTS: As with most DP studies, male patients were significantly overrepresented. Nonetheless, after statistically accounting for sex in our analyses, DP is significantly correlated with primiparity, fewer vertex but more breech and transverse intrauterine presentations, twinning (specifically, dizygosity), and, finally, right-sided lateralization. Additional analyses revealed that several factors correlated with DP, such as intrauterine presentation, sleep position, and lateralization, are not easily explained by an underlying biological factor. Instead, sleep position was the single greatest predictor of lateralization. CONCLUSION: Although previous studies have argued for both environmental and underlying biological factors associated with DP, we found that lateralization in children with DP could be largely explained by environmental factors such as sleep position.

AB  - Objectives Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy(J.M.E.) needs life-long anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment. Of various drugs tried in this condition, valproate effectively treats all types of seizures seen in J.M.E. Among valproate side effects, neural tube defects (NTD) in the offspring, is a deterring factor in its use in childbearing period. To avoid NTD, most authorities advise on switching to AED drug before conception.As well, the effects of valproate on male fertility is feared of. Clonazepam controls only the myoclonic jerks, leaving the patients unprotected and susceptible to generalized seizures, which mostly occur in the morning after sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is the most prevalent precipitating factor for generalized seizures in these patients. Materials &Methods Between Jan 2003 & April 2008, 15 newly diagnosed JME patients (9 girls, 6 boys), were given clonazepam (1.0-4.0 mg) at bedtime, and were compared to 16 patients on valproate treatment. All were advised to avoid sleep deprivation. Results This study showed, all patients in the clonazepam group, (100 %) had full control of their myoclonic jerks; 4(26.6%) had breakthrough episodes of generalized seizures, provoked by sleep deprivation; the rest (11,73.4 %), were in full remission of their myoclonic and generalized seizures. In control group, 2(12.5 %), had episodes of breakthrough, sleep-deprived, generalized seizures;the rest(14, 87.5%) were in remission. Statistically, there was no significance between the results in both groups. Clonazepam side effects were limited to mild to moderate drowsiness in the morning, eliminated by giving the dose earlier at night. Conclusion The study suggests that if J.M.E. patients avoid sleep deprivation, they can be treated with clonazepam alone to avoid side effects of valproate.

AB  - Sleeping arrangements under long-lasting impregnated nets (LLIN) were recorded in 2467 households during the low malaria transmission season (May-June 2007) and the same families were followed up during the high malaria transmission season (December 2007-January 2008) in two malaria-endemic areas of Sri Lanka. Approximately 800 households each from the three main ethnic groups were studied. The number of families lost to follow-up was 68. A significant increase was seen in the proportion of households using LLINs the previous night during the high transmission season (96%) compared with the low transmission season (90%) (P ≤ 0.001 for all three ethnic groups). When sleeping arrangements of the entire population were considered, priority to sleep under the LLIN was given to children under 5 years during both seasons. The percentage of children under five who slept under a LLIN increased from 75% during the low transmission season to 90% during the high transmission season. Utilisation of LLINs by pregnant women was low; only approximately 45% of pregnant women reported sleeping under a LLIN during both seasons. The study suggests the possible need for re-focusing of health education messages regarding the importance of LLIN use among pregnant women. © 2008 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is estimated to affect 50- 90% of women during pregnancy with more than a third of women reporting it as a severe problem compromising their ability to work during pregnancy and affecting normal daily life and sleep patterns. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in kinematics and kinetics of lifting in pregnant subjects. Methodology Fifteen maternal subjects (age: 32.0±2.3 yrs; height: 165.3±5.5cm; weight: 71.7±6.4kg) were tested at the third trimester of pregnancy (32-38 weeks). Twenty-seven retro reflective markers were placed on the various bony landmarks of the subjects. An eight-camera motion analysis system (VICON 512, VICON, Oxford, UK) was used to record movements of the body segment and synchronised force plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) parameters in three dimensions. Eight non-pregnant subjects (age: 29.6±3.1yrs; height:167.3±5.6cm; weight:65.4±8.4kg) were used as controls. Each subject lifted a 4 kg plastic box (dimension: 31.5x25x20 cm), which is representative of commonly lifted items. Motion of the ankle, knee and hip joints and pelvic segments were investigated. Principal component (PC) analysis was applied to 23 kinematic and kinetic variables from each group. The total PC score for each subject was calculated, and a one-tail student-t test was used to test for significant differences between the groups. Results Significant group differences (p<0.05) were found for three of the PC scores. Parameters found to be major contributors to these differences included minimum hip flexion extension moment; maximum knee flexion moment; maximum ankle plantar flexion and knee flexion angles and average hip flexion extension angles. Discussion PCA was able to identify different lifting kinematics and kinetics in pregnant subjects and important biomechanical differences when compared with the control group. This is the first study to identify such lifting differences during pregnancy. © 2009 International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineering.

AB  - In hospitals, women of reproductive age do a range of work tasks, some of which are known to carry potential risks. Tasks such as working with radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents, as well as performing heavy lifting or tasks requiring erratic sleep patterns have been reported to increase the risk of reproductive failures. Our aim was to study pregnancy outcomes in female hospital workers in Denmark. We performed a cohort study of 5976 female hospital workers and used as a reference group 60,890 women employed outside of hospitals. The reproductive health of hospital workers working during pregnancy is comparable to those of non-hospital workers for the majority of reproductive failures studied. However, an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities was noted in some subgroups of hospital workers, which may indicate that some hospital work still entails fetotoxic hazards.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are sleep disorders that are commonly seen in clinical practice. The standard treatment recommendations for these disorders are pharmacologic; both conditions are typically managed with pramipexole or ropinirole, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of RLS. A mix of behavioral suggestions is included in treatment algorithms for providers and in patient education materials. Although these suggestions have considerable merit, they are typically not delivered as an intervention, but instead provided as a series of helpful tips. There is emerging evidence for providing such suggestions as part of a cognitive-behavioral package to be delivered as active treatments for RLS or PLMD. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Correctional facilities have become, by default, one of the largest providers of mental health care for patients with serious mental illness. In its 2002 Report to Congress, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care has reported that most facilities do not provide quality mental health care, nor do they conform to nationally accepted guidelines for mental health screening and treatment. This article describes the product of a consensus panel of correctional health care experts, charged to develop performance measures, based on nationally accepted standards, for selected elements of psychiatric treatment behind bars, aimed to improve the quality of care. Performance measures were developed for medication adherence, suicide prevention, mental health treatment planning, and sleep medication usage. © 2009 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Aim: The study aimed to assess the time of labour onset and its symptoms as perceived by women in labour and midwives, and the relationship between these and first stage duration. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study of women with a singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation was performed in 41 maternity units. The sample comprised 1,170 women, 611 nulliparae (np) and 559 multiparae (mp), who answered two standardized questions on the onset of labour and selected the applicable symptoms of labour onset from a list of eight. A multivariate Cox regression model was computed covering further perinatal factors. Results: The median durations of the first stage of labour as assessed by the women themselves were 11 (np) and 6.5 h (mp), and as assessed by the midwives 7 (np) and 4 h (mp). Median time intervals between the start of labour onset symptoms as perceived by the women concerned and the midwives' diagnoses varied greatly: the shortest related to watery fluid loss (np = 1.5 h, mp = 0.0 h), the longest to alterations in sleep patterns (np = 11.5 h, mp = 4.5 h). Irregular pain, watery fluid loss and the time between self-diagnosed and professionally diagnosed onset of labour were just as closely associated with the duration of the first stage of labour as perinatal factors. Significant perinatal factors were induction with oxytocin, herbal remedies and PROM. Conclusions: The perceptions of women in labour are as important as perinatal factors in determining the duration of the first stage of labour and should be taken into account in intrapartum care. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary sustained and often painful muscle contraction, usually producing repetitive movements or abnormal positions of the mouth, jaw and/or tongue. We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a 1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible relationship between OMD and hormonal factors. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related movement disorder characterized by a disagreeable sensation in the limbs which worsens at night and in rest condition and is improved by movement. The majority of patients with RLS present periodic limb movements (PLM), insomnia and a good response to the dopamine-agonists compounds. The natural course of RLS is generally chronic with only sporadic and irregular periods of remission. In idiopathic cases the neurological examination is unremarkable and often a positive family history is reported. Standard diagnostic criteria for the clinical diagnosis of RLS and for the polysomnographic scoring of PLM, as well as specific tools to quantify the RLS severity are available. Several conditions, such as iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, antidopaminergic medications and neurological disorders, may induce symptomatic forms of the syndrome. RLS is a common and often underdiagnosed disorder, with a prevalence around 5-10% in the general population. Although the pathogenesis of RLS/PLM is still unknown, there are pieces of evidence which support a dysfunction of the descending hypothalamic inhibitory dopaminergic pathways to the spinal cord. For their tolerability, safety, half-life and efficacy, which is evident immediately and also at low dosages, the non-ergot derivate dopamlne-agonlsts represent the first choice treatment in RLS. Iron, benzodiazepines and antlepileptic drugs are also available as a second line or combined treatment.

AB  - Two weeks of touch intervention, either Yakson or Gentle Human Touch (GHT) have been shown to reduce the levels of stress hormones. This study evaluated the acute impact of both interventions on state during and immediately after touch. Forty preterm infants with a gestational age of ≤34 weeks received either Yakson or GHT for 15 days. A significantly greater sleeping state was identified in both groups after touch. This effect was significantly stronger with Yakson than GHT. During touch, about half the Yakson infants showed an arousal effect while the GHT infants showed little change. Both interventions left the babies calmer after touch. This calming effect is consistent with the previously observed effect on stress hormones and should be beneficial in terms of growth and development. Yakson had an arousing effect on a subset of the infants during touch, which possibly could be beneficial in terms of social development. © The Author(s), 2009.

AB  - We describe a mentally retarded 24-year-old man followed by our group since age 18 months who exhibited nearly continuous stereotypic movements while awake. These movements, which have persisted over many years, consist of synchronous lateral flexion at the neck and waist. Movements could be partially voluntarily suppressed and disappeared in sleep. The patient has drug-resistant seizures and a constellation of dysmorphic features, including coarse face, large nose, large thin lips, brachicephaly, marked hirsutism on the face, and limbs proportionally smaller than the trunk, which suggests that the unusual stereotypic movements described may be part of a syndrome. Routine and full metabolic serum and urine analyses, full ophthalmological examination, internal organs ultrasound examination, full skeletal survey, standard karyotype and array-CGH analysis yielded normal results. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - Malaria chemotherapy is under constant threat from the emergence and spread of multidrug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum. Resistance has been observed to almost all currently used antimalarials. Some drugs are also limited by toxicity. A fundamental component of the strategy for malaria chemotherapy is based on prompt, effective and safe antimalarial drugs. To counter the threat of resistance of P. falciparum to existing monotherapeutic regimens, current malaria treatment is based principally on the artemisinin group of compounds, either as monotherapy or artemisinin-based combination therapies for treatment of both uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria. Key advantages of artemisinins over the conventional antimalarials include their rapid and potent action, with good tolerability profiles. Their action also covers transmissible gametocytes, resulting in decreased disease transmission. Up to now there has been no prominent report of drug resistance to this group of compounds. Treatment of malaria in pregnant women requires special attention in light of limited treatment options caused by potential teratogenicity coupled with a paucity of safety data for the mother and fetus. Treatment of other malaria species is less problematic and chloroquine is still the drug of choice, although resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine has been reported. Multiple approaches to the identification of new antimalarial targets and promising antimalarial drugs are being pursued in order to cope with drug resistance. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - The review was made on gene pass conception as individual DNA data bank reflecting unique genetic peculiarities of each human, its major potential contribution in achievements of active longevity and creation most favorable conditions for maximal duration of individual life-span. Participation of major age-regulated genes such as biological clock genes and the weak chain genes in aging processes of humans is briefly outlined. The significance of genetic testing of allelic polymorphisms and marker-genes implicated in common multifactorial disorders is stressed. The problems evoked by genetic results interpretation are mentioned. Special attention is paid to Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) technology implemented for analysis of genetic profiles and candidate genes associated with common diseases. Scientific problems and social interests in creation of individually oriented DNA-data banks (Gene Passes) amenable for the pregnant women, children, sportsmen, etc. are discussed. The relationship of Gene Pass idea to the current international genetic program "Personificated Genome" is highlighted. Feasible perspectives for genetic testing and basic contribution of Gene Pass into gerontology practical medical service are reviewed.

AB  - Hypnotic effects of melatonin and melatoninergic drugs are mediated via MT1 and MT2 receptors, especially those in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which acts on the hypothalamic sleep switch. Therefore, they differ fundamentally from GABAergic hypnotics. Melatoninergic agonists primarily favor sleep initiation and reset the circadian clock to phases allowing persistent sleep, as required in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A major obstacle for the use of melatonin to support sleep maintenance in primary insomnia results from its short half-life in the circulation. Solutions to this problem have been sought by developing prolonged-release formulations of the natural hormone, or melatoninergic drugs of longer half-life, such as ramelteon, tasimelteon and agomelatine. With all these drugs, improvements of sleep are statistically demonstrable, but remain limited, especially in primary chronic insomnia, so that GABAergic drugs may be indicated. Melatoninergic agonists do not cause next-day hangover and withdrawal effects, or dependence. They do not induce behavioral changes, as sometimes observed with z-drugs. Despite otherwise good tolerability, the use of melatoninergic drugs in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy has been a matter of concern, and should be avoided in autoimmune diseases and Parkinsonism. Problems and limits of melatoninergic hypnotics are compared. © 2009 Hardeland, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - RLS is a common sleep disorder with distinctive clinical features. The prevalence of RLS in Caucasians and North Americans ranges from 5% to 10%. However, only some of these subjects (almost the 3% of the general population) report being affected by a frequent and severe form of the sleep disorder. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of four internationally recognized criteria that summarize the main characteristics of the sleep disorder. Besides the essential criteria, supportive and associated features of RLS have been established by experts in order to help physicians treat patients with doubtful symptoms. Several clinical conditions may mimic this sleep disorder. In order to increase the sensibility and specificity of RLS diagnosis, doctors should perform a meticulous patient history and then an accurate physical and neurological examination. Dopamine agonists are recognized as the preferred first-line treatment for RLS. Rotigotine is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist with selectivity for D1, D2 and D3 receptors. The drug is administered via transdermal patches which release rotigotine for 24 hours. Four clinical trials demonstrated that this compound is able to improve RLS symptomatology with few and moderate adverse events. Head to head trials are required to compare the efficacy and tolerability of rotigotine with other dopamine agonists administered via oral intake. Rotigotine has been approved by the FDA and EMEA for Parkinson's disease. For the treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic RLS, rotigotine has been recommended for approval by the EMEA and is under review by the FDA. © 2009 Merlino et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in young adults and causes significant psychosocial impairment and economic burden to society. Because of the paucity of long-term evidence and lack of national guidelines for diagnosis and management of adult ADHD, most of the data are based on experience derived from management of childhood ADHD. This article reviews the current evidence for the diagnosis and management of adult ADHD with special emphasis on the role of methylphenidate hydrochloride preparations in its treatment. Methylphenidate hydrochloride, a stimulant that acts through the dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways, has shown more than 75% efficacy in controlling the symptoms of adult ADHD. Although concern for diversion of the drug exists, recent data have shown benefits in preventing substance use disorders in patients with adult ADHD. © 2009 Nair and Moss, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Objective.Continuous fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is considered by some as necessary to the expectant management of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). No data exist to support this premise, and liability may be incurred if such an order cannot be practically carried out. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the performance of prolonged FHR monitoring in terms of the completeness of recorded tracings. Methods.A retrospective cohort study was performed between 2004 and 2006 in a tertiary care hospital on patients being expectantly managed with PPROM at 2434 weeks of gestation. Forty-seven singleton gravidas with a physician order of continuous external FHR monitoring were included. Exclusion criteria were evidence of labour, chorioamnionitis or FHR abnormalities that prompted delivery. FHR tracings during the prolonged monitoring period were reviewed. Results.The study cohort was monitored for a duration of 321-2272 min (mean 970 min). In total, 28.3%(95% confidence interval 23.8-33%) of the tracing did not show a legible recording. Gestational age is negatively correlated with the proportion of absent tracing, whereas body mass index is positively correlated. There is no significant difference in the absent signal proportion between the first half of the monitoring period and the second half or between day and night. Conclusions.In patients with PPROM being expectantly managed, a significant proportion (28.3%) of the FHR tracing was not recorded as ordered. This suggests that 'continuous' prolonged external fetal monitoring may not be practically feasible and alternative monitoring approaches should be considered. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Summary Most of the adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy on the fetus are usually as a consequence of placental malaria PM. This study was conducted with the objective of determining the prevalence, risk factors and pregnancy outcome of PM. A cross-sectional study of 437 pregnant women who delivered at the UMTH, Maiduguri was conducted between 24 July 2007 and 12 January 2008. Placental histology was done for the malaria parasite. Maternal packed cell volume was done and thick blood films were studied for the malaria parasite in maternal peripheral blood and the cord blood/heel prick of their babies. The prevalence of PM was 33.9 148/437. It is associated with non-usage of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy IPT and maternal HIV infection. PM in turn predisposes to low birth weight and cord parasitaemia. Only 2.8 of the women were sleeping under insecticide-treated nets ITNs. The high prevalence of PM calls for renewed efforts for preventive measures, particularly the routine use of IPT and ITN during the antenatal period. © 2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus are the principal pacemaker in mammals, controlling daily, circadian rhythms in physiology and behaviour. Environmental light during development has long-term effects on circadian behaviour, but it is still unclear what the relevant adaptations within the brain are. In the present study, we examined the manifestation of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity, and the expression of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and vasointestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the SCN of adult mice reared under different light environments during the suckling period, and synchronised to light/dark cycles after weaning. We found that animals reared under constant light had higher amplitude and more stable activity rhythms, together with lower levels of VIP- and AVP-immunostaining in the SCN, compared to mice reared under light/dark cycles or constant darkness. Differences in AVP expression were also found in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus, two brain areas which receive SCN projections. These results indicate that the postnatal light experience may affect clock function and clock output, and suggest implications for the control of hormonal homeostasis and circadian behaviour. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by loss of the muscle atonia of REM sleep, with release of complex and violent behaviors that are often attempted dream-enactments. This study reviewed the literature on RBD with regard to potentially lethal behavior. A total of 39-41 clinical cases of RBD associated with potentially lethal behaviors to self and/or others were found, involving a child and adults of all age groups, that manifested as choking/headlock (n = 22-24), defenestration/near-defenestration (n = 7), and diving from bed (n = 10). A total of 80.8% (n = 21) were males; 19.2% (n = 5) were females; mean age was 65.6 ± (SD) 13.8 years (range: 27-81 years, and a child). (Gender/age data were not listed in the remaining cases.) An etiologic association of RBD with a neurologic disorder (or with pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders, n = 4) was present in 21-23 patients. Thus, RBD carries well-documented, potential forensic consequences during RBD episodes that could possibly have been misinterpreted as suicidal or homicidal behavior. © 2009 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

AB  - Ekbom K, Ulfberg J (Department of Neurology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sleep Disorders Center, Avesta Hospital, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden). Restless legs syndrome (Review). J Intern Med 2009; 266: 419-431. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensory-motor disorder that is characterized by intense restlessness and unpleasant creeping sensations deep inside the lower legs. Symptoms appear when the legs are at rest and are worst in the evening and at night. They force patients to keep moving their legs, and often to get out of bed and wander about. Periodic limb movements (PLMS) are also common during sleep amongst those suffering from RLS, and sleep efficiency is severely reduced. There are idiopathic as well as symptomatic forms of RLS, the latter being associated with e.g. pregnancy, iron deficiency and chronic renal failure. A family history of RLS is very common and pedigrees in these cases suggest an autosomal-dominant transmission with high penetrance. Genetic investigations have been performed in order to identify genes associated with RLS. Several loci have been found (on chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, 20p and 16p). Pathophysiology of RLS remains incompletely understood. However, advanced brain imaging studies and positive results of dopaminergic treatment suggest that RLS may be generated by dopamine dysfunction locally within the central nervous system. At present, there is a wide range of treatment options including levodopa, dopamine agonists, opioids, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and iron supplements. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are now widely used as a first-line treatment for depression and many other psychiatric conditions, are generally well tolerated, they are not devoid of side effects. Most short-term treatment-related side effects of SSRIs are transient and disappear after a few days or weeks. However, following long-term treatment with the SSRIs, some serious adverse events may occur. Some of them can be difficult to recognise because they can resemble residual symptoms of depression. The most serious can be life threatening. They all have a negative influence on the patients quality of life and are frequently a prime reason for a lack of long-term compliance with the associated increased risk of recurrence of a depressive episode. This article is an overview of the more common adverse events, which are seen with non-acute treatment with the SSRIs. © 2009 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to explore health promoting lifestyles and related factors in pregnant women. Methods: This was a descriptive study using convenience sampling. Altogether, 172 pregnant women were recruited from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Personal data was collected, and the instruments used included perceived health status, self-efficacy of health behaviors, perception of family or peers' health-promoting behaviors, and Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP Π). Results: The results showed that the standardized total score of health promoting lifestyles was 66.88 (moderate level). The subscales of the HPLP Π in descending order of standardized scores were as follows: "interpersonal relationships," "health responsibility," "psychological wellness," "nutrition," "stress management" and "physical activity." There were significant differences in the total scores of the HPLP Π among subjects with different educational level, socioeconomic status, chronic diseases, exercise habits, length of sleep, and perceived health status. Both perception of health-promoting behaviors among family (or peers) and self-efficacy of health behaviors had significantly positive relationships with health-promoting lifestyles. Perception of the family or peers' health-promoting behaviors, self-efficacy of health behaviors, perceived health status and chronic diseases were the four significant predictors of health-promoting lifestyles, accounting for 62.4% of the variance. Conclusion: The findings of this study could be used as a reference for prenatal care, nursing education, and maternal / neonatal health policies.

AB  - Change in facial expression over a fixed time after a noxious stimulus is the key measure used to calculate pain scores in preterm and newborn infants. We hypothesised that the latency of facial motor responses would be longer in the youngest premature infants and that behavioural scoring methods of pain may need to take this into account. One hundred and seventy-two clinically required heel lances were performed in 95 infants from 25 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Sixty-four percentage of the heel lances evoked a change in facial expression. Change in facial expression was observed in infants across the whole age range from 25 weeks PMA and the latency to the facial expression response ranged from 1 to 17 s. Latency to facial expression change was dependent on the infants' PMA at the time of the heel lance. Infants below 32 weeks PMA had a significantly longer latency to change in facial expression than older infants (54% increase in infants below 32 weeks; p < 0.001). Sleep state and presence of brain damage (IVH grades 1-4) did not significantly increase the latency (p > 0.05 for each variable). Intravenous morphine at the time of the heel lance significantly increased the latency to facial expression response (p < 0.001) but the analysis shows that latency is highly dependent on PMA independent of morphine administration. These findings highlight developmental changes underlying infant behaviour that are critically important if pain scores are to be correctly interpreted. © 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) family, CRH, CRH-related peptides and their receptors (R) play major roles in coordinating the behavioral, endocrine, autonomic, and immune responses to stress. The wide influence of the CRH system on physiologic processes in both brain and periphery implicates the respective peptides in the pathophysiology of numerous disorders characterized by dysregulated stress responses. CRH peptides and their receptors are being explored as therapeutic targets for intervention in stress-related disorders. Selective antagonists have been used experimentally to elucidate the role of CRH-related peptides in disease processes, such as anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, addictive disorders, inflammatory disorders, acute and chronic neurodegeneration and preterm labor. The development of effective antagonists with no significant side effects remains a challenge. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - This article reviews the comprehensive data on the safety and tolerability from over 6,300 patients who have taken artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem®) as part of Novartis-sponsored or independently-sponsored clinical trials. The majority of the reported adverse events seen in these studies are mild or moderate in severity and tend to affect the gastrointestinal or nervous systems. These adverse events, which are common in both adults and children, are also typical of symptoms of malaria or concomitant infections present in these patients. The wealth of safety data on artemether/lumefantrine has not identified any neurological, cardiac or haematological safety concerns. In addition, repeated administration is not associated with an increased risk of adverse drug reactions including neurological adverse events. This finding is especially relevant for children from regions with high malaria transmission rates who often receive many courses of anti-malarial medications during their lifetime. Data are also available to show that there were no clinically relevant differences in pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to artemether/lumefantrine compared with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine during pregnancy. The six-dose regimen of artemether/lumefantrine is therefore well tolerated in a wide range of patient populations. In addition, post-marketing experience, based on the delivery of 250 million treatments as of July 2009, has not identified any new safety concerns for artemether/lumefantrine apart from hypersensitivity and allergies, known class effects of artemisinin derivatives. © 2009 Falade and Manyando.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the factors associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) from birth to age 2 years, whether recent advice has been followed, whether any new risk factors have emerged, and the specific circumstances in which SIDS occurs while cosleeping (infant sharing the same bed or sofa with an adult or child). Design: Four year population based case-control study. Parents were interviewed shortly after the death or after the reference sleep (within 24 hours) of the two control groups. Setting: South west region of England (population 4.9 million, 184 800 births). Participants: 80 SIDS infants and two control groups weighted for age and time of reference sleep: 87 randomly selected controls and 82 controls at high risk of SIDS (young, socially deprived, multiparous mothers who smoked). Results: The median age at death (66 days) was more than three weeks less than in a study in the same region a decade earlier. Of the SIDS infants, 54% died while cosleeping compared with 20% among both control groups. Much of this excess may be explained by a significant multivariable interaction between cosleeping and recent parental use of alcohol or drugs (31% v 3% random controls) and the increased proportion of SIDS infants who had coslept on a sofa (17% v 1%). One fifth of SIDS infants used a pillow for the last sleep (21% v 3%) and one quarter were swaddled (24% v 6%). More mothers of SIDS infants than random control infants smoked during pregnancy (60% v 14%), whereas one quarter of the SIDS infants were preterm (26% v 5%) or were in fair or poor health for the last sleep (28% v 6%). All of these differences were significant in the multivariable analysis regardless of which control group was used for comparison. The significance of covering the infant's head, postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, dummy use, and sleeping in the side position has diminished although a significant proportion of SIDS infants were still found prone (29% v 10%). Conclusions: Many of the SIDS infants had coslept in a hazardous environment. The major influences on risk, regardless of markers for socioeconomic deprivation, are amenable to change and specific advice needs to be given, particularly on use of alcohol or drugs before cosleeping and cosleeping on a sofa.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the existing literature on the use of various classes of psychotropic medications during breastfeeding to provide information about infant exposure levels and reported adverse events in breastfed infants. METHODS: A bibliographic search in the Medline (1967 through July 2008), Embase (1975 through July 2008), and PsycINFO (1967 through July 2008) databases was conducted for studies on breastfeeding and psychotropic medications for a total of 96 drugs. References of retrieved articles, reference books, and dedicated Web sites were also checked. The manufacturers were contacted for drugs without published information. Original articles and review articles that provide pharmacokinetic data on drug excretion in breast milk and infant safety data were considered, to estimate the "compatibility level" of each drug with breastfeeding. RESULTS: A total of 183 original articles were eligible for analysis. Documentation was retrieved for 62 (65%) drugs. In all, 19 (31%) psychotropic drugs can be used during lactation according to an evidencebased approach. For 28 drugs, the available data do not permit an evaluation of the drug's safety profile during breastfeeding and, for an additional 15 drugs, the exposure dose or observed adverse effects make their use unsafe. CONCLUSIONS: Although most drugs are considered safe during breastfeeding, compatibility with breastfeeding has not been established for all psychotropic drugs. There is a need for additional research and accumulation of experience to guarantee a more rational use of psychotropic drugs during breastfeeding.

AB  - The goals of epilepsy therapy are to achieve seizure freedom while minimizing adverse effects of treatment. However, producing seizure-freedom is often overemphasized, at the expense of inducing adverse effects of treatment. All antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have the potential to cause dose-related, "neurotoxic" adverse effects (i.e., drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, blurry vision, and incoordination). Such adverse effects are common, especially when initiating AED therapy and with polytherapy. Dose-related adverse effects may be obviated in most patients by dose reduction of monotherapy, reduction or elimination of polytherapy, or substituting for a better tolerated AED. Additionally, all older and several newer AEDs have idiosyncratic adverse effects which usually require withdrawal in an affected patient, including serious rash (i.e., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hematologic dyscrasias, hepatotoxicity, teratogenesis in women of child bearing potential, bone density loss, neuropathy, and severe gingival hyperplasia. Unfortunately, occurrence of idiosyncratic AED adverse effects cannot be predicted or, in most cases, prevented in susceptible patients. This article reviews a practical approach for the definition and identification of adverse effects of epilepsy therapies, and reviews the literature demonstrating that adverse effects result in detrimental quality of life in epilepsy patients. Strategies for minimizing AED adverse effects by reduction or elimination of AED polytherapy, appropriately employing drugsparing therapies, and optimally administering AEDs are outlined, including tenets of AED selection, titration, therapeutic AED laboratory monitoring, and avoidance of chronic idiosyncratic adverse effects. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Many women report disturbed sleep during pregnancy, but its impact on clinical outcomes remains unknown. This study examined subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in relation to preterm birth. Methods: A convenience sample of 220 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during the second trimester. Women who had preterm and full-term births were compared on these measures. Results: The preterm birth rate of the sample was 14.6 %. Sleep latency, the period from lights out to sleep onset, was significantly longer in the preterm group, which also reported a tendency to use more sleep medications, but had lower PSQI daytime dysfunction scores. Perceived stress did not differentiate preterm and full-term groups. Conclusion: Disturbed sleep in pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth. Future studies should examine specific physiological factors that underlie this increased vulnerability.

AB  - Despite advances in epilepsy therapeutics, some physicians feel uncomfortable with newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) due to difficulty in promptly obtaining blood levels to guide medication adjustment, and even when levels for newer AEDs are obtained, many practitioners feel they are not very useful. Lacking confidence in AEDs whose levels that cannot readily or expeditiously be measured, many clinicians share uncertainty about proper use of the newer AEDs and monitoring AED administration. Similarly, some epilepsy patients inflate the importance of AED blood level monitoring, feeling that blood levels falling within traditionally therapeutic ranges are a fail-safe for seizure control, regardless of their compliance or personal behavior aggravating seizure burden, such as poor sleep or use of illicit substances. This review examines the elusive concept of therapeutic AED blood levels and potential uses and abuses of blood level monitoring, reinforcing appropriate uses for blood levels to ensure compliance and adjust for altered AED pharmacokinetics in the context of aging and disease states, pregnancy, or drug interactions. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Genes associated with lactation evolved more slowly than other genes in the mammalian genome. Higher conservation of milk and mammary genes suggest that species variation in milk composition is due in part to the environment and that we must look deeper into the genome for regulation of lactation. At the onset of lactation, metabolic changes are coordinated among multiple tissues through the endocrine system to accommodate the increased demand for nutrients and energy while allowing the animal to remain in homeostasis. This process is known as homeorhesis. Homeorhetic adaptation to lactation has been extensively described; however how these adaptations are orchestrated among multiple tissues remains elusive. To develop a clearer picture of how gene expression is coordinated across multiple tissues during the pregnancy to lactation transition, total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissues collected from rat dams (n = 5) on day 20 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation, and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two types of gene expression analysis were performed. Genes that were differentially expressed between days within a tissue were identified with linear regression, and univariate regression was used to identify genes commonly up-regulated and down-regulated across all tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis showed genes commonly up regulated among the three tissues enriched gene ontologies primary metabolic processes, macromolecular complex assembly and negative regulation of apoptosis ontologies. Genes enriched in transcription regulator activity showed the common up regulation of 2 core molecular clock genes, ARNTL and CLOCK. Commonly down regulated genes enriched Rhythmic process and included: NR1D1, DBP, BHLHB2, OPN4, and HTR7, which regulate intracellular circadian rhythms. Changes in mammary, liver and adipose transcriptomes at the onset of lactation illustrate the complexity of homeorhetic adaptations and suggest that these changes are coordinated through molecular clocks. © 2009 Casey et al.

AB  - This study focuses on the role of sex steroids on the libido, sexual life, emotional and physiological heart of men of all ages. Sex steroids play a significant role throughout a man's life, with a gradual decline in old age. The foetal testis secretes testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone at about nine weeks gestation. At puberty, testosterone increases dramatically in boys. Changes in weight and height of boys across this period are associated with increasing testosterone concentration and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Romantic thoughts, fantasy, and sexual pleasure-seeking behaviour in adolescents are associated with exposure to high androgens secretion. Thus, the libido and sexual life of a man is initiated and maintained by testosterone and SHBG. Lower testosterone levels are associated with erectile dysfunction among other risk factors: diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, psychological stress and obesity. Men with proven coronary atherosclerosis have lower levels of testosterone and SHBG, which have negative correlation with very low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, body mass index and body fat mass. These are some of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Thus, in men, endogenous sex steroids impart beneficial effects on the heart. How exactly endogenous sex steroids act on the heart is not clear. Further study is needed to understand the interaction between endogenous sex steroids, higher centers in the brain and the heart of a man. Copyright © 2009 Via Medica.

AB  - The efferent mechanisms mediating the well-known diurnal cardiovascular rhythms in the late-gestation fetus are only partially understood. In the present study, we evaluated the contribution of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems (SNS) to these rhythms. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at a mean (SE) of 122 (1) days gestation (term is 147 days) underwent either chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine the day after surgery (n = 8), vagotomy at surgery (n = 8), or were sham controls (n = 8). Fetal heart rate (HR), fetal HR variability (HRV), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), carotid blood flow (CaBF), electrocorticogram (ECoG) activity, and nuchal activity were measured continuously for 24 h. Changes between sleep states were determined in a 6-h interval. Control fetal sheep showed consistent diurnal rhythms in fetal HR, HRV, MAP, and CaBF, with maximal activity in the evening, but not in nuchal activity. Sympathectomy was associated with a significant reduction of both fetal HR and HRV, while vagotomy was associated with a fall in fetal HRV (P < 0.05) but no change in HR. Despite this, most animals in the two intervention groups still showed diurnal rhythms for fetal HR, HRV, MAP, and CaBF, although peak HR may have been delayed in the sympathectomy group (mean 02:22 vs. 23:54 h in controls, P = 0.06). There was no effect of either intervention on sleep state cycling, although state-related cardiovascular rhythms were significantly modulated. These data indicate that, neither the SNS nor vagal activity, in isolation at least, is essential for generating cardiovascular diurnal rhythms in the late-gestation fetus.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic stress, combined with positive energy balance, may be a contributor to the increased risk for obesity, especially upper body obesity, and other metabolic diseases. This association may be mediated by alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In this review, we summarize the major research that has been conducted on the role of the HPA axis in obesity and metabolic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Dysregulation in the HPA axis has been associated with upper body obesity, but data are inconsistent, possibly due to methodological differences across studies. In addition to systemic effects, changes in local cortisol metabolism in adipose tissue may also influence the risk for obesity. HPA axis dysregulation may be the causal link between conditions such as maternal malnutrition and sleep deprivation with metabolic disease. SUMMARY: The present review provides evidence for the relationship between chronic stress, alterations in HPA activity, and obesity. Understanding these associations and its interactions with other factors will be important in developing effective treatments for obesity and related metabolic diseases. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness are particularly frequent during pregnancy and are likely to be influenced by changes in reproductive hormones, morphological modifications and sometimes psychological aspects that accompany pregnancy. The frequency of these disturbances increases throughout the pregnancy while they disappear generally some weeks after the delivery. The restless legs syndrome and insomnia are the most frequent. The detection of a sleep apnea syndrome is of utmost importance because potentially source of foetomaternal complications. The management of the sleep disorders during pregnancy is specific and must be adapted to the pregnancy by avoiding if possible appeal to medications. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. There is a strong link between female sex hormones and sleep. This implies the existence of sex differences both in the structure of sleep as in the incidence of various sleep disorders. Aim. To review the changes in the pattern of sleep experienced by women along different stages of their life cycle (fertile period, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause and postmenopause), as well as the most frequent sleeping pathologies in which there exist more gender differences (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome and narcolepsy). Development. About normal sleeping has been reported a higher quality of it, in women compared with men (increased sleeping time, reduced sleep onset latency, and a greater efficiency of sleeping), but they frequently complain of sleep problems. Moreover, different stages in the life of women are associated with significant physiological and hormonal changes that favour the disruption of normal sleep pattern and by this way, possibly, increase risk to suffer sleep disorders. Conclusions. The reasons that underlie in gender differences in sleeping disorders are attributed to differences in normal sleep pattern, in the clinical manifestations and risk factors for sleep disorders, and in the results and optimal dose of treatments. © 2009, Revista de Neurología.

AB  - Objective: Factors associated with weight gain during pregnancy that may be linked to maternal overweight and obesity were examined. Methods: In this observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation. Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended by the Institute of Medicine). Results: Women gained 14.4 (±5.0) kg during pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight, judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR]=6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-19.32; OR=3.96, 95% CI: 1.55l, 10.15; and OR=3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36, respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for excessive weight gain (OR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93, respectively). Conclusions: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain. Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus on the identified factors. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Depression is a frequent pathology in women, particularly during pregnancy, a period of psychic vulnerability. Numerous studies have shown that this disorder can have major consequences for the mother but also for the child to be born. A study of sleep in these children with the observation from the age of two to 24 weeks shows the presence of an increase in the sleep latency and in the time awake during the night, and a reduction in the sleep duration. Meanwhile, it is well-known that maternal depression, and even more major depression during pregnancy, is a risk factor for depression in children and adolescents, classically associated with specific sleep alterations. Thus, the following question arises: are the sleep alterations a consequence of the mood disorder in the mother, or are they the classical parallel of the depressive state in the child or adolescent himself? From our recent results and the rare data in the literature, it seems that maternal depression is a risk factor, in the child, of sleep disorders that change with age. They consist essentially, for children in a reduction of paradoxical sleep, and for adolescents in a decrease of total sleep time and of sleep efficiency. Given the negative effects of depression on the mother as well as on the child, it seems of primary importance to treat this pathology during pregnancy, and to propose a treatment with minimal deleterious effects on the child to be born. In this respect, the exposure to SSRI during the third trimester of pregnancy is a matter of concern, even so more when considering the results of animal research. Indeed, neonatal SSRI exposure in rodents induces sleep and behavior disorders that persist throughout life. Thus, there is a need to explore further the long-term effects of in utero exposure to SSRI on the child, and notably on its life-long vulnerability to sleep and mood disorders. Finally, on the basis of experimental data, new treatments can be developed, that aim at protecting the baby from the negative effects of the SSRI, while preserving the therapeutic efficacy in the mother. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Sleep data were collected by maternal report in a prospective longitudinal follow up of cocaine-exposed and unexposed children. There were 139 participants: 23 with no prenatal drug exposure, 55 exposed to cocaine alone or in combination with other drugs, and 61 exposed to drugs other than cocaine. Characteristics differed between exposure groups including birth size, caretaker changes, maternal socioeconomic status, and postnatal drug use. Compared to those with no drug exposure, children with prenatal drug exposure other than cocaine experienced greater sleep problems (p = .026). Prenatal nicotine exposure was a unique predictor of sleep problems (p = .048). Early sleep problems predicted later sleep problems (all ps <.01). Together, these preliminary findings suggest possible neurotoxic sleep effects that persist over time. Larger studies, however, need to be conducted that better control for potential postnatal confounding factors. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - One hundred and fifty-nine women were measured for depressive and anxiety symptoms from late pregnancy through to 12 months postpartum. Partial correlations revealed stability of depressive and anxiety symptoms across time. Depressive symptoms did not predict anxiety at any time point. Anxiety predicted increases in depressive symptoms from late pregnancy to early postpartum, but not from early postpartum to mid postpartum. Anxiety predicted depressive symptoms from mid postpartum to late postpartum, however, not when social support in late pregnancy was controlled for. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Associations between stress hormones and preterm delivery have not been fully explored. In this study, pregnant women enrolled from 52 clinics in 5 Michigan communities (1998-2004) provided urine samples for 3 days (waking and bedtime) during midpregnancy. Urinary catecholamine levels (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) were measured in a subcohort (247 preterm and 760 term deliveries), and a 3-day median value was calculated. Polytomous logistic regression models assessed relations between catecholamine quartiles (of the median) and a 4-level outcome variable (i.e., term (referent) and 3 preterm delivery subtypes: spontaneous; premature rupture of membranes; and medically indicated). Final models incorporated other relevant covariates (e.g., creatinine, demographic, behavior). The risk of spontaneous preterm delivery was increased in the highest versus lowest quartile of norepinephrine and dopamine: norepinephrine, waking (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8, 7.9) and bedtime (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.9); dopamine, waking (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.1) and bedtime (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.6). Adjusted odds ratios were further strengthened after removing women whose placentas showed evidence of acute infection or vascular pathology. High catecholamine levels in maternal urine may be indicative of excess stressors and/or predisposition to elevated sympathetic activation that contributes to increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.

AB  - Aim. This paper is a report of a study conducted to evaluate a resource-enhancing family nursing intervention to identify and meet mothers', fathers' and children's psychosocial support needs. Background. Although a family's resources are a central concept in nursing science, descriptions of the content of the concept and ways to enhance families' resources are scant. Studies have usually identified the need for support by families with children from the perspective of one family member, most often the mother. Method. A total of 75 family members from 30 families with small children participated in the study in 2004-2005. The data were collected before and after intervention, using structured questionnaires called the Family Situation Barometer. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric Wilcoxon tests were used as statistical methods. Results. Participants' need for psychosocial support was reduced or alleviated during the family nursing intervention. The mental health of the mothers and fathers improved, as did their marital relationships and emotional lives. Furthermore, their social support networks increased and their employment situation improved. There were also positive changes in the mental health and sleep-related issues of the children. Conclusion. The resource-enhancing family nursing proved to be useful in improving the well-being and health of family members. The Family Situation Barometer proved to be a practical tool in the home context and can supplement the instruments developed earlier in family nursing science. Research into supporting interpersonal and family-systems nursing remains a future challenge. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Thiopental may be used for sedation before intubation in newborn infants. A boy, born at 33 weeks of gestation (gw); birth weight 2435 g, was prescribed thiopental 3 mg/kg before intubation. He developed temporary hypotension and oxygen desaturation, and remained unconscious for longer than expected with a suppressed electroencephalography for 48 h. Serum thiopental concentration was 82, 59, 42 and 32 μmol/L after 20 min and 6, 24 and 68 h respectively. Serum concentrations from five newborn infants at the same time points after intubation with the same thiopental dose were used as reference values, and indicated a 10-fold overdose in the index case. The cause of the overdose could not be identified. The infant recovered; cerebral magnetic resonance imaging at the age of 42 gw and psychomotor development at 2 years were normal. These results show that thiopental concentrations are variable in neonates and there is a high risk of dosage error as no specific paediatric formulation is available. Conclusion: Well-designed procedures and continuous education are required to prevent errors and adverse events during drug delivery to newborn infants. To develop a safe method of administration for thiopental, an extended pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in neonates is warranted. © 2009 Foundation Acta P?diatrica/Acta P?diatrica.

AB  - Background: Although children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) are at high risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), direct comparisons show distinct cognitive phenotypes in the 2 diagnoses. However, these groups have not been directly compared for social problems or social cognition, nor has social cognition been directly examined in FASDs. Objectives: To compare FASDs and ADHD groups on social cognition tasks and determine whether deficient social cognition and emotion processing predict behavioral problems and social skills. Methods: Studied were 33 children with FASDs, 30 with ADHD, and 34 normal controls (NC). All received tasks of social cognition and emotion processing. Parents and teachers rated children on measures of completed questionnaires assessing child's behavioral problems and social skills using the Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form, and Social Skills Rating Scale. Children received 3 subtests from the Saltzman-Benaiah and Lalonde (2007) Theory of Mind Task as a measure of social cognition and 4 subtests from the Minnesota Test of Affective Processing (Lai et al., 1991) to assess emotion processing. Results: Parents and teachers reported more behavior problems and poorer social skills in children in FASD and ADHD than NC groups. FASDs demonstrated significantly weaker social cognition and facial emotion processing ability than ADHD and NC groups. Regression analyses identified social cognition as a significant predictor of behavior problems and emotion processing as a significant predictor of social skills. Conclusions: Children with FASDs show a distinct behavioral profile from children with ADHD. Difficulties in social cognition and emotion processing in children with FASDs may contribute to their high incidence of social behavioral problems.

AB  - Several newer areas of hypertension research are presented in this supplement. First, the benefits of melatonin in the treatment of experimental hypertension including its cardioprotective effects are introduced. Second, the possible role of melatonin in the non-dipping blood pressure pattern is described. Third, two hypotheses discuss the potential reasons for the ineffectivness of antioxidants in hypertension treatment, and difficulties associated with interpretations of experimental findings in the model of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Finally, interactions of indapamide with the nitric oxide system in SHR, the protective effect of angiotensin Il type 1 receptor blockade against alterations in insulin-resistant rats, and the deleterious effect of a low protein diet on kidney maturation with the development of hypertension are presented. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The aim of this multicenter prospective cohort study was to develop and validate a prediction tool for moderate to severe delayed (days 2 to 5) nausea/vomiting (N&V) after chemotherapy. To develop the initial prediction tool, 200 patients from a single center were enrolled. Clinical, patient, and outcomes data associated with delayed N&V were collected. An additional 146 patients from three cancer centers were prospectively enrolled to externally validate the instrument. All patients received standard antiemetic prophylaxis that was consistent with the guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. A generalized estimating equations multivariate regression model was used to develop the initial model. Using backward elimination, we derived a risk-scoring algorithm (range 0-62) from the final reduced model. On multivariate analysis, eight predictive factors were identified and validated for delayed N&V: age, type of antiemetic used, prior N&V, a history of morning sickness during pregnancy, chemotherapy cycle, acute N&V, hours of sleep the night before chemotherapy, and use of nonprescription antiemetics. Risk scores of 16-20 were identified as the cutoff scores to maximize the sensitivity (72.0%) and specificity (64.4%) of the prediction tool. The instrument had good predictive accuracy when applied to the validation sample. To our knowledge, this is the first such tool to be developed and validated for the prediction of delayed chemotherapy-induced N&V in patients with different types of solid tumors. This tool may be used to identify a priori patients at high risk for chemotherapy-induced N&V and allow optimization of their antiemetic therapy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease is associated with maternal and neonatal complications. In order to reduce risks for unfavorable outcomes, pregnant women need to adopt specific health behaviors. We investigated the pregnancy-related health behavior of women with congenital heart disease during their pregnancy. Methods. As part of a large study on pregnancy in congenital heart disease in the Netherlands and Belgium, we designed a descriptive, retrospective study that included 137 women. Patients born between January 1, 1958 and December 31, 1983, who had been pregnant for at least 20 weeks, and who were in active cardiac follow-up were eligible for inclusion. Patients with isolated patent foramen ovale, rheumatic heart disease, and mental retardation were excluded. Participants were interviewed by telephone using a questionnaire to retrospectively assess their health behavior during pregnancy. Results. Most of our participants did not drink alcohol (91.1-95.6%) and did not smoke (91.2-93.8%) during their pregnancy. Forty to fifty percent adopted physical restrictions. All were followed by an obstetrician, but only 38.2-56.9% regularly visited a cardiologist during pregnancy. Conclusions. Health behavior in pregnant women with congenital heart disease is generally good. However, it was worrisome that only a relatively few patients received follow-up from a cardiologist. © 2009 Copyright the Author Journal compilation © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion available, and they are effective for treating all acid-related disorders. Esomeprazole is one of several most recent PPIs that became available to the market in 2001. Esomeprazole is indicated for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults and children, risk reduction of NSAIDs-associated gastric ulcer, Helicobacter pylori eradication and control of pathological hypersecretory conditions associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Esomeprazole is available in both oral and intravenous formulations. A number of studies have compared esomeprazole with other PPIs. While differences supporting esomeprazole have been reported, the magnitude of differences has been variable and of uncertain clinical importance. Cost plays a major role in prescribing patterns of PPIs. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine neonatal symptoms previously reported to be associated with exposure to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy in a group of infants exposed to antidepressants, using a prospective and controlled design. Method: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. Results: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for >3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. Conclusions: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome.

AB  - Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease resulting blindness due to optic nerve atrophy if not treated properly. Large clinical trials have identified intraocular pressure as the main risk factor for disease progression. Intraocular pressure is also the only risk factor that can be treated by application of local therapy. The aim of modern medical glaucoma therapy is to reach reliably the patient's individual target pressure, furthermore to avoid significant diurnal fluctuations. Current medications from betablockers, prostaglandin-analogues, alpha-agonists, parasympathomimetics (miotics), carboanhydrase-inhibitors, hyperosmotics, as well as medications improving ocular blood flow, are listed and discussed.

In the nocturnal phase, the intensity of contraction and risk of hemorrhage, allergy, and asthma are greater. On the other hand, HTN in eclampsia does not show circadian variation; VIII) Obstetric chronopharmacology: local anesthetics, analgesics, hypnotics, general anesthetics, and neuromuscular blockers. Chronoenergy explains the matinal peak of opioid analgesia, vespertine of local anesthetic, and nocturnal of inhalational anesthetics.
CONCLUSIONS: The chronobiological approach of labor anesthesia emphasizes the obstetric importance of circadian rhythmicity in labor humanization and safety.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Temporal cycles (dark/light; birth/death; etc.), along with environmental conditions (synchronizers), influence labor physiology because of the presence of endogenous clocks (oscillators) that interact with social diuturnal clues. In this review, the most important cyclic anesthetic-obstetric parameters in parturient care are listed.

AB  - To examine whether HPA-axis activity mediates the relationship between obstetric complications (OCs) and externalizing behavior problems, and to investigate whether this model is different for boys and girls. In a population-based cohort of 1,768 10- to 12-year-old early adolescents, we assessed the cortisol awakening response and evening cortisol levels. Externalizing behavior problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report. OCs were retrospectively assessed in a parent interview. OCs significantly predicted externalizing behavior problems, but OCs did not predict HPA-axis activity. Thus, the mediation model was not supported. In addition to the relationship between HPA-axis activity and externalizing behavior problems, which is specific for girls, there is also a relationship between OCs and externalizing behavior problems. However, these two mechanisms are not related to each other indicating that HPA-axis activity is not a mediator in the relationship between OCs and externalizing behavior problems. Future research should focus on understanding the mechanism through which OCs cause externalizing behavior problems. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Epidemiological studies demonstrated a relationship between low birth weight mainly caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and adult metabolic disorders. The concept of metabolic programming centers on the idea that nutritional and hormonal status during the key period of development determines the long-term control of energy balance by programming future feeding behavior and energy expenditure. The present study examined the consequence of early or late "catch-up growth" after IUGR on feeding behavior and metabolic cues of male offspring of rat dams exposed to protein restriction during gestation and/or lactation. Our results suggest that early catch-up growth may be favorable for fasting metabolic parameters at weaning, as no differences were observed on plasma leptin, triglyceride, glucose, and insulin levels compared with controls. In contrast, if pups remained malnourished until weaning, low insulin concentration was detected and was accompanied by hyperphagia associated with a large increase in hypothalamic NPY and AgRP mRNA expression. At adult age, on a regular chow diet, only the meal structure was modified by fetal programming. The two IUGR groups demonstrated a reduced meal duration that enhanced the speed of food ingestion and consequently increased the rest period associated to the satiety state without changes in the hypothalamic expression of appetite neuropeptides. Our findings demonstrate that in IUGR, regardless of postnatal growth magnitude, metabolic programming occurred in utero and was responsible for both feeding behavior alteration and postprandial higher insulin level in adults. Additionally, catch-up growth immediately after early malnutrition could be a key point for the programming of postprandial hyperleptinemia. Copyright © 2009 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to evaluate pictures in magazines widely read by women of childbearing age, for adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for safe infant sleep practices. METHODS: Magazines were included in this study if they had an average female readership of >5 million, circulation of >900 000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines. Pictures of infant sleep environments and sleeping infants in articles and advertisements in issues of these 28 magazines were analyzed for adherence to AAP guidelines for decreasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 391 unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57 pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP. CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.

AB  - Snoring and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) are two disorders of considerable relevance due to their high prevalence in the general population and their notable morbidity and mortality, particularly in association with their harmful effects on the cardiovascular system. As well as sex, age, weight, craniofacial malformations, alcohol consumption, and use of hypnotic drugs, it has been suggested that smoking may be a risk factor for developing sleep-disordered breathing. While there is solid evidence for the independent association between snoring and smoking in both children and adults, it is still unclear whether smoking constitutes an independent risk factor for developing SAHS, despite the many studies carried out to assess this link. This is probably because the association, if it exists, is very weak. © 2009 SEPAR.

AB  - Tecommendations for reconvalescence and restriction of physical activity after elective caesarean section are not consistent and there is a lack of evidence on the subject. Although physiological changes are rapidly normalized after the operation, the women experience an extended period characterized by fatigue caused by lack of sleep due to nursing and breastfeeding of the baby. This paper accounts for the effects of post-operative pain, breastfeeding, fatigue, sexuality and physical recovery in the period of reconvalecence following elective caesarean section.7.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Rett Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder in females is thought to be relatively common from worldwide studies. There are few or probably no reports from the West African sub region. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Rett Syndrome in a Ghanaian. METHODS: Using International Diagnostic criteria for Rett syndrome, a 21-month old female presenting with mental retardation and autistic features was followed up for nearly two years and all clinical features and relevant investigations recorded. RESULTS: Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful, child developed normally till age 12 years when her development began to decline. She exhibited handwriting and bruxism was underweight with microcephaly investigations were normal except for epileptform discharges on EEG and prolonged QT interval on ECG. She was treated with melatonin and dompor for her sleep and reflect problems respectively. The patient met the criteria for a diagnosis of classical Rett Syndrome. CONCLUSION: This report shows that Rett syndrome does exist in the West African sub-region. It is possible to identify the condition in girls presenting with mental retardation or autistic features if they are appropriately followed up.

AB  - Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease resulting blindness due to optic nerve atrophy if not treated properly. Large clinical trials have identified intraocular pressure as the main risk factor for disease progression. Intraocular pressure is also the only risk factor that can be treated by application of local therapy. The aim of modern medical glaucoma therapy is to reach reliably the patient's individual target pressure, furthermore to avoid significant diurnal fluctuations. Current medications from betablockers, prostaglandin-analogues, alpha-agonists, parasympathomimetics (miotics), carboanhydrase-inhibitors, hyperosmotics, as well as medications improving ocular blood flow, are listed and discussed.

AB  - Background: We previously reported that a number of factors related to maternal lifestyle during early pregnancy, including smoking, are associated with childhood obesity at 5 years of age. In the present study, we investigated whether the association with maternal smoking persisted to the age of 9-10 years. Methods: The study population comprised children born between April 1, 1991 and March 31, 1999, and their mothers. The dependent variables-childhood overweight and obesity at 5 and 9-10 years of age-were defined according to internationally acknowledged cut-off values. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy was used as the independent variable. Results: Mothers who completed a specifically designed questionnaire gave birth to a total of 1644 infants during the study period. Anthropometric data were collected from 1302 of these children during medical checkups at 9-10 years of age (follow-up rate: 79.2%). Maternal smoking during early pregnancy was associated with obesity in 9- to 10-year-old children (adjusted odds ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.53). However, the point estimates at the age of 9-10 years were considerably lower than those at the age of 5 years. Conclusions: Our results suggest that fetal environment, including exposure to maternal smoking, continues to be associated with childhood obesity at the age of 9-10 years. © 2009 by the Japan Epidemiological Association.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexpected death of an infant less than 12 months of age that occurs during sleep and remains unexplained after a complete autopsy, death scene investigation, and review of the clinical history. It is the leading cause of postneonatal mortality in the developed world. The cause of SIDS is unknown, but is postulated to involve impairment of brainstem-mediated homeostatic control. Extensive evidence from animal studies indicates that serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the medulla oblongata play a role in the regulation of multiple aspects of respiratory and autonomic function. A subset of SIDS infants have several abnormalities in medullary markers of 5-HT function and genetic polymorphisms impacting the 5-HT system, informing the hypothesis that SIDS results from a defect in 5-HT brainstem-mediated control of respiratory (and autonomic) regulation. Here we review the evidence from postmortem human studies and animal studies to support this hypothesis and discuss how the pathogenesis of SIDS is likely to originate in utero during fetal development. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Significance: Given the substantial health risks of smoking during pregnancy, and the potential of pharmacotherapy to enhance quit rates, a need exists to examine the utility of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Literature Review: We briefly review the first-line medications that are recommended for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. Additionally, we review the toxicity of tobacco smoke and the potential risks of pharmacotherapy as evidenced by animal studies. We review in more detail studies conducted in pregnant women, including (a) observational studies, (b) short-term safety and longer term uncontrolled studies, and (c) randomized controlled clinical trials (both effectiveness and efficacy studies). Discussion: Because the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation during pregnancy have not been established, no definitive recommendations can be made on the topic. Effectiveness trials have shown that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) enhances smoking cessation during pregnancy, but efficacy trials have not shown an advantage for NRT compared with placebo treatment. Small sample size or poor medication compliance (with either the dose or the duration of treatment) may contribute to lack of efficacy in placebo-controlled NRT trials. However, these trials showed that NRT did not adversely affect birth outcomes and increased birth weight. Based on these findings and the fact that all medications have some risk, psychosocial interventions should be the first treatment option for pregnant smokers. Additional research is needed to determine fully the risks and benefits of the various pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation during pregnancy. © The Author 2009.

AB  - Postpartum depression occurs in at least one in seven new mothers, usually within the first 6 months after delivery. By the time of onset of postpartum depression, the mother has usually long since been discharged from the maternity hospital. Early identification and treatment of these mothers reduces both maternal and infant suffering. Careful risk-benefit decision-making regarding various treatment options in the postpartum should be discussed with the mother. Risks of untreated depression include poor bonding with the infant, lack of self care, infant neglect and infanticide. © 2009 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, sleep apnea syndrome and obesity hypoventilation syndrome are all defined as sleep-disordered breathing. Many changes occur in the respiratory system and sleep physiology during pregnancy due to physical and hormonal causes. Functional residual capacity, total sleep time, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and stage 3-4 non-REM sleep are reduced during the third trimester of pregnancy. Snoring is more prevalent in pregnant women than nonpregnant women. Snoring during pregnancy may be associated with pregnancy induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation and low APGAR scores in infant. The prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome during pregnancy is unknown. All pregnant women, especially obese and preeclamptic were asked to possibility of sleep disordered breathing. In this review we summarized, first normal physiological changes of respiratory system and sleep during pregnancy, second maternal and fetal outcome of sleep disordered breathing and finally treatment of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy.

AB  - Efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has been an important component of the treatment of HIV infection for 10 years and has contributed significantly to the evolution of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The efficacy of efavirenz has been established in numerous randomized trials and observational studies in HAART-naive patients, including those with advanced infection. In the ACTG A5142 study, efavirenz showed greater virological efficacy than the boosted protease inhibitor (PI), lopinavir. Efavirenz is more effective as a third agent than unboosted PIs or the nucleoside analogue abacavir. Some, but not all, studies have suggested that efavirenz (added to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) is more effective than nevirapine. Virological and immunological responses achieved with efavirenz-based HAART have been maintained for 7 years. Dosing convenience predicts adherence, and studies have demonstrated that patients can be switched from PI-based therapy to simplified, once-daily efavirenz-based regimens without losing virological control. The one-pill, once-daily formulation of efavirenz plus tenofovir and emtricitabine offers a particular advantage in this regard. Efavirenz also retains a role after failure of a first PI-based regimen. Efavirenz is generally well tolerated: rash and neuropsychiatric disturbances are the most notable adverse events. Neuropsychiatric disturbances generally develop early in treatment and they tend to resolve with continued administration, but they are persistent and troubling in a minority of patients. Efavirenz has less effect on plasma lipid profiles than some boosted PIs. Lipodystrophy can occur under treatment with efavirenz but it may be reduced if the concurrent use of thymidine analogues is avoided. Efavirenz resistance mutations (especially K103N) can be selected during long-term treatment, underscoring the importance of good adherence. Recent data have confirmed that efavirenz is a cost-effective option for first-line HAART. In light of these features, efavirenz retains a key role in HIV treatment strategies and is the first-line agent recommended in some guidelines. © The Author 2009.

AB  - Background: Ilio-caval stenting now represents the first line treatment for disabling obstructive ilio-caval lesions. Most patients are young women of child-bearing age. We herein report our experience of pregnancy in women who have a history of ilio-caval stenting. Materials and Methods: From November 1995 to April 2008, 119 patients had ilio-caval stenting for obstructive venous disease in our department. Of these, 62 women were able to become pregnant. When pregnancy occurred, they received preventive treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) from the 3rd month of pregnancy to 1 month after delivery and had to wear elastic stockings. Patients also had to sleep on their right side if possible. They were followed during the pregnancy by duplex scanning at 3, 6, and 8 months, and then 1 month after delivery. Results: Eight pregnancies occurred in 6 patients (mean age 26.5 years) who had a patent self-expanding stent (1 patient had 3 pregnancies). They had stenting for May-Thurner disease in 3 patients, for post-deep venous thrombosis (DVT) left common iliac vein occlusion in 1 patient, and during venous thrombectomy in 2 patients. All stents were self-expanding metallic stents located on the left common iliac vein. One patient had unrelated spontaneous abortion after 2 months of pregnancy. No DVT or symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred during pregnancy, delivery, or during the postpartum period. Four patients needed cesarean delivery and none had hemorrhagic complications. None of the patients had adverse effects from the treatment. Duplex scan showed compression of the stent(s) at 8 months in 4 patients with inflow obstruction in 3 patients. Postpartum duplex-scan showed no remaining stenosis in all patients. No stents had structural damage. Conclusion: Ilio-caval stent compression can occur during pregnancy but does not lead to structural damage to the self-expanding stents. Despite this, no cases of DVT occurred with preventive LMWH treatment. © 2009 Society for Vascular Surgery.

AB  - Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease resulting blindness due to optic nerve atrophy if not treated properly. Large clinical trials have identified intraocular pressure as the main risk factor for disease progression. Intraocular pressure is also the only risk factor that can be treated by application of local therapy. The aim of modern medical glaucoma therapy is to reach reliably the patient's individual target pressure, furthermore to avoid significant diurnal fluctuations. Current medications from betablockers, prostaglandin-analogues, alpha-agonists, parasympathomimetics (miotics), carboanhydrase-inhibitors, hyperosmotics, as well as medications improving ocular blood flow, are listed and discussed.

AB  - BackgroundAspirin has been found to prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension and to induce nitric oxide (NO) release from vascular endothelium. Low-dose aspirin has also been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) when administered at bedtime, as opposed to upon awakening, in untreated hypertensive patients and high-risk pregnant women. Accordingly, we investigated the effects on ambulatory BP of aspirin administered at different times of the day in prehypertension.MethodsWe studied 244 subjects with prehypertension, 43.0 13.0 years of age, randomly divided in three groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary recommendations; the same recommendations and aspirin (100 mg/day) on awakening; or the same recommendations and aspirin at bedtime. BP was measured for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention.ResultsAmbulatory BP was unchanged in subjects randomized to either nonpharmacological intervention or aspirin on awakening. A significant ambulatory BP reduction was, however, observed in the subjects who received aspirin at bedtime (decrease of 6/3 mm Hg in the 24-h mean of systolic (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP), respectively; P<0.001), without changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline. BP was homogenously controlled along the 24 h after bedtime aspirin administration (6/4 mm Hg reduction in activity mean of SBP/DBP; 6/3 mm Hg reduction in sleep-time mean, respectively).ConclusionsThis prospective trial documents a significant effect on BP of low dose aspirin only when ingested at bedtime by prehypertensive subjects. The timed administration of low-dose aspirin could thus provide a valuable and cost-effective approach for BP control in subjects at elevated risk of developing hypertension. © 2009 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

AB  - Neonatal alcohol exposure produces long-term changes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that are presumably responsible for disturbances in the light-dark regulation of circadian behavior in adult rats, including the pattern of photoentrainment, rate of re-entrainment to shifted light-dark cycles, and phase-shifting responses to light. Because SCN neurons containing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) receive direct photic input via the retinohypothalamic tract and thus play an important role in the circadian regulation of the SCN clock mechanism by light, the present study examined the long-term effects of neonatal alcohol exposure on VIP neuronal populations within the SCN of adult rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to alcohol (EtOH; 3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 g/kg/day) or isocaloric milk formula (gastrostomy control; GC) on postnatal days 4-9 using artificial-rearing methods. At 2-3 months of age, animals from the suckle control (SC), GC, and EtOH groups were exposed to constant darkness (DD) and SCN tissue was harvested for subsequent analysis of either VIP mRNA expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization or of VIP-immunoreactive (ir) neurons using stereological methods. Neonatal alcohol exposure had no impact on VIP mRNA expression but dramatically altered immunostaining of neurons containing this peptide within the SCN of adult rats. The relative abundance of VIP mRNA and anatomical distribution of neurons expressing this transcript were similar among all control- and EtOH-treated groups. However, the total number and density of VIP-ir neurons within the SCN were significantly decreased by about 35% in rats exposed to alcohol at a dose of 6.0 g/kg/day relative to that observed in both control groups. These results demonstrate that VIP neuronal populations in the SCN are vulnerable to EtOH-induced insult during brain development. The observed alterations in SCN neurons containing VIP may have an impact upon clock responses to light input and thus contribute to the long-term effects of neonatal alcohol exposure on the photic regulation of circadian behavior. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To determine the contribution of infant temperament to the relationship between maternal sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms. Utilizing a repeated measures design, 112 couples recruited from childbirth education classes were assessed in third trimester and postpartum. Instruments included Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, General Sleep Disturbance Scale, wrist actigraphy, and an investigator-developed tool to assess infant temperament completed by mothers and fathers. Regardless of infant temperament, mothers who slept < 4 h between midnight and 6 am and mothers who napped < 60 min during the day were at increased risk for depression at three months postpartum. Infant temperament was associated with maternal sleep but was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms after controlling for other contextual factors. Postpartum clinical visits should include questions about maternal sleep so interventions can be directed toward sufficient sleep to minimize risk of postpartum depression. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is classified in five stages according to Quintero staging. However, the efficacy of such staging was recently debated. We reviewed the efficacy of Quintero staging to predict survival rate in TTTS treated with laser therapy. Articles reporting survival rate for each stage in TTTS treated with laser therapy were reviewed. Number of twins alive per pregnancy (NAP) was compared between early (I + II) and advanced (III + IV) stages and within stages. Meta-analysis was performed according to Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Heterogeneity was tested with chi-square for heterogeneity at a significance level of p < 0.10, and random or fixed models were generated as appropriate. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NAP was similar between early (zero survivors: 34/228, 15%; one survivor: 49/228, 21%; two survivors: 145/228, 63%) and advanced stages (zero survivors: 38/214, 18%; one survivor: 64/214, 30%; two survivors: 112/214, 52%; p > 0.05) except for one survivor (p < 0.05). A trend for increased NAP was observed in all stages. Because clinically relevant differences were not observed, laser therapy is the optimal treatment for all stages. As Quintero staging does not provide information about prognosis, a new staging system is proposed. Copyright © 2009 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Aims: To determine trimester-specific risk factors for small-for- gestational-age (SGA) infants. Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in Sri Lanka from May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or before 16 weeks of gestation and followed up until delivery. The sample size was 690. Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were gathered on average at 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. SGA was assessed using customised birth centile charts. Multiple logistic regression was applied, and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: The risk factors for SGA less than 5th centile were shift work and exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters (OR 4.20, 95%CI 1.10-16.0), sleeping for less than or equal to 8 h during 2nd or 3rd or both trimesters (OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.08-4.59), walking for less than or equal to 2.5 h per day (OR 2.66, 95%CI 1.12-6.31) and alcohol consumption during the 3rd trimester (OR 14.5, 95%CI 2.23-94.7). Poor weekly gestational weight gain was significantly associated with both SGA < 10th and < 5th centiles. None of the other factors became significant for SGA < 10th centile. Conclusions: Risk factors for SGA less than 5th centile were sleep deprivation and shift work and exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters, less walking hours and alcohol consumption during 3rd trimester. Poor weekly gestational weight gain may be considered as a predictor of delivering an SGA infant. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder that remains underdiagnosed in adult females. The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying people at risk for OSAS. The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAS in women and to estimate the risk for OSAS among females in the United States. Methods: This is an analysis of data from the 2007 Sleep in America Poll of the National Sleep Foundation. The NSF Poll is an annual telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. adults. The 2007 NSF Poll included 1254 women in the United States, with an oversample of pregnant and postpartum women. We used the Berlin Questionnaire to estimate the risk for OSAS among the U.S. female population. This instrument includes questions about self-reported snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and obesity. Also included were questions about sleep habits, sleep problems, menstrual cycle status, and other medical disorders. Results: Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for OSAS. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of OSAS as habitual snoring (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently reported. The risk increased with age (p<0.05), obesity (p<0.001), and menopause (p<0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more frequently reported among women at high risk. Conclusions: One in four women in America is at high risk of having OSAS. Awareness by the primary care medical community of this disorder in females should thus be increased. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - High blood pressure is an important component of pre-eclampsia. The underlying mechanism of development of hypertension in pre-eclampsia is complicated and still remains obscure. Several theories have been advanced including endothelial dysfunction, uteroplacental insufficiency leading to generalized vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output, and sympathetic hyperactivity. Increased blood flow and pressure are thought to lead to capillary dilatation, which damages end-organ sites, leading to hypertension, proteinuria and edema. Additional theories have been put forward based on epidemiological research, implicating immunological and genetic factors. None of these theories have been substantiated. Based on a review of literature this paper postulates that the initiating event for the development of pre-eclampsia is intermittent hypoxia associated with irregular breathing during sleep, hypoapnea, apnea, inadequate respiratory excursions during the waking hours and inadequate cardiopulmonary synchronization (abnormal sympatho-vagal balance). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Most antidepressant medications in current use have several disadvantages: a delayed therapeutic effect, side effects, stigmatization and concerns about safety for the developing fetus during pregnancy. Several chronobiologic techniques which are free of these disadvantages were proposed as an alternative. The current article reports the design and the initial outcome results of a new chronobiologic multistage intervention (CMI) that is comprised of the following techniques: (i) partial sleep deprivation during the second half of the night (wake therapy - WT), (ii) medium (green) wavelength light in combination with dawn simulation (DS), (iii) bright light therapy (BLT), and (iv) sleep phase advance (SPA). Methods: The study was conducted as a set of 12 single-case designs with moderate-to-severe depressive volunteering patients. Depression, anxiety and tension measurements were taken on a daily basis beginning with a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a set of four consecutive morning measurements during the therapeutic intervention (T1-T4),and with a final measurement carried out at the end of 4 weeks of follow-up (T5). Results: A clinically significant rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms was demonstrated and maintained for at least 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. No dropouts or compliance difficulties were observed. Patient satisfaction was high, and other than having to sleep for four nights at the Research and Development Unit, participants were not inconvenienced by the nature of the therapeutic design. Sleepiness in the late afternoon hours was reported by several of the participants, but did not reach a level that interfered with their ability to function. Levels of tension did not show a consistent improvement along the intervention procedure and were not maintained in follow-up. There was some unexpected improvement in the level of anxiety that persisted at follow-up. This latter finding requires further validation by additional studies. Conclusions: These initial findings showed the procedure to be effective and well tolerated. It affords many advantages, such as the achievement of a rapid response, no extinction of the therapeutic effect after 4 weeks of follow-up, safety, high patient compliance and cost effectiveness. These encouraging results warrant validation in further randomized controlled clinical trials. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sensorimotor disorder where patients complain of an almost irresistible urge to move their legs. This urge can often be accompanied by pain or other unpleasant sensations, it either occurs or worsens with rest particularly at night, and improves with activity. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group has established four essential criteria for clinical diagnosis of RLS. State of art: Affecting an estimated 7.2 to 11.5% of the adult population, the symptoms of RLS may be associated with significant sleep disturbance and may have a negative impact on quality of life. The prevalence of RLS increases with age, and women are more frequently affected than men. In France, the estimated prevalence is 8.5%. Among sufferers, 4.4% complain of very severe symptoms. Although RLS is mainly idiopathic, several clinical conditions have been associated with it, especially iron deficiency with or without anemia, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. These conditions may share a common pathophysiological mechanism involving a disorder of iron metabolism. By contrast, controversy persists as to whether polyneuropathy, particularly when associated with diabetes, is to be considered as an important cause of secondary RLS. This association is difficult to demonstrate as conventional electromyography is not adequate to detect small fiber neuropathy often associated with diabetes. Conclusion and perspectives: RLS is often underdiagnosed and few subjects receive recommended RLS drug treatment. There is a clear need for complementary education to improve the accurate diagnosis of RLS. Indeed, better knowledge of this syndrome is a prerequisite to prompt an appropriate therapeutic management. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Duetting is defined as an interactively organized pair display in which one pair partner coordinates its vocalizations in time with those of the other. It is widespread among tropical birds and cohesive pair-living primates, in which it is suggested to strengthen pair bonds. We know very little about the presence and function of duetting in dispersed pair-living mammals. We studied duetting behavior in a solitary foraging, but pair-sleeping, primate, the Milne Edwards' sportive lemur, in a dry deciduous forest of north-western Madagascar. We radio-tracked six pairs throughout 1 year and recorded their sleeping sites and associations, homerange use, and vocal and behavioral interactions. Three different periods were covered (mating, pregnancy, and offspring care). Sleeping partners form long-term pair bonds, indicated by an almost exclusive pair-specific usage of sleeping sites and home-ranges across periods. We explored three functional hypothesis of duetting: mate reunion, pair reunion, and joint-territorial defense. Pairs regularly engaged in duet calling. Duetting increased significantly during the offspring care period. Duetting occurred significantly more often at feeding sites than at sleeping sites. Pair partners synchronized behavioral activities after duetting. The activity most often synchronized was locomotion. Pair partners played an equal role in duetting with no difference between sexes in starting or terminating duetting. Altogether, our results provide support for the hypothesis that in dispersed pair-living primates, duetting evolved as a mechanism to coordinate activities between pair partners dispersed in space, to strengthen pair bonds, and, perhaps, to limit infanticide and nutritional stress in lactating females. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: to investigate long-term outcomes of mothers who have or have not held their stillborn baby, and predictors of having held the baby. Design: postal questionnaires. Setting: a nation-wide cohort study of mothers who gave birth to a singleton stillborn baby in Sweden in 1991. Participants: 314 out of 380 women answered the questionnaire and 309 reported whether or not they had held their baby. Measurements: scales measuring anxiety, depression and well-being. Findings: 126 (68%) mothers of 185 babies stillborn after 37 gestational weeks had held their baby and 82 (68%) mothers of 120 babies stillborn at gestational weeks 28-37 had also done so. Compared with mothers who agreed completely with the statement that staff gave enough support to hold the baby, mothers who did not agree were less likely to have held their baby [relative risk (RR) 4.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-6.1], and mothers with a low level of education were less likely to have held their baby than mothers with a higher level of education (RR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-3.8). Mothers who had not held their babies born after 37 gestational weeks had an increased risk of headache (RR 4.3; 95% CI 1.1-16.5), and they were less satisfied with their sleep (RR 2.7; 95% CI 1.5-5.0). The increased risk of long-term outcomes associated with not holding, compared with holding, a stillborn baby were less pronounced for women who gave birth at gestational week 28-37 compared with women who gave birth after 37 gestational weeks. Key conclusions: in this cohort, we found an overall beneficial effect of having held a stillborn baby born after 37 gestational weeks, whereas findings for having held a stillborn baby born at gestational weeks 28-37 are uncertain. The attitude of staff influenced whether or not the mother held her stillborn baby. Implications for practice: if the mother is guided by staff in a sensitive way to hold her stillborn term baby, the experience will possibly be beneficial for her in the long term. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences on developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disordres (FASD). Among FASD, cases that exhibit all of three criterion; 1) central nervous system dysfunction, 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure during brain development on brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing 2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol consumption by these dams was 11.53 ± 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, ectopias on the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing system of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding of babies. Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

AB  - Gestational hypertension is a recognized risk factor for the development of complications during pregnancy. The present study retrospectively assessed the respective values of blood pressure components derived from conventional and 24-h recordings (ABPM) as predictors of premature delivery in women with gestational hypertension based on office readings from 26th week of gestation onwards. Blood pressures were measured conventionally and over 24 h. Standard medical and obstetric history, and standard laboratory work-up were taken into account. The mean (± standard deviation, SD) age of 123 women was 29 ± 6 years. Current pregnancy was, on average, the second. The conventional systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) blood pressure averaged 140 ± 19/ 92 ± 14 mmHg, and pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MBP) averaged 48 ± 10 and 108 ± 15 mmHg. The corresponding values derived from ABPM were 135 ± 16/90 ± 11, 47 ± 9 and 105 ± 12 mmHg. The 24-h blood pressures had better prognostic value than the conventional blood pressures. The 24-h SBP predicted risk of premature delivery and was inversely related to the duration of pregnancy and birth weight. After the exclusion of 41 women with white-coat hypertension, the highest predictive value was associated with PP. PP wider by 1SD was associated with 66% higher risk of premature delivery, and was associated with shortening of pregnancy by 2 weeks and 400 g lower birth weight, even after adjustment for SBP. In conclusion, ABPM is superior to conventional blood pressure measurements in predicting adverse outcome of pregnancy. Twenty-four-hour PP, of all classic indices, seems to be most closely related to increase of that risk.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. Study Design and Methods: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15- minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. Results: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r ≤ 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. Clinical Implications: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleepwake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

AB  - St. John's Wort is a herbal therapy, shown to be effective in treating mild to moderate depression; a disease common in women in their childbearing years. With a significant proportion of unplanned pregnancies, exposure to St. John's Wort into pregnancy is expected to occur. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to this agent in pregnancy is associated with major malformations. We prospectively collected and followed subjects taking St. John's Wort and compared them to a matched group of pregnant women taking other pharmacologic therapy for depression and a third group of healthy women, not exposed to any known teratogens. We obtained follow-up information on 54 St. John's Wort exposed pregnancies and 108 pregnancies in the two comparator groups. Our results indicated that the rates of major malformations were similar across the three groups, with 5%, 4% and 0% in the St. John's Wort, disease comparator, and health group, respectively (p = 0.26), This was not different that the 3-5% risk expected in the general population. The live birth and prematurity rates were also not different among the three groups. Though further large scale studies are still needed, this first study on the effects of St. John's Wort in human pregnancy does provide some evidence of fetal safety. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Study objectives: (1) To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for postpartum maternal sleep problems and depressive symptoms simultaneously, (2) identify factors independently associated with either condition, and (3) explore associations between specific postpartum sleep components and depression. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based. Participants: All women (n = 4191) who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September 2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was 68% (n = 2830). Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression, defined as EPDS ≥ 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly associated with depression. Conclusions: Poor sleep was associated with depression independently of other risk factors. Poor sleep may increase the risk of depression in some women, but as previously known risk factors were also associated, mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression are not merely reporting symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.

AB  - Objective: We sought to determine whether trimester of pregnancy influences the ability to diagnose major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Eight hundred thirty-eight subjects completed a Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) before 17 weeks of pregnancy, at 26-30 weeks of pregnancy and at 4-12 weeks postpartum. Subjects responded to a checklist of MDD symptoms regardless of stem question endorsement. We compared rates of symptom expression by response (Y/N) to stem questions, and trimester, using logit analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves determined optimal EPDS thresholds. Results: Most symptoms from the DSM-IV checklist were endorsed significantly more often in the first compared to later trimesters (odds ratios ranged from 1.39 to 14.16 for the first vs. later trimesters), independent of response to depression stem questions or medication treatment. Despite this, stem-positive and stem-negative groups differed significantly for 10 out of 13 symptoms (odds ratios, 2.29-6.89), independent of trimester. The EPDS had an optimal cutoff of 10 and showed acceptable predictive value. Conclusions: Pregnant women commonly experience somatic and other symptoms in this first trimester, but depressed women still differ from those who are not depressed. "Appetite increase," "oversleeping" and "increase in energy" (e.g., agitation) were uninformative with regard to an MDD diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

If left untreated, 30% of patients may develop tertiary syphilis, which can manifest as neurosyphilis. Case Report: The authors present a case of an acute psychosis during and after pregnancy in a 37-year-old woman, which was identified as a manifestation of neurosyphilis after admission to a psychiatric ward. The positive screening test for syphilis provided the first hint of syphilis and gave direction for further diagnosis and specific treatment. Subsequently, the patient was treated with psychotropic medication concurrent with an adequate antibiotic treatment for neurosyphilis and was simultaneously psychologically monitored. An improvement of psychotic symptoms during antibiotic therapy was observed. Conclusion: This case emphasises that neurosyphilis still has to be considered in the differential diagnosis within the context of psychiatric conditions and diseases. Owing to current epidemiological data and difficulties in diagnosing syphilis, routine screening tests in the psychiatric field are necessary. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated individual differences in susceptibility to the detrimental effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Many factors, including genetic differences, have been shown to play a role in susceptibility and resistance, but few studies have investigated the range of genetic variation in rodent models. Methods: We examined ethanol teratogenesis in 5 inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6J (B6), Inbred Short-Sleep, C3H/Ibg, A/Ibg, and 129S6/SvEvTac (129). Pregnant dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD) on day 9 of pregnancy. Dams were sacrificed on day 18 and fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for gross morphological malformations. Every other fetus within a litter was then either placed in Bouin's fixative for subsequent soft-tissue analyses or eviscerated and placed in ethanol for subsequent skeletal analyses. Results: B6 mice exposed to ethanol in utero had fetal weight deficits and digit, kidney, brain ventricle, and vertebral malformations. In contrast, 129 mice showed no teratogenesis. The remaining strains showed varying degrees of teratogenesis. Conclusions: Differences among inbred strains demonstrate genetic variation in the teratogenic effects of ethanol. Identifying susceptible and resistant strains allows future studies to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying prenatal alcohol phenotypes. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

AB  - On a routine prenatal ultrasound at 19 weeks gestation by the last menstrual period, a male fetus was noted to have large dysplastic kidneys. Subsequent ultrasounds at 23 and 25 weeks also identified oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth retardation. No other structural anomalies were noted. Maternal history was negative for hypertension, other illnesses, and exposures to teratogens. The couple is healthy and nonconsanguineous. The family history is negative for renal diseases, birth defects, and recurrent pregnancy loss. The baby was born at 38 5/7-week gestational age with a birth weight of 2179 g length of 43 cm, and a head circumference of 34.5 cm. He had a large anterior fontanel and dysmorphic features (Fig. 1a) in addition to a shawl scrotum (Fig. 1b). His conjugated bilirubin was high on day 1 of life. He was also noted to have a significant coarctation of the aorta that required urgent surgical correction. After surgery, the patient developed significant cholestasis and significant failure to thrive. At 7 weeks he had not regained birth weight. His condition improved. At 4-month follow-up his weight was 4100g, length was 50 cm, and the head circumference was 41.5 cm. His head control was not optimal. However, he smiled at 3 months, was able to put his thumbs into his mouth, and made a variety of sounds. The sleeping pattern was normal. No active issues with voiding and bowel movements were observed. The color of the urine and stool has been normal. The sclera was of normal color as well. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Deformational plagiocephaly, an abnormal asymmetric flattening of infants' heads, is diagnosed in approximately 10% of infants. The prevalence of plagiocephaly has increased dramatically since 1992 when it was first recommended that infants be placed to sleep in a non-prone position to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. The authors conducted a case-control study to evaluate associations between plagiocephaly and perinatal characteristics. The authors assessed whether risk factors for plagiocephaly have changed since 1992. Cases were born 1987-2002 in Washington State and diagnosed with plagiocephaly at the Craniofacial Center at Seattle Children's Hospital. Risk factor information was abstracted from birth certificate and hospital discharge data and unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Cases (n = 2764) were more likely than controls (n = 13 817) to have been injured at birth (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2, 1.7) or diagnosed with a congenital anomaly (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.8, 2.3). Cases were more likely to have been male, a twin, or small-for-gestational-age. This first large-scale, case-control study of risk factors for plagiocephaly in a U.S. population provides new evidence that birth injuries and congenital anomalies are associated with plagiocephaly risk. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Breast cancer is very common and seen in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Research into prevention, better screening, and more effective treatments is occurring continually, and changes are translated into clinical practice relatively quickly. It is important for women's health care providers to have an understanding of breast cancer treatments and the gynecologic side effects. For premenopausal women interested in fertility, options should be discussed prior to chemotherapy. Issues pertaining to pregnancy after breast cancer should be discussed in a multidisciplinary fashion, involving the obstetrician/gynecologist, breast surgeon, and oncologist. Ovarian suppression is often used as part of breast cancer treatment in premenopausal women with hormone positive disease, and menopausal symptoms may be severe. Hormonal therapies including tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors are used in the treatment of hormone positive breast cancers. Each of these drugs has a variety of gynecologic implications. Understanding the options for treatment for menopausal complaints in breast cancer patients is important for women's health providers. Although most breast cancers are sporadic, a small percentage will be due to mutations in the BRCA genes. It is imporatant for women's health providers to take an appropriate family history and refer to genetic counselors for possible testing when hereditary cancer is suspected. This review focuses on the various women's health issues pertaining to breast cancer and treatment. Copyright © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Pregnancy-related low back pain is a common problem during pregnancy. More than half of all pregnant women experience low back pain at some time during pregnancy. The pain can vary from a mild discomfort to being severe and disabling. In one-third of these women, pain is a severe problem compromising activities of daily living, work and sleep. The awareness of the possible impact of low back pain on the quality of life and the associated costs to society has increased medical attention over the last decade. Pain usually develops between the fifth and seventh month of pregnancy but may appear as early as the first trimester. Moreover, some women who experience back pain during pregnancy experience persistent back pain in the postpartum period or have an increased risk of back pain in subsequent pregnancies, and many women with chronic back pain link its onset to a pregnancy. Despite its high frequency, there are some ambiguities inherent in the terminology, diagnosis and classification. The etiology and pathogenesis are not yet dearly understood. The etiology of pain is probably related to a combination of mechanical, hormonal and vascular contributing factors. Low back pain in pregnancy is most commonly subdivided into lumbar pain and posterior pelvic pain. This subdivision is important in terms of both management and prognosis. Characteristic findings and treatment may differ between the two categories. Accurate assessment and effective treatment are important for managing the low back pain of pregnancy. The purpose of the present article was to provide a summary review of the performed studies on pregnancy-related low back pain.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most commonly used medications, with a prescription frequency of 2.3 in pregnant women. Although most babies born to women who take SSRIs during pregnancy are normal, there is accumulating evidence that maternal SSRI treatment during pregnancy may cause adverse reproductive outcomes. Maternal SSRI treatment during the first trimester has been implicated in increased risks of birth defects, specifically cardiac abnormalities, in the infant, whereas third-trimester treatment has been linked to various neonatal complications, including symptoms of neonatal withdrawal and toxicity, prematurity, low birth weight and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Although data on neurobehavioural and long-term cognitive problems among children of women who were treated with SSRIs during pregnancy remain limited, the possibility of such functional abnormalities is an additional concern.On the other hand, untreated maternal depression also carries serious risks for both the mother and the baby, and SSRIs are one of the best available treatments. Thus, pregnant women who require treatment for depression and their physicians often face a difficult choice regarding the use of SSRIs. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Women with twin pregnancy are at high risk for spontaneous preterm delivery. Progesterone seems to be effective in reducing preterm birth in selected high-risk singleton pregnancies, albeit with no significant reduction in perinatal mortality and little evidence of neonatal benefit. We investigated the use of progesterone for prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancy. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 500 women with twin pregnancy were recruited from nine UK National Health Service clinics specialising in the management of twin pregnancy. Women were randomised, by permuted blocks of randomly mixed sizes, either to daily vaginal progesterone gel 90 mg (n=250) or to placebo gel (n=250) for 10 weeks from 24 weeks' gestation. All study personnel and participants were masked to treatment assignment for the duration of the study. The primary outcome was delivery or intrauterine death before 34 weeks' gestation. Analysis was by intention to treat. Additionally we undertook a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data to establish the efficacy of progesterone in prevention of early (<34 weeks' gestation) preterm birth or intrauterine death in women with twin pregnancy. This study is registered, number ISRCTN35782581. Findings: Three participants in each group were lost to follow-up, leaving 247 analysed per group. The combined proportion of intrauterine death or delivery before 34 weeks of pregnancy was 24·7% (61/247) in the progesterone group and 19·4% (48/247) in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 1·36, 95% CI 0·89-2·09; p=0·16). The rate of adverse events did not differ between the two groups. The meta-analysis confirmed that progesterone does not prevent early preterm birth in women with twin pregnancy (pooled OR 1·16, 95% CI 0·89-1·51). Interpretation: Progesterone, administered vaginally, does not prevent preterm birth in women with twin pregnancy.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to smoking and alcohol increases the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Physiological changes associated with these exposures are not well studied. Full-term infants were tested within the first 3 days of life. We hypothesized that maternal alcohol consumption and/or smoking during pregnancy would alter autonomic nervous system function. Newborns whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had lower beat-to-beat heart rate variability in quiet sleep. Infants whose mothers consumed alcohol had lower global heart rate variability, but only in active sleep. Unexposed infants demonstrated increases in heart rate with head-up tilt and decreases in heart rate with head-down tilt, but smoking and alcohol-exposed infants showed no significant responses. These results indicate that autonomic function is altered by prenatal exposure to alcohol and smoking. Such markers may provide early identification of infants at greatest risk for SIDS. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The brainstem hypothesis is one of the leading hypotheses concerning the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It states that SIDS, or an important subset of SIDS, is due to abnormal brainstem mechanisms in the control of respiration, chemosensitivity, autonomic regulation, and/or arousal which impairs the infant's response to life-threatening, but often occurring, stressors during sleep (e.g., hypoxia, hypercarbia, asphyxia, hyperthermia) and leads to sudden death in a vulnerable developmental period. In this review, we summarize neuropathologic evidence from SIDS cases that support this hypothesis, beginning with the seminal report of subtle brainstem gliosis three decades ago. We focus upon recent neurochemical studies in our laboratory concerning the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and its key role in mediating protective responses to homeostatic stressors via medullary circuits. The possible fetal origin of brainstem defects in SIDS is reviewed, including evidence for adverse effects of prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking and alcohol upon the postnatal development of human brainstem 5-HT pathways. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Computer analyses of EEG/sleep states can be used as physiologic biomarkers of developmental neural plasticity. Frequency- and time-dependent signal processing strategies of cerebral and noncerebral measures can help test current theories of neuronal network maturation in terms of segregation and integration of short-distance versus long-distance neuronal connections throughout the neuroaxis. Specific phenotypic expressions of adaptive or maladaptive neuronal connectivity are proposed based on comparisons of whole-brain EEG/sleep resting states between preterm and full-term cohorts when developmental outcome measures are applied. Combined use of neurophysiological datasets with neuroimaging and genetic methodologies define endophenotypes that will more accurately diagnose children at risk for developmental disorders, as well as design appropriate neuroprotective interventions for the individual's age and disease progress. © 2009 S.

AB  - Purpose: Day/night ratio from diurnal ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP) in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in non-diabetic women was evaluated for its association with preeclampsia, retinopathy, HbA1c, and birth weight. Methods: One hundred and sixty-one women were recruited for AMBP performed with a Spacelab 90207 monitor. The pregnant women were 50 non-diabetic women and 111 T1DM women with normoalbuminuria and no hypertension. ANOVA, regression, and ROC curves analysis were applied. Results: Women with simplex retinopathy had higher night/day ratio and lower birth weight than those without retinopathy. Women who developed preeclampsia had night/day ratio similar to those with simplex retinopathy. In first trimester they had higher blood pressure than those who did not develop preeclampsia. Conclusions: Simplex retinopathy and preeclampsia are associated with a reduced night/day ratio even with normal blood pressure but night/day ratio provides no better prediction of preeclampsia than the absolute values. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Objectives: To describe different sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness in a French population of randomly selected young women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: Cross-sectional design with retrospective survey of pre-pregnancy, symptoms and prospective survey of current symptoms. Mothers were interviewed during pregnancy with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep before pregnancy and to assess alterations in their sleep according to the trimester. Results: 871 pregnant women completed the questionnaire. The rate of pregnant women with insomnia with non-refreshing sleep and frequent awakenings increases during the second and the third trimester reaching more than 75% of the women, essentially due to an urge to urinate, movements of the fetus, backache and restless legs syndrome. Snoring also increases throughout the pregnancy with more than 18% of them snoring every night. Conversely, more than 75% of the women complained of a decrease in their vigilance and a need to nap inreased during the pregnancy. Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy and increases throughout the pregnancy, except for excessive daytime sleepiness which was more frequent during the first trimester. © 2009 S.

AB  - In mammals, including man, epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that a range of environmental factors acting during critical periods of early development can alter adult phenotype. Hormones have an important role in these epigenetic modifications and can signal the type, severity and duration of the environmental cue to the developing feto-placental tissues. They affect development of these tissues both directly and indirectly by changes in placental phenotype. They act to alter gene expression, hence the protein abundance in a wide range of different tissues, which has functional consequences for many physiological systems both before and after birth. By producing an epigenome specific to the prevailing condition in utero, hormones act as epigenetic signals in developmental programming, with important implications for adult health and disease. This review examines the role of hormones as epigenetic signals by considering their responses to environmental cues, their effects on phenotypical development and the molecular mechanisms by which they programme feto-placental development, with particular emphasis on the glucocorticoids. © 2009 The Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: Prenatal nicotine exposure is associated with increased neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and smaller head circumference. Opioid-dependent pregnant women show a particularly high prevalence of tobacco smoking and are at greater risk for additional adverse events. However, little is known about the impact of tobacco smoking on opioid-maintained pregnant women and neonatal outcomes. Patients and Methods: This study examined the effect of cigarette smoking on 139 opioid-maintained pregnant women and their neonates. Forty-five percent of the participants were maintained on slow-release oral morphine (SROM), 39% received methadone maintenance, and 16% received buprenorphine. Participants were divided into two groups: (1) women who reported a low cigarette consumption of ≤10 cigarettes/day (56.8%) and (2) those reporting heavy consumption of ≥20 cigarettes/day (43.2%). Neonatal outcome measures were assessed, and a standardized Finnegan score was applied to determine the neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Results: Fifty-two percent of the newborns did not require treatment for NAS (54% of neonates born to methadone-maintained mothers, 30% born to SROM-maintained mothers, and 95% born to buprenorphine-maintained mothers; p < 0.001). Heavy cigarette consumption was associated with significantly lower neonatal birth weight (p < 0.001), smaller birth length (p = 0.017) as well as with the severity of NAS (p = 0.03). With regard to concomitant consumption of opioids (p = 0.54), cocaine (p = 0.25), amphetamines (p = 0.90) or benzodiazepines (p = 0.09), no significant differences between heavy or low nicotine consumption were noted. Conclusion: Heavy tobacco smoking in opioid-maintained pregnant women is associated with adverse medical and developmental consequences for the newborn. Future treatment programs for this target group should focus on an individualized approach to opioid maintenance therapy in addition to offering specially tailored counseling for smoking cessation. © 2009 S.

AB  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed in brainstem and spinal cord regions involved in the control of breathing. These receptors mediate central cholinergic regulation of respiration and effects of the exogenous ligand nicotine on respiratory pattern. Activation of α4 nAChRs in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), an essential site for normal respiratory rhythm generation in mammals, modulates excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission and depolarizes preBötC inspiratory neurons, leading to increases in respiratory frequency. nAChRs are also present in motor nuclei innervating respiratory muscles. Activation of post- and/or extra-synaptic α4 nAChRs on hypoglossal (XII) motoneurons depolarizes these neurons, potentiating tonic and respiratory-related rhythmic activity. As perinatal nicotine exposure may contribute to the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), we discuss the effects of perinatal nicotine exposure on development of the cholinergic and other neurotransmitter systems involved in control of breathing. Advances in understanding of the mechanisms underlying central cholinergic/nicotinic modulation of respiration provide a pharmacological basis for exploiting nAChRs as therapeutic targets for neurological disorders related to neural control of breathing such as sleep apnea and SIDS. © 2009 CPS and SIMM.

AB  - In the absence of prompt and efficacious treatment, malaria patients may progress within a few hours from having minor symptoms to severe disease and death. These last years have seen the development of several artemisinin-based combinations, new treatments for severe malaria patients, and new strategies such as intermittent preventive treatment or the home-based/near-home management of malaria. The health sector is now confronted with several treatment options and strategies, in contrast with the period when chloroquine monotherapy was the standard treatment. The major challenge remains the large-scale deployment, in the most efficient way, of the tools available today, including artemisinin-based combination treatments, within health systems that remain extremely weak in malaria endemic countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Health system research, exploring new potential approaches for the large-scale implementation of these interventions, should be promoted in parallel with that on new therapeutic agents to be used in the unlucky event of the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance. The prospects of substantially decreasing the malaria burden are brighter today than 20 - 30years ago, but the efforts and resources committed to this purpose should be maintained over a long period. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an extremely rare cause of acute coronary syndrome, with a reported angiographic incidence ranging between 0.1 and 1.1%. It mainly affects young patients, in particular women in the peripartum period or taking oral contraceptives, without possessing a definite relation with the classic risk factors for coronary artery disease. The left coronary artery system is the most frequently diseased, although the pattern of artery involvement is gender-based. Clinically, the presentation spectrum ranges from mild symptoms to sudden cardiac death. The major pathophysiologic processes underlying medial dissection are the presence of an intimal tear or the formation of an intramural hematoma. Several treatment modalities have been reported with varying success, although owing to the rarity of this condition, the optimal treatment options remain to be established.

AB  - Aims and objectives. The objectives of this prospective study were to identify birth-related fatigue trajectories in expectant fathers with the progress of labour and the physiological, psychological and situational factors related to specific trajectory patterns. Background. An increasing number of fathers participate in their partner's labour; however, their fatigue experience remains unclear. Previous studies have focused on overall groups without considering the possibility of between-subject heterogeneity. With an advanced data-analytic strategy, it is feasible to identify subgroup variation within the population over time. Design. A prospective, repeated measures design was used. Method. A convenience sample of 108 Taiwanese expectant fathers was followed throughout the labour process. Data were collected by visual analogue scales and self-administered questionnaires. The repeated measures of fatigue were analysed by using semi-parametric, group-based modelling. Results. Two distinct groups of individual trajectories among the expectant fathers were identified; the persistent low-fatigue group (49·2%) and the persistent high-fatigue group (50·8%). After birth, a moderate level of fatigue persisted in the high-fatigue group. The fastest period of increasing level in the persistent high-fatigue group was in the latent phase. The persistent high-fatigue group also experienced significantly more sleep difficulties prior to labour and more anxiety than the persistent low-fatigue group. Conclusions. Identifying and characterising meaningful clusters of trajectories could provide a better understanding of the birth-related fatigue experience of fathers and contributes to recognising the target client and timing for early intervention. Relevance to clinical practice. There are points in time at which professional caregiver actions may have an effect on the birth-related fatigue of fathers. Caregivers should prevent high levels of fatigue, which could accumulate as fathers accompany the women entering the labour phase. Fathers who present with high fatigue at onset of labour should receive early intervention, especially in the rapid-increasing fatigue period. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - To further understanding of the multiple temporal relationships of the physiological process, we monitored simultaneously 25 different variables in individual cows. We used 6 Bruna Italiana non - pregnant and non-lactating cows from the same farm. The animals were housed individually in a 12 m2 box under natural 14/10 light/dark cycle. They were fed twice daily and water was available ad libitum. Locomotor activity and heart rate were recorded continuously. The rectal temperature, respiratory rate and blood samples were recorded every 4 hours for 24 consecutive hours. To describe the periodic phenomenon analytically we applied a trigonometric statistical model according to the single cosinor procedure. Twelve of the 25 variables studied showed a daily rhythm: locomotor activity, rectal temperature, respiratory rate, haemoglobin, glucose, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, total lipids, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), phosphorus and magnesium. Our results contribute to the understanding of the capacity for reaction and adaptation of animals to the environment, and to the improvement in their output by intervention in their environmental circumstances and in the breeding process.

AB  - Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are defined as babies having a birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. A great number of studies have shown that children with SGA have an increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an excellent method for measuring brain maturation in newborns. In this study, the effect of SGA on the maturation of cerebrocortical electrographic activity was investigated by the EEG and also analyzed with power spectral analysis. Serial EEGs were performed in 40 term SGAs, and 20 term appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants in 1st week, 1st and 3rd month. Power spectral analysis was performed quantitatively in five channels (Fp 1-C 3, C 3-O 1, Fp 2-C 4, C 4-O 2, and Cz-C 4 channels). Amplitude levels of the SGA group were significantly lower than the AGA group in all records. Delta frequency was the major frequency component in the groups. Delta frequency activities in the midline vertex region were decreased in the AGA group with increasing postconceptual age while the activities of the SGA group were increased. Contrarily, beta frequency activities in the midline vertex region were increased in the AGA group with increasing postconceptual age while these activities of the SGA group were decreased. Theta frequency activities in the fronto-central regions were lower in the SGA group. In terms of the vertex, k-complex, and sleep spindle, there was no difference between the two groups. We conclude that cerebrocortical electrophysiological maturation has been delayed in term SGA infants during the first three months of postnatal life. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nephropathy of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (NAPS) is an increasingly well-recognized aspect of antiphospholipid syndrome. The most characteristic histopathology is that of thrombotic microangiopathy, and thrombosis occurring in the renal vasculature is thought to be the initiating event. Other less common pathologies have been reported, and the mechanisms of these are unclear. Therapy has been largely empiric. We report a case of NAPS in a patient with atypical pathology, who has declined therapy with immunosuppressive agents and anticoagulants and who has maintained normal renal function in 20 years of follow-up. © 2009 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Kisspeptins, coded by the KiSS-1 gene, regulate aspects of the reproductive axis by stimulating GnRH release via the G protein coupled receptor, GPR54. Recent reports show that KiSS/GPR54 may be key mediators in photoperiod- controlled reproduction in seasonal breeders, and that KiSS-1/GPR54 are expressed in the hypothalamus, ovaries, placenta, and pancreas. This study examined the expression of KiSS-1/ GPR54 mRNA and protein in ovaries of Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). Ovaries from cycling hamsters were collected during proestrus (P), estrus (E), diestrus I (DI), and diestrus II (DII). To examine KiSS-1/GPR54 during stimulated recrudescence, additional hamsters were maintained either in long day (LD 16L:8D, control) or short day (SD 8L:16D) for 14 weeks and then transferred to LD for 0-8 weeks. Staining of KiSS-1/GPR54 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in steroidogenic cells of pre-antral and antral follicles, and corpora lutea. Immunostaining peaked in Pand E, butdecreased in the diestrus stages (P< 0.05). In recrudescing ovaries, KiSS-1/GPR54 immunostaining was low after 14 weeks of SD exposure (post-transfer [PT] week 0), and increased during the early weeks of recrudescence. Expression of KiSS-1/GPR54 mRNA was low with short day exposure, but increased during recrudescence and was higher at PT week 8 as compared to PT weeks 0 and 2 (P< 0.05). The elevated KiSS-1/GPR54 expression during P and E suggests a potential role in ovulation in Siberian hamsters. Transient increases in KiSS-1/GPR54 expression following LD stimulation are also suggestive of possible involvement in ovulation and/or restoration of ovarian function. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Infant sleep is a major source of concern for many parents. The aims of this longitudinal study were to assess: (a) the development of sleep patterns among infants, (b) the development of maternal cognitions regarding infant sleep, and (c) the relations between these domains during the 1st year of life. Eighty-five mothers were recruited during pregnancy and completed a questionnaire aimed at assessing maternal sleep-related cognitions. After delivery (at 1, 6, and 12 months) sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep logs, and maternal cognitions were reassessed. The findings demonstrated significant predictive and concomitant links between maternal cognitions and infant sleep. Maternal soothing behaviors mediated the relations between these domains. © 2009, Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

AB  - Sleep disturbance during pregnancy can result in excessive daytime sleepiness, diminished daytime performance, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the potential for an increased length of labor and increased risk of operative birth. Sleep disturbance may be the result of a sleep disorder, such as leg cramps, a common yet benign disorder, or restless legs syndrome, a sensorimotor disorder. Both disrupt sleep, are distressing to the pregnant woman, and mimic one another and other serious disorders. During pregnancy, up to 30% of women can be affected by leg cramps, and up to 26% can be affected by restless legs syndrome. © 2009 American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - Introduction. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic neurological disorder that has a negtive influence on sleep. We describe clinical spectrum, polysomnogram and impact on sleep of patients' series with RLS. Methods. We studied 49 patients with RLS. We analyse sociodemographic information, clinical features, therapy and impact on sleep. We realized differents questionnaire: Index of Severity of Sleep, Epworth Scale, Index-RLS, Questionnaire Quality of Life-RLS and Questionnaire from limitation of laboral productivity. Results. Mean age is 60.33±14.27 with similar distribution enter gender. They presented a positive family history in 36,73% with predominant in early onset of symptoms. Secondary causes more frequent associated were rheumatoid arthritis, iron-deficiency, uremia, pregnancy and polineuropathy. Significative prevalence of insomnia (73,43%) and periodic limb movement disorder (51,02%), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (22,45%) and hipersomnia (22,45 %). Pharmacological treatment more used were dopaminergic drugs. We didn't find significant stadistic differences enter clinical feature and therapy, so tendency to better quality of life with dopaminergic drugs. Conclusions. It's an neurological disorder with important delay in diagnosis. Early detection is needed because important impact on sleep efficiency and quality of life, and improvement with therapy, solely dopaminergic drugs.

AB  - Sleep duration is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors, depression, automobile and workplace accidents, and prospective mortality. Little is known, however, about sleep patterns in the US population. The 2004-2007 National Health Interview Survey-Sample Adult Files provide nationally representative data for 110,441 noninstitutionalized US adults aged 18 years or older, and multinomial logistic regression examines whether variables in 5 domains - demographic, family structure, socioeconomic, health behavior, and health status - are associated with long or short sleep duration. Being older, non-Hispanic black, or a current or former smoker; having low levels of education, income, or few income sources; consuming few or numerous drinks in a week; or reporting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, underweight, or activity limitations is associated with increased odds of both long and short sleep duration. Other variables are associated with shorter (e.g., living with young children, being unmarried, working long hours, more frequent binge drinking) or longer (e.g., being younger, Mexican American, pregnant, or having low levels of physical activity) sleep hours. The authors identify numerous risk factors for long and short sleep; many of those variables are potential confounders of the relation between sleep hours and other health outcomes.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common movement disorder wherein sensory motor symptoms are observed in the limbs mainly during sleep and quiet wakefulness. The diagnostic criteria for RLS were established in 1995 by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) and revised in 2003. The prevalence of RLS in Europe and North America was reported to be between 5% and 12%. On the other hand, the prevalence of RLS in Asia was lesser than that in Europe and North America: it was estimated to be less than 4%. This difference might be associated with vacial, cultural, and language differences. Genetic factors are known to contribute to the etiology of RLS in up to two-thirds of these patients. Furthermore, RLS might complicate an already existing medical condition. The development of secondary RLS is associated with renal failure, iron deficiency, frequent blood donation, Parkinson disease, neuropathy, as well as pregnancy. Generally, these medical condition are more frequently complicated in patient with RLS than in healthy controls. However, there is no conclusive evidence to prove an association between these medical conditions and RLS. Genetic contribution, environmental factors and other covariates such as gender, age, iron deficiency, as well as medical conditions play an important role in the development of RLS. In conclusion, epidemiological evidence suggests that both the primary and secondary forms of RLS are common neurological disorders. Future epidemiological studies are required to determine the potential risk factors contributing to the development of this disorder.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs and usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movement and is exacerbated or occurs mainly in the evening or night. People suffering from RLS are estimated to represent 2-3% of the general Japanese population, which is relatively lower than the estimated prevalence in western countries. Supportive diagnostic critevia include family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. RLS phenotypes include an early onset form that is usually idiopathic with frequent familial history and a late onset form that is usually secondary to other somatic conditions that are causative factors in RLS occurrence. In all patients presenting with complaints of insomnia or discomfort in the lower limbs, diagnosis of RLS should be considered. RLS should be differentiated from akathisia, which is an urge to move the whole body in the absence of uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test (SIT) can detect PLM in patients that are asleep or awake. RLS may cause severe sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms, and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Secondary RLS may occur due to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drug use including antipsychotics and antidepressants. Small fiber neuropathy can trigger RLS or mimic its symptoms. RLS is associated with many neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy; althoughit does not predispose to these diseases. A symptom rating scale for RLS authorized by the International RLS Study Group (IRLS) would facilitate accurate diagnosis of this condition.

AB  - The information about aspergillosis locations in the reproductive organ is scarce. This short paper deals with aspergillosis in the dog genital tract with hyphae present in semen. There are two therapy schemes used in visceral mycoses, non-invasive treatment and surgical intervention. Considering the future reproductive career of the dog, we decided on antifungal drugs administration. Based on the microbiological results, we administered amoxycillin with clavulonate (Synulox® 500 mg, twice daily) orally. Itraconazole was used as an antimycological agent (Orungal®, 100 mg, twice daily) every other week. In 8th week of therapy no Aspergillus spp. growth was noted, yet slight Penicillium growth was observed. After 12 weeks of treatment, no fungus growth was present. Neither spores or hyphae were seen in the microscopic examination. Three months after the termination of the therapy, the dog mated with two females. In one case, unifetal pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasound examination on day 42 after mating. Due to purulent discharge on day 45 after mating, the owner decided to terminate the pregnancy. In the other case, severe pyometra appeared 12 days after the second mating and the owner decided to put the female to sleep. The pathogen eradication from the ejaculates may be treated as a serious success, yet the lack of litters after mating calls for an explanation and consequences of Aspergillus spp. infection need to be considered. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the last 30 years, there has been an explosion in facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of the obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) as well as a rapid advancement in the understanding of its consequences. In the general population, the prevalence of OSAHS is approximately 3-7% in adult men and 2-5% in adult women. OSAHS has been recognised as an independent risk factor for disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and sleepiness-related accidents. Currently, it is considered to be a systemic disease. This review provides a general overview of OSAHS: its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment, as well as its consequences for public health. Crown Copyright © 2009.

AB  - The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of serotonin transporter gene is widely investigated in association studies in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The results of such studies, however, remain controversial possibly due to the great genetic heterogeneity related to ASD and the lack of evaluation of the triallelic functional structure of 5-HTTLPR. This study tested for association between the 5-HTTLPR and ASD in a Brazilian sample by case-control and family-based association test (FBAT) methods, considering the biallelic and triallelic structures of this polymorphism. In addition, we performed an exploratory analysis of associations between specific clinical outcomes of ASD patients and 5-HTTLPR as well as several prenatal environmental factors. Genotyping was achieved in 151 ASD patients, 179 unrelated controls and 105 complete trios. There was no evidence of association between the 5-HTTLPR with ASD in both case-control and FBAT tests, but the LaLa 5-HTTLPR genotype was associated with mood instability in patients (P = 0.006). The prenatal exposure to potential neuroteratogenic drugs was associated with epilepsy (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that the 5-HTTLPR is not associated with ASD in the Brazilian population, even considering the triallelic structure. Additionally, this study suggested a role of the 5-HTTLPR and environmental factors in the clinical expression of ASD. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND:: Obesity and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are both associated with hypofunction of dopamine in the CNS. We therefore examined whether individuals who are obese have an increased risk of RLS in two ongoing US cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study II and the Health Professional Follow-up Study. METHODS:: We included 65,554 women and 23,119 men free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy in the current analyses. Information on RLS was assessed using a set of standardized questions. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met four RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International RLS Study Group and had restless legs ≥5 times/month. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using logistic regression models adjusting for age, smoking, use of antidepressant, phobic anxiety score, and other covariates. Log ORs from the two cohorts were pooled by a fixed-effects model. RESULTS:: There were 6.4% of women and 4.1% of men who were considered to have RLS. Multivariate adjusted ORs for RLS were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.3, 1.6; p trend <0.0001) for participants with body mass index (BMI) >30 vs <23 kg/m and 1.60 (95% CI: 1.5, 1.8; p trend <0.0001) for highest vs lowest waist circumference quintiles. Greater BMI in early adulthood (age 18-21 years) and weight gain were also associated with a higher prevalence of RLS (p trend <0.01 for both). CONCLUSIONS:: Both overall and abdominal adiposity are associated with increased likelihoods of having restless legs syndrome (RLS). Further prospective studies are warranted to clarify causative association between obesity and risk of developing RLS. © 2009 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

AB  - Different factors have been proposed to influence morningness-eveningness, biological rhythms, and sleep-wake cycles, but few studies focused on the influence of social habits. Here, we focus on the influence of children and partners on the social habits of women at different stages of their lives and on synchronization within the family. One hundred and seventy-nine women participated in the study and were allocated into four groups: women without children, pregnant women without children, pregnant women with children, and non-pregnant mothers. Morningness was predicted by the presence of children, and earlier chronotype was predicted by the presence of children, pregnancy, and age. Average sleep duration was longest in pregnant women. The presence of children was responsible for a difference in rise times of approximately 1.5h on the weekend. Subjective sleep-onset latencies were shortest in women with children. The synchrony between partners (husband/wife) was 0.46 in women without children, 0.79 in pregnant women, 0.40 in women with children, and 0.56 between mother and child. Partners' chronotypes were highly correlated, as were those of mother and child. This study suggests children have a strong influence on their mother's lifestyle and sleep-wake rhythm, far beyond the first months of life, and that children are a more important social factor than the male partner.

AB  - Activity-rest behaviour of 11 neonates whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy (s-group) and 11 neonates of non-smoking mothers (ns-group) born by Caesarean section (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using Actiwatch actometers. In addition, a standardised diary was kept regularly. Amount of sleep time during daytime, night time, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during daytime and night time, were compared. Both groups showed a significant difference in amount of night time sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at night time. Many adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy are known. We could not, however, detect significant differences in the amount of night time sleep, daytime sleep, and 24h sleep time between the s- and ns-group neonates.

AB  - Mutual interactions between neurohormones and sleep have been extensively studied since the pioneering work done in the 1960s on growth hormone secretion. Hormonal secretion pattern is either influenced predominantly by sleep, independently of circadian timing, or more closely coupled to the light-dark cycle, although both processes ultimately interact with one another. Individual differences regarding gender and age are sometimes prominent, so careful selection of groups to be studied is important. Because of such fragmented data, generalizations can seldom be derived from the available literature. Much like puzzle pieces, every bit of information constitutes but one small component of the broader, more global, neurohormonal picture seen in sleep. We have divided this analysis into discussions of the adenohypophysis, neurohypophysis, and pineal gland, describing the reciprocal influence regarding sleep and the different neurohormones. Specific issues related to gender differences and selected endocrinologic diseases will also be addressed, as well as changes related to the most common sleep disorder, obstructive sleep apnea. © 2009, American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of daily versus alternate-day stimulation for patients undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI). Design: Retrospective comparative study. Setting: University tertiary care center for infertility. Patient(s): Women with anovulatory or unexplained infertility for over 12 months who had not responded to or not conceived with clomiphene citrate treatment. Intervention(s): Ovarian stimulation with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; follitropin-beta) given either daily or on alternate days before IUI. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical pregnancy at ultrasound 4 weeks after IUI. Secondary outcome measures were duration of stimulation, total gonadotropin dose, ovarian response, and multiple pregnancy rate. Result(s): Of the 212 women who underwent a first cycle of gonadotropin stimulation, 28 had daily injections and 117 had alternate-day injections of follitropin-beta only for IUI. Female age, antral follicle count, and day-3 serum FSH were comparable. The median duration of stimulation (8 days vs. 8 days) and the median number of follicles over 14 mm (3.5 vs. 3.0) were similar in both groups. However, the total recominbinant FSH dose (825 vs. 625 IU) and endometrial thickness (10.1 vs. 9.3 mm) were greater in the daily injection group. The clinical pregnancy rate per cycle was 42% (12 out of 28) in the daily injection group and 19% (22 out of 117) in the alternate-day group. Conclusion(s): Daily recombinant FSH stimulation for IUI seems to be associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate than alternate-day FSH stimulation. Prospective randomized trials would be needed to determine whether this is indeed the case. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality in late pregnancy and recurrence of postpartum major depression (PPMD) through 28 weeks postpartum. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 36 weeks gestation was assessed in 51 non-depressed women with a history of PPMD; recurrence was determined by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Sleep quality in late pregnancy was not related to recurrence per se, but it was related to timing of recurrence (Kruskal-Wallace = 9.78, p = .008).Rapid recurrence (within 4 weeks post delivery) was preceded by fewer sleep complaints (mean PSQI for early recurrers = 4.8 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = 09). Recurrence after 4 weeks postpartum was preceded by more sleep complaints in late pregnancy (mean PSQI for late recurrers = 9.9 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .02). Sleep quality in late pregnancy may help in identifying women at risk for a PPMD recurrence. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted bacterial infection that results in health care costs in the United States that exceed $2 billion per year. Chlamydia infections cause damage to the oviducts, resulting in ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility, but the reasons for defective oviduct function are poorly understood. We have investigated the role of oviduct contractions in egg transport and found that underlying electrical pacemaker activity is responsible for oviduct motility and egg transport. Specialized pacemaker cells, referred to as oviduct interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-OVI), are responsible for pacemaker activity. The ICC-OVI, labeled with antibodies to KIT protein, form a dense network associated with the smooth muscle cells along the entire length of the oviduct. Selective removal of ICC-OVI with KIT-neutralizing antibody resulted in loss of electrical rhythmicity and loss of propulsive contractions of the oviduct. We tested whether infection might adversely affect the ICC-OVI. Mice infected with Chlamydia muridarum displayed dilation of oviducts, pyosalpinx, and loss of spontaneous contractile activity. Morphological inspection showed disruption of ICC-OVI networks, and electrophysiological recordings showed loss of intrinsic pacemaker activity without change in basal smooth muscle membrane potential. Chlamydia infection also was associated with upregulation of NOS2 (iNOS) and PTGS2 (COX II) in leukocytes. Loss of ICC-OVI and pacemaker activity causes oviduct pseudo-obstruction and loss of propulsive contractions for oocytes. This, accompanied by retention of oviduct secretions, may contribute to the development of tubal factor infertility. © 2009 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

AB  - Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with significant maternal and infant morbidity are on the rise in Western society despite advances of medical technology. Current risk factors are insufficient to identify women at greatest risk of developing an adverse outcome. An attempt to identify novel contributors to increased risk is warranted. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, yet are often dismissed as irrelevant. Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. Disturbed sleep is also linked with an increased inflammatory response. Increased inflammation is proposed as a key biological pathway through which chronic disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes develop. In this paper, we propose a model and a testable hypothesis of how disturbed sleep in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth via increased inflammation.

AB  - Study Objective: To determine whether preconceptional psychological distress is associated with infant sleep disturbance. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Southampton, UK. Participants: A cohort of women from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant pairs were involved in the study. Measurements and results: Preconceptional psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confdence intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46). Conclusions: Women with preconceptional psychological distress are more likely to have babies with sleep disturbance during infancy, independent of whether they suffered from postnatal depression.

AB  - The brain and the gut work synergistically with each other and other organs. Reviewing nutrition systemically (rather than by single organs) is a holistic way for dietitians to evaluate their clients'health status. Nutrition influences the genetic onset and consequences of many chronic diseases. With identification of up to 500 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in an individual, the population-level potential for nutrigenomic optimization is astounding. The reader will be able to describe how several specific nutrients can maintain or improve health through supporting or suppressing gene expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Energy drinks are frequently purported to improve cognitive function and concentration. However, the cardiovascular effects of these drinks have not been adequately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cardiac effects of a commercially available, multicomponent energy drink in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Fifteen healthy adults were included in this prospective study. Individuals who had chronic medical conditions, were on chronic medication, or were pregnant or breast-feeding were excluded. Subjects abstained from caffeine for 48 hours prior to and during the study. In the morning on Day 1 of the study, while subjects were in a fasted state, baseline blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters were measured. Participants then consumed 500 mL (2 cans) of an energy drink and measurements were repeated 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours later. Participants then drank 500 mL of energy drink daily for the next 5 days. Day 1 protocol was repeated on Day 7. RESULTS: On Days 1 and 7, maximum mean systolic BP (SBP), HR, and QTc interval occurred at 4 hours. Maximum diastolic BP (DBP) occurred at 2 hours on Days 1 and 7. Within 4 hours of energy drink consumption, on Days 1 and 7, respectively, SBP increased by 7.9% (p = 0.006) and 9.6% (p < 0.001), HR increased by 7.8% (p = 0.009) and 11.0% (p < 0.001), and QTc interval increased by 2.4% (p = 0.368) and 5.0% (p = 0.052). DBP increased by 7.0% (p = 0.046) and 7.8% (p = 0.063) within 2 hours of energy drink consumption on Days 1 and 7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although no significant ECG changes were observed, HR increased 5-7 beats/min and SBP increased 10 mm Hg after energy drink consumption.

AB  - Background: Current use of treated mosquito nets for the prevention of malaria falls short of what is expected in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), though research within the continent has indicated that the use of these commodities can reduce malaria morbidity by 50% and malaria mortality by 20%. Governments in sub-Sahara Africa are investing substantially in scaling-up treated mosquito net coverage for impact. However, certain significant factors still prevent the use of the treated mosquito nets, even among those who possess them. This survey examines household ownership as well as use and non-use of treated mosquito nets in Sahel Savannah and Niger Delta regions of Nigeria. Methodology: This survey employed cross-sectional survey to collect data from households on coverage and use of mosquito nets, whether treated or not. Fever episodes in previous two weeks among children under the age of five were also recorded. The study took place in August 1 - 14 2007, just five months after the March distribution of treated mosquito nets, coinciding with the second raining period of the year and a time of high malaria transmission during the wet season. EPI INFO version 2003 was used in data analysis. Results: The survey covered 439 households with 2,521 persons including 739 under-fives, 585 women in reproductive age and 78 pregnant women in Niger Delta Region and Sahel Savannah Region. Of the 439 HHs, 232 had any mosquito nets. Significantly higher proportion of households in the Niger Delta Region had any treated or untreated mosquito nets than those in the Sahel Savannah Region. In the Niger Delta Region, the proportion of under-fives that had slept under treated nets the night before the survey exceeded those that slept under treated nets in the Sahel Savannah Region. Children under the age of five years in the Niger Delta Region were four times more likely to sleep under treated nets than those in the Sahel Savannah Region. Conclusion: This study found that despite the fact that treated nets were distributed widely across Nigeria, the use of this commodity was still very low in the Sahel Savannah region. Future campaigns should include more purposeful social and health education on the importance and advantages of the use of treated nets to save lives in the Sahel Savannah region of Nigeria.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity have become two of the main threats to public health in the Western world. In addition, obesity is the most important determinant of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a condition that adversely affects glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown whether patients with diabetes have more severe SAHS than non-diabetic subjects. The aim of this cross-sectional case-control study was to evaluate whether obese patients with T2DM are more prone to severe SAHS than obese non-diabetic subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and smoking status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a university hospital. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, smoking habit, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examinations included a non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary function testing, and an awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures included the percentage of time spent at saturations below 90% (CT90). A high prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM:80%, nondiabetic:78.3%). No differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events between diabetic and non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in diabetic patients, a significantly increase in the CT90 was detected (20.2±30.2% vs. 6.8±13,5%; p = 0.027). In addition, residual volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM (percentage of predicted: 79.7±18.1 vs. 100.1±22.8; p,0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with CT90. Conclusions/Significance: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in obese patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, the screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory. © 2009 Lecube et al.

AB  - Background. Obesity among children and adolescents is a growing public health problem. The aim of the present paper is to identify potential determinants of obesity and risk groups among 3- to 17-year old children and adolescents to provide a basis for effective prevention strategies. Methods. Data were collected in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a nationally representative and comprehensive data set on health behaviour and health status of German children and adolescents. Body height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was classified according to IOTF cut-off points. Statistical analyses were conducted on 13,450 non-underweight children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years. The association between overweight, obesity and several potential determinants was analysed for this group as well as for three socio-economic status (SES) groups. A multiple logistic regression model with obesity as the dependent variable was also calculated. Results. The strongest association with obesity was observed for parental overweight and for low SES. Furthermore, a positive association with both overweight (including obesity) and obesity was seen for maternal smoking during pregnancy, high weight gain during pregnancy (only for mothers of normal weight), high birth weight, and high media consumption. In addition, high intakes of meat and sausages, total beverages, water and tea, total food and beverages, as well as energy-providing food and beverages were significantly associated with overweight as well as with obesity. Long sleep time was negatively associated with obesity among 3- to 10-year olds. Determinants of obesity occurred more often among children and adolescents with low SES. Conclusion. Parental overweight and a low SES are major potential determinants of obesity. Families with these characteristics should be focused on in obesity prevention. © 2009 Kleiser et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The 50 g-glucose challenge test (GCT) is commonly used for screening of gestational diabetes (GDM) in low risk pregnant women. If elevated, glucose tolerance test is performed to confirm the diagnosis. In this study, we evaluated whether GCT alone is sufficient to diagnose GDM when the GCT result is very elevated. Research design and methods: Using a database of 62877 pregnancies over 10 years, the positive predictive value (PPV) of GCT for GDM was assessed using different GCT cut-off values. Results: At a glucose cut-off value of 11 mmol/l, the PPV for GDM was 85.3%, based on the subsequent GTT. This increased to 95.3% when the cut-off was 12 mmol/l. Furthermore, the PPV was consistently higher when GCT was performed in the morning. Conclusion: We concluded that the diagnosis of GDM can be made when the glucose level following GCT is very elevated, and GTT need not to be performed for confirmation of GDM. The timing of GCT also affected PPV for GDM, and has implications on the diagnostic value of the test. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of induced labour with intravenous oxytocin with a start in the evening versus in the morning. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Labour wards of three hospitals in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants: Women with an indication for induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin. Methods: Included women were randomized to either the evening group with a start of induction of labour at 21:00 hours, or the morning group with a start at 07:00 hours. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was duration of labour. Secondary outcomes were instrumental delivery rate, adverse neonatal outcome defined as an Apgar score below 7 after 5 minutes, number and indications of paediatric consults and neonatal admissions, duration of second stage, number of intrapartum infections and necessity of pain relief. Results: We randomised 371 women. Mean duration of labour was not significantly different (primiparae: morning 12 hours and 8 minutes versus evening 11 hours and 22 minutes, P value 0.29; multiparae: morning 7 hours and 34 minutes versus evening 7 hours and 46 minutes, P value 0.70). There were no significant differences in instrumental deliveries rates, number of infections or patient satisfaction. Unexpectedly, neonatal outcome was better in women induced in the evening. Conclusion: Induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is equally effective as induction in the morning. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - Hypertension develops in 10% of pregnancies. Snoring, a marker of obstructive sleep apnoea, is a newly identified risk factor for gestational hypertension. Moreover, obstructive sleep apnoea is an independent risk factor for incident hypertension in the non-pregnant population. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with new onset of hypertension among pregnant females. A case-control study was performed involving 17 pregnant females with gestational hypertension and 33 pregnant females without hypertension. Subjects were frequency-matched for gestational age and recruited in a tertiary obstetrical centre. Obstructive sleep apnoea was ascertained by polysomnography and defined by an apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) of ≥15 events·h-1, without requirement for desaturation. The mean±SD AHI for normotensive pregnant females was 18.2±12.2 events·h-1 compared with 38.6±36.7 events·h-1 for females with hypertensive pregnancies. The crude odds ratio for the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea given the presence of gestational hypertension was 5.6. The odds ratio was 7.5 (95% confidence interval 3.5-16.2), based on a logistic regression model with adjustment for maternal age, gestational age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, prior pregnancies, and previous live births. In conclusion, gestational hypertension appears to be strongly associated with the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2009.

AB  - Background: Dysregulation of daytime cortisol activity has been associated with stress-related pathologies. Research suggests that early environmental adversity might shape cortisol activity. However, little is known about the genetic and environmental contributions to early cortisol and how this varies as a function of environmental circumstances. The goals of the study were to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to daytime cortisol secretion in infant twins and to investigate whether these contributions varied as a function of familial adversity (FA). Methods: Participants were 517 6-month-old twins. Salivary cortisol was collected when the infants woke up at home and in the morning, upon arrival at the laboratory. Familial adversity was defined by seven perinatal and postnatal risk factors: maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, low family income, low maternal education, single parenthood, young motherhood, and maternal hostile/reactive behaviors. Genetic and environment contributions to cortisol activity were estimated for high (three risk factors or more: 21.3% of the sample) versus low FA. Results: Genetic factors accounted for cortisol levels in different ways: a moderate "main effect" of genes was found for home-based awakening cortisol, whereas the contribution of genes to morning cortisol was conditional to FA. Genetic factors accounted for most of the variance in morning cortisol in high family adversity but not in low family adversity. Conclusions: Early FA modulates the heritability of morning cortisol in infants. The results are consistent with the diathesis-stress model, with genetic factors more likely to be expressed in adverse settings. © 2009 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present the life-span model of motivation comprising four key processes or the four C's - channelling, choice, co-agency or co-regulation and compensation - in the context of several longitudinal data sets focusing on people's personal goals during critical life transitions. The life-span model of motivation posits that the challenges, demands, and opportunities people encounters at a particular stage of their lives channel the kinds of personal goals they construct [Little, B., Salmela-Aro, K., & Phillips, S. (2007). Personal project pursuit: Goals, action and human flourishing. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers]; that personal goals play an important role in the ways in which people make choices and direct their own development [Baltes, P. B. (1997). On the incomplete architecture of human ontogeny: Selection, optimization and compensation as foundation of developmental theory. American Psychologist, 52, 366-380]; that people regulate their development by co-agency [Edwards, A. (2006). Relational agency: Learning to be a resourceful practitioner. International Journal of Educational Research, 43, 168-182]; and that people compensate for failure experiences by adjusting their personal goals on the basis of previous developmental transitions and life events [Brandtstädter, J. (1989). Personal self-regulation of development: Cross-sequential analyses of development-related control beliefs and emotions. Developmental Psychology, 25, 96-108], and that such compensation and adjustment has consequences for their well-being [Heckhausen, J., Wrosch, C. & Fleeson, W. (2001).

AB  - Background: The study examined whether prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with increased motor timing variability when the timing response is partitioned into central clock variability, which indexes information processing at the central nervous system (CNS) level and motor delay variability, which reflects timing processes at the level of the peripheral nervous system. Methods: Eighteen children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and 22 control children were assigned to young (7 to 11 years) or older (12 to 17 years) groups. Children tapped a single response key with the index finger in synchrony with a series of externally generated tones (the paced phase). At the conclusion of these tones, children continued tapping (the continuation phase) while attempting to maintain the same rate of tapping imposed by the paced phase. Two blocks of tapping were completed with inter-tone-intervals set at either 400 or 900 milliseconds. Inter-response interval, central clock variability, and motor delay variability produced during the continuation phase were the dependent variables. Results: Mean inter-response interval for the 4 groups did not differ for either time interval. Central clock variability produced by the young alcohol-exposed group was significantly greater than the two older groups for the 400 millisecond interval and all other groups for the 900 millisecond interval. Motor delay variability produced by the young alcohol-exposed group was significantly greater than the other three groups for both time intervals. Central and motor delay variability in children with and without alcohol exposure was directly related to the duration of the interval to be reproduced. Conclusions: Central and peripheral timing variability was significantly greater for the young alcohol-exposed children. This atypical timing may be related to the teratogenic effects of alcohol, although the negative effects are limited to younger alcohol-exposed children since there were no differences in central and peripheral timing variability between the older alcohol-exposed children and controls. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

AB  - The United States is in the midst of an obesity crisis. The majority of American women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. The presence of excess body weight in a woman can negatively impact fertility, pregnancy, postnatal recovery, and the health of her child. Psychiatric comorbidities, including eating and mood disorders, can influence nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy and weight loss in the postpartum period. Stress associated with caretaking in the postpartum period impacts levels of sleep and physical activity, which further impact postpartum weight retention. This article reviews the literature in these areas; the article discusses the management of excess body weight during and after pregnancy as well as related psychiatric conditions in pregnant and postpartum women. © MBL Communications.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to explore the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety across pregnancy and the early postpartum. Methods: Participants (N = 207) completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait subscale, Beck Depression Inventory, and social support and sleep quality measures at two time points during pregnancy and once in the early postpartum period. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of anxiety and depression over time, depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of anxiety in late pregnancy and anxiety in late pregnancy predicted higher depressive symptomatology in the early postpartum. A bi-directional model of depression and anxiety in pregnancy was supported. Limitations: Data were based on self-reports and participating women were predominantly tertiary educated with high family incomes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms precede the development of higher levels of anxiety and that anxiety, even at non-clinical levels, can predict higher depressive symptoms. Clinicians are advised to screen for anxiety and depression concurrently during pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prevalence studies show that one in five women experience an episode of major depressive disorder during their lifetime. It is important for health care providers to be aware of (1) the frequency of depression in this population; (2) signs, symptoms, and appropriate screening methods; and (3) health risks for the mother and growing fetus if depression is undetected or untreated. Because management of depressed pregnant women also includes care of a growing fetus, treatment may be complicated and primary care providers should consider a multidisciplinary approach, including an obstetrician, psychiatrist, and pediatrician, to provide optimal care. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The "disk-over-water" method, where animals are awakened by disk rotation triggered by sleep EEG signals, was efficiently used in many studies involving sleep deprivation. Recently, the modification of this method has been developed where, during the period of deprivation, the disk was rotated in accordance with a pre-set program (the "disk-over-water" method without feedback). We considered this modification as a potentially promising one for investigation of relationship between maternal sleep and litter development. However, none of these methods has been used in experiments on female rats, and efficiency of the method without feedback has never been tested using electrophysiological estimation of sleep-wake states either. Performing these tasks was the goal of the present study. Cortical EEG, hippocampal theta-activity and locomotor activity were recorded in 14 female Wistar rats underwent sleep deprivation in the "disk-over-water" setup without feedback. Three days long during the deprivation periods from 11:00 to 14:00 the disk was rotated for 8 s with 15 s intervals. REM sleep was totally eliminated during these periods, and amounts of slow wave sleep did not exceed 10% of 3 h. The results were identical both for pregnant and non-pregnant rats. The rate of sleep reduction during deprivation periods in our experimental conditions did not differ from that in the original system with the feedback. Thus the simplified "disk-over-water" method without feedback can be used in the studies involving relatively short sleep deprivation periods.

AB  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is commonly used although clinical studies questioned its diagnostic value. Sophisticated FHR variability (fHRV) measures such as fHRV complexity may improve the sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring. A more detailed understanding of the physiology underlying fHRV complexity is essential to harness its use for monitoring fetal health. To examine the specific effects of vagal and sympathetic modulations on fHRV complexity, we blocked vagal activity with atropine and sympathetic activity with propranolol in near-term fetal sheep (n = 7, 0.85 gestation). Under these conditions, we analyzed the linear and nonlinear parts of fHRV complexity from autonomic information flow. Overall fHRV complexity decreased with both drugs compared with nonrapid eye movement sleep baseline (P < 0.05). With atropine, this was because of a decrease of the linear part of fHRV complexity on the long-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that vagal modulation of fHRV is adequately described by linear fHRV measures. With propranolol, the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity decreased on the short-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that sympathetic influences on fHRV can be detected by the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity. Thus the complex interplay of vagal and sympathetic modulations of fHRV is reflected differently and specifically in the linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV complexity, and on different time scales. Analysis of linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV may improve sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring. Copyright © 2009 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - The diagnosis and management of patients with epilepsy is often undertaken by pediatricians, internists, and geriatricians (primary care physicians [PCPs]). Although referral to a neurologist may be necessary if the diagnosis of epilepsy is unclear or if the patient does not respond to initial therapy with antiepileptic drugs, PCPs may subsequently follow-up with patients to implement the recommendations of the neurologist. To maximize the likelihood of treatment success, PCPs should supplement antiepileptic drug therapy with patient education and referrals for psychosocial and vocational support when needed. Special considerations are warranted for women of childbearing potential and elderly patients. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple risk factors for deformational plagiocephaly (DP) have been reported. The purpose of this study was to establish the impact of these variables on the severity of this deformity. A prospective cohort study was performed. Parents completed a standardized questionnaire assessing potential risk factors for DP before assessment. Examination included measurement of transcranial difference (TCD; ie, difference in oblique cranial lengths), evaluation of head tilt, and rotational asymmetry. Pearson correlation coefficient, 1-way analysis of variance, and 2-sample t-test were used to quantify the relationship between identified risk factors and TCD. A total of 434 patients with DP were evaluated. Male-to-female ratio was 2:1; mean gestational age was 36.5 weeks. Deformational plagiocephaly was first appreciated at a mean infant age of 6 weeks. A preexisting diagnosis of torticollis was noted in fewer than 50%. Mean TCD was 11.2 mm. Head tilt was documented in 80% of infants, and mean head rotational asymmetry was 16.4 degrees. Deformational plagiocephaly was more severe in multiple birth pregnancies (P < 0.05), males (P < 0.05), infants with a favorite head position (P < 0.01), preexamination diagnosis of torticollis (P < 0.05), and infants with a head tilt (P < 0.05). Lower gestational age (P < 0.05) and greater head rotational asymmetry (P < 0.0001) were found to correlate with DP severity. This study suggests that the relationship between the severity of DP and certain risk factors can be quantified. The presence and degree of cervical imbalance correlate strongly with deformational cranial asymmetry. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Post-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with diminished lung growth during school age. The current authors aimed to determine whether pre-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with lung function changes in the newborn. In a prospective birth cohort of 241 healthy term-born neonates, tidal breathing, lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured during unsedated sleep at age 5 weeks. Maternal exposure to particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm (PM 10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and distance to major roads were estimated during pregnancy. The association between these exposures and lung function was assessed using linear regression. Minute ventilation was higher in infants with higher pre-natal PM10 exposure (24.9 mL·min-1 per μg·m-3 PM 10). The eNO was increased in infants with higher pre-natal NO 2 exposure (0.98 ppb per mg?m-3 NO2). Post-natal exposure to air pollution did not modify these findings. No association was found for pre-natal exposure to O3 and lung function parameters. The present results suggest that pre-natal exposure to air pollution might be associated with higher respiratory need and airway inflammation in newborns. Such alterations during early lung development may be important regarding long-term respiratory morbidity. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2009.

AB  - Very low-birth-weight premature infants often suffer from a variety of respiratory problems, including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), hypopnea and periodic breathing, and apnea. These conditions are likely related to immaturity of the respiratory centers; yet how respiratory rhythms originating from these centers, including their complexity, relate to demographic measures of prematurity remains largely unknown. In 39 neonates with mild RDS (22 males, 28 ± 2 wk gestational age, 1,036 ± 234 g body wt), we derived the univariate association between complexity of two respiratory rhythms [respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (VT)] and postmenstrual age, gestational age, postnatal age, and weight at time of study. RR and VT rhythm complexities were assessed using approximate entropy, sample entropy, base scale entropy, and forbidden words entropy estimated for 300 consecutive breaths determined from respiratory inductance plethysmography, irrespective of breathing effort rate or amplitude, collected during sleep while the neonates were exposed to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (4-6 cmH 2O). RR and VT exhibited increased complexity with increased maturity, but only in terms of base scale entropy and forbidden words entropy, which are based on pattern matching, rather than approximate entropy and sample entropy, which are based on conditional probabilities. Specifically, RR complexity as measured by forbidden word entropy increased with increasing weight (r = 0.502), postconceptional age (r = 0.423), and gestational age (r = 0.493). As measured by base scale entropy, RR complexity increased with increasing weight (r = 0.488) and postconceptional age (r = 0.390). VT complexity, measured by base scale entropy, was greater with increased postnatal age (r = 0.428). Our results indicate that respiratory rhythms become more complex with increasing levels of maturity, as indicated by increased weight and several age parameters. This emphasizes the importance of the later weeks of gestation in the maturation of respiratory centers in the brain and suggests a promising use of entropy measures in exploring respiratory maturation in infants.

AB  - Endogenous cardiotonic steroids (CTS), also called digitalis-like factors, have been postulated to play important roles in health and disease for nearly half a century. Recent discoveries, which include the specific identification of endogenous cardenolide (endogenous ouabain) and bufadienolide (marinobufagenin) CTS in humans along with the delineation of an alternative mechanism by which CTS can signal through the Na +/K +-ATPase, have increased the interest in this field substantially. Although CTS were first considered important in the regulation of renal sodium transport and arterial pressure, more recent work implicates these hormones in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and fibrosis, the modulation of immunity and of carbohydrate metabolism, and the control of various central nervous functions and even behavior. This review focuses on the physiological interactions between CTS and other regulatory systems that may be important in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension, preeclampsia, endstage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Based on our increasing understanding of the regulation of CTS as well as the molecular mechanisms of these hormone increases, we also discuss potential therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in a spectrum of adverse developmental outcomes, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). This study evaluated deficits in sensory, motor and cognitive processing in children with FASD that can be identified using eye movement testing. Our study group was composed of 89 children aged 8-15 years with a diagnosis within the FASD spectrum [i.e. fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)], and 92 controls. Subjects looked either towards (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a peripheral target that appeared on a computer monitor, and eye movements were recorded with a mobile, video-based eye tracker. We hypothesized that: (i) differences in the magnitude of deficits in eye movement control exist across the three diagnostic subgroups; and (ii) children with FASD display a developmental delay in oculomotor control. Children with FASD had increased saccadic reaction times (SRTs), increased intra-subject variability in SRTs, and increased direction errors in both the prosaccade and antisaccade tasks. Although development was associated with improvements across tasks, children with FASD failed to achieve age-matched control levels of performance at any of the ages tested. Moreover, children with ARND had faster SRTs and made fewer direction errors in the antisaccade task than children with pFAS or FAS, although all subgroups were different from controls. Our results demonstrate that eye tracking can be used as an objective measure of brain injury in FASD, revealing behavioral deficits in all three diagnostic subgroups independent of facial dysmorphology. © 2009 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell.

AB  - The existence of generic medicines promotes the availability of medicines at a price lower than the original product. Pharmacological studies have only to prove that the generic product is bio-equivalent to the original medicine before registration and no clinical trials to prove efficacy and safety are required. Once a generic medicine is registered, the price will be determined by market forces, which may drive down the price of similar products, including the innovator medicine. Several new generics were launched in 2008, some of which were the first generic for the original product. The policy on generic substitution requires the dispenser to inform the patient of the availability of a generic alternative where the originator product has been prescribed, thus all dispensers must be aware of the existence of these new generics. This review looks at the first generics for originator products launched in 2008. Prices quoted are the single exit price inclusive of VAT, taken from Mims October 2008.

AB  - Varenicline is a recently developed medication for smoking cessation, which has been available on prescription since 2006. It is a selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, and is designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms and to lessen the rewards of continued smoking. Our objective in this article is to assess the efficacy of varenicline as an aid to smoking cessation and to weigh the potential benefits against the possible risks. We identified ten randomized controlled trials and one cohort study with historical controls. In total there were 7999 participants, 5112 of whom received varenicline. Eight of the trials compared varenicline with placebo for cessation, two compared it with nicotine replacement therapy and one tested extended use for relapse prevention. Three of the varenicline/placebo trials also included a bupropion arm. The recommended dosage of varenicline 1 mg twice daily more than doubled the chances of quitting at 6 months or longer, with a relative risk (RR) compared with placebo of 2.38 (95% CI 2.00, 2.84). It also outperformed bupropion (RR 1.52 [95% CI 1.22, 1.88]) and nicotine replacement (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.01, 1.71]). A reduced dosage regimen of 1 mg daily also increased cessation (RR 1.88 [95% CI 1.35, 2.60]). In the trials, varenicline significantly reduced craving and other withdrawal symptoms. The most frequent adverse event was nausea, occurring in 30-40% of varenicline users. However, this was generally reported at mild to moderate levels, diminished over time and was associated with attributable discontinuation rates of between 0.6% and 7.6%. Other commonly occurring adverse events included insomnia, abnormal dreams and headache. Serious adverse events were rare, with no treatment-related deaths during the treatment or follow-up phases. Postmarketing surveillance has raised new questions about the safety of varenicline. In February 2008, the US FDA issued a public health advisory note, reporting a possible association between varenicline and an increased risk of behaviour change, agitation, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. They have required the manufacturers to revise the labelling of varenicline and the Summary of Product Characteristics, and to issue a medication guide. It is arguable that much of the reported behavioural and mood changes may be associated with nicotine withdrawal, although some effects occurred in people who continued to smoke while taking the medication. In view of the potential, if unproven, risk that varenicline may be associated with serious neuropsychiatric adverse outcomes, patients attempting to quit smoking with varenicline, and their families and caregivers, should be alerted about the need to monitor for neuropsychiatric symptoms, including changes in behaviour, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour, and to report such symptoms immediately to the patient's healthcare provider. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Decreased GABAergic signaling is among the more robust pathologies observed postmortem in schizophrenia; however, the functional consequences of this deficit are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate, in a verified animal model of schizophrenia, that a reduced expression of parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons is correlated with a reduction in coordinated neuronal activity during task performance in freely moving rats. More specifically, methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)-treated rats display a decreased density of parvalbumin-positive interneurons throughout the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral (but not dorsal) subiculum of the hippocampus. Furthermore, the reduction in interneuron functionality is correlated with a significantly reduced gamma-band response to a conditioned tone during a latent inhibition paradigm. Finally, deficits in mPFC and ventral hippocampal oscillatory activity are associated with an impaired behavioral expression of latent inhibition in MAM-treated rats. Thus, we propose that a decrease in intrinsic GABAergic signaling may be responsible, at least in part, for the prefrontal and hippocampal hypofunctionality observed during task performance, which is consistently observed in animal models as well as in schizophrenia in humans. In addition, a deficit in intrinsic GABAergic signaling may be the origin of the hippocampal hyperactivity purported to underlie the dopamine dysfunction in psychosis. Such information is central to gaining a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology and alternate pharmacotherapeutic approaches. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.

AB  - Possible prevention of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure has been investigated using peptides that were previously shown to be involved in neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo. I focused in this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects of one of these peptides with regard to the determination of the downstream signaling pathways involved in neuroprotection. This peptide with the sequence NAPVSIPQ, known as NAP, a fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, demonstrated a potent protective effect against oxidative stress associated with alcohol exposure. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched C57BL/6 pregnant females were assigned the following groups: (1) Ethanol liquid diet group (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethano-derived calories, (2) Pair-fed (PF) control group (3) Chow control group, (4) treatment groups with alcohol alongside i.p. injections of d-NAP (ALC/d-NAP, 20 or 30 μg/20 g body weight), (5) PF/d-NAP control group. On E13, fetal brains were collected and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, caspase-3 colorimetric assay and ELISA for cytochrome c detection. My results show that NAP significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of the fetal brain. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP administration significantly prevented alcohol-induced increases in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium cingulate cortex and basal ganglia eminence. The investigation of downstream signaling pathways involving NAP neuroprotection revealed that this peptide significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in the concentrations of caspase-3 in E13 fetal brains. Moreover, ELISA for cytochrome c shows that NAP significantly prevented both alcohol-induced increases in the level of cytosolic cytochrome c and alcohol-induced decreases in the level of mitochondrial cytochrome c. These data provide an understanding of NAP intracellular target, and the downstream mechanisms of action that will pave a path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during prenatal stages. © 2009 IBRO.

AB  - This paper describes a possible framework of hormones and their binding proteins (BPs) that might be responsible for the increased incidence of depression in women, including postnatal depression. It is based on three reported facts: Increased cortisol exposure reduces growth hormone (GH) secretion. Cortisol and GH show opposite effects on mood. Liver secretion of various hormone binding proteins is increased under estrogen exposure. If we accept that pure cortisol exposure leads to depressive mood, while simultaneous brain exposure to cortisol and an anabolic (growth hormone or somatomammotropin) is less mood affecting, the occurrence of depression an be more likely in persons: with altered sleep patterns and thus reduced GH secretion, in individuals with increased chronic cortisol exposure (any individual under repeated or sustained stress, older individuals with stressful memories, etc.). The proposed mechanism can be enhanced in women of reproductive age through increased transcortin and GH BP pools due to estrogen action on liver. A particularly vulnerable phase seems to be the early postnatal period, when sudden discontinuation of somatomammotropin anabolic actions might lead to postnatal depression that takes weeks or months to resolve, until the GH/cortisol circadian rhythm normalization. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether 2-hour and 4-hour urinary proteins correlate with 24-hour proteinuria in patients with preeclampsia. Study design: Protein estimation was done from 2-hour, 4-hour, and 24-hour urine samples in 50 women with preeclampsia and the results were compared. Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the mean protein excretion when comparing the 2-hour values with the 24-hour and further comparing 4-hour values with the 24-hour value. The values of 2-hour and 4-hour urine proteins in total volume (TV) correlated well with 24-hour value for mild & severe disease (p < 0.001). Amount of the protein excretion in 2-hour and 4-hour samples predicted mild preeclampsia with positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 80%. NPV of both the samples for severe preeclampsia was 100%. Conclusion: 2-hour and 4-hour proteinuria can be used for initial assessment of preeclampsia thereby avoiding the inconvenience and delay in treatment. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Prenatal environment exerts profound influences on the development of an organism and stressful events during pregnancy can bring about long-term physiological/behavioral alterations in the offspring. Epidemiological evidence points to a relationship between intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), body weight at birth, and adult cardiovascular disease. Experimental research employed different models of IUGR, including altered maternal nutrition, exposure to elevated glucocorticoids, and reduced placental perfusion, all of which can program, when acting during sensitive temporal windows of foetal life, alterations in cardiovascular regulation and stress sensitivity. Original data are presented indicating that prenatal psychological stress (intermittent restraint) does not induce in the rat adult offspring changes of plasma corticosterone levels, cardiac autonomic modulation, and circadian rhythmicity of heart rate (HR), body temperature (T) and physical activity (Act) at rest. However, prenatally stressed rats - when further stimulated in adulthood - exhibit prolonged adrenocortical stress responsivity, disturbed circadian rhythmicity of HR, T, and Act, and increased adrenal weight. This evidence supports the idea that prenatal stress per se does not change dramatically a given structure or function, but it affects resilience and renders the animal more susceptible to pathophysiological outcomes when further insults occur during adulthood. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pax4 is a homeobox gene that is known to be involved in embryonic development of the endocrine pancreas. In this tissue, Pax4 counters the effects of the related protein, Pax6. Pax6 is essential for development of the pineal gland. In this study we report that Pax4 is strongly expressed in the pineal gland and retina of the rat. Pineal Pax4 transcripts are low in the fetus and increase postnatally; Pax6 exhibits an inverse pattern of expression, being more strongly expressed in the fetus. In the adult the abundance of Pax4 mRNA exhibits a diurnal rhythm in the pineal gland with maximal levels occurring late during the light period. Sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland by superior cervical ganglionectomy prevents the nocturnal decrease in pineal Pax4 mRNA. At night the pineal gland is adrenergically stimulated by release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic innervation; here, we found that treatment with adrenergic agonists suppresses pineal Pax4 expression in vivo and in vitro. This suppression appears to be mediated by cAMP, a second messenger of norepinephrine in the pineal gland, based on the observation that treatment with a cAMP mimic reduces pineal Pax4 mRNA levels. These findings suggest that the nocturnal decrease in pineal Pax4 mRNA is controlled by the sympathetic neural pathway that controls pineal function acting via an adrenergic-cAMP mechanism. The daily changes in Pax4 expression may influence gene expression in the pineal gland. Copyright © 2009 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Background: The ideal obstetric analgesia should provide analgesic efficacy without attenuation of uterine contractions. Aims: To compare the outcome of intramuscular administration of pethidine and tramadol in labour analgesia. Methods: One hundred and sixty full-term parturients were randomly assigned to two equal groups in active labour. Group P received 50 mg pethidine; and group T, 100 mg tramadol intramuscularly. Primary outcome measure was the duration of the labour. The analgesic efficacy, maternal side-effects, mode of delivery, maternal satisfaction and Apgar score as the secondary outcome were assessed. Results: The duration of labour was shorter in group T, for first stage (190 vs 140 min; P < 0.0001) and for second stage (33 vs 25 min; P = 0.001). There were no differences in Groups P and T with respect to median (7 vs 8) and maximum (7.5 vs 8) visual analog scores (VAS) for pain at 10 min and one hour after drug administration. Women in group P had lower VAS pain scores than those in group T in the second stage of labour (8 vs 9; P = 0/009). There was a significantly higher incidence of nausea and vomiting (35% vs 15%; P = 0.003) and drowsiness (80% vs 29%; P < 0.0001) in group P. Conclusion: Both 100 mg tramadol and 50 mg pethidine provide moderate analgesia in first stage of labour. Tramadol seems to cause a shorter duration of labour and lower incidence of maternal side-effects. However, its analgesic efficacy was not found to be as effective as pethidine, especially in the second stage of labour.

AB  - Background: The decrease of maternal docosahexaenoic (DHA) status during pregnancy has been associated with postpartum depression, especially in women with a low intake of DHA. Since the DHA intake in the Netherlands is low, we investigated whether supplementation of low doses of DHA or DHA plus arachidonic acid (AA) during pregnancy and lactation could prevent depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in this period. Methods: Women were supplemented daily with placebo, DHA (220 mg) or DHA + AA (220 mg each) from week 16 of pregnancy till three months postpartum. Fatty acid analyses were performed in the available plasma samples at 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Depressive symptoms were measured in weeks 16 and 36 of pregnancy and six weeks postpartum using EPDS and within one week postpartum using a blues questionnaire. Results: 119 women completed the study. The average frequency of fish intake was low, 0.94 times per week, and did not differ between the groups. The supplementation groups did not differ in mean EPDS scores or changes in EPDS scores, nor in incidence or severity of postpartum blues. Red blood cell DHA, AA and DHA/AA ratio did not correlate with EPDS or blues scores. Indices of sleep quality did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: Supplementation of 220 mg/day DHA or DHA + AA (220 mg/day each) does not prevent peri-partum depressive symptoms, in a population based sample with low background DHA intake.

AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is mainly due to a pathologic slow-down in the fetal growth pace, resulting in a fetus that is unable to reach its growth potential. IUGR frequency will vary depending on the discrimination criteria adopted. It is extremely important to use local or national fetal growth graphs in order to avoid some confounding factors. IUGR incidence in newborns would be between 3% and 7% of the total population. In our experience it is 5.13%, a figure similar to the one obtained by other authors but with a progressively higher incidence during the lost decade. There are multiple maternal factors that can generally be grouped into constitutional and general factors given that they affect age, weight, race, maternal cardiac volume, etc, socioeconomic factors with key incidence in the mother's nutrition level, where a poor maternal nutrition level would be the key factor in this group. We have evaluated multiple factors as possible contributors to the IUGR risk: race, parents' age, mother's height (cm), mother's birth weight and before pregnancy (kq), ponderal gain and blood pressure during pregnancy, and previous SGA newborns. Socioeconomic factors like social class, parents' profession, habitual residence, salary, immigration, and diet were also evaluated. We also included variables such as total daily working time and time mothers spent standing up, daily sleeping time (hrs), stress self-perception test at work and primiparity age. Toxic factors during pregnancy: tobacco (active and passive), alcohol, drugs and coffee consumption. Fetal or utero-placental factors were considered. In our study, the most significant etiologic factors were: Active and passive tobacco consuming, mother's stress level, increase of total months worked during pregnancy, total daily working hours and time mothers spent standing up and finally, the parent's height. Our data support the main objective of reducing the incidence of SGA newborns after IUGR by fighting against tobacco from all fields, including the passive smoking habit, and improving the laboral conditions of the pregnant mother, lowering the number of daily hours worked, the physical activity and trying to avoid and to cope with stressful situations.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine the quality of life (QoL) and related factors in women in a 12-month postpartum period. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to ascertain the factors related to QoL of postpartim women in Konya city, Turkey. Participants of the study consisted of 1749 first-year postpartum women. Main outcome measures were Quality of Life Scale and factors potentially related to postpartum QoL. Results: It was found that being over the age of 35 years, having a spouse with a low level of education, having a low income, having a large number of children, not having social support from the spouse or other family members and not having time to rest or sleep were related to QoL. Conclusions: The QoL of postpartum women is related not only to sociodemographic and fertility characteristics, but also to the degree that social support is available and a woman's ability to find time for herself to rest and sleep. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - The sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year of age that is typically associated with sleep and that remains unexplained after a complete autopsy and death scene investigation. A leading hypothesis about its pathogenesis is that many cases result from defects in brainstem-mediated protective responses to homeostatic stressors occurring during sleep in a critical developmental period. Here we review the evidence for the brainstem hypothesis in SIDS with a focus upon abnormalities related to the neurotransmitter serotonin in the medulla oblongata, as these are the most robust pathologic findings to date. In this context, we synthesize the human autopsy data with genetic, whole-animal, and cellular data concerning the function and development of the medullary serotonergic system. These emerging data suggest an important underlying mechanism in SIDS that may help lead to identification of infants at risk and specific interventions to prevent death.

AB  - Metformin is an insulin sensitizer widely used for the treatment of patients affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because many women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are insulin resistant, metformin was introduced in clinical practice to treat these patients also. Moreover, metformin's effect has other targets beside its insulin-sensitizing action. The present review was aimed at describing all evidence-based and potential uses of metformin in PCOS patients. In particular, we will analyze the uses of metformin not only for the treatment of all PCOS-related disturbances such as menstrual disorders, anovulatory infertility, increased abortion, or complicated pregnancy risk, hyperandrogenism, endometrial, metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities, but also for the prevention of the syndrome.

AB  - Background: Acute uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections in women and is conventionally treated with antibiotics. However, emergence of resistant uropathogens forces physicians to reconsider the prescription of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated cystitis in non-pregnant young women. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis. Methods: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus database. Results: Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving non-pregnant, non-immunocompromised adult women with clinically and microbiologically documented acute uncomplicated cystitis were included. Clinical success was significantly more likely in women treated with antibiotics versus those treated with placebo [4 RCTs, 1062 patients, random effects model (REM), odds ratio (OR) = 4.81, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 2.51-9.21]. Antibiotics were also superior to placebo, regarding cure (4 RCTs, 1062 patients, REM, OR = 4.67, 95%CI = 2.34-9.35); microbiological eradication at the end of treatment (3 RCTs, 967 patients, REM, OR = 10.67, 95%CI = 2.96-38.43); after the end of treatment (3 RCTs, 738 patients, REM, OR = 5.38, 95%CI = 1.63-17.77), and microbiological reinfection or relapse (5 RCTs, 843 patients, REM, OR = 0.27, 95%CI = 0.13-0.55). However, adverse events were more likely to occur in antibiotic-treated patients versus placebo-treated women (4 RCTs, 1068 patients, REM, OR = 1.64, 95%CI = 1.10-2.44). No difference was found between the compared treatment arms regarding study withdrawals from adverse events, the development of pyelonephritis and emergence of resistance. Conclusion: Antibiotics are superior to placebo regarding both clinical and microbiological success in adult non-pregnant women with microbiologically confirmed acute uncomplicated cystitis. However, they are associated with more adverse events. © 2009 The British Infection Society.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder of the central nervous system. It is characterized by an irresistible urge or need to move the limbs that occurs as a result of uncomfortable limb sensations. Although RLS usually starts in the legs, it can spread to other parts of the body, such as the arms or torso. RLS sufferings often describe the disorder as feeling like water flowing inside the legs, "bugs in the bones," or electricity in the legs. These symptoms may be present all day, but usually worsen during periods, of inactivity and in the evening. People with RLS usually must move their limbs for complete or partial relief of the uncomfortable sensations. At night, RLS often is associated with periodic limb movements (PLMs), which can cause sleep problems and also make it difficult to perform sedimentary activities such as sitting comfortably in a car or on an airplane for extended periods. The cause of RLS remains unclear, but research suggests that impaired dopamine activity in the brain due to iron insufficiency may induce RLS in people with a genetic predisposition. RLS can be classified as primary or as secondary due to another medical condition, such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or pregnancy. Dopamine agonists like ropirinole and pramipexole are first-line therapy for RLS with daily smptoms. Alternative therapies are available for refractory cases or persistent symptoms. This article explores the prevalence, etiolog, and diagnosis of RLS as well as available treatments.

AB  - Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (NIC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to studygenetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects. © The Author 2008.

AB  - During the period March 1, 1998 to January 14, 2007, approximately 6 million doses of Anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) vaccine were administered. As of January 16, 2007, 4753 reports of adverse events following receipt of AVA vaccination had been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Taken together, reports to VAERS did not definitively link any serious unexpected risk to this vaccine, and review of death and serious reports did not show a distinctive pattern indicative of a causal relationship to AVA vaccination. Continued monitoring of VAERS and analysis of potential associations between AVA vaccination and rare, serious events is warranted.

AB  - Circadian clock governs daily rhythmicity of a number of physiological processes such as reproductive functions. The existence of circadian clocks in the placenta is not clearly established. In order to investigate whether human placenta may function as circadian oscillator, we utilized HTR-8/SVneo cells derived from human first-trimester trophoblast. In serum-shocked cells we found circadian expressions for the clock genes Per2 and Dec1 as well as for Dbp, a canonical clock-controlled gene. We obtained similar results for Vegf, a circadian output involved in the control of placental vasculogenesis and trophoblast functions. Interestingly, circadian oscillations persisted and even enhanced in cells experimentally rendered hypoxic with CoCl2. These results could be explained since the hypoxic milieu of the first-trimester placenta is considered the optimal condition for normal placentation. These data collectively support a possible role for the differential rhythmic expression of Vegf, influenced by circadian clock, in the adjustment of placental vascularization and trophoblast functions to the specific requirements of the different gestational ages. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Diesel exhaust (DE) is composed of particles and gaseous compounds. It has been reported that DE causes pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. We have previously reported that fetal exposure to DE had deleterious effects to the reproductive system of mice offspring. However, there is still little known about the effects of prenatal exposure to DE to the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we found that prenatal exposure to DE induced reduction of locomotion, furthermore, dopamine (DA) turnover was significantly decreased in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to DE has an effect on the CNS. Hypolocomotion could be due to a decrease in DA turnover associated with DA nervous system abnormality. The present study provides the possibility that maternally inhaled DE might influence the development of central dopaminergic system and result in behavior disorder. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The circadian oscillator is generated within the suprachiasmatic nuclei and synchronizes circadian clocks in numerous peripheral tissues. The molecular basis is composed of a number of genes and proteins that form transcriptional and translational feedback loops. Such molecular oscillators are also operative in peripheral tissues, including in the uterus. Although ovarian steroids regulate the function of uterine endometrial stromal cells, the modulation of ovarian steroids on the circadian rhythms remains unknown. Here we investigate the possibility that estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) modulate the circadian oscillator of the stromal cells. The study using transgenic rats constructed with Period 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase (Per2-dLuc) gene, with the real-time monitoring system of Per2-dLuc oscillation. The stromal cells displayed constant Per2-dLuc oscillation after treatment with dexamethasone, suggesting that the circadian oscillator is operative. However, the circadian oscillator was disrupted by in vivo administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) following equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), although it was altered into a rhythmic pattern 4 days later following hCG. Chronic treatment with P4 induced constant Per2-dLuc oscillation in the stromal cells from eCG-treated immature and pregnant rats, whereas E2 did not promote such a rhythmic Per2-dLuc oscillation. Collectively, P4 synchronizes the circadian oscillator of the uterus endometrial stromal cells through transcriptional and translational feedback loops of the clockwork system. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.

Methods for dating the stages in this temporal organisation have advanced and the genetics approach to the circadian cycle is dominated by studies of the maturation of the awake-asleep cycle. Disease involves the functional regression to one of the different stages of genesis or alternatively will involve a pathological lesion. Circadian dysfunction is characterised by loss of amplitude and multi-day fragmentation, correction of which requires control of multi-day pressure and within-day stabilisation. © 2009 L'Encéphale.

AB  - This was a nationwide study of sleep circadian in term infants. The aim was to understand the development characteristics of infants' sleep/wake patterns longitudinally in their own home environments over the first 12 months of life. Totally 524 healthy term infants from 9 urban districts took part in this project Their sleep/wake patterns over 24 h were recorded using parental sleep diaries, from the 2nd day to 12 months old. The results showed that infant daytime sleep changed significantly at 0-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 8-9 months after birth, and the change was the fastest in the first month, the mean percentage of daytime sleep decreased from 82.4% at Day 2 to 62.8% at 1 month old. Also, the average number of naps reduced from 3.7 to 2 across the infancy. The ability of continuous sleep throughout the night gradually enhanced from 1 month old, and the nocturnal longest sleep time extended to 6.8 h at 4 months of age as well as the nighttime awakening frequency less than 0.5 over 6 months old. Additionally, the nighttime sleep increased significantly at 4 and 9 months after birth, where the proportion of nighttime sleep increased from 55.8% at Day 2 to 64.3% of 4 months and 71.2% of 9 months respectively. In general, the total sleep time over a 24 h period presented a downward trend as the infant aged. The periods 0-6 and 8-9 months after birth were the key periods for the development of infant sleep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate light exposure is critical for entraining circadian rhythms, regulating sleep-wake cycles, and maintaining optimal mood. Yet, few studies have reported normative data on light exposure experiences in postpartum women and young infants; none has examined the two simultaneously. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this pilot study was to document the 24-h light exposure experiences in postpartum women and their infants. DESIGN: An intensive within-subject design was employed. SETTINGS: The participant's natural home environment. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited from the general community in Seattle, USA. Two mother-infant pairs did not have complete data, resulting in a final sample size of 22 (12 female infants). METHODS: Mothers and infants wore a monitor to continuously record illumination levels for 7 days. Data were aggregated within subject to calculate summary measures of illumination exposure. Circadian patterns of light were examined using cosinor analysis. Pearson correlation was used to examine the relation between maternal and infant light exposure. RESULTS: Mothers spent 71.13 +/- 11.58% and infants spent 80.07 +/- 8.27% of their daytime hours (defined as 06:00-21:59) in an illumination level <50 lux. Mean minutes >1000 lux per day was 54 +/- 39 for mothers and 23 +/- 18 for infants. Maternal and infant light exposure exhibited a modest circadian pattern and a strong correlation, both in the timing of peak illumination exposure (r = 0.93, p < 0.01) and in the level of light exposure (r = 0.7 0 +/- 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Postpartum women and infants experience low ambient light levels with short periods of bright light during the day. Whether this level of light is sufficient for optimal postpartum mood and infant circadian entrainment warrants further investigation. If higher levels of light were indeed necessary for postpartum women and young infants, increasing ambient light levels through the use of natural sunlight (i.e., walking outdoors) could be a simple and economic nursing intervention. The strong pattern synchrony between maternal and infant light exposure suggests that mothers play the primary role in providing a lighting environment suitable for infants to synchronize their circadian rhythms to a 24-h day.

AB  - Background: The circadian variation in biologic rhythm has been known to affect labour pain. The duration of action of ropivacaine or fentanyl used in treatment of labour pain has been demonstrated to vary with different times of the day. The aim of this study is to find whether the need for epidural supplementation for breakthrough pain is significantly affected by the time of day, in patients who are on a continuous epidural infusion of these drugs. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, parturients with spontaneous onset of labour were given a combined spinal-epidural technique with spinal ropivacaine 2 mg + fentanyl 15 μg followed by an epidural infusion of ropivacaine 0.1-0.125% with fentanyl 2 μg/mL at 10 mL/hour. A total of 1657 patients were divided into four groups: (1) morning: analgesia request: 7:01 to 13:00, delivery before 19:00; (2) afternoon: analgesia request: 13:01 to 19:00, delivery before 1:00; (3) evening: analgesia request: 19:01 to 1:00, delivery before 7:00 and (4) night: analgesia request: 1:00 to 7:00, delivery before 13:00. Pain scores before epidural analgesia, need for additional epidural supplementation, side effects and patient satisfaction scores were compared between the groups. Results: The pain scores before epidural analgesia were significantly higher in evening and night groups than in morning and afternoon groups (6.95 ± 2.4, 7.38 ± 2.2 compared to 6.67 ± 2.5, 6.49 ± 2.7 respectively, P < 0.001). Incidence of breakthrough pain, side effects and parturient satisfaction scores were not significantly different between groups. Conclusion: Parturients with labour onset and neuraxial analgesia request in the evening and night experienced higher pain scores. However, no significant differences in the incidence of breakthrough pain or the quality of analgesia were observed with the provision of commonly used concentrations of ropivacaine with fentanyl via continuous epidural infusion. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pax4 is a homeobox gene encoding Pax4, a transcription factor that is essential for embryonic development of the endocrine pancreas. In the pancreas, Pax4 counters the effects of the related transcription factor, Pax6, which is known to be essential for eye morphogenesis. In this study, we have discovered that Pax4 is strongly expressed in retinal photoreceptors of the rat. Pax4 expression is not detectable in the foetal eye; however, postnatal Pax4 transcript levels rapidly increase. In contrast, Pax6 exhibits an inverse developmental pattern of expression being more strongly expressed in the foetal eye. Histological analysis revealed that Pax4 mRNA is exclusively expressed in the retinal photoreceptors, whereas Pax6 mRNA and protein are present in the inner nuclear layer and in the ganglion cell layer of the mature retina. In the adult retina, Pax4 transcripts exhibit a diurnal rhythm with maximal levels occurring during the light period, whereas retinal Pax6 transcript levels do not change throughout the day. The daily changes in Pax4 expression may contribute to daily changes in function in the differentiated retinal photoreceptor. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Pregnancy is associated with many physiologic and hormonal changes along with changes in sleep architecture, placing pregnant women at risk for the development of sleep-disordered breathing or worsening of preexisting sleep apnea. Snoring, the most common symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is markedly increased during pregnancy. The exact prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women is unknown. Because the apneic episodes are commonly associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturations, the combination of obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy can be potentially harmful to the fetus given the low oxygen reserves during pregnancy. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension among the general population, and this raises the possibility of its association with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In this clinical review, we discuss the physiologic changes of pregnancy that predispose pregnant women to the development of obstructive sleep apnea and the effects of sleep-disordered breathing on pregnancy outcomes. We also review the recommendations regarding evaluation for sleep apnea and treatment options during pregnancy and postpartum.

AB  - Childlessness is becoming more common and it is estimated that around one in five women of childbearing age will not have children in the UK.1 The average age of a woman giving birth is 29 years2 and, as more women delay motherhood, either until they feel ready or until they meet the right partner, the risk of leaving it too late to conceive grows. Fertility treatment is often seen as a solution for older women who want children of their own. Of course, no one wants to have treatment in order to conceive but, if getting pregnant naturally is not easy, fertility treatment is seen as a way to overcome this. It is too frequently assumed that anyone who can afford treatment and who perseveres will eventually have a child of their own. We hear very little about in vitro fertilisation (IVF) failure. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority publishes IVF success rates and there is rarely any focus on the fact that the current average success rate, which is not far above 20% per cycle,3 means that more than 75% of cycles will fail. Cumulative success rates suggest that many more couples will succeed if they can continue with treatment but not everyone will be able to afford this financially or emotionally. Unrealistic expectations Despite the figures, the idea that IVF can beat the biological clock remains, and fertility treatment is often seen as a solution for having left it ‘too late’ to conceive naturally. © 2009 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

AB  - Pseudopregnancy (PSP) is a neuroendocrine reflex triggered by vaginocervical stimulation similar to the neuroendocrine response of early pregnancy and is characterised by short-term neural activity, resulting in long-term neuroendocrine responses that cause repeated release of pituitary prolactin (PRL) over many days. PSP is a useful model to study how somatosensory input is transduced in the brain into neuroendocrine responses, and has been extensively characterised in rats. With increasing use of mice as an experimental model, however, and to allow use of transgenic mice to investigate mechanisms of this sensory response, it is important to characterise the principal neuroendocrine response of pseudopregnancy in this species. The present study aimed to examine the induction and neuroendocrine responses of PSP in mice using vasectomised stud males, to investigate mating-induced changes in vaginal cytology, uterine growth, and PRL secretion, and to map certain aspects of somatosensory transduction by assessing the neural activity marker FOS. Unlike the induction of pseudopregnancy in rats, which can be induced simply by multiple intromissions from a male or artificial mechanical stimulation of the cervix, PSP induction in mice required the receipt of an ejaculation from a male. In mice that received PSP-inducible mating stimuli, FOS expression was observed in a slightly different range of brain regions than has been observed in rats, with increases in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, and ventromedial hypothalamus, but not in limbic areas examined. Moreover, PSP mice expressed a single diurnal PRL surge on day 6 of PSP. Thus, the data demonstrate important species differences in the neuroendocrine mechanisms activated in response to a mating stimulus in mice compared with rats. A clear understanding of the species-specific response will be required in interpreting research into the reproductive biology of this species. © 2008 The Author.

AB  - Objective: To explore women's levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of pregnancy. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample. Participants: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell's Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire. Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women. Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women's fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women's emotional experiences during pregnancy. © 2009 AWHONN.

AB  - Objective: Down syndrome (DS) affects 1/800 infants. Prenatal NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) (NAP+SAL) prevent developmental delay in Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of DS. We investigated whether this finding involves N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits. Study Design: Pregnant Ts65Dn mice were treated with placebo or NAP+SAL on gestational days 8-12. After developmental delay prevention was shown, 4 trisomic (Ts), 4 control, and 3 Ts+NAP+SAL adult offspring brains (from 3 litters) were collected. Calibrator-normalized real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subunits NR2A and NR2B, and for GABA subunits GABAAα5 and GABAAβ3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistics included analysis of variance and Fisher PLSD with P &lt; .05 as significant. Results: NR2A, NR2B, and GABAAβ3 levels were decreased in Ts vs control (all P &lt; .05). Prenatal NAP+SAL increased NR2A, NR2B, and GABAAβ3 to levels similar to control (all P &lt; .05). A significant difference in GABAAα5 levels was not found. Conclusion: Prenatal NAP+SAL increases NR2A, NR2B, and GABAAβ3 expression in adult DS mice to levels similar to controls. This may explain how NAP+SAL improve developmental milestone achievement. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Sleep quality seems to be an antecedent to depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms. Methods: Each of the 252 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep quality measure at mid and late pregnancy. Results: PSQI total scores showed good internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors. Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the PSQI is useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early pregnancy. © 2009 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

AB  - An approach combining time-continuous nonlinear stability analysis and a parametric bispectral method was introduced to better describe cortical activation and deactivation patterns in the immature fetal electroencephalogram (EEG). Signal models and data-driven investigations were performed to find optimal parameters of the nonlinear methods and to confirm the occurrence of nonlinear sections in the fetal EEG. The resulting measures were applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation when organized sleep states were not developed and compared to previous results at 0.9 gestation. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already at this early gestational age, suggesting the presence of premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature sleep states associated with nonrapid eye movement sleep later in gestation. Thus, the combined nonlinear and time-variant approach was able to provide important insights into the properties of the immature fetal ECoG. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Sleep-associated movement disorders are a broad group of sleep disorders characterized by involuntary movements that may disrupt sleep. Relatively little is known about the clinical consequences of sleep-associated movement disorders on cardiovascular health. Because these disorders manifest mostly during sleep, recognizing a movement disorder can be particularly difficult. Nevertheless, patients can have frequent arousals and suffer from similar sleep deprivation, fragmentation, and autonomic disruption as occurs in sleep-disordered breathing. Subsequently, these disorders may have a serious impact on daytime function and perception of health in patients with chronic heart failure. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Study Objectives: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomno-graphic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol. Interventions: N/A. Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211 ± 6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475 ± 7,990 pg/mL, P < 0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P < 0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P < 0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin. Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

AB  - With up to 80% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), it is critical to have a graded scale of its severity as a guide for appropriate treatment. In 2002 we introduced the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) scoring system, which assessed the severity of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) based on three physical symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and retching over the previous 12 hours. We present here validation of an extension of the original PUQE, by assessing NVP over 24 hours. This extension is deemed more clinically relevant, because assessment of symptoms over only 12 hours may encompass sleeping hours and hence may not adequately capture the length and severity of the symptoms. In this study we assessed the external validity of the new PUQE-24 by examining its ability to evaluate several characteristics associated with NVP: (a) ability to take multivitamin supplements; (b) rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits for severe symptoms; (c) sleep patterns; (d) liquid intake; and (e) the woman's self-rated well-being scores. Data collected prospectively from 315 women counselled via the Motherisk NVP line were used for the validation. PUQE-24 showed strong correlation with all parameters examined except for sleep patterns and hydration status. The well-being score, however, correlated significantly with hydration status. Capturing 24 hours rather than 12 hours of symptoms may better direct management of NVP and predict its outcome. © 2009 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - Pregnant black depressed women were compared to pregnant black non-depressed women on self-report stress measures and cortisol levels at mid and late pregnancy and on neonatal outcomes. The depressed women had higher anxiety, anger, daily hassles, sleep disturbance scores and cortisol levels at both prenatal visits. These higher stress levels may have contributed to the greater incidence of prematurity and low birthweight neonatal outcomes noted in the depressed group, and they may partially explain the higher rate of prematurity and low birthweight among black women. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Study Objectives: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in children. Design: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term. Measurements and results: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency (≤ 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Poor sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size at birth.

AB  - To provide a convenient method for screening obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in pregnant women. Seventy-eight pregnant women with suspected OSAHS were calculated for the EP index using Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) with also measurement of the neck circumference (NC) and body mass index (BMI). The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated and the lowest SaO(2) (LSaO(2)) measured through a 7-h polysomnography (PSG). The women were then divided into 4 groups according to the AHI and LSaO(2). The ESS was compared with the PSG-AHI and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was generated. All the clinical indexes (NC, BMI, EP, AHI, and LSaO(2)) showed significant differences between the 4 groups (P<0.05). EP and PSG were found to have greater correlations to AHI (r=0.759, P=0.000) than NC (r=0.668) and BMI (r=0.663). The area under the ROC of the EP (0.825) was greater than that of NC (0.772) and BMI (0.784). The index of EP showed greater clinical diagnostic value of OSAHS in pregnancy. Base on the ROC, EP at the optimal operating point of 7.5 had a sensitivity of 76.8% and specificity of 68.2% for diagnosis of OSAHS in pregnant women. The ESS is an economic and convenient method for screening OSAHS in pregnant women with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Summary: Polymicrogyria is a congenital brain malformation characterized by abnormal cortical lamination, excessive cortical folding (smaller and more numerous gyri). It is a consequence of brain perfusion failure during pregnancy between the 20th and the 24th weeks of gestation. Their classification (bilateral versus unilateral malformation) has been greatly improved by brain MRI, and their localizations are more frequently in the perisylvian regions. Sporadic polymicrogyria are predominant, but some familial syndromes have been identified. Mental retardation, pyramidal signs and epilepsy are frequently reported. Specific epileptic syndrome such as electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep can occur and require adapted antiepileptic drugs. When medical treatment is not adequate, surgical therapy has to be considered. We reported a study of 12 children with unilateral polymicrogyria associated with epileptic seizures and continuous spikes and waves syndrome - not controlled by steroïds - and treated successfully by hemispherotomy. All but one were seizure-free after surgery, antiepileptic drugs were stopped, without increase of the preoperative deficit, global motricity, behavior as well as learning capacities were moreover improved.

AB  - Affective illness is common in women, and the puerperium is a time of particular vulnerability. Gender differences in the expression of affective disorders have been attributed to the impact of hormonal influence, socialization, and genetics. Dramatic fluctuations in gonadal hormones that occur following childbirth, influences the increased incidence of mood disorders during this time. Numerous tools including the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale can be used to screen for depression during pregnancy and postpartum. While screening tools may assist with appropriately identifying women who should be further assessed, their use alone does not significantly increase treatment seeking in women, even when their providers are notified about risk. Many studies demonstrate that only a small number (18%) of women who meet criteria for major depressive disorder seek treatment during pregnancy and postpartum. Additionally, common symptoms of depression (sleep, energy and appetite change) may be misinterpreted as normative experiences ofpregnancy. Treatment engagement is important as untreated depression during pregnancy may have unfavorable outcomes for both women and children. Complications of pregnancy associated with depression include: inadequate weight gain, under utilization of prenatal care, increased substance use, and premature birth. Human studies demonstrate that perceived life-event stress, as well as depression and anxiety predicted lower birth weight, decreased Apgar scores, and smaller head circumference, and small for gestational age babies. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common clinical disorder occurring in 15% of deliveries, making it one of the most frequent conditions to complicate pregnancy. Risk factors include past personal or family history of depression, sing marital status, poor health functioning, lower SES, and alcohol use. Women who have a prior history of postpartum depression, particularly with features of bipolarity or psychosis may be at particularly high risk. © 2009 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB  - Nicotine occurs in tobacco smoke. It is a habit-forming substance and is prescribed by health professionals to assist smokers to quit smoking. It is rapidly absorbed from the lungs of smokers. It crosses the placenta and accumulates in the developing fetus. Nicotine induces formation of oxygen radicals and at the same time also reduces the antioxidant capacity of the lungs. Nicotine and the oxidants cause point mutations in the DNA molecule thereby changing the program that controls lung growth and maintenance of lung structure. The data available indicate that maternal nicotine exposure induces a persistent inhibition of glycolysis and a drastically increased AMP level. These metabolic changes are thought to contribute to the faster aging of the lungs of the offspring of mothers that are exposed to nicotine via the placenta and mother's milk. The lungs of these animals are more susceptible to damage as shown by the gradual deterioration of the lung parenchyma. The rapid metabolic and structural aging of the lungs of the animals exposed to nicotine via the placenta and mother's milk, and thus during phases of lung development characterized by rapid cell division, is likely due to ‘programming— induced by nicotine. Since varenicline, a partial nicotine agonist, has basically the same structure as nicotine, and also binds to acetylcholine receptors in competition with nicotine (but with largely the same effect), it is not advisable to use nicotine or varenicline during gestation and lactation. Furthermore, the use of individual vitamin supplements is also not advisable because of the negative impact on the program that controls maintenance of lung structural and functional integrity and aging. A more appropriate smoking cessation program will also include a mixture of antioxidant nutrients such as in tomato juice. © 2009, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, duration and risk factors for benign neonatal sleep myoclonus (BNSM) in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) treated with opioids or sedatives, compared with control infants. Methods: This is a single centre observational case control study. Seventy-eight near term and term infants with neonatal opiate abstinence syndrome confirmed by meconium analysis were included. Exclusion criteria were cerebral malformation, intracranial haemorrhage and perinatal asphyxia. The babies were assessed eight hourly with a modified Finnegan score that included sleep myoclonus. Seventy-eight infants not exposed to opiates during pregnancy, hospitalized for at least 14 days and matched for gestational age were used as controls. Results: The median gestational age was 38 1/7 (95% CI: 35 3/7-41 2/7) weeks, birth weight 2730 (95% CI: 1890-3600) g, umbilical artery pH 7.25 (CI 7.10-7.37) and Apgar score at 5 minutes 9 (95% CI: 7-10). The control infants did not differ in these characteristics. Sleep myoclonus was diagnosed in 52 (67%) of the infants with NAS and 2 (2.6%) of the controls (OR 26 [95% CI: 7-223], p &lt; 0.001). Myoclonus appeared as early as day 2 and as late as day 56 of life (median day 6) and lasted for 1 to 93 days (median 13 days). All infants had serum glucose &gt; 2.5 mmol/L at first occurrence. The neurological examinations as well as cerebral ultrasound scans were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) carried out in 18 infants showed no signs of epileptic activity. Conclusion: BNSM has a high incidence in infants with NAS. The diagnosis can be made clinically. In the absence of other neurological symptoms further investigations such as EEG are not necessary and anticonvulsive treatment is not indicated. © 2008 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The primary aim was to investigate the appropriateness (as outlined in the South African Acne Treatment Guideline1) for the prescription of systemic isotretinoin in the management and counselling of acne in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropole. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to patients receiving systemic isotretinoin by 30 community pharmacies. The response rate was 29.2% (57 respondents). Results: The acne medication history revealed that commercial brands of beauty products were used by 57.9% of respondents, topical benzoyl peroxide by 22.8%, and systemic cotrimoxazole by 19.3%. Only nine females used an oral contraceptive as acne treatment prior to isotretinoin. The average daily dose of isotretinoin was 44.2 (SD=16.9) mg. Half of the respondents received a suboptimal cumulative dosage of isotretinoin. The average prescribed duration of isotretinoin therapy was 6.2 months. Adequate counselling was received by only 57.9% of patients. A third of the patients who were able to fall pregnant received recommendations for contraception. Pregnancy tests were conducted in only two females. Just over 40% of patients reported a complete clearance of acne lesions. Conclusions: Many prescribers did not follow the recommendations for isotretinoin prescription. The counselling of patients regarding isotretinoin therapy was substandard, especially with respect to pregnancy prevention. © SAAFP.

The presence of MSAF has been recognized as being associated with adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes for centuries. Aristotle gave the substance the name meconium-arion, meaning “opium-like.” This may have been because the philosopher believed it induced fetal sleep, recognizing fetal deaths and neonatal depression as being associated with meconium. Conversely, the name may have arisen because processed opium is a black, tarry substance resembling meconium. Obstetricians and pediatricians have long recognized the relationship of MSAF with stillborn infants, abnormal fetal heart-rate (FHR) tracings, neonatal encephalopathy, respiratory distress, and an abnormal neurologic outcome in some survivors. Nevertheless, the vast majority of infants born through MSAF do not have apparent antenatal, intrapartum, or postnatal problems. Thus we have somewhat limited ability to predict and prognosticate from the presence of MSAF. Healthcare providers should be appropriately concerned about both MSAF and meconium-stained neonates who subsequently develop respiratory distress, the meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Despite the frequent occurrence of MSAF and MAS, there remains a distinct paucity of literature describing the neurological development of either children born through MSAF or those with MAS. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

AB  - The rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide problem affecting not only the developed world but also developing nations such as South Africa. Excess body fat deposition is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure and there are many genetic and environmental factors that can influence this balance. The present article will describe these factors and discuss the complex interaction between the environment and the human genome that may underlie the current obesity epidemic.

AB  - Pyogenic granuloma is a polypoidal capillary hemangioma that occurs on the skin and mucosal surface. Trauma, hormonal changes seen in pregnancy and use of the oral contraceptive pill have a role in its pathogenesis. Except for the oral cavity, involvement of gastrointestinal tract is quite rare and there are no reports of hypopharyngeal involvement. We report a case of hypopharyngeal pyogenic granuloma most likely secondary to prolonged nasogastric tube insertion in an immuno-compromised host. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period and it is important to examine interventions being used to educate new parents about caring for themselves and their newborns during this time. Objectives: To assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered by an educator to an individual or group on maternal/paternal and infant outcomes and health services, and whether the effects of structured postnatal education vary by length or type of intervention and by population. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2007), CINAHL (1982 to September 2007), ERIC (1966 to September 2007), HealthSTAR (1966 to September 2007), PsycINFO (1806 to September 2007), Sociological Abstracts (1974 to September 2007), ClinicalTrials.gov (August 2007), Current Controlled Trials (August 2007), Trialscentral.org (August 2007) and The National Research Register (August 2007). Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided by an educator to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post birth related to the care of an infant or of the family. We excluded studies of educational interventions for parents of infants in neonatal intensive care units. Data collection and analysis: Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Main results: We included 14 trials (2934 women) and excluded 24. Of the 14 included studies, education tested included: four on infant sleep enhancement, four on infant behaviour, two on general post-birth health, three on infant safety, and one on father involvement/skills with infants. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and/or participant accrual/loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only five were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses and these included the same two studies. Of these five meta-analyses, only one was found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect; education on sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more minutes of sleep in 24 hours (95% confidence interval 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. Authors' conclusions: The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborn infants remain unclear. Education on sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep although more and larger studies are needed to confirm this. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct clinical and molecular genetic analyses of the members of an extended family in Central Indiana with a high prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: From February 1, 2006, through August 31, 2008, we collected data from members of this family, which is of English descent. Genealogical methods were used to expand the family tree, and family members were screened with an RLS questionnaire. Telephone interviews and personal examinations were performed at Mayo Clinic and during a field trip to Central Indiana. Blood samples were collected for molecular genetic analysis. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted 1 year later. RESULTS: The family tree spans 7 generations with 88 living members, 30 of whom meet the criteria for diagnosis of RLS established by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Three affected family members also have Parkinson disease or essential tremor. The mode of RLS inheritance is compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern. The affected family members do not exhibit linkage to the 5 known RLS loci or mutations in the RLS susceptibility genes MEIS1 and BTBD9. CONCLUSION: Of 88 members of this single extended family in Central Indiana, 30 were diagnosed as having RLS. Because our analysis shows that the disease is not linked to any of the known RLS loci or risk-associated genes, we postulate that members of this family may carry a gene mutation in a novel genetic locus. © 2009 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

AB  - The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that major depression is the single greatest cause of years of life lost to disability worldwide (Global Health Forum for Research, 2008). In the United Kingdom, the cost of mental ill-health is currently estimated at £77 billion pounds, greater than heart disease and cancer combined. By 2020, the WHO predicts a 50% rise in child mental health disorders. The rise in mental health disorders may reflect the dramatic change in diet observed during the past century favouring mass food production coupled with a global decrease in fish and seafood consumption both during pregnancy and in children of school age. It is well established that polyunsaturated fatty acids are vital for the optimal development of both the brain and retina. They are abundant in the central nervous system and play a pivotal role in neurotransmission, serotonergic and dopaminergic function. The omega 3, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22: 6n-3) and the omega-6, Arachidonic Acid (AA; 20:4n6) are key components of cell membranes; they are required for normal brain structure and early visual development during pregnancy and infancy. Low maternal seafood consumption, that is less than 340 grams per week during pregnancy, is linked with higher scores of suboptimal outcome across a range of developmental measures in children. Furthermore, children with lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids are reported to have more temper tantrums, sleep disorders and behavioural problems than controls. This chapter discusses the role of nutrition in child and adolescent depression, with specific reference to essential fatty acids and brain function. An overview of specific comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ADHD) is provided along with clinical trial evidence of the efficacy and safety of dietary supplementation. The review concludes with an evaluation of nutritional trends as reflected in the blood profiles of patients with depression and ADHD. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have suggested that preterm birth with or without subsequent chronic lung disease is associated with reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and increased ventilation inhomogeneity in the neonatal period. We aimed to establish whether such findings are associated with the degree of prematurity, neonatal respiratory illness and disproportionate somatic growth. Methods: Multiple breath washout measurements using an ultrasonic flowmeter were obtained from 219 infants on 306 test occasions during the first few months of life, at three neonatal units in the UK and Australia. Tests were performed during unsedated sleep in clinically stable infants (assigned to four exclusive diagnostic categories: term controls, preterm controls, respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease). The determinants of neonatal lung function were assessed using multivariable, multilevel modelling. Results: After adjustment for age and body proportions, the factors gestation, intrauterine growth restriction and days of supplemental oxygen were all significantly associated with a reduced FRC. In contrast, increased ventilation inhomogeneity (elevated lung clearance index) was only significantly associated with duration of supplemental oxygen. After adjusting for continuous variables, diagnostic category made no further contribution to the models. Despite using identical techniques, unexpected inter-centre differences occurred, associated with the equipment used; these did not alter the negative association of preterm delivery and disease severity with lung function outcomes. Conclusion: Reduction in FRC is independently associated with prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction and severity of neonatal lung disease. Determinants of lung function shortly after birth are highly complex in different disease groups.

AB  - Fetal malnutrition or prenatally enhanced stress hormone levels have the potential to program brain function in later life. Even modest malnutrition has direct effects on brain development mainly via modulation of the insulin-like growth factor system. Nutrient restriction also increases maternal stress hormone concentrations in the fetal circulation. Increased fetal cortisol concentrations due to restricted fetal nutrient supply, prenatal stress or glucocorticoid treatment affect structural and functional brain development. Increased cortisol concentrations during maturation of the fetal hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the last weeks of pregnancy induce hyperactivity of the HPA axis due to permanent desensitization of glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus and a subsequent decrease in negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis. Increased responsiveness of the HPA axis to stress in later life is associated with perturbation of the activity of neurotransmitter systems such as the serotonergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic systems predisposing to discrete cognitive disturbances, behavioral disorders and depressive and schizophrenic diseases.

AB  - Breast feeding is accompanied by numerous clinical and psychosocial advantages for both the mother and her child. Since most drugs will pass into human milk in some amount, the lactating mother who requires pharmacotherapy adds complexity to the risk-benefit assessment for clinicians making treatment decisions. In the case of psychotropic medications this issue is particularly worrisome since women who are not well controlled will have impaired bonding with their child. Moreover, these women may not necessarily recognize adverse events or abnormal outcomes in her infants. In an ideal situation, the patient would receive pharmacotherapy to assist in disease management, while at the same time successfully breastfeed her child. This goal of this presentation is to discuss the disposition of drugs in lactating patients and to outline the available literature concerning the use of psychotropic drugs in lactating women. Part of the continuum of treating women with psychiatric disease in pregnancy concerns the treatment of women after delivery, and for many, this will include drug treatment during lactation. The goal of today's discussion is to describe the issues and outline what is currently known about the use of psychotropic drugs in breastfeeding women. © 2009 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB  - Objective. The Alaska Division of Public Health has stated that infants may safely share a bed for sleeping if this occurs with a nonsmoking, unimpaired caregiver on a standard, adult, non-water mattress. Because this policy is contrary to recent national recommendations that discourage any bed sharing, we examined 13 years of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred while bed sharing to assess the contribution of known risk factors. Methods. We examined vital records, medical records, autopsy reports, and first responder reports for 93% of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred between 1992 and 2004. We examined deaths while bed sharing for risk factors including sleeping with a non-caregiver, prone position, maternal tobacco use, impairment of a bed-sharing partner, and an unsafe sleep surface. We used Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data to describe bed-sharing practices among all live births in Alaska during 1996-2003. Results. Thirteen percent (n=126) of deaths occurred while bed sharing; 99% of these had at least one associated risk factor, including maternal tobacco use (75%) and sleeping with an impaired person (43%). Frequent bed sharing was reported for 38% of Alaskan infants. Among these, 60% of mothers reported no risk factors; the remaining 40% reported substance use, smoking, high levels of alcohol use, or most often placing their infant prone for sleeping. Conclusions. Almost all bed-sharing deaths occurred in association with other risk factors despite the finding that most women reporting frequent bed sharing had no risk factors; this suggests that bed sharing alone does not increase the risk of infant death. ©2009 Association of Schools of Public Health.

AB  - Despite declines in prevalence during the last years, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) continues to be the leading cause of death for infants aged between 1 month and 1 year in developed countries. Epidemiological studies have described a number of environmental factors related, as placing infants prone for sleep, maternal smoking during pregnancy or postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke; however, the main cause of SIDS remains obscure. Since hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most prevalent causes of sudden cardiac death in younger adults, although in many cases the disease is not clearly evident at younger ages, we hypothesize about the possibility of founding HCM genes implicated in the development of sudden death in infants. In order to ascertain whether our hypothesis is correct, we have analysed more than 600 HCM mutations in 140 cases of SIDS. Mutation detection was performed with the MassArray genotyping platform of Sequenom and positive mutations were consequently confirmed by resequencing. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background: Herbal medicine use is common in Australia but little is known about the use of individual herbs. Methods: A cross-sectional population survey conducted in 2007 with a sample of 2526, in the Australian state of Victoria. Results: Almost a quarter (22.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 20.9-24.2%) of survey participants had used at least one medicinal herb in the preceding 12 months. Aloe vera, garlic and green tea were the most popular, each used by about 10% of participants. Health enhancement was the most common reason for herbal medicine use (69.6% of users) but relatively high proportions of users sought relief of specific medical conditions. Over 90% considered their herbal medicine to be very or somewhat helpful. Less than half (46.6%) the users were aware that there were potential risks associated with herbal medicine. Relatively high proportions of female users had taken herbal medicine whilst pregnant (14.4%) and/or whilst breast feeding (10.0%). Over half (50.9%) of herbal medicine users had also used Western medicine for the same medical condition in the 12-month period. Almost the same proportion (49.9%) had used both forms of medication on the same day. In deciding whether or not to use herbal medicine, the vast majority of survey participants indicated that they would accept the advice of their medical practitioner. Conclusions: In addition to health enhancement, specific herbs are commonly used to treat a range of medical conditions, without clear evidence of efficacy. Concurrent use of herbal and conventional medicine is relatively common and the majority of herbal medicine users are not aware of potential adverse effects. It appears that medical practitioners could exert significant influence on their patients' decisions about herbal medicine use. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In Wistar rats, pregnant or not pregnant, sleep-wakefulness parameters were registered for 2 days from 10:00 till 14:00. Later, these rats were subjected to 3-hour (11:00-14:00) daily sleep deprivation (SD) during 3 consecutive days. To prevent sleep, the following manipulations were used: acoustic stimulation from moving of the food pellets, opening or horizontal rotation of the cage and gentle handling. Control pregnant or not pregnant rats were placed in individual cages in the same room, but their sleep was not disturbed. On average, not pregnant rats spent about 65% of the time in sleep. Sleep episodes were mostly short (less than 1 min) or medium (1-15 min). After the beginning and with advance of pregnancy, the amount, deepness and duration of sleep episodes increased. With the methods of SD used, not pregnant rats did not sleep almost at all during the SD session. In pregnant rats, the quantity and intensity of stimuli used for SD increased as compared to control, which was indicatives of the growth of "sleep pressure" during pregnancy.

AB  - The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of child-bearing age, and the diagnosis carries with it associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors that are likely linked to insulin resistance. Consequently, women affected by PCOS are at significant risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Aggressive screening for glucose intolerance and cardiovascular risk factors should be performed in all PCOS patients, and, when indicated by symptomatology, affected women should be screened for sleep apnea. Long-term goals of therapy should focus on prevention of these comorbidities.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women. Method: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15 healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates. Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women. Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression.

AB  - Sex hormones interfere with the immune response. Estrogens enhance humoral immunity, and androgens and progesterone are natural immune suppressors. Some physiological, pathological, and therapeutical conditions may change the serum estrogen milieu and/or peripheral conversion rate and these factors include the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, menopause, old age, chronic stress, altered circadian rhythms, inflammation, the use of corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, and steroid hormone replacements. These factors alter androgen/estrogen ratios and have related effects. Inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6) increase aromatase activity, and this action may partially explain abnormal peripheral estrogen synthesis in rheumatoid arthritis (i.e., increased availability of 17β-estradiol and its metabolites in synovial fluids). Similar mechanisms in systemic lupus erythematosus may explain the altered serum sex hormone levels and decreased androgens and DHEAS that have been reported in that disease. The local effects of sex hormones in autoimmune rheumatic diseases seem to consist mainly of altered cell proliferation and cytokine production. Women, who have increased exposure to cell traffic in pregnancy, would be expected to have a higher occurrence of autoimmune conditions. © 2008.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of short or long day light regimes on the reproductive performance in the sow. The study comprised approximately 1300 sows and their 3400 breedings in three commercial sow pools, in which a batch farrowing of 40 sows was employed. Each batch remained in the farrowing unit for 8 weeks under either a short day (10 h light, 14 h dark) or a long day (14 h light, 10 h dark) light regime. After weaning and transportation to the central unit, all sows were kept under the long day regime until they were moved back to the farrowing unit. Production results for each individual sow were recorded. The effect of the two different light regimes on the farrowing rate (FR) and on the weaning-to-oestrous interval was evaluated using logistic and Poisson regression models, respectively. The light regime affected none of the parameters significantly. The FR in June, July and August did, however, drop below that in December, January and February (OR 0.7, p < 0.05). The FR was affected by the sow pool (p < 0.01). Parity two sows exhibited a lower FR (OR 0.5, p = 0.05) and higher incidence of delayed first oestrus (IRR 2.7, p < 0.01) than did older sows. This study indicates that despite an artificial light regime, sows may still react to changes in season. In conclusion, use of simple light regime to obtain complete control over reproductive performance appears to be difficult. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - With the growing frequency of preterm birth, increased effort has been made to elucidate the physiology of normal and aberrant parturition. As with many developmental processes, the study of genetically altered mice has led to an increased understanding of mechanisms controlling the maintenance and resolution of pregnancy. Studies in genetically altered mice have implicated critical roles for both prostaglandin synthesis and degradation in luteolysis and the progression of labor. The importance of local modulation of progesterone activity to cervical ripening has also been demonstrated. Although a decline in levels of serum progesterone is a part of normal labor initiation in mice but not humans, murine labor without progesterone withdrawal has been reported in some cases. These findings emphasize the importance of other components of the parturition cascade that are shared in mice and humans and highlights the importance of an increased understanding of the physiology of mouse parturition.

AB  - In this study, we report that the gender ratio (GR) at death [where GR = (N males/N males + N females)] of those born (and likely conceived) in solar cycle peaks (about a 3-year period occurring on average every ∼11 years), is inversely related to mean male age at death; e.g., the higher the GR at death the lower the mean lifespan, while the GR at death of those born in non-peak years has no relation to mean male lifespan. Although changes in the GR are small and may be of little clinical significance, the GR is a sensitive indicator of environmental effects, and therefore is pertinent to epigenetics. This paper supports the hypothesis that solar radiation, probably in the ultraviolet spectrum, by some manner interacts with chromosomal DNA (genes) and produces the genetic variety that not only fosters adaptation, but also produces the diseases that reduce lifespan. This paper also proposes that sunlight is more effective in modifying genomes at the time of conception than later in gestation or infancy. Referring to the work of others, this study also reveals that geographic latitude also affects the GR, suggesting that the variation in light is probably as important as the intensity of light in modifying genomes. This study finds that men sustain more genetic variation, producing 28% more disease than women, as well as a 2% decrease in GR from birth to death, and a shorter life (in Maine) by 7 years. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Results regarding the use of bovine somatotropin for enhancing fertility in dairy cattle are variable. Here, the hypothesis was tested that a single injection of a sustained-release preparation of bovine somatotropin (bST) during the preovulatory period would improve pregnancy success of lactating dairy cows at first service. Results: The first experiment was conducted in a temperate region of Mexico. Cows inseminated following natural estrus or timed artificial insemination were given a single injection of bST or a placebo injection at insemination (n = 100 cows per group). There was no significant difference between bST and control groups in the proportion of inseminated cows diagnosed pregnant (29 vs 31% pregnant). The second experiment was performed during heat stress in Florida. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization regimen for first insemination. Cows treated with bST received a single injection at 3 days before insemination. Controls received no additional treatment. As expected, bST did not increase vaginal temperature. Treatment with bST did not significantly increase the proportion of inseminated cows diagnosed pregnant although it was numerically greater for the bST group (24.2% vs 17.8%, 124-132 cows per group). There was a tendency (p = 0.10) for a smaller percent of control cows to have high plasma progesterone concentrations (≥ 1 ng/ml) at Day 7 after insemination than for bST-treated cows (72.6 vs 81.1%). When only cows that were successfully synchronized were considered, the magnitude of the absolute difference in the percentage of inseminated cows that were diagnosed pregnant between bST and control cows was reduced (24.8 vs 22.4% pregnant for bST and control). Conclusion: Results failed to indicate a beneficial effect of bST treatment on fertility of lactating dairy cows. © 2008 Bell et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Sleep fragmentation and disruption during the normal physiological changes of pregnancy are as significant as some medical diseases. Sleep disorders during pregnancy are an even further complication. These changes, which persist not only over the course of the pregnancy, but also into the postpartum period, are significant enough to affect quality of life. Measures specific to the quality of life associated with sleep disorders are limited in pregnancy. Sleep disruption affects quality of life in a significant way. Those with insomnia suffer significant distress during that period, and those with poor sleep suffer the daytime consequences such as excessive daytime sleepiness. The literature regarding sleep and quality of life during pregnancy is limited. This review outlines the sleep characteristics typical of a normal pregnancy, including physical and emotional changes, and then the quality of life implications. We present some preliminary data that have been collected on quality of life in a study of normal pregnancy, and how sleep disruption may have an impact. Then, we explore sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome and sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy and assess how they may impact quality of life. Finally, we discuss sleep changes in the postpartum period, and how they may impact quality of life. The implications for perinatal depression may be particularly important. It becomes clear that for such a significant change in life, physically and emotionally, further studies exploring the impact of sleep on quality of life in pregnancy are required. The potential treatment of sleep disorders in pregnancy could lead to significant quality of life improvements during this time. © 2008 Humana Press, Totowa, NJ.

AB  - Background: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact with the neurophysiological development of neonates. Study Objectives: The present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep patterns in the preterm neonate. Design: Overnight sleep patterns were polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed. Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France). Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 ± 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, Slow, n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, S heavy, n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy. Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (-21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep. Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

AB  - Since the introduction of the HIV protease inhibitors in 1995, considerable progress has been made in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. However, treatment has not been without problems. Studies have demonstrated associations between protease inhibitor concentrations and efficacy and in some cases toxicity. As considerable inter-individual and intra-individual variations of protease inhibitor concentrations have been observed, it has been questioned to what extent this has clinical implications with regard to efficacy and toxicity? As a consequence the use of protease inhibitor concentration measurements to optimise HIV antiretroviral therapy (therapeutic drug monitoring - TDM) has been suggested. The objectives of this study, initiated in 2000, were: to establish a method for the simultaneous measurement of the available protease inhibitors; to explore the pharmacokinetics of the protease inhibitors in clinically relevant situations and in this context; to consider the applicability of TDM in protease inhibitor therapy. The presented studies and review demonstrate: 1) that it is feasible to measure protease inhibitor plasma concentrations in a clinical setting with precision and accuracy, and that protease inhibitor concentrations are very stable during different circumstances ex vivo; 2) that protease inhibitor plasma concentrations display limited long-term intra-individual variation but considerable inter-individual variation; 3) that protease inhibitor plasma concentrations display considerable intra-individual variations between morning and evening and in the case of drug-drug interactions; 4) that protease inhibitor drug-drug interactions can be unpredictable and adverse but also that protease inhibitor drug-drug interactions can be exploited to increase protease inhibitor concentrations or decrease protease inhibitor dose; 5) that increases in protease inhibitor plasma concentrations can enhance efficacy but also that decreases can reduce toxicity; 6) that the concentration-efficacy associations which have been established by others can be confirmed in clinical trials but that concentration-toxicity associations are more difficult to establish and confirm. The experiences with protease inhibitor therapy and the understanding of protease inhibitor pharmacokinetics have resulted in new treatment principles and the development of new and better protease inhibitors. Most patients achieve concentrations several folds higher than the minimum effective concentration with the regimens that are used currently (2007). As a result TDM in protease inhibitor therapy has become less relevant in HIV-infected patients receiving their first protease inhibitor. In protease inhibitor experienced patients, harbouring HIV with varying degrees of resistance/reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors, the combination of TDM and genotypic resistance testing, seems to be a promising tool, but prospective studies are needed. In some patients with certain conditions or in certain circumstances known to be associated with considerable inter-individual or intra-individual variation of protease inhibitor concentrations (drug-drug interactions, gastrointestinal disease, pregnancy or children) TDM might also be of benefit. However, no studies have investigated these patients specifically in randomised TDM trials.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine whether multiple preterm birth poses a risk to the child's normal psychomotor development. The first part of the article presents the results of cognitive development in two sets of triplets born preterm (32 and 33 hbd). The second part compares the psychomotor development of 24 four-and five-year-old twin children born preterm to that of 24 preterm singletons matched for week of gestation at birth, sex and birth weight. The third part compares these results with those obtained in a study done by the third author of the present study in the 1970s of 56 children born from multiple pregnancies. An analysis of the data suggests that preterm birth accompanied by low or very low birth weight has a stronger effect on the psy-chomotor development of children than multiple pregnancy. The preterm triplets, examined in the first and second year of life, showed a smaller degree of cognitive development than full-term singletons, but their results did not differ from those that would be expected for the corrected birth age. No difference was found between 4-and 5-year-old preterm twins and preterm singletons, although both these groups obtained lower scores than their full-term peers. The mothers of preterm twins reported more behavioral problems. On the CBCL 1.5-5 scale, the twins had a higher general score for reported problems, especially internalization, emotional reactivity and sleep disturbances. There is a strong statistical tendency towards comple-mentary personalities among pairs of preterm twins due to the contrast effect.

AB  - In the United States, about 1 million women of childbearing age have epilepsy. Estimates vary as to the percentage of these women who consider pregnancy, but epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition encountered in pregnancy. Women with epilepsy express significant interest in receiving guidance about pregnancy and the effects of seizures and anticonvulsant treatments on the developing fetus, but clinicians often are hard-pressed to find accurate and relevant information to share. In our practice, we devote many hours of clinical time to the counseling required when such a request is made. We begin by providing information about the risks of pregnancy for any woman, comparing the data for women with and without epilepsy; this gives patients perspective on the increase in the risk of fetal malformations associated with anticonvulsant therapy. We then proceed with an evaluation of whether the patient could consider withdrawing one or more anticonvulsants, particularly during the first trimester of gestation. For women who must continue taking anticonvulsants to prevent seizures, we explain that the increase in metabolism during pregnancy will require an increase in oral dosing to maintain prepregnancy concentrations of anticonvulsants. It is hoped that by maintaining prepregnancy blood levels during pregnancy, a woman with epilepsy can maintain the same level of seizure control during pregnancy that she had before conception. Additional time is spent discussing the need for adequate hydration, regular meals, and proper sleep during pregnancy and in the postpartum time to avoid behavioral alterations that can trigger seizures. As seizure medicines will need to be decreased after delivery, when a patient will be sleep-deprived and under the influence of hormonal changes that can increase the seizure tendency, our nurses meet with patients throughout pregnancy to develop plans for partner or family assistance with care of the neonate. Patients report appreciation for this type of personalized counseling but express frustration that we cannot provide absolute guidance with respect to the use of anticonvulsants in pregnancy. Therefore we often have to return several times to the topic of the limitations of scientific research regarding decision-making in pregnancy. Much of the information we have about the safety of anticonvulsant use in pregnancy comes from the registry studies discussed in this article. These studies can be difficult to interpret and compare because of the diversity of the methods used. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

AB  - Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a potentially fatal form of heart failure associated with pregnancy. A 29-year-old African American woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 36 weeks' gestation had a history of cardiomyopathy, morbid obesity (body mass index &gt; 70 kg/m2), uncontrolled hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and required a repeat cesarean delivery. The patient was admitted to the hospital several times throughout her pregnancy for congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and headaches. Two years previously the patient received a diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy 3 weeks after the delivery of her second child. This case report illustrates the recognition of peripartum cardiomyopathy and the risks early in pregnancy. It also describes the appropriate medical management, including transesophageal echocardiography and the need for collaboration of multiple medical specialists before and during delivery to provide the best possible outcome for both mother and infant.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common cause of daytime sleepiness for millions of Americans. It is also a disease associated with an increased likelihood of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, motor vehicle accidents, and diminished quality of life. A number of population-based studies have shown that OSA is more common in men than in women and this discrepancy is often evident in the clinical setting. There are a number of pathophysiological differences to suggest why men are more prone to the disease than women. Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, differences in obesity, upper airway anatomy, breathing control, hormones, and aging are all thought to play a role. The purpose of this review was to examine the literature on gender differences in OSA and to analyze whether or not these differences in pathogenic mechanisms affect diagnosis or treatment.

AB  - Course and outcome of 200 pregnancies, deliveries and post-partum periods of 127 women with the onset of epilepsy before or during pregnancy were compared to clinical form of the disease, frequency of seizures and antiepileptic therapy. In addition, 104 children born to 97 mothers with epilepsy, 85 children--from the moment of birth to 1 year old and others from 1 to 16 years old, were studied. The particular attention was focused on the early neonatal adaptation. It was shown that, along with the last weeks of pregnancy, the first 7 days period after the delivery was critical for epilepsy severity. The development of seizures at this period was related to sleep deprivation and marked hormonal changes. There were no significant changes between the body mass of newborns of mothers with epilepsy and those of healthy mothers. The period of neonatal adaptation in children of affected mothers was favorable in 46% of cases. Some peculiarities of a child's state (withdrawal syndrome, hepatitis A etc.) were mostly related to the treatment of a mother with high dosages of antiepileptic preparations, i.e. valproic acid. These disturbances vanished to the age of 1-3 years. In summary, the active supervision of women by an epileptologist during the pregnancy period allows to optimize the prognosis of the child's health and better course of epilepsy in the mother.

AB  - Auditory development in the fetus and infant entails the structural parts of the ears that develop in the first 20 weeks of gestation, and the neurosensory part of the auditory system develops primarily after 20 weeks' gestational age. The auditory system becomes functional at around 25 weeks' gestation. The cochlea of the middle ear and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are most important in the development of the auditory system. They are both easily affected by the environment and care practices in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). The period from 25 weeks' gestation to 5 to 6 months of age is most critical to the development of the neurosensory part of the auditory system. This is the time when the hair cells of the cochlea, the axons of the auditory nerve, and the neurons of the temporal lobe auditory cortex are tuned to receive signals of specific frequencies and intensities. Unlike the visual system, the auditory system requires outside auditory stimulation. This needs to include speech, music, and meaningful sounds from the environment. The preterm as well as the term infant cannot recognize or discriminate meaningful sounds with background noise levels greater than 60 dB. The more intense the background noise, especially low frequency, the fewer specific frequencies (pitch) can be heard and used to tune the hair cells of the cochlea. Continuous exposure to loud background noise in the NICU or home will interfere with auditory development and especially frequency discrimination. The initial stimulation of the auditory system (speech and music) needs to occur in utero or in the NICU to develop tonotopic columns in the auditory cortex and to have the critical tuning of the hair cells of the cochlea occur. The control of outside noise, the exposure to meaningful speech sounds and music, and the protection of sleep and sleep cycles, especially rapid eye movement sleep, are essential for healthy auditory development. The environment and care practices for the fetus in utero or the infant in the NICU are critical factors in the development of the auditory system. © 2008.

AB  - Despite a variable prevalence in the literature, OSAS is characterized by a higher frequency in men. This study involved a review of published data describing the impact of gender on features of OSAS.In women, OSAS seems to be associated with certain anatomical factors such as more significant obesity, a thinner oropharyngeal junction, a shorter uvula and reduced upper airway (UA) collapsibility, in comparison with men. Sleep related breathing disorders observed during pregnancy are more likely UA resistance syndrome than true OSAS, and are associated with severe fetal and maternal complications that could be improved by the use of nasal CPAP. Though OSAS symptoms are underestimated by women, the Epworth score as well as snoring are not influenced by gender. Gender does not seem to be a risk factor for increased mortality. Compliance with nasal CPAP is identical in both sexes, but oral appliance seem to be more effective in women.Further studies are needed to produce the required complementary data to confirm specific sex-related features in the diagnosis and treatment of OSAS. © 2008 SPLF.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the biochemistry of lipid metabolism in the adipocyte. Adipocytes make up approximately one-half of the cells in adipose tissue, the remainder being blood and endothelial cells, adipose precursor cells of varying degrees of differentiation, macrophages, and fibroblasts. In humans, small clusters of adipocytes are present that increase in size during gestation. Larger clusters of fat cells are associated with tissue vascularization and a general increase in cluster size is positively correlated with larger blood vessels. Paracrine/autocrine factors play a significant role in both capillary growth and adipose conversion. Recent advances have demonstrated that the adipocyte is not a passive lipid storage depot but a dynamic cell that plays a fundamental role in energy balance and overall body homeostasis. Moreover, the fat cell functions as a sensor of lipid levels, transmitting information to a neural circuit affecting major biological processes including hunger, sleep, and reproduction. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective. We examined the impact of chronic stress on the relationship between second-trimester serum corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) concentrations and preterm delivery (PTD) in working women. Methods. Birth records from mothers of 364 PTD and 730 controls in Southern California were linked to stored mid-pregnancy maternal serum analysed for CRH. Association of CRH with stressors reported in post-partum interviews was examined in cases and controls separately. Stratified multivariable logistic regression analyses examined moderating influence of seven chronic stressors on CRH in predicting PTD. Results. Mean log CRH was lower among women with chronic stressors. Chronic stressors were not related to an increased risk of PTD, but did strengthen the association of CRH with PTD. Adjusted for confounders, the odds of PTD were 1.5-times higher per unit increase in log CRH in the overall study population, but were two-to-three times higher in subjects who reported unfulfilling jobs, little sleep or strong anger in the second trimester. Conclusion. The relation of CRH with PTD is moderated by exposure to chronic stressors during pregnancy. © 2008 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - In a mature organism, the contact between various liquids and the laryngeal mucosa triggers lower airway protective responses (cough, swallowing, arousal). These laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are essential for preventing aspiration. In contrast, previous studies showed that LCR are responsible for apnea and bradycardia in the neonatal mammal. Consequently, LCR, especially when triggered by acid gastrolaryngeal reflux, are deemed responsible for some apneas of prematurity and many life-threatening events of infancy and, probably, for some cases of sudden infant death syndrome. Recently, we have revisited LCR in full-term lambs during quiet sleep. Our results showed that the LCR triggered by HCl (pH 2), mimicking the acid component of an acid gastro-oesophageal reflux, were consistently like the mature LCR reported in adult mammals, without significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire 2005). These results prompted us to question whether premature birth alters LCR. Results show that LCR triggered in pre-term lambs by both saline and HCl are much more marked and clinically relevant than the ones observed in fullterm lambs. Indeed, life-threatening responses to HCl, including repetitive apneas for more than 90 seconds, severe desaturation and bradycardia, were observed in 2 lambs at postnatal day 7 (D7). In addition, LCR were significantly blunted at D14. In conclusion, HCl can trigger potentially dangerous LCR in pre-term lambs at D7, suggesting that LCR in response to acid gastrolaryngeal refluxes are likely involved in some apnea/bradycardia/desaturation in pre-term infants, before they reach a post-conceptional age equivalent to full gestation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Objective: The hypothesis is tested that electrocortical functional connectivity (quantified by coherence) of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, measured at term post-menstrual age, has regional differences from that of full term infants. Methods: 128 lead EEG data were collected during sleep from 8 ELBW infants with normal head ultrasound exams and 8 typically developing full term infants. Regional spectral power and coherence were calculated. Results: No significant regional differences in EEG power were found between infant groups. However, compared to term infants, ELBW infants had significantly reduced interhemispheric coherence (in frontal polar and parietal regions) and intrahemispheric coherence (between frontal polar and parieto-occipital regions) in the 1-12 Hz band but increased interhemispheric coherence between occipital regions in the 24-50 Hz band. Conclusions: ELBW infants at term post-menstrual age manifest regional differences in EEG functional connectivity as compared to term infants. Significance: Distinctive spatial patterns of electrocortical synchrony are found in ELBW infants. These regional patterns may presage regional alterations in the structure of the cortex. © 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - Purpose of the review: Preoperative evaluation and optimization of a patient's medical conditon are important components of anesthesia practice. With ever increasing numbers of patients with serious comorbidities having complex procedures as outpatients, the task of gathering information and properly preparing for their care is challenging. Improvements in assessment and management can potentially reduce adverse events, improve patient and caregiver satisfaction, and reduce costs. Recent findings: A growing body of literature and evidence-based practices and guidelines can assist clinicians who work in the expanding field of preoperative medicine. Care providers from various specialties in medicine are developing innovative methods, tools, and knowledge to advance science and processes. Data-driven practices are beginning to close the information gap that has plagued this field of medical practice. Summary: Preparation of patients before surgery is a necessary and vital component of perioperative medicine. Practices are developing to guide effective interventions that benefit patients and healthcare systems. Outpatients present special challenges to preoperative assessment. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The knowledge and understanding of the development of the sensory systems in the fetus, neonate, and infant have progressed and grown extensively in the past twenty to thirty years. This has been a result of the advances in technology for study of brain development and the sensory systems specifically. While the basic physcial structure of the sensory receptors (i.e. eyes, ears etc.) develops early in gestation, most of the neurosensory development occurs in the last sixteen to twenty weeks. The neurological processes are not accelerated by preterm birth. Preterm birth accelerates the maturation of the kidney, gastrointestinal, lung and cardiovascular function but does not alter the sequence or timing of neurodevelopment. The stresses and the environment of the Newborn Intesive Care Unit (NICU) play a major role in the altered neurodevelopment observed in preterm infants. The brain development in the fetus, neonate, and infant includes not just sensory systems but motor systems, social/emotional systems, and the cognitive systems. These systems are connected and integrated during development. The development of the brain, both structure and function, is shaped by the influence of four major factors or processes. These inlude (1) the genetic endowment and the epigenetic effects from the environment, (2) the endogenous or internal brain activity and sleep, (3) external experiences and stimulation of the sensory organs, and (4) the physical, chemical, sensory, and social/emotional environments. These factors operate on and influence the development of each of the brain systems. These effects depend on age and developmental level of the particular system. Many of the processes and stimulations needed to facilitate brain development can result in adverse effects if exposure is at the wrong time in development or the level of intensity is not appropriate. The NICU inviroment can have very adverse consequences for healthy nuerodevelopment. It is essential that the invironment of the fetus, neonate, infant be adapted and managed to provide for the healthy early brain development. This requires both a developmentally, supportive environment and developmentally appropriate care practices. © 2008.

AB  - We all go through ups and downs in our mood. Sadness is a normal reaction to life's struggles, setbacks, and disappointments. We may feel "down in the dumps" for a short period of time, but gradually the painful feelings dissipate and we move on with our lives-often the wiser for the experience. But if these feelings of sadness don't go away or if they are so intense that they interfere with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and enjoy life, you may be suffering from depression. We are all at risk for developing a depressive illness. People of all ages, races, and social class can become depressed. No one is completely immune to this condition. Everyone experiences feelings of unhappiness and sadness occasionally. But when these depressed feelings start to dominate everyday life and cause physical and mental deterioration, they become what are known as depressive disorders. Nearly twice as many women as men develop depression and related disorders at some point in their lives. A woman's unique biological, psychosocial and cultural factors may increase her risk of depression. Married women are more depressed. It is usually because a married woman has many responsibilities to fulfill. The present study was conducted in district Faisalabad.The purpose was to study the risk factors, prevalence and impact of depression on married women. Women were interviewed through a well-structured interviewing schedule consisting of close-ended questions. The sample size was 200 respondents. Four villages from two union councils of one rural town were selected randomly through multi stage sampling technique. This study entails with the perception of rural married women about the risk factors, prevalence and impact of depressive disorder. After a comprehensive research the factors that cause depression in married women are husband wife conflict, in-laws conflict, baradari conflict, death of a close relative, loss of children, loss of husband's job, financial difficulties, addiction in family, long term of stress at home, rented house, pregnancy, miscarriage, infertility, early motherhood, caring of children and aging parents, single parenthood and workload due to large family. On the basis of results and findings of the study, different recommendations are proposed, focusing on preventive measures for depression and emphasizing on improving the mental health of women. The study has deeply indicate that low socio-economic status, conflict with husband and in-laws, early motherhood and heavy workload are the major risk factors of depression among women.

AB  - Background: Aortic valve sparing operations were developed to preserve the native aortic valve in patients with relatively normal aortic cusps and aortic root aneurysms with or without aortic insufficiency secondary to dilatation of the sinotubular junction or annulus. These operations are an alternative to replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta using a conduit containing a tissue or mechanical valve, which has been considered the standard operation to treat patients with aortic root aneurysm. An important feature of this method is the absence of the need for anticoagulation treatment and lack of other complications resulting from mechanical prosthesis implantation. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the early and mid-term results of aortic valve reimplantation to treat aortic root and ascending aorta aneurysm. Material and Methods: From 2001 to 2008, 45 patients (male 32, female 13) underwent aortic valve sparing operations for aortic root aneurysms (10 patients) and aortic root with ascending aorta aneurysms (35 patients). Their mean age was 45.5±17.1 years. In all patients the reimplantation technique was used. Mean early follow-up was performed 21.1±9.1 days and at mid-term, 21.9±16.1 months after the operation. Severe aortic insufficiency (AI) was diagnosed in 31.1% of patients (n=14), moderate in 42.2% (n=19) and mild 26.6% (n=12). 8 patients had Marfan's syndrome, 8 patients had bicuspid aortic valve, in 22 patients hypertension was diagnosed and in 4 patients aortic dissection was noted. The tube graft was implanted using pledged sutures at the level of the aortic root and with reimplantation of coronary ostia to the tube graft. During the operation transoesophageal echocardiographic assessment of the reimplanted aortic valve function was performed. Early and mid-term results of the operation were assessed on the basis of transthoracic echocardiographic study. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) form. Results: In the transoesophageal echocardiographic examination no significant AI was revealed. Early echocardiographic assessment revealed 89.9% of patients free from moderate or severe AI. In mid-term observations 7 had developed moderate AI (15.5%) and 1 severe AI (2.2%). 82.3% of patients were free from significant AI. Freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 8 years was at the level of 97.8%. There were two hospital deaths. One was on the 20 th postoperative day in a patient with severe AI and with III/IV NYHA heart failure. He underwent kidney transplantation, had severe kidney failure and required chronic dialysis. The second patient, with acute aortic dissection, died on the 10th postoperative day, because of heart failure. An additional death was registered due to leukaemia two years after the operation. One female became pregnant after the operation and delivered successfully by vaginal delivery. QoL in all six sections of NHP - energy, physical mobility, emotional reactions, pain, sleep and social isolation - was assessed as very good (60-100 points). Conclusions: Early and mid-term observation of patients treated because of aortic root aneurysms with the used reimplantation technique revealed good results of the operation and high quality of life.

AB  - Background: In order to clarify the alcohol consumption status of pregnant women in Japan and the characteristics of pregnant women who abstained from alcohol after their pregnancy had been confirmed, a nationwide questionnaire-based study of alcohol consumption behavior was performed. We also examined the factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy. Methods: After random sampling, 260 institutions participated in the survey; these were selected from a list of survey points fixed by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed pregnancies by using self-administered anonymous questionnaires during the period from February 1 through 14, 2002. Results: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported in 11.1% of the study participants, and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy, in 76.9%. Significant associations were recognized between higher education and both alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after pregnancy confirmation. Furthermore, alcohol consumption was significantly associated with parity, smoking, and shorter sleep duration, whereas abstention was significantly associated with less frequent alcohol consumption and knowledge regarding the risk of alcohol consumption. Conclusion: The results clarified the factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy in Japan.

AB  - Fatigue, a common presenting symptom in primary care, negatively impacts work performance, family life, and social relationships. The differential diagnosis of fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia, pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management. Copyright © 2008 American Academy of Family Physicians.

AB  - Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a rare cholestatic liver disease. Such liver disease can get worse by female hormone disorder. Albumin dialysis or Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) has been reported to reverse severe cholestasis-linked pruritus. Here, we report the first use of MARS during a spontaneous pregnancy and its successful outcome in a patient with PFIC3 and intractable pruritus. Albumin dialysis could be considered as a pregnancy-saving procedure in pregnant women with severe cholestasis and refractory pruritus. © 2008 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Kangaroo care (KC) has been widely using to improve the care of low birth weight infants. However, very little is known about cerebral hemodynamics responses in low birth weight infants during KC intervention. The objective of this study was to elucidate the response of cerebral hemodynamics during KC in low birth weight infants. Methods: Near infrared spectroscopy measured regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2), heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) measured by electrocardiogram, and percentages of oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured by pulse oxymetry was monitored in 16 preterm infants (&lt; 1600 g) in three sessions: before, during, and after KC. Using power spectral analysis, total power (TP), low-frequency (LF, 0.02-0.20 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.20-0.50 Hz) bands, the ratio of LF/HF were calculated and normalized as %LF or %HF = LF or HF/TP × 100 (%). Results: Significant differences were not observed in the meanrSO2, HR, and SpO2 throughout sessions; however, the TP of these parameters was significantly decreased during KC and increased after KC (p &lt; 0.001). The %LF of LrSO2 and RrSO2 was decreased during KC (p &lt; 0.05) with decreased %HF in RrSO2 (p &lt; 0.05). The %LF of HR was significantly increased during KC while %HF was decreased (p &lt; 0.05). Mean and TP of RR was increased during KC (p &lt; 0.01 respectively) with the increase of quiet sleep state (p &lt; 0.05) and decreased after KC (p &lt; 0.01). The %LF of RR was increased after KC (p &lt; 0.05) with decreased %HF (p &lt; 0.05); however, significant changes were not observed during KC. Conclusion: KC intervention appears to have influence on cerebral hemodynamics as well as cardiorespiratory parameters. The results of rSO2 and HR might be associated with quiet sleep states. The results of this study may indicate the contribution of KC intervention to the activation of central nervous system and brain function. Further study is needed to determine the underlying physiology responsible for these differences. © 2008 Begum et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The idea of the presence of androgens in females may sound peculiar as androgens generally refer to male hormones. Although produced in small amounts in women, androgens have direct and significant effects on many aspects of female physiology. Moreover, androgens are precursors to estrogens, which are the predominant female sex hormones. The measurement of androgens in blood is important in the diagnosis of both gonadal and adrenal functional disturbances, as well as monitoring subsequent treatments. The accuracy of such measurements is crucial in sports medicine and doping control. Therefore, the concentration of androgens in female subjects is frequently measured. Analysing such compounds with accuracy is especially difficult, costly and time consuming. Therefore, laboratories widely use direct radioimmunoassay kits, which are often insensitive and inaccurate. It is especially complicated to determine the level of androgens in women, as the concentration is much lower compared to the concentration found in males. Additionally, the amount of androgens in fluids tends to decrease with aging. Analyses of hormone concentrations are influenced by a myriad of factors. The factors influencing the outcome of these tests can be divided into in vivo preanalytical factors (e.g., aging, chronobiological rhythms, diet, menstrual cycle, physical exercise, etc.), in vitro preanalytical factors (e.g., specimen collection, equipment, transport, storage, etc.) and as mentioned before, analytical factors. To improve the value of these tests, the strongly influencing factors must be controlled. This can be accomplished using standardised assays and specimen collection procedures. In general, sufficient attention is not given to the preanalytical (biological) factors, especially in the measurement of androgens in females. Biological factors (non-pathological factors) that may influence the outcome of these tests in female subjects have received little attention and are the topic of the present review. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is more common in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disease and fetal growth restriction. Study design: An observational study comparing pregnant women with these two complications with normal pregnant women and non-pregnant women in two UK maternity hospitals. Each participant completed a sleep apnoea questionnaire and underwent nocturnal oxygen saturation monitoring. Results: Using a strict definition of obstructive sleep apnoea confirmed by oxygen saturation monitoring only two mild cases were seen, 0/50 non-pregnant women, 1/69 of normal pregnant women, 0/48 women with various types of hypertensive disease, and 1/33 women carrying fetuses affected with fetal growth restriction. Even using less strict definitions and self-reported sleepiness scores there was no relation between sleep apnoea and either fetal growth restriction or hypertensive diseases. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnoea is at most a rare cause of either growth restriction or hypertensive disease in pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors. Method: 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. Results: The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: Exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Foetal and postnatal smoke-exposure may alter cardiovascular control in infants. We studied heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses in smoke-exposed infants. Methods: Eleven infants exposed to maternal cigarette smoking were studied at the age of 12 ± 2.1 (range 10-16) weeks. Twenty healthy, age-matched infants from non-smoking families served as controls. During confirmed slow-wave sleep (NREM3), 3-5 sec side motion and 45 sec 45° head-up tilt tests were performed. Results: Control infants showed consistent biphasic HR and BP responses to side motion, with an initial 2-5% increase followed by a 2% decrease (p < 0.0001). In smoke-exposed infants, the initial HR (p = 0.009) and BP responses (p < 0.0001) were markedly reduced, and the subsequent decrease in BP was more prominent (systolic blood pressure, SBP, p = 0.005; diastolic blood pressure, DBP, p = 0.03). No differences were observed between the groups in tilt test results, HR variability or HR responses to spontaneous arousals. Conclusion: Maternal cigarette smoking may alter vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control in early infancy. This may contribute to increased SIDS risk. © 2008 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To examine the effects of a community-based mutual health organization (MHO) on utilization of priority health services, financial protection of its members and inclusion of the poor and other target groups. Methods: Four MHOs were established in two districts in Mali. A case-control study was carried out in which household survey data were collected from 817 MHO member households, 787 non-member households in MHO catchment areas, and 676 control households in areas without MHOs. We compiled MHO register data by household for a 22-month period. Outcome measures included utilization of priority services, health expenditures and out-of-pocket payments. Independent variables included individual, household and community demographic, socioeconomic and access characteristics, as determined through a household survey in 2004. Findings: MHO members who were up to date on premium payments (controlling for education, distance to the nearest health facility and other factors) were 1.7 times more likely to get treated for fevers in modern facilities; three times more likely to take children with diarrhoea to a health facility and/or treat them with oral rehydration salts at home; twice as likely to make four or more prenatal visits; and twice as likely, if pregnant or younger than 5 years, to sleep under an insecticide-treated net (P < 0.10 or better in all cases). However, distance was also a significant negative predictor for the utilization of many services, particularly assisted deliveries. Household and individual enrolment in an MHO were not significantly associated with socioeconomic status (with the exception of the highest quintile), and MHOs seemed to provide some financial protection for their members. Conclusion: MHOs are one mechanism that countries strengthening the supply of primary care can use to increase financial access to - and equity in - priority health services.

AB  - Background - Being born preterm, small, and to a mother who smokes are common perinatal complications with major public health implications. Evidence suggests that each affects the body's structure and function in ways that could increase susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction later in life. Here, we used 2 routine stress reactivity tests to identify incipient "silent" programming of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with adverse perinatal events. Methods and Results - We studied 29 control babies born at term to nonsmokers, 18 term-born babies of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy (mean, 15 cigarettes a day), and 31 babies born preterm to nonsmokers. All infants were compared at the same age after conception (ie, at 40 to 42 weeks), during sleep. We analyzed blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to breathing 4% CO2 for 4 minutes or to passive head-up tilt to 60°. BP was measured continuously from a wrist cuff. CO2 exposure raised heart rate and BP in controls by 10%, and tilt increased their BP by 5%. CO 2 elicited the expected BP but no heart rate response from preterm infants but a much-greater-than-expected BP and heart rate response from babies of smokers. Tilt elicited a 3- to 4-fold greater rise in BP from preterm and tobacco-exposed babies. Conclusions - Vascular, cardiac, and blood pressure reactivity is heightened in babies born preterm or to smokers. The findings are consistent with in utero and early postnatal "programming" of human cardiovascular dysfunction by adverse circumstances. This incipient dysfunction may be an early manifestation of processes that lead to other problems or complications later on (eg, higher BP or sudden infant death syndrome). © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Choline supplementation of the maternal diet has long-term facilitative effects on spatial and temporal memory processes in the offspring. To further delineate the impact of early nutritional status on brain and behavior, we examined effects of prenatal-choline availability on hippocampal oscillatory frequency bands in 12 month-old male and female rats. Adult offspring of time-pregnant dams that were given a deficient level of choline (DEF = 0.0 g/kg), sufficient choline (CON = 1.1 g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP = 3.5 g/kg) in their chow during embryonic days (ED) 12-17 were implanted with an electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in combination with an electromyograph (EMG) electrode patch implanted in the nuchal muscle. Five consecutive 8-h recording sessions revealed differential patterns of EEG activity as a function of awake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep states and prenatal choline status. The main finding was that SUP rats displayed increased power levels of gamma (30-100 Hz) band oscillations during all phases of the sleep/wake cycle. These findings are discussed within the context of a general review of neuronal oscillations (e.g., delta, theta, and gamma bands) and synchronization across multiple brain regions in relation to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the hippocampus. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Early epilepsy is known to worsen the developmental prognosis of young children with a congenital focal brain lesion, but its direct role is often very difficult to delineate from the other variables. This requires prolonged periods of follow-up with simultaneous serial electrophysiological and developmental assessments which are rarely obtained. We studied a male infant with a right prenatal infarct in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery resulting in a left spastic hemiparesis, and an epileptic disorder (infantile spasms with transient right hemihypsarrhythmia and focal seizures) from the age of 7 months until the age of 4 years. Pregnancy and delivery were normal. A dissociated delay of early language acquisition affecting mainly comprehension without any autistic features was documented. This delay was much more severe than usually expected in children with early focal lesions, and its evolution, with catch-up to normal, was correlated with the active phase of the epilepsy. We postulate that the epilepsy specifically amplified a pattern of delayed language emergence, mainly affecting lexical comprehension, reported in children with early right hemisphere damage. © 2008 Mac Keith Press.

AB  - Empirical and clinical literature suggests a temporal thread running through family narratives of hereditary disease, linking past experiences to current beliefs about risk. This study asked young women with elevated risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (HBOC) how their family histories with cancer and their gene status inform meaning construction around cancer risk and family development. Twenty-three women aged 22-35 who carry a BRCA gene alteration completed illness genograms and open-ended, narrative interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using the Listening Guide, a narrative tool that emphasizes key themes, meanings, and relational structures. Data analysis revealed distinct priorities for (1) single versus partnered women and (2) women who wished to have children versus those who had completed childbearing or were not intending to have children. Findings suggest single women experience increased urgency at finding a life partner capable of handling the emotional strain of the cancer world and open to pursuing multiple paths toward parenthood. Further, participants' family experiences shaped beliefs about perceived time to achieve desired family goals, specifically having biological children, before a cancer diagnosis or the need for preventive surgery. Clinical practice and research implications are discussed.

AB  - Previous studies on feeder use in group-housed pregnant sows focused on dynamic groups and protected electronic sow feeders (ESF). This study observed 60 pregnant sows, 1st to 8th parity - housed from Day 29 of pregnancy to 1 week before parturition in stable groups of 20 animals, 1 Fitmix feeder per group. Data from 25 nonconsecutive 24-hr feeding cycles showed sows making several visits to the feeder. Literature on conventional ESF indicated shorter daily feeder occupation. Daily feeder occupation per sow decreased over time (p &lt; .001). The study observed maximum feeder activity in the hours following the start of each feeding cycle. During the experiment, there was a relatively stable, quickly established, and maintained feeder order (W &gt; 0.80, p &lt; .001). This highly correlated with dominance rank (rs = 0.80, p &lt; .001). High-ranking sows fed earlier and made as many - but longer - visits as low-ranking sows; thus, they occupied the feeder more time every day (p &lt; .01). Although optimization of the feeder efficiency may take several weeks, Fitmix seems an efficient feeding system for medium-size, stable groups of sows.

AB  - Maternal psychological functioning during pregnancy affects both maternal and fetal well-being. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis provides one mechanism through which maternal psychosocial factors may be transduced to the fetus. However, few studies have examined maternal psychological factors or birth outcomes in relation to the diurnal pattern of cortisol across the day. The current study examined maternal psychological well-being, parity status, and birth weight in relation to the maternal cortisol diurnal rhythm in a group of 98 low-risk pregnant women (51 primiparae). At 36 weeks gestation, participants completed both pregnancy-specific and general self-report measures of psychological functioning and provided saliva samples at 8:00, 12:00, and 16:00 h on 2 consecutive working days for the assay of cortisol. The expected diurnal decline in salivary cortisol was observed. Higher trait anxiety was associated with a flatter afternoon decline for all mothers. For primiparae, steeper morning cortisol declines were associated with lower infant birth weight. The findings suggest that regulation of the HPA axis may differ by parity status with downstream implications for fetal growth and development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - • Most sleep complaints involve difficulties in getting to sleep or staying asleep, or not feeling refreshed on awakening. Misconceptions and worrying over the lack of sleep and its consequences can contribute to reinforcing these disorders. • How can patients who complain of poor-quality sleep be helped, without resorting to treatments that can have adverse effects? To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review of the literature based on the standard Prescrire procedure. • One effective approach is to explain the basic physiology of sleep, to discuss misconceptions, and to adopt a strategy of "stimulus control". This method has a similar efficacy to prescribing a benzodiazepine, and the effect is longer lasting. • Moderate, regular physical exercise, especially in the morning, seems to help some patients, but the evidence is weak. • Some clinical trials of phytotherapy have shown a positive risk-benefit balance of weak aqueous or hydroalcoholic valerian extracts. Efficacy is limited, however. • A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials showed that benzodiazepines and related drugs increase the duration of sleep and help patients to fall asleep sooner. However, none of these trials provides comparative data spanning periods of more than two weeks. Efficacy is uncertain in the longer term, as patients quickly develop a tolerance to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines. • The adverse effects of benzodiazepines include frequent memory disorders, daytime drowsiness, falls, fractures and road accidents, and a withdrawal syndrome after treatment cessation. Related drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone provoke similar adverse effects. • Sedative antihistamines have not been as well-evaluated as benzodiazepines in this setting. Small comparative trials of doxylamine and diphenhydramine showed no major difference in efficacy versus benzodiazepines and related drugs. The main adverse effects of sedative antihistamines are daytime drowsiness and altered vigilance, and atropinic effects. • Case-control studies showed a statistical link between benzodiazepine use in early pregnancy and birth defects such as cleft lip. In contrast, data on the use of doxylamine during pregnancy are reassuring. • Other sedative psychotropics have not been adequately tested in this setting or have been shown to have a negative risk-benefit balance. • In practice, patients who complain of poor-quality sleep should be given appropriate information on the mechanisms of normal sleep and related misconceptions, on the best methods for getting to sleep, and on the dangers of sedative psychotropics (dependence, withdrawal syndrome). When prescribing or dispensing a benzodiazepine to a woman of child-bearing age, the risk of birth defects, although not clearly demonstrated, must be mentioned. © Review prepared and translated by the Prescrire Editorial Staff.

AB  - Uterine fibroids are the commonest tumours of the female genital tract with a prevalence varying from 20-50% in women of reproductive age. Surgical management by myomectomy is limited to the non pregnant uterus. Fibroid coexisting with pregnancy may be associated with complication in 10-30% of cases which are preferably often managed conservatively. We present a case of huge uterine fibroid in early pregnancy with significant complication that necessitated myomectomy at 10 weeks gestation in a 37 year old nullipara in which pregnancy continued till successful delivery at 38 weeks gestation.

AB  - Depression has a female sex predilection with 2 to 3% of the pregnant women population presently requiring treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Exposure to SSRIs in late gestation leads to clinical manifestations in as much as 30% of the neonates. These include neurobehavioral, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and somatic symptoms. Among the respiratory manifestations, persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome is a newly recognized and concerning side effect of SSRI exposure in utero. This causal association has been reproduced in an animal model where fluoxetine administration to pregnant rats induces fetal pulmonary hypertension. The pharmacological effects of SSRI on the fetus and newborn, available treatment, and prevention strategies are discussed in this review. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prenatal lung development requires fetal breathing movements (FBM). To investigate the dependence of FBM on feedback originating from the lung, we hypothesized that pneumonectomy stimulates FBM. Time-dated fetal sheep underwent bilateral pneumonectomy, unilateral pneumonectomy, or sham surgery at 125-130 days gestation. The incidence of FBM decreased in sham-operated fetuses at 142 days versus 130 days (p = 0.013), but was unchanged across all gestational ages in bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses (p ≥ 0.52). In unilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses, the incidence of FBM remained unchanged until 139 days and was higher than that of the bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses at 130-136 days gestation (p ≤ 0.03). The amplitude of integrated diaphragmatic electromyographic activity (∫EMGdi) and total respiratory output (frequency of breathing x ∫EMGdi) were lower in pneumonectomized fetuses versus sham-operated fetuses at later gestational ages (p &lt; 0.05). These decreases in ∫EMGdi and total respiratory output were most pronounced at 142 days in bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses versus sham-operated fetuses (p = 0.006 and 0.016, respectively). Low-voltage electrocortical activity (ECoG) increased, and high-voltage ECoG decreased, in unilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses compared with sham-operated fetuses (p = 0.04). In conclusion, we provide new evidence that feedback from the fetal lung modulates the incidence and various components of phrenic nerve output, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism between FBM and lung development. © 2008 NRC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Our goal is to describe the methods used in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II), a study of infant feeding and care practices throughout the first year of life. Survey topics included breastfeeding, formula and complementary feeding, infant health, breast-pump use, food allergies, sleeping arrangements, mother's employment, and child care arrangements. In addition, mothers' dietary intake was measured prenatally and postnatally. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS. The IFPS II sample was drawn from a nationally distributed consumer opinion panel of 500 000 households. All questionnaires were administered by mail, 1 prenatally and 10 postpartum. Qualifying criteria were used to achieve the sample goals of mothers of healthy term and late preterm singleton infants. In addition to the questionnaires about the infants, women were sent a diet-assessment questionnaire prenatally and at ∼4 months after delivery;this questionnaire was also sent to members of a comparison group who were neither pregnant nor postpartum. RESULTS. A sample of 4902 pregnant women began the study, and ∼2000 continued through their infant's first year. Response rates ranged from 63% to 87% for the different questionnaires. Compared with adult mothers of singletons from the nationally representative sample of the National Survey of Family Growth, IFPS II participants had a higher mean education level; were older; were more likely to be middle income, white, and employed; were less likely to smoke; and had fewer other children. Compared with women who participated in the National Immunization Survey who gave birth in 2004, IFPS II mothers were more likely to breastfeed and to breastfeed longer. CONCLUSIONS. The IFPS II provides a valuable database because of its large sample size, the frequency of its questionnaires, and its wide coverage of issues salient to infant feeding.

AB  - In this case-control study, we examined infants delivered vaginally at 37 weeks or later to identify factors associated with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). We reviewed the obstetric records of all vaginal deliveries at the Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital from 2005 through 2007. Demographic information and the characteristics of labor were extracted from patient charts. Multivariate analysis identified that the incidence of TTN was significantly associated with nulliparity: a history of infertility therapy, such as in vitro fertilization: augmentation of labor: nonreassuring fetal status: vacuum/forceps delivery: and low Apgar score (<7) at 1 and 5 minutes. In addition, a low Apgar score at 1 minute was the factor most strongly associated with the incidence of TTN (adjusted odds ratio, 20: 95% confidence intervals. 12-34: p<0.001). The present results indicate that the improvement of obstetric surveillance to diminish the frequency of low Apgar scores is important for preventing TTN in infants delivered vaginally at 37 weeks or later.

AB  - Background: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is fundamental to infant health. ANS activity of preterm newborns seems to be reduced at term equivalent age, but follow-up of ANS activity has rarely been performed in that population during the weeks after birth. The aim of the study was to perform such a follow-up in preterm newborns of different gestational ages, up to their term equivalent ages. Methods: Prolonged electrocardiographic recordings were prospectively performed in a group of 39 premature newborns, each week, up to term equivalent age before discharge. Control values were obtained from a group of 19 full-term newborns, recorded at the first week of their life. ANS indices were calculated from recordings during quiet sleep periods by spectral-domain analysis (Fourier transform): Ptot (total power), VLF (very low-frequencies), LF (low-frequencies), HF (high-frequencies), LF/HF ratio, LFnu (normalized low-frequencies) and HFnu (normalized high-frequencies) values. Results: Ptot, VLF, LF and HF were significantly lower in the preterm group at birth compared to the control group, while LFnu, HFnu and LF/HF ratio were not significantly different. The results were similar when comparing the control group to any ANS values at a given post-natal corrected age of preterm newborns. Furthermore, preterm newborns did not demonstrate any significant increase in ANS values from birth to theoretical term. Conclusion: The finding of substantial reduced ANS activity and failure of maturation in preterm infants up to term equivalent age needs confirming by other research groups, and mechanisms and implications for infant health explored. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of torticollis, plagiocephaly and facial asymmetry in normal newborn infants. Design: 102 healthy newborn infants were examined prospectively during their birth hospitalisation for torticollis with neck range of motion (ROM) assessment and for facial, mandibular and cranial asymmetry by photographic analysis. Results: 73% of newborns had one or more asymmetry: torticollis (16%), asymmetry of the mandible (13%), facial asymmetry (42%) and asymmetry of the head (61%). Torticollis was associated with maternal report of the fetus being "stuck" in one intrauterine position for more than 6 weeks before delivery. Moderate facial asymmetry was associated with a longer second stage of labour, forceps delivery, a bigger baby and birth trauma. Moderate cranial and mandibular asymmetries were associated with birth trauma. More than one significant asymmetry was found in 10% of newborns. Conclusions: Asymmetries of the head and neck are very common in normal newborns, and sixteen (16%) of 102 study newborns were found to have torticollis. Such newborns, especially if they sleep supine, are thought to be at risk of developing deformational posterior plagiocephaly. Identification of affected infants may allow early implementation of positioning recommendations or physical therapy to prevent the secondary craniofacial deformations that are part of an increasingly common phenomenon.

AB  - Nicotine addiction and the neurobiological mechanisms explaining nicotine reinforcement, withdrawal, and relapse involve α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This review updates readers on the preclinical and clinical pharmacology, as well as the therapeutic efficacy and safety of cytisine and varenicline, the two partial agonists of nAChRs for smoking cessation. Cytisine has been used for several decades: yet despite its surprising popularity in some parts of the world, it has been absent from almost all existing reviews of smoking cessation drugs. If safe and sufficiently efficacious, an obvious advantage would be its low cost, which could make cytisine an attractive treatment available to millions of smokers. Varenicline was recently introduced to the drug market and has been found to be more efficacious than existing treatments. Very encouraging results of early human trials and strong theoretical background for their use make the nAChRs partial agonists a promising alternative for currently available antismoking treatments. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Background: Migraine is among the 10 most disabling disorders worldwide. Besides acute attack treatment, drug prophylaxis of migraine is important in order to improve the quality of life. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the indications, principles and appropriate drugs with published evidence for the prophylaxis of migraine in general and in specific situations. Methods: Based on the American and European guidelines for the treatment of migraine, the evidence for different drugs in the prophylaxis of migraine was evaluated. In addition, all trials on migraine drug prophylaxis published since the publication of the guidelines were included in the evaluation. These trials were identified by a literature search in MedLine, Embase and the Cochrane library. Results: The drugs of first choice are β-blockers, flunarizine, valproic acid and topiramate and, in the US, amitriptyline is also grouped among the first-choice drugs. Drugs of second choice, with less efficacy or poorer evidence, are venlafaxine, gabapentin, naproxen, butterbur root, vitamin B2 and magnesium. The potential side effects are considered when choosing the appropriate prophylactic drug. All drugs used in migraine prophylaxis have been detected by chance and not by pathophysiological considerations. In the future, drugs developed on the basis of the current knowledge of migraine pathophysiology will hopefully be more effective. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: This research investigated the differences and disparities of postpartum depression in a sample of African American, Hispanic, Native American, and White women. Methods: A sample of 586 women were administered the Beck-Gable PDSS at 6-weeks postpartum. Factor analysis was applied to analyze the similarities among African American, Hispanic, Native American, and White participants. Confidence intervals of the rates of depression by group were estimated, followed by statistical tests to determine the differences among these rates. Risk assessment was performed with factor analysis and correlation methods. Results: Hispanic women had a remarkably lower depression rate (2.5%) than other groups (P-values < 0.05). Significant differences for major depression were not found among African American, Native American, and White women; but Whites had higher minor depression (P-values < 0.05). Native American women had the highest rate of major depression (18.7%) and an average minor depression (10.5%). Although Whites had the second highest major depression (17.6%) and the highest minor depression (19.6%), their average full score (76.1) was noticeably lower than that of Native Americans (82.9) and slightly lower than that of African Americans (78.9; major and minor depression rates: 14.8% and 9.9%). The sample also demonstrated strong associations of depression with depression history and breastfeeding. Conclusion: Statistically, postpartum depression can be ranked from high to low as Native Americans, Whites, African Americans and Hispanics (Hispanics have remarkably lower depression rates). This information is critically important to clinicians, researchers, agency administrators and social workers who work with these populations. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

AB  - In mammals, which give birth to more or less dependent offspring, parturition usually takes place during the animals' resting period and in a secure environment. We report here the first direct and documented observation of a daytime birth of a wild baby crested black macaque, Macaca nigra, in the Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. We further consider the parturition time as a female reproductive strategy in a broader evolutionary framework. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animal models of prenatal ethanol exposure are necessary to more fully understand the effects of ethanol on the developing embryo/fetus. However most models employ procedures that may produce additional maternal stress beyond that produced by ethanol alone. We employed a daily limited-access ethanol intake model called Drinking in the Dark (DID) to assess the effects of voluntary maternal binge-like ethanol intake on the developing mouse. Evidence suggests that binge exposure may be particularly hannful to the embryo/fetus, perhaps due to the relatively higher blood ethanol concentrations achieved. Pregnant females had mean daily ethanol intakes ranging from 4.2 to 6.4 g/kg ethanol over gestation, producing blood ethanol concentrations ranging from 115 to 182 mg/dL. This level of ethanol intake produced behavioral alterations among adolescent offspring that disappeared by adulthood, including altered sensitivity to ethanol's hypnotic actions. The DID model may provide a useful tool for studying the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure in mice. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Intellect, emotion and intentions, the major components of the human mentality, are neurologically correlated to memory and sensorimotor integration, the neuronal system consisting of the amygdale and hypothalamus, and motivation and learning, respectively. Development of these neuronal processes was evaluated by correlating the pathophysiologies of idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders and developmental courses of sleep parameters, sleep-wake rhythm (SWR), and locomotion. The memory system and sensory pathways develop by the 9th gestational months. Habituation or dorsal bundle extinction (DBE) develop after the 34th gestational week. In the first 4 months after birth, DBE is consolidated and fine tuning of the primary sensory cortex and its neuronal connection to the unimodal sensory association area along with functional lateralization of the cortex are accomplished. After 4 months, restriction of atonia in the REM stage enables the integrative function of the brain and induces synaptogenesis of the cortex around 6 months and locomotion in late infancy by activating the dopaminergic (DA) neurons induces synaptogenesis of the frontal cortex. Locomotion in early infancy involves functional specialization of the cortex and in childhood with development of biphasic SWR activation of the areas of the prefrontal cortex. Development of emotions reflects in the development of personal communication and the arousal function of the hypothalamus. The former is shown in the mother-child relationship in the first 4 months, in communication with adults and playmates in late infancy to early childhood, and in development of social relationships with sympathy by the early school age with functional maturation of the orbitofrontal cortex. The latter is demonstrated in the secretion of melatonin during night time by 4 months, in the circadian rhythm of body temperature by 8 months, and in the secretion of the growth hormone by 4-5 years with synchronization to the SWR modulated by the brainstem aminergic neurons. For this purpose, nursing according to the day-night light-dark cycle is essential right from early infancy. The deep cerebellar nuclei involved in learning develop by the 9th gestational month. The DA neurons activated in late infancy modulate the nuclei of the basal ganglia and the association cortex for learning. Motivation starts with activation of the PPN in infancy by crawling which makes DA neurons as the lead. In late childhood, DA neurons along with 5HT neurons activate the anterior cingulate area and establish the neuronal process for learning with motivation.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of dipper status in women with preeclampsia by comparing arterial stiffness index (SI) values, and dipper and nondipper status. Methods: A total of 60 pregnant women in their third trimester were enrolled in the study. SI values were measured using a digital photoplethysmographic method (Pulse Trace System, Micro Medical Ltd., Gillingham, Kent, UK). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured by a SpaceLabs 90217 oscillometric device (SpaceLabs Inc., Redmond, WA, USA). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) were recorded. Those preeclamptic women whose mean nighttime blood pressure measurements were at least 10% lower compared with mean daytime measurements were classified as dipper status, and those with a decrease of less than 10% were classified as nondipper status. Results: Seventeen women were preeclamptic with a dipper status, 13 women had nondipper status preeclampsia, and 30 women were normotensive. SI values were significantly higher in preeclamptic women compared with normotensive women (8.8±1.2 m/s vs. 5.9±0.8 m/s, P<0.001), but SI values of preeclamptic women with dipper status and preeclamptic women with nondipper status did not differ significantly from each other (P=0.485). Conclusion: There was no significant difference in SI values between the dipper and nondipper preeclamptic groups. These results indicate that dipper and nondipper measurements may not be suitable for clinical follow-up of preeclamptic women.

AB  - Background: Infants exposed prenatally to alcohol are at increased risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Aim: To examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous motor movements in early infancy. Study design: Low-income women (N = 13) were interviewed regarding pre- and pregnancy rates of alcohol, cigarette smoking and other substance use in the perinatal period. Infants were examined in a laboratory nap study using EEG, videography and actigraphy at 6-8 weeks of age. Estimates of maternal pre- and pregnancy alcohol use were used to divide infants into high vs. low maternal alcohol use groups. Subjects: Mother-infant dyads recruited from a family practice clinic. Outcome measures: Sleep-related spontaneous movements, behavioral state, and maternal assessments of infant alertness and irritability. Results: Pre-pregnancy rates of alcohol consumption including binge drinking correlated with maternal report of poor infant alertness, and increased irritability. High maternal exposure groups showed increased sleep fragmentation, e.g. frequency and duration of wakefulness following sleep onset and decreased active sleep. Bout analysis of the temporal structure of sleep-related spontaneous movements showed significantly reduced bout duration associated with high maternal alcohol use. Conclusion: These results present evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts postnatal sleep organization and suppresses spontaneous movements during sleep, and increased sleep fragmentation promotes sleep deprivation. Results are consistent with the SIDS model of chronic sleep debt and suggest that attenuated sleep-related movements should be examined as an important modulator of cardiorespiratory functions during sleep in high-risk groups. © 2008.

AB  - Synchronous with the decline in fertility that took place in the post-war period in the Netherlands, patterns of birth seasonality changed as well. In this paper seasonal fluctuations in fertility in the Netherlands are examined using population register data for the period 1952 to 2005. The peak in births has changed from spring to summer and subsequently to August/September, thereby shifting from the European to the American pattern. The seasonal shift can be attributed to parity-specific changes. Before the transition, birth seasonality did not differ much between the different parities. In the transition period from higher to low fertility, differences between parities increased which persist up to today. At present, the overall seasonality pattern is determined by first births. Moreover, birth seasonality varies by maternal age. The findings stimulate the discussion on the role of planning as a cause of birth seasonality. © 2008 Copyright Cambridge University Press.

However, as there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal well-being have not been done. Aims: To solve these methodological issues, we developed a new sensor with electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration of fetal movement. Methods and results: Experiment I: We verified the reliability of our fetal movement recording system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39 weeks of gestation) were asked to lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a button as a subjective marker when they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously recorded maternal polysomnograms and fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens using a Medilog recorder. The mean of prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for agreements, based on time between fetal movement signals recorded and subjective maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75. Experiment II: We recorded seven pregnant women's polysomnograms and fetal movement simultaneously during all-night sleep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and 36 of gestation. We succeeded in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement. The mean value of the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly larger than that at 36 weeks. Conclusions: There was a high agreement between subjective maternal markers and fetal movement. Our recording system using the new sensor can be used for home monitoring of fetal movement. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypertension is the most common medical disorder in pregnancy. It complicates about 15% of all pregnancies and is an important cause of maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. Hypertension is diagnosed from an absolute rise in blood pressure at or above 140/90 mm of Hg. There is general consensus that severe hypertension should receive pharmacological treatment but the value of treating mild hypertension is controversial. The threshold for treatment is 140-150 mm of Hg systolic and/ or 95-100 mm of Hg diastolic to prevent worsening complications of hypertensive mother. Opinions differ as to which is the best antihypertensive during pregnancy. All antihypertensives are either shown or assumed to cross the placenta and reach foetal circulation. While the goal of treatment is to reduce maternal risk, agents selected must be efficacious and safe for the foetus. Methyldopa and labetolol are considered as the first line antihypertensives. As second line therapy, calcium channel blocker, oral hydralazine are recommended. As third line agent, beta-adrenergic blockers are used. For immediate lowering of blood pressure sublingual Nifidipine, parenteral or oral Labetolol, parenteral Hydralazine are used. Atenolol use should probably be avoided in pregnancy because of its association with low birth weight. Both Angiotensin converting enzymes and Angiotensin receptor blockers are fetotoxic and contraindicated during pregnancy. This review article was done with the aim to update knowledge regarding indication, safety, side effects as well as impact of anti-hypertensives on the foetus.

AB  - Purpose: Black infants die from sudden infant death syndrome at twice the incidence observed among non-Hispanic white infants. Explanations for this disparity include a two-fold greater prevalence of prone (i.e., stomach) infant sleep placement among black caregivers. I test the hypothesis that the contraction of state economies may contribute to this disparity by increasing the risk of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers. Methods: I retrieved data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment series and 33,518 black mothers in 26 states participating in the 1996-2002 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. I use weighted multivariable analyses to control for individual characteristics and state and time trends. Results: Black mothers exhibit an elevated risk of reporting prone placement one month following statewide declines in employment (adjusted odds ratio for a one percent decline = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22). This risk remains elevated after control for individual variables. In contrast, I find no association between the economy and prone placement among white mothers. Conclusions: Statewide economic decline may reduce adherence to the recommended non-prone infant sleep position among black, but not white, mothers. Additional research among black caregivers should determine which mechanisms connect economic downturns to prone infant sleep placement. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus can be controlled and its complications prevented, provided clients take part in self-care actions. The objective of the present study was to identify self care deficiencies in pregnant women suffering from diabetes, and to provide inputs for their educational support. This descriptive study included 12 pregnant women cared at a diabetes and hypertension reference institution in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, in April and May, 2007. Data were collected using a semistructured interview. Analysis was based on Orem's Nursing General Theory. Self-care deficiencies were related to eating habits, physical activities, sleep and rest, and social interaction. Nurses must provide educational support to these patients, evaluate their self-care capacity, and propose actions that involve the family, as well as group activities in health services.

AB  - Sleep disorders affect women differently than they affect men and may have different manifestations and prevalences. With regard to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), variations in symptoms may cause misdiagnoses and delay of appropriate treatment. The prevalence of OSA appears to increase markedly after the time of menopause. Although OSA as defined by the numbers of apneas/hypopneas may be less severe in women, its consequences are similar and perhaps worse. Therapeutic issues related to gender should be factored into the management of OSA. The prevalence of insomnia is significantly greater in women than in men throughout most of the life span. The ratio of insomnia in women to men is approximately 1.4:1.0, but the difference is minimal before puberty and increases steadily with age. Although much of the higher prevalence of insomnia in women may be attributable to the hormonal or psychological changes associated with major life transitions, some of the gender differences may result from the higher prevalence of depression and pain in women. Insomnia's negative impact on quality of life is important to address in women, given the high relative prevalence of insomnia as well as the comorbid disorders in this population. Gender differences in etiology and symptom manifestation in narcolepsy remain understudied in humans. There is little available scientific information to evaluate the clinical significance and specific consequences of the diagnosis of narcolepsy in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs or other limbs during periods of rest or inactivity and may affect as much as 10% of the population. This condition is more likely to afflict women than men, and its risk is increased by pregnancy. Although RLS is associated with impaired quality of life, highly effective treatment is available. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Amino acid infusate (Primene) and insulin euglycemic (insulin + 10% dextrose) clamp techniques were used in the ovine fetus near term and the impact on the incidence of low-voltage and high-voltage electrocortical (ECOG) activities was determined. Fetal sheep were studied over a 2-hour control period and a subsequent 6-hour experimental period.With the Primene infusion, the basic and neutral amino acids were increased by 43% and 25%, respectively, whereas the acidic amino acids showed little change. With the insulin/dextrose infusion, the basic and neutral amino acids decreased by 48% and 30%, respectively, whereas the acidic amino acids were again little changed. A small fall in arterial oxygen saturation and an increase in fetal heart rate for both groups can be attributed to an insulin-mediated increase in fetal metabolic rate. Despite the moderate increases and decreases in circulating amino acid levels, there was no significant change in the mean percent time or duration of fetal ECOG activities for either study group. © 2008 by the Society for Gynecologic Investigation.

AB  - Introduction: Antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has transformed it from a terminal illness to a chronic manageable condition. This review summarizes the history of the treatment and explains the current practice in the field, including uses in prevention strategies. Sources of data: National and international guidelines, important publications in peer reviewed literature and recent important conference abstracts. Areas of agreement: There is a broad agreement on the choice of drug regimens and on the need to treat patients with symptomatic HIV infection and with CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells/mm 3. The need to adapt therapy to individual circumstances is also well accepted, e.g. hepatitis co-infection and pregnancy. Areas of controversy: Treatment of acute HIV infection and the optimum time to commence therapy in asymptomatic chronic infection remain controversial. Use of antiretrovirals for prevention, e.g. pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis, is still developing. Growing points: This article summarizes the current use of anti-HIV medication and the evidence behind it for the non-specialist. Areas timely for developing research: New strategies for using current drugs, the best use of newly available drugs and new uses of antiretroviral drugs, such as in prevention of HIV transmission, are key areas for research. Further research addressing the question of when to start antiretrovirals and assessing their long-term effects is also needed. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Rarely in the history of medicine has an X-linked mental retardation syndrome so thoroughly entered every branch of medicine, at least of pediatrics, but also of internal medicine, on account of its protean manifestations. In such countries as Zambia, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and other infections diseases, and many environmental and nutritional disorders still top the list of childhood morbidity and mortality. However, in the more developed nations of the Old and New Worlds, prematurity, birth defects, and genetic conditions constitute the major burden of infant mortality and chronic childhood handicaps. One of the most pervasive of these is the group of FG syndromes seen in every pediatric clinic and mental health service. A partial list includes:Peri- and neonatology: prematurity, breech and cesarean section delivery, intrauterine growth retardation, congenital hypotonia, difficulties in neonatal adaptation, feeding difficulties, reflux with or without aspiration, failure to thrive, single umbilical artery, infant deathOtology/otorhinolaryngology: severe congenital sensorineural deafness; chronic recurrent otitis; sinusitis and tonsillitis (tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy), stridor/laryngomalacia; grade 1 laryngeal cleft with or without subglottic stenosis; cleft palate; rare choanal stenosis; almost universal narrowing of ear canals with frequent need to remove wax; short lingual frenulum, labiogingival frenulum; conductive hearing lossOphthalmology: strabismus, congenital nystagmus; large corneae; stenosis of nasolacrymal ducts; lack of tearing; ptosis; blepharophimosis with inturned eyelashes and corneal irritation; errors of refraction, cobolomataAllergy: almost universal reactive airway disease; sometimes eczema, generally rather mildPulmonology: aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis; sleep apneas and other sleep disturbances that may require continuous positive airway pressure.Gastroenterology: reflux (Nissen), feeding difficulties and failure to thrive (G-button), constipation, diarrhea, pyloric stenosis, and rectal stenosisUrology [61]: hypospadias, inguinal hernia(e), cryptorchidism, hydrocele, renal anomalies, neurogenic bladder, nephrolithiasisCardiology: patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, (peripheral) pulmonic stenosis, left superior vena cava, conduction defects, autonomic vascular problems, postnatal hypotension, acrocyanosis/RaynaudGeneral surgery: umbilical hernia, rare diaphragmatic herniaNeurosurgery: Chiari I (beyond 10 mm [62]), syringomyelia, tethered cord, cervical vertebral malformations, rarely true hydrocephalusRadiology: for "everything," brain MRI and cine-MRI of lower cord recommended in all FGS children, boys and girlsOrthopedics: ectrodactyly, polysyndactyly, duplication of thumb, congenital clubfeet, syndactyly, patellar subluxation, hypotonic scoliosis, hypotonic pectus excavatum, unstable hipsPlastic surgery: helmet for congenital plagiocephaly/torticollis; occasional hemangiomataDermatology: pigmentary dysplasias, nevi, warts, melanoma surveillancePhysical therapy: hypotonia, hypotonic diplegia, motor delayOccupational therapy: defects of sensory integration (especially oral tactile aversion), feeding therapy, autistic manifestations.Speech therapy: virtually universal speech delayPsychology: evaluation of behavior, autism, cognitive/psychomotor development; psychologic therapyPsychiatry: evaluation for "autism," behavior and emotional problems (ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder; bipolar disorder), psychopharmacology, psychotherapyHematology: follow-up of those with neonatal anemia, neutropenia/leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and other platelet disordersInfectious disease and rheumatology: immune deficiencies toward potential intravenous immunoglobulin treatment [63], recurrent viral infections, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, bronchiolitis.Pediatric genetics: cytogenetics, molecular genetics, FGS carrier testing, genetic counselingObstetrics and gynecology: Pregnancies in known FGS carriers require most careful surveillance and such women must be considered at high risk after a prior complicated outcome. In the process, the carrier woman may be discovered to have a uterine malformation (uterus bicornis, septate, duplex) and an unusually short perineal body. There is a much higher probability of cesarean delivery for hypotonia, cephalic dystocia, fetal distress, breech or transverse presentation, failure to progress, and other reasons. Soon molecular prenatal diagnosis will be possible.Pathology: At autopsy a stillborn male infant or fetus with evident congenital hypotonia, hypertelorism, hypospadias, broad thumbs, and halluces. Parents are not present to give a family history and the case may end up being coded "multiple congenital anomalies, chromosomes (apparently) normal," with no further causal analysis. In the fetal genetic pathology service at the University of Utah, we have begun to add the sentence: "Consider possibility of FG syndrome and referral to genetics." This takes into account the frequent note of fetal or infant death in FGS sibships evaluated in the pediatric genetics, and the findings in the last three syndromal infant cases referred by the Utah medical examiner, one dying of overwhelming sepsis with dehydration, failure to thrive, and severe constipation after formula change to Neocate with over 100 rock-hard sciboli in colon, and several affected sibs with FGS. Another male died suddenly 1 day after cochlear implant with pronounced congenital hypotonia and megalencephaly. Another was a "sudden infant death" in a male with congenital hypotonia, large head, and urethral megameatus. Thus, in our experience FGS emerges as the most common yet the least known developmental disabilities condition in our society. FGS imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity, and to some extent also of mortality, on society and families. After successful neonatal adaptation, such recurring problems as otitis, reactive airway disease, and constipation can be routinely treated symptomatically. However, the neurodevelopmental burden represents the greatest challenge that FGS presents for families and to society. Under the best of circumstances, motor and speech development catch up. However, virtually all FGS children, boys and girls, have difficulties in psychologic development, school performance, and ultimate emotional adaptation to adult life and social integration. The many such cases added to those with outright psychiatric disturbances are overwhelming social, psychologic, and psychiatric services and, above all, public and private school systems, which are understaffed, underfunded, beyond formulating individual educational plans, and helpless to deal with the enormous burden of special service needs of these children. It's time that handicapped children receive care according to needs and not according to diagnosis. However, the near absence of information on FGS available to these professionals is a handicap in arriving at a specific diagnosis (allowing state and federal support for special services) and in understanding the prognosis, natural history, and such complications as "autism," seizures, and tethered cord that affect the child's success at home, in school, and out in society. The FGS parent support group has been of enormous help in informing families about all of these "issues," and to this day remains the greatest repository of knowledge on FGS. As they say in baseball, it is time at long last for the professionals "to step up to the plate.". © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Fetal heart rate (FHR) variation and fetal movements show a diurnal rhythm, a rise in the afternoon and evening compared to morning hours. A previous study showed that reductions in fetal parameters occurring two to three days after betamethasone administration are most likely caused by suppression of the normal rise during the day. Therefore monitoring during the morning could circumvent the suppressive effects of betamethasone. Objective. To study the effects of betamethasone on fetal diurnal rhythms, by comparing morning and afternoon recordings over five successive days. Methods. This was a prospective longitudinal study of 20 women at 25-34 weeks of gestation. One-hour recordings of FHR and fetal movements were made on each of five successive days in the morning and afternoon. Betamethasone was administered on day 0 and day 1. Results. We found no reduction of FHR variation on days 2 and 3 in the morning. In contrast, in the afternoon a reduction of FHR variation occurred on day 2. Time courses of fetal body and breathing movements during the morning were not affected by betamethasone administration. Conclusions. Transient reductions in fetal movement and FHR variation after glucocorticoid administration are not observed in the morning. For fetal monitoring and especially for assessing trends in fetal heart rate variation and movements with time, morning recordings should be preferably used in the period around glucocorticoid administration. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To analyze whether previously identified risk factors for sudden death syndrome have a significant impact in a developing country. Methods: Retrospective longitudinal case-control study carried out in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. Cases (N=39) were infants born between 1996 and 2000 who died suddenly and unexpectedly at home during sleep and were diagnosed with sudden death syndrome. Controls (N=117) were infants matched by age and sex who died in hospitals due to other conditions. Data were collected from postmortem examination records and questionnaires answers. A conditional logistic model was used to identify factors associated with the outcome. Results: Mean age at death of cases was 3.2 months. The frequencies of infants regarding gestational age, breastfeeding and regular medical visits were similar in both groups. Sleeping position for most cases and controls was the lateral one. Supine sleeping position was found for few infants in both groups. Maternal variables, age below 20 years (OR=2, 95% CI: 1.1; 5.1) and smoking of more than 10 cigarettes per day during pregnancy (OR=3, 95% CI: 1.3; 6.4), significantly increased the risk for the syndrome. Socioeconomic characteristics were similar in both groups and did not affect risk. Conclusions: Infant-maternal and socioeconomic profiles of cases in a developing country closely resembled the profile described in the literature, and risk factors were similar as well. However, individual characteristics were identified as risks, in the population studied, such as smoking during pregnancy and maternal age below 20 years.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the variation of normal maternal temperature during labour. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: Two hospitals in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Population: All women with a live singleton pregnancy and a gestational age of 36 weeks or more admitted to the delivery ward from June 2000 to January 2002. Methods: Maternal temperature was measured rectally every 2-3 hours from admission until the beginning of second stage, and 1-hour postpartum. Normal labour (n = 843) was defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks, spontaneous onset of labour, rupture of membranes <18 hours before birth, normal progress of labour without the need for augmentation or epidural analgesia and spontaneous vaginal delivery of a healthy infant. The remaining group was classified as abnormal (n = 2209). Main outcome measures: Rectal measured temperature in degrees Celsius. Results: The mean temperature during labour in the complete study population increased from 37.1°C at the beginning of labour to 37.4°C after 22 hours. Temperature in the abnormal labour group was equal to the normal labour group during the first 3 hours of labour (P > 0.05) but increased thereafter. Conclusions: At the beginning of labour, temperature was 37.1°C. Temperature increased slowly during labour and was 37.4°C (2SD 1.2) after 22 hours. The upper 2SD limit for normal temperature did not follow a circadian pattern and time of day is not relevant for the classification of normal versus elevated temperature. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate pregnancy-associated sleep disorders, pregnancy outcomes and inflammatory markers in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy (control). Patients and methods: We studied 15 consecutive pre-eclamptic women and 14 controls. Pre-eclamptic women underwent overnight pulse oximetry and nasal pressure measurements at a university teaching hospital, and the sleep study for the controls was performed at home. Mean gestation was 31 weeks. Nasal airflow was carefully analyzed visually, and the time with flow limitation was calculated as a percentage of total recording time. At the time of the sleep study, the subjects were clinically evaluated, they answered sleep questionnaires, and fasting blood samples were drawn for tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and sensitive C-reactive protein. Pregnancy outcomes were collected after delivery. Results: Pre-eclampsia patients spent significantly more time with flow limitation (mean ± SD: 21 ± 18% vs. 4 ± 9%), had higher plasma levels of TNF-α (6.2 ± 2.3 ng/l vs. 4.1 ± ng/l) and IL-6 (4.4 ± ng/l vs. 1.2 ± 0.4 ng/l), had more generalized edema, had increased fatigue and snoring, and had poorer pregnancy outcomes than did controls. Age, gestational age, mean SpO2 and body mass index did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia showed significantly more nasal flow limitation during the night, higher fasting IL-6 and TNF-α plasma levels, more edema and worse pregnancy outcomes than did healthy pregnant women. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure via maternal liquid diet consumption by C57BL/6 (B6) mice causes conspicuous midline neural tube deficit (dysraphia) and disruption of genesis and development of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei, together with brain growth retardation. The current study tested the hypothesis that concurrent treatment with either an activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) agonist peptide [SALLRSIPA, (SAL)] or an activity-dependent neurotrophic protein (ADNP) agonist peptide [NAPVSIPQ, (NAP)] would protect against these alcohol-induced deficits in brain development. Methods: Timed-pregnant B6 dams consumed alcohol from embryonic day 7 (E7, before the onset of neurulation) until E15. Fetuses were obtained on E15 and brain sections processed for 5-HT immunocytochemistry, for evaluation of morphologic development of the brainstem raphe and its 5-HT neurons. Additional groups were treated either with SAL or NAP daily from E7 to E15 to assess the potential protective effects of these peptides. Measures of incomplete occlusion of the ventral canal and the frequency and extent of the openings in the rhombencephalon were obtained to assess fetal dysraphia. Counts of 5-HT-immunostained neurons were also obtained in the rostral and caudal raphe. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in abnormal openings along the midline and delayed closure of ventral canal in the brainstem. This dysraphia was associated with reductions in the number of 5-HT neurons both in the rostral raphe nuclei (that gives rise to ascending 5-HT projections) and in the caudal raphe (that gives rise to the descending 5-HT projections). Concurrent treatment of the alcohol-consuming dams with SAL prevented dysraphia and protected against the alcohol-induced reductions in 5-HT neurons in both the rostral and caudal raphe. NAP was less effective in protecting against dysraphia and did not protect against 5-HT loss in the rostral raphe, but did protect against loss in the caudal raphe. Conclusions: These findings further support the potential usefulness of these peptides for therapeutic interventions in pregnancies at risk for alcohol-induced developmental deficits. Notably, the ascending 5-HT projections of the rostral raphe have profound effects in regulating forebrain development and function, and the descending 5-HT projections of the caudal raphe are critical for regulating respiration. Protection of the rostral 5-HT-system may help prevent structural and functional deficits linked to abnormal forebrain development, and protection of the caudal systems may also reduce the increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

AB  - Objectives: Previously published data from the Cleveland Children's Sleep and Health Study demonstrated that preterm infants are especially vulnerable both to sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and its neurocognitive sequelae at age 8 to 11 years. In this analysis, we aimed to identify the components of the neonatal medical history associated with childhood SDB among children born prematurely. Study design: This analysis focuses on the 383 children in the population-based cohort from the Cleveland Children's Sleep and Health Study who were born <37 weeks gestational age and who had technically acceptable sleep studies performed at ages 8 to 11 years (92% of all preterm children). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between candidate perinatal and neonatal risk factors and the presence of childhood SDB by sleep study. Results: Twenty-eight preterm children (7.3%) met the definition for SDB at age 8 to 11 years. Having a single mother and mild maternal preeclampsia were strongly associated with SDB in unadjusted and race-adjusted models. Unadjusted analyses also identified xanthine use and cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation in the delivery room as potential risk-factors for SDB. We did not find a significant link between traditional markers of severity of neonatal illness-such as gestational age, birth weight, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or duration of ventilation-and childhood SDB at school age. Conclusions: These results represent a first step in identifying prenatal and neonatal characteristics that place preterm infants at higher risk for childhood SDB. The strong association between mild preeclampsia and childhood SDB underscores the importance of research aimed at understanding in utero risk factors for neurorespiratory development. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Restless-legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movements and is exacerbated or occurs at night and in the evening. RLS sufferers represent 2 to 3% of the general population in Western countries. Supportive criteria include a family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. The RLS phenotypes include an early onset form, usually idiopathic with a familial history and a late onset form, usually secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Recently, an atypical RLS phenotype without PLM and l-DOPA resistant has been characterized. RLS can occur in childhood and should be distinguished from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, growing pains and sleep complaints in childhood. RLS should be included in the diagnosis of all patients consulting for sleep complaints or discomfort in the lower limbs. It should be differentiated from akathisia, that is, an urge to move the whole body without uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test can detect PLM. Furthermore, an l-DOPA challenge has recently been validated to support the diagnosis of RLS. RLS may cause severe-sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In most cases, RLS is idiopathic. It may also be secondary to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. The small-fiber neuropathy can mimic RLS or even trigger it. RLS is associated with many neurological and sleep disorders including Parkinson's disease, but does not predispose to these diseases. The pathophysiology of RLS includes an altered brain-iron metabolism, a dopaminergic dysfunction, a probable role of pain control systems and a genetic susceptibility with nine loci and three polymorphisms in genes serving developmental functions. RLS treatment begins with the elimination of triggering factors and iron supplementation when deficient. Mild or intermittent RLS is usually treated with low doses of l-DOPA or codeine; the first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS is dopaminergic agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim. This paper is a report on a study identifying trajectories of childbirth-related fatigue intensity changes over time and the influencing factors related to specific trajectory patterns. Background. Childbirth is a period of time that encompasses considerable physiological and psychological fatigue, often having an adverse impact on women in labour. Empirical studies on this issue are scarce. How childbirth-related fatigue changes over time, and factors influencing fatigue development, remain unclear. Method. A prospective, correlational design with repeated measures was used. Data were collected by self-reported measures and laboratory analysis of blood specimens. From December 2004 to November 2005 a convenience sample of 209 low-risk pregnant Taiwanese women was followed throughout the labour process. Repeated measures of fatigue were analysed by using a semiparametric mixture model. Variables explaining trajectory class membership were identified by means of logistic regression. Results. Two distinct trajectories of childbirth-related fatigue were identified: low intensity (30.8% of women) and high intensity (69.2% of women). Fatigue level of both classes intensified following labour. The fastest period of fatigue-increasing rate was in the active phase. After birth, fatigue levels in the high-fatigue intensity class remained high. Primiparas in the high-fatigue intensity class experienced significantly more anxiety and higher lactate concentration at admission than the low-intensity class. Conclusion. Caregivers should endeavour to prevent high levels of fatigue once women enter the labour phase. Women who present with high fatigue at onset of labour should be targeted for early intervention, especially in the period of rapid fatigue increase. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: Catecholamines may contribute to the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). TH01, a tetrameric short tandem repeat marker in the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, regulates gene expression and catecholamine production. Study design: We investigated TH01 in 172 German Caucasian SIDS cases and 390 sex- and age-matched control subjects. Results: The *9.3 alleles were more frequent in patients with SIDS than in control subjects (40.12% vs 31.15%; P = .006). For homozygotes the odds ratio was 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-3.05), for carriers 1.58 (1.09-2.28). Moreover, *9.3 alleles were significantly more frequent during the winter (47.73% vs 35.38% in the warmer seasons), and the frequency of *9.3 alleles varied significantly with the age at death (weeks 7 to 12: 49.04% vs 29.63% within the first 6 weeks). Other risk factors (sleeping position, gestation, smoking) had no significant impact on the frequency of *9.3. Conclusions: Our results indicate a relationship between SIDS and TH01 genotype, presumably caused by an impairment of breathing regulation or arousal. We propose that noradrenalinergic neuronal activity contributes to the cause of a major subset of SIDS victims. Moreover, the results further stress that SIDS is a highly heterogenic group. © 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Syndrome of restless legs is a well defined complex clinical unit characterized by the disorders of sleep and movement. Clinical symptoms are dominated by severe and urging need of moving one's legs. The provoking factors embrace motoric inactivity coming on evenings and nights, whereas relief is brought along by walking, moving the extremities. Common accompanying phenomena include sleep disorders associated with excessive fatigues and drowsiness. The diagnosis of the syndrome of restless legs is based mainly on anamnestic data. It is necessary to exclude secondary syndrome most common in iron deficiency, renal failure and pregnancy. The treatment is complex, in more serious cases pharmacotherapy is indicated. The drug of first choice involves substances with dopaminergic effect - levodopa - dopamin receptor agonists. Opiods or anticonvulsants are considered as alternative treatment.

AB  - The hypothesis of the dynamics of aging on the chronobiological grounds is presented. The results of the original research are demonstrated as well as the conclusions made by the leading authorities in the human individual annual and perennial endogenous cycles are treated. Risk-zones, which tend to increase the possibility of "mistakes" in a genetic program that lead to aging of organism are proposed. The data obtained could provide an opinion of existing both the perennial and annual endogenous cycles, that begin from the moment of conception and include nine months of the embryo period and three months after the date of birth. The data available provide a ground for a hypothesis verifying the trimester time-genetic program of the endogenous year. The "mistakes" in the chronobiological program emerging as the reaction on the environment during the periods of intensive growth of metabolic process are supposed to be one of the essential causes of aging and early death.

AB  - While the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) is typically complex, the treatment of women with bipolar disorder is even more challenging because clinicians must also individualize treatment based on the potential for pregnancy, drug interactions with oral contraceptives, and an increased risk of endocrine diseases that can either impact the course of illness or become manifest with some treatments. Women with BD should be checked for hypothyroidism, and if prescribed antidepressants, carefully watched for rapid cycling or a mood switch to mania, hypomania, or a mixed state. Several medications interact with oral contraceptives or increase the risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome. Consideration of possible pregnancy is essential, and should be planned in advance whenever possible. Rates of recurrence have been shown to be equal in pregnant and nonpregnant women with BD. Risks of medication to the fetus at various points of development must be balanced against the risks of not treating, which is also detrimental to both fetus and mother. The postpartum period is a time of especially high risk; as many as 40% to 67% of women with BD report experiencing a postpartum mania or depression. The decision to breastfeed must also take into account the adverse impact of sleep deprivation in triggering mood episodes. In order to best address these issues, clinicians must be familiar with the data and collaborate with the patient to assess risks and benefits for the individual women and her family. © 2008, LLS SAS.

AB  - Chemical and enzymatic methods are used to measure creatinine in serum and urine. Chemical methods are mostly based on the reaction of creatinine with alkaline picrate (Jaffe reaction). The Jaffe reaction is not specific for creatinine, the same reaction resulting in Jaffe-like chromogens show many interfering substances (ascorbic acid, bilirubin, proteins, ketones, cephalosporins and other drugs). Chemical and enzymatic methods show similar accuracy and day-to-day precision. Chemical methods are cheaper than enzymatic methods. Enzymatic methods require low sample volume and are not affected by the interfering substances as the chemical methods. Presented case report shows an unusual occurrence of drug interference in the enzymatic creatine deaminase procedure. Biological factors (circadian rhythm, pregnancy, hemodialysis, transplantation, stress, exercise), analytical and preanalytical factors (pH, glucose, pyruvate, bilirubin, fatty acids, sample storage and sample collection - gel tubes) and biological variability of creatinine play significant role in the creatinine examination.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome is a common neurologic movement disorder that affects approximately 10 percent of adults. Of those affected with this condition, approximately one third have symptoms severe enough to require medical therapy. Restless legs syndrome may be a primary condition, or it may be secondary to iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, or the use of certain medications. The diagnosis is clinical, requiring an urge to move the legs usually accompanied by an uncomfortable sensation, occurrence at rest, improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome causes sleep disturbances, is associated with anxiety and depression, and has a negative effect on quality of life. Treatment of secondary causes of restless legs syndrome may result in improvement or resolution of symptoms. Currently, there is little information regarding the effects of lifestyle changes on the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. If medications are needed, dopamine agonists are the primary medications for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome. Other medications that may be effective include gabapentin, carbidopa/levodopa, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Copyright © 2008 American Academy of Family Physicians.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the influence of changes in the atmospheric state on the incidence of preterm delivery (PTD) and preterm premature rupture of membrane (PPROM). Study Design: The hospital records of PTD and/or PPROM over the year 1999 were reviewed. The current meteorological state was described by a set of parameters and their diurnal and seasonal variations. Multivariate analysis, time series approach and Poisson regression were used. Result: PTD occurrence was correlated with humidity and maximum temperature (P<0.01), its rise preceded their sharp variations by 3 days (P<0.01). PPROM was influenced by the variations in the weather state: desert heat wave arrival (P=0.093), strong winds, overall daily differences of humidity and temperature (all with P<0.05). Conclusion: The rates of PTD and PPROM are affected by an ensemble of meteorological variables, specific for each disorder. Obstetricians should be aware of the influence of unstable weather on PTD and PPROM rates, especially in the spring and autumn.

AB  - Background: It is widely accepted that circadian physiological rhythms of the fetus are affected by oscillators in the maternal brain that are coupled to the environmental light-dark (LD) cycle. Methodology/Prindpal Findings: To study the link between fetal and maternal biological clocks, we investigated the effects of cycles of maternal food availability on the rhythms of Per1 gene expression in the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver using a transgenic rat model whose tissues express luciferase in vitro. Although the maternal 5CN remained phase-locked to the LD cycle, maternal restricted feeding phase-advanced the fetal SCN and liver by 5 and 7 hours respectively within the 22-day pregnancy. Conclusions:/Significant: Our results demonstrate that maternal feeding entrains the fetal SCN and liver independently of both the maternal SCN and the LD cycle. This indicates that maternal-feeding signals can be more influential for the fetal SCN and particular organ oscillators than hormonal signals controlled by the maternal SCN, suggesting the importance of a regular maternal feeding schedule for appropriate fetal molecular clockwork during pregnancy. © 2008 Ohta et al.

AB  - The practice of shift-work scheduling has long been part of normal work duties in emergency services such as health and security. It is only recently, in the wake of growing job opportunities and booming industries, where more employees are needed to keep services running over 24-hour periods that studies on the effects of shift work on workers' health have begun to delve deeper. The desynchronisation that occurs in circadian rhythms, with respect to sleep cycles, predisposes employees to coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal disturbances, increased risk of breast cancer and poor pregnancy outcomes. This literature review focuses on circadian rhythms, their molecular components, disturbances of these rhythms as a result of shift work and the adverse effects thereof on the cardiovascular system.

AB  - Contents: Maintenance of high levels of realized fertility (defined as the percentage of ewes that lamb) and appropriate levels of fecundity are critical for efficient sheep production. The optimal level of fecundity in most situations is well below the maximum attainable level and can be targeted by combining selection among and within breeds with use of an expanding array of single-gene mutations affecting ovulation rate and litter size. The heritability of litter size is approximately 0.10, allowing changes of up to 2%/year from simple mass selection. Mutations in several genes associated with the transforming growth factor β superfamily (BMPRIB, GDF9 and sex-linked BMP15) can increase ovulation rates by 0.7-1.5 ova in heterozygous ewes. However, ewes that are homozygous for BMP15 or GDF9 mutations are sterile, so use of these mutations requires carefully structured breeding programmes. Improvements in fertility may be critical for autumn lambing or programmes that aspire to lamb throughout the year. Selection to improve fertility in spring matings has been successful; selected adult ewes have lambing rates of 80-85% in October and early November. The selected ewes have a dramatically reduced seasonal anestrus, and many ewes continue to cycle during spring and summer. Major genes affecting seasonal breeding have not been identified in sheep. Polymorphisms in the melatonin receptor 1a gene appear to be associated with seasonal breeding in some, but not all breeds. However, functional genomic studies of genes associated with circadian and circannual rhythms have potential to reveal additional candidate genes involved in seasonal breeding. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Neonatal exposure of rats to bisphenol-A, an endocrine disruptor, has recently been proposed as a possible animal model of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), because such rats exhibit motor hyperactivity. To strengthen the face validity of this animal model, the present study replicated the original experiments and additionally analysed both changes in habituation to a novel environment and behavioural responses to methylphenidate, the two phenomena known to be altered in ADHD. Single intracisternal administration of bisphenol-A (20 and 40 μg) into 5-day-old male Wistar rats impaired habituation to a novel environment in the light, but not the dark, phase at 4 weeks of age. Thus, habituation as assessed by time-dependent decrease of locomotor activity, rearing, sniffing and grooming was significantly reduced in bisphenol-A-pretreated rats. Methylphenidate (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently enhanced locomotor activity in both vehicle-pretreated and bisphenol-A-pretreated rats during both the dark and the light phases. Thus, the effects of methylphenidate did not differ between bisphenol-A-pretreated and vehicle-pretreated rats. Apart from a slight methylphenidate-induced increase in rearing and sniffing in bisphenol-A (20 μg)-pretreated rats, the overall effects of methylphenidate on rearing, sniffing and grooming were similar in both vehicle- and bisphenol-A-pretreated rats. It is concluded that neonatal exposure of rats to bisphenol-A is an animal model with limited face validity for ADHD, because the motor hyperactivity and reduced habituation to a novel environment are not accompanied by altered responses to methylphenidate. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Aim: To compare the effects of fetal buprenorphine and methadone exposure during maintenance treatment of pregnant heroin dependent subjects. Design and setting: A population based comparison of consecutive, prospectively followed buprenorphine-exposed pregnancies in Stockholm County, Sweden, to retrospectively analyzed consecutive methadone-exposed pregnancies. Participants: All 47 pregnancies in 39 women with opiate dependence and buprenorphine maintenance treatment 2001-2006, and all 35 methadone-exposed pregnancies (26 women) 1982-2006 in Stockholm County. Measurements: Intrauterine growth, birth outcome, malformations, neonatal adaptation, withdrawal syndrome and infant mortality. Findings: Buprenorphine-exposed pregnancies resulted in 47 uneventful live births (2 twin pairs), 1 stillbirth (for which no explanation was found) and 1 miscarriage. The birth weight of the infants was normal. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurred in 19 cases (40.4%), the majority mild in nature and only 7 (14.9%) needing withdrawal treatment. Compared to 35 infants born after intrauterine methadone exposure at the same hospital since 1982 (77.8% of them exhibiting NAS and 52.8% needing withdrawal treatment), there were significant advantages with buprenorphine treatment: birth weight was higher, due to longer gestation. Incidence of NAS of any intensity, as well as incidence of NAS that required pharmacological treatment was lower, while length of hospital stay was shorter. When buprenorphine treatment started pre-conception, NAS at any level was significantly less frequent than in subjects with post-conception initiated treatment (7/27, 26%; 12/20, 60%, respectively). Conclusions: Data from this non-randomized comparison suggest that buprenorphine may offer advantages for treatment of opiate dependence during pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex ≥95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12 m, and 31% of infants slept <12 h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight. © 2008 The Obesity Society.

AB  - Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is one of the most common undiagnosed diseases. The incidence in India has been reported to be much less as compared to the West. RLS is considered as an organic neurological disorder with a genetic cause, modulated by the metabolism of iron. Most of the patients with RLS present with an urge to move and uncomfortable sensations. There are no established guidelines regarding treatment recommendations for RLS. Several substances are currently available such as dopaminergic agents, opioids, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, iron, adenosine, adrenergic drugs, magnesium, and others.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of maternal pinealectomy and postnatal pinealectomy on affective responses. Siberian hamsters were born to either pinealectomized or sham-operated dams and then underwent pinealectomy or a sham operation. Maternal pinealectomy increased depressive-like responses of offspring in the forced swim test. Maternal pinealectomy increased rearing behaviour and postnatal pinealectomy increased locomotor behaviour in the open field test. These results suggest that prenatal melatonin organizes adult affective responses. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To determine the influence of lamb presence on the dairy ewes circadian system we monitored simultaneously 16 different parameters (insulin, glucose, total protein, urea, cholesterol, triglycerides, total bilirubine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, rectal temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate). Sixteen clinically healthy Sarda breed dairy ewes, divided into two groups, group A with their lambs and group B without their lambs, were used. Data collection was done at 3 hourly intervals over a 24-h period. Our results indicate that lamb presence influences ewes metabolism, inducing modifications of the acrophase and robustness of the rhythm of some physiological variables. Most variables lost the rhythmicity that they show in not pregnant and not lactating ewes. Lamb presence also influenced urea circadian rhythm: the time of urea peak was shifted from 16:00 to 12:24±00:35 when ewes were housed with lambs, and on triglycerides circadian rhythm.

AB  - Over the past 40 years, it has been recognised that the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis undergoes adaptations through pregnancy and lactation that might contribute to avoidance of adverse effects of stress on the mother and offspring. The extent of the global adaptations in the HPA axis has been revealed and the underlying mechanisms investigated within the last 20 years. Both basal, including the circadian rhythm, and stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid secretory patterns are altered. Throughout most of pregnancy, and in lactation, these changes predominantly reflect reduced drive by the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurones in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). An accompanying profound attenuation of HPA axis responses to a wide variety of psychological and physical stressors emerges after mid-pregnancy and persists until the end of lactation. Central to this suppression of stress responsiveness is reduced activation of the pPVN CRF neurones. This is consequent on the reduced effectiveness of the stimulation of brainstem afferents to these CRF neurones (for physical stressors) and of altered processing by limbic structures (for emotional stressors). The mechanism of reduced CRF neurone responses to physical stressors in pregnancy is the suppression of noradrenaline release in the PVN by an up-regulated endogenous opioid mechanism, which is induced by neuroactive steroid produced from progesterone. By contrast, in lactation suckling the young provides a neural stimulus that dampens the HPA axis circadian rhythm and reduces stress responses. Reduced noradrenergic input activity is involved in reduced stress responses in lactation, although central prolactin action also appears important. Such adaptations limit the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure on the foetus(es) and facilitate appropriate metabolic and immune responses. © 2008 The Author.

AB  - Background: We hypothesized that voluntary counselling and testing during pregnancy are necessary but not sufficient to provide the holistic psychosocial support needed by Jamaican women living with HIV and/or AIDS. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated a range of coping methods and support systems used by HIV-infected women and a group of their HIV-negative counterparts before, during and immediately after their pregnancies. Methods: Women attending obstetric clinics in urban Jamaica completed a quantitative survey aimed at discovering coping behaviours, social and spiritual support systems. Pre-survey focus group studies and key informant interviews contributed to the design of the questionnaire while post-survey focus groups were used to probe the validity of the data gleaned from the questionnaire survey. Survey data were analyzed using non-parametric tests for trend with independent univariate tests. Results: Fifty-five HIV-infected women and 51 HIV-negative women completed the survey. Compared with HIV-negative women, more HIV-infected women reported both feeling depressed (p = 0.07) and having difficulty concentrating (p = 0.05) during the month immediately prior to the study. Other statistically significant differences included: HIV-infected women were more likely to pray, to sleep and to change eating habits in response to worry and stress (p = 0.001 in each instance). Although several women declared religious faith, significantly fewer HIV-infected women were willing to talk to a religious leader about their problems compared to their HIV-negative counterparts (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Participation of HIV-infected women in post-survey focus groups augmented the survey findings. Many of the women reported negative emotions and some indicated serious challenges in accessing social support. The results point to the need for systematic documentation of psychosocial profiles as part of the approach to caring for these women. In addition, in the Jamaican sociocultural context, we recommend improved training of religious leaders and healthcare providers in psychosocial issues.

AB  - Objective: : To study the association between diurnal variation in blood pressure, the mean daily blood pressure and various complications of pregnancy in patients presenting with severe pre-eclampsia before 34 weeks' gestation. Study design: : Forty-four women presenting to a tertiary hospital in South Africa with severe pre-eclampsia between 28 and 34 weeks' gestation were managed expectantly for at least 8 days. We measured maternal blood pressure every 30 min with the pregnancy validated Spacelabs 90209 automated blood pressure monitor for 24 h periods on alternative days. The mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure measurement, the mean diastolic blood pressure for daytime and nighttime, the day-night blood pressure difference and the night-day ratio were compared with the occurrence of abruptio placentae, gestational age at delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission, birth weight, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler FVW and reason for delivery. Results: : One hundred and seventy-six 24-h studies were analyzed. The day-night blood pressure difference decreased with increasing mean diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.323, p < 0.0001). A combination of normal mean diastolic blood pressure and normal day-night blood pressure difference was associated with increased gestational age and lower caesarean section rates. Conclusion: : The combination of mean diastolic blood pressure and day-night blood pressure difference may be a supplementary measurement of disease severity in early onset severe pre-eclampsia and seems to be of prognostic value. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder. It is generally an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. Patients with RLS suffer from sensory and motor symptoms evoked in the limbs at rest. Symptoms are worse at rest, are relieved by movement, and increase in the evening and during the night. The diagnosis is based primarily on the following four essential criteria: (1) an urge to move, usually associated with paresthesias, (2) onset or exacerbation of symptoms at rest, (3) relief of symptoms with movement, and (4) symptoms manifesting in a circadian pattern. Family history is present. The prevalence of RLS increases with age and is more prevalent in women than in men. RLS can be divided into primary and secondary forms, which are generally related to the age of onset. Well-documented secondary causes of RLS include pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, and iron deficiency. Most of the RLS pathophysiology work has focused on the dopamine and iron systems. The differential diagnosis of RLS includes both movement and sleep disorders. Effective treatment is available. Treatment of RLS begins with an assessment of potential factors in the patient's life that may aggravate RLS. These factors must be detected and must be either eliminated or modified. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective and relieves symptoms rapidly. However, assessing the most bothersome symptoms and quantifying the severity of RLS are important because not all patients require medical therapy. Treatment should be individualized to suit each patient's needs. Copyright © 2008 by Türk Tibbi Rehabilitasyon Kurumu Derneǧi.

AB  - For the first time, the relationship between depressive symptoms and sleep quality was explored prospectively during pregnancy. Participants (n = 273) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression Inventory at three 8-week intervals, starting from 15-23 weeks gestation. In addition to sleep quality and depression remaining relatively stable during pregnancy, findings revealed that sleep quality earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy (after controlling for prior depression levels). In contrast, there was no evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy impacted on sleep quality later on. Given that depressive symptomatology can lead to major depression and given the prevalence of pre- and postnatal depression, our findings suggest that screening for sleep problems during pregnancy may be of clinical significance. © 2008 European Sleep Research Society.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N = 215) at 15-25 weeks gestation completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research, paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem; self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

AB  - Oncofertility is one of the 9 NIH Roadmap Initiatives, federal grants intended to explore previously intractable questions, and it describes a new field that exists in the liminal space between cancer treatment and its sequelae, IVF clinics and their yearning, and basic research in cell growth, biomaterials, and reproductive science and its tempting promises. Cancer diagnoses, which were once thought universally fatal, now often entail management of a chronic disease. Yet the therapies are rigorous, must start immediately, and in many cases result in premature failure of the body's reproductive ability. In women, this loss is especially poignant; unlike the routine storage of sperm, which is done in men and boys facing similar treatment decisions, freezing oocytes in anticipation of fertility loss is not possible in most cases, and creating an embryo within days of diagnosis raises significant moral, social and medical challenges. Oncofertility is the study of how to harvest ovarian tissue in women facing cancer to preserve their gametes for future use with IVF, thus allowing the decisions about childbearing to be deferred and reproductive choices to be preserved. The research endeavor uses the capacity of the ovarian follicle to produce eggs in vitro. Developing the human follicle to ovulate successfully outside the body is scientifically difficult and ethically challenging. Infertility is linked to long-standing religious and moral traditions, and is intertwined with deeply contentious social narratives about women, families, illness and birth. Is the research morally permissible? Perhaps imperative if understood as a repair from iatrogenic harms? How are considerations of justice central to the work? How will vulnerable subjects be protected? What are the moral implications of the work for women, children and families? What are the implications for society if women could store ovarian tissue as a way of stopping the biological clock? What are the moral possibilities and challenges if eggs can be produced in large quantities from a stored ovarian tissue? Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Physical and hormonal changes during pregnancy alter breathing patterns of pregnant women. It is possible that occult disordered breathing during sleep may be a risk factor for the development of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia. Objective: Our aim was to determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant women, and to investigate the relationship of snoring, obesity and neck circumference to PIH and preeclampsia. Methods: 469 pregnant women and 208 age-matched nonpregnant women were included in the study. Both groups were asked to complete a questionnaire. Maternal complications were retrieved from the medical records. Results: Habitual snoring was reported from 1.9% of nonpregnant women, 2.5% of pregnant women prior to pregnancy and 11.9% of those same women during the third trimester of pregnancy (p < 0.001). Age, smoking during pregnancy, and weight before delivery were independent risk factors for habitual snoring in pregnancy. PIH and preeclampsia developed in 20 and 10.9% of pregnant women with habitual snoring, as compared to 11 and 5.8% of non-snoring pregnant women (p = 0.045, p = 0.125, p = 0.415), respectively. In women who developed preeclampsia, weight before pregnancy, weight before delivery and neck circumference were significantly higher in univariate analysis. Neck circumference was an independent risk factor for PIH and preeclampsia according to logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: The incidence of snoring is significantly higher in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. Snoring may indicate a risk of PIH. Neck circumference was an independent risk factor for both PIH and preeclampsia. Copyright © 2007 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Although fatigue is a common experience for pregnant women and new mothers, few measures of fatigue have been validated for use with this population. To address this gap, the authors assessed psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, which was used in 2 independent samples of pregnant women. Results indicated that the psychometric properties of the scale were very similar across samples and time points. The scale possesses a high level of internal consistency, has good convergent validity with measures of sleep quality and depression, and discriminates well from a measure of social support. Contrary to previous evaluations of the MAF, data strongly suggest that the scale represents a unidimensional construct best represented by a single factor. Results indicate that the MAF is a useful measure of fatigue among pregnant and postpartum women. © 2008 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Women seem to have a heightened risk for developing sleep disorders compared with men; women also show a greater risk for developing some psychiatric problems including mood and anxiety disorders. The modulatory effects of sex hormones on sleep-wake behaviors and mood may contribute to this compounded risk and to the emergence of symptoms throughout the female reproductive life cycle. This article focuses on the clinical evidence for sleep disorders in women. Particular attention is paid to the hormonal and mood interactions with sleep disorders (sleep initiation and sleep maintenance) in the context of menstrual cycle changes, pregnancy, and in the menopausal years. Lastly, management strategies for sleep disorders in women are critically discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need-Mothers Version. There were significant differences in the total number of needs (p<0.01) and total number of unmet needs (p<0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother-notably pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities, sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by staff. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Rationale: Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes. Methods: 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal. Results: No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Recently, frequency domain and entropy analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) have been assessed in several studies, providing new insights into physiologic regulatory mechanisms, constituting appealing tools for pharmacodynamic assessment, namely during fetal life. There is evidence that entropy and frequency domain analysis convey information on cortical and autonomic nervous system activities, respectively. Use of internal versus external FHR acquisition sensors and the signal sampling frequency may dramatically affect results. Most FHR frequency domain indices are significantly increased with rising fetal activity, namely during active wakefulness and active sleep, whereas the opposite occurs with nonlinear indices. This is in favour of increased activity of the autonomous nervous system and decreased activity of the central nervous system complexity control systems, during periods of fetal activity. Progression of labor is associated with a significant increase in FHR frequency domain indices, whereas entropy indices are significantly decreased. This denotes activation of the autonomic nervous system in the final minutes of labour, associated with decreased central nervous system activity. The emerging knowledge on FHR frequency domain and entropy analysis substantiates a continued interest of these methods in evaluation of the fetal pathophysiologic regulatory mechanisms, and opens new perspectives for clinical and pharmacodynamic assessment. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Obstetrician-gynecologists are responsible for promoting healthy eating and physical activity in adolescents during annual screening examinations. Adolescents with a body mass index for age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile should undergo an in-depth health assessment to determine psychosocial morbidity and risk of cardiovascular disease. Further research is needed to determine the most efficacious approach to the prevention and treatment of obesity in adolescents. For now, it is best to extrapolate an approach from data pertaining to children and adults, while being cognizant of the special psychosocial and physical needs of adolescents. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Background: Quantitative information about the elastic properties of the large arteries can be obtained by determination of the pressure and the pulsatile changes of arterial diameter. Objective: To study the stiffness of major branches (common carotid artery; CCA, abdominal aorta; AA and femoral artery; FA) in newborn infants. Study design: The arterial stiffness index (SI) values were measured with a phase locked loop ultrasound technique to estimate the arterial systolic and diastolic diameters and their correlation with blood pressure. Subjects: We studied 62 appropriate-for-gestational age infants (between 30 and 41 weeks of gestation at birth) including 33 preterm infants. Results: The systolic and diastolic diameters of the CCA, AA and FA, as well as the SI, increased with the gestational age at birth. In the SI of the FA, there was considerable variation in the individual values for a given gestational age at birth. The gestational age associated increase in stiffness was statistically significant only in the CCA and the AA. Although the mechanical properties of the FA were significantly influenced by physical activities during the active waking and quiet sleeping states, the calculated SI values were less vulnerable to these activities in the central arteries. Conclusion: These results indicate that the SI of the FA (peripheral muscular artery) is modified appreciably by vasoactive stimuli. The mechanical properties of the deeper elastic arteries in newborn infants provide sufficiently reliable information about changes caused by development. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:: Parents often report their children display irregular eating patterns. Our aim is to describe the stability of maternal-perceived irregular eating of their offspring from 6 months to 2-4 years of age and to investigate factors that are associated with maternal perceived irregular eating of their 2-4 year old offspring. METHODS:: A longitudinal mother-child linked analysis was carried out using 5 year follow-up data from a population-based prospective birth cohort of 5122 mothers who were participants in the Mater-University Study of Pregnancy, Brisbane. Measures included responses to standardized questionnaires, pediatrician review and standardized measures such as the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised and the Child Behavior Checklist. RESULTS:: 20.2% and 7.6% of mothers respectively stated their 2-4 year old was sometimes or often an irregular eater. Continuity of feeding difficulties from age 6 months was prominent: 48% of 6 month olds with a feeding problem were 'sometimes' or 'often' irregular eaters at age 2-4 years. From a multivariable analysis, both child-intrinsic factors (chronic physical morbidity, sleeplessness and anxiety-depressive symptoms) and factors that impinge upon the child (poor maternal health and maternal depression and anxiety) independently contributed to irregular eating status at age 2-4 years. CONCLUSIONS:: We conclude that approximately one third of mothers had some concern with their child's irregular eating, 7.6% of mothers were often concerned. Irregular eating children were usually physically well, more likely to have persisting feeding problems, sleeplessness, behavioral problems and lived with mothers with perceived poor physical and mental health. Intervention strategies should be family orientated and include child, mother and mother-child psychosocial approaches. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined by the presence of (i) an urge to move the legs with or without an actual paraesthesia; (ii) a worsening of symptoms with inactivity; (iii) improvement with activity; and (iv) a worsening of symptoms in the evening and at night. Patients may use a variety of semantic phrases to describe their symptoms but all must have an urge to move. Most people with RLS also have periodic limb movements during sleep, although this is not part of the clinical diagnostic criteria. RLS is very common. About 10% of all Caucasian populations have RLS, although it may be mild in the majority of cases. Women generally outnumber men by about 2:1. As a general rule, RLS severity worsens through the first seven to eight decades of life, but may actually lessen in old age. The aetiology of RLS is only partly understood. There is a strong genetic component, and several genetic linkages and three causative genes have been identified worldwide. Several medical conditions, including renal failure, systemic iron deficiency and pregnancy, and possibly neuropathy, essential tremor and some genetic ataxias, are also associated with high rates of RLS. In all cases to date, the actual CNS pathology of RLS demonstrates reduced iron stores, in a pattern that suggests that the homeostatic control of iron is altered, not just that there is not enough iron entering the brain. The relationship between reduced CNS iron levels and the clinical phenotype or treatment response to dopaminergics is not known but generates promising speculation. Treatment of RLS is usually rewarding. Most patients respond robustly to dopamine receptor agonists. Over time, response may lessen, or the patients may develop 'augmentation', whereby they have a worsening of symptoms, usually in the form of an earlier onset. Other treatment options include gabapentin, or similar antiepileptic drugs, and opioids. High-dose intravenous iron is a promising but still experimental approach. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Orexin-A and -B are hypothalamic peptides which, in the adult brain, are associated with arousal, increased vigilance, and the seeking and ingestion of food. Because the fetus is mostly asleep, and hunger is a physiological state unlikely to arise until birth, we hypothesized that orexigenic neurons in the lateral and dorso-medial hypothalamic areas (LHA, DMH) and their projections to the locus coeruleus (LC) would develop only near the time of birth. We therefore determined orexin expression in fetal sheep, where birth occurs over a tightly regulated interval of 146-148 days gestation. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the presence and distribution of orexin-A positive fibres and cells at the level of the hypothalamus and LC in fetal (125-137 and 145+ days gestation age) and newborn sheep brains. Orexin was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples taken from chronically catheterised fetal and newborn sheep, and in CSF taken from fetuses and lambs at postmortem. Orexin-A positive cells bodies were observed in the hypothalamus, and orexin-A fibres were found throughout all hypothalamic, thalamic, and brain stem regions of all the fetal and newborn brains examined. Orexin-A was present in plasma and CSF at similar concentrations in fetal and newborn sheep. The presence of orexin in hypothalamic neurons and CSF throughout late gestation suggests that orexinergic regulation of hunger, appetite and the sleep/wake cycle is inhibited, by mechanisms yet to be identified, until the time of parturition.

AB  - The term biological clock is usually used by physicians and psychologists to refer to the declining fertility, increasing risk of fetal birth defects and alterations to hormone levels experienced by women as they age. Female fecundity declines slowly after the age of 30 years and more rapidly after 40 and is considered the main limiting factor in treating infertility. However, there are several scientific reports, chapters in books and review articles suggesting that men may also have a biological clock. The aim of our study was to conduct a review of the literature, based on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), to evaluate the male biological clock. After adjustments for other factors, the data demonstrate that the likelihood that a fertile couple will take more than 12 months to conceive nearly doubles from 8% when the man is < 25 years old to 15% when he is > 35 years old. Thus, paternal age is a further factor to be taken into account when deciding on the prognosis for infertile couples. Also, increasing male age is associated with a significant decline in fertility (five times longer to achieve pregnancy at the age of 45 years). Patients and their physicians therefore need to understand the effects of the male biological clock on sexual and reproductive health, in that it leads to erectile dysfunction and male infertility, as well as its potential implications for important medical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Pulse character of hormones secretion in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonads system is a necessary condition of physiological regulation of reproduction. At the same time, the rhythms of ovarian hormones secretion have not been adequately explored. The researches study mainly three sexually mature ewes. The stages of oestrus cycle were determined on behavioral reactions of females in the presence of ram. Blood samples from jugular vein were collected hourly over 24-hour period during follicular (15-16 days), early (3-4 days) and middle (7-9 days) luteal phase of oestrus cycle, pregnancy (40-105 days) and lactation (30-45 days). 27 experiments were performed. Plasma progesterone was determined by enzyme-immunoassay method. There was no diurnal rhythm of ovarian progesterone secretion in ewes. During early and middle luteal phase of oestrus cycle and lactation, an 8-hour rhythm of progesterone secretion was detected. Follicular phase of oestrus cycle and pregnancy were characterized by irregular rises of fluctuations of progesterone level. It seems that the 8-hour rhythm of progesterone secretion during luteal phase and lactation is controlled by action of intraovarian generator of ultradian rhythms.

AB  - Diverse patterns of cortisol secretion with consistently high circulating catecholamines have been reported in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety state that develops after exposure to traumatic life events. Indeed, peripheral cortisol levels have been reported to be low or normal in the majority of adult chronic PTSD studies, whereas, in most paediatric studies, high cortisol values have been documented. Longitudinal studies on PTSD biology, including the transition from childhood to adulthood, may shed light on these discrepancies. In children, elevated evening salivary cortisol in the aftermath of the trauma was predictive of PTSD development 6months later, whereas plasma interleukin-6 correlated positively with evening cortisol and was equally predictive of later PTSD. Longitudinal assessment of PTSD children 1 and 6 months later revealed progressive normalisation of cortisol levels, whereas noradrenaline concentrations became gradually higher. We hypothesise that, in adults with chronic PTSD, low cortisol levels, together with high catecholamines, may reflect a late event in the natural history of the disorder, months or years after the trauma. The progressive divergence of cortisol and noradrenaline concentrations over time may be responsible for PTSD maintenance in children and explain the differences between the child and adult PTSD endophenotypes. In adults studied immediately after the trauma, and by contrast to children, low cortisol levels are predictive of later PTSD development. Our hypothesis that low cortisol levels may reflect a previous trauma, earlier in development, is supported by the well established observation that prior trauma is a risk factor for a new PTSD diagnosis. The developmental stage of an individual in relation to previous exposure to trauma and PTSD vulnerability are crucial variables that may determine clinical and biological PTSD phenotypes and explain the discrepancies between adults and children in reported cortisol levels. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the LD50, toxic effects on organogenesis/fetal-development, physical aspects, and developmental/ neurobehavioral reflexes of litters previously exposed to Cecropia glazioui SNETHL (Cg) extract during the entire gestational period. Swiss mice were submitted to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 g/kg/p.o. Female rats received 1.0 g/kg/day of Cg extract (G1, n = 10) or 1.0 mL/kg/day of deionized water (G2, n = 10) during pregnancy. The number of successful gestations, pregnant females weight and born/dead-born offsprings were evaluated. Physical development (offspring weight; fluff and hair appearing; ear unsticking and opening; incisor teeth eruption; eyes opening; testis descent; vagina opening; rearing frequency; uprightness latency and negative geotaxis) and the sleeping time (30 mg/kg/i.p. sodium pentobarbital assay) were also observed. Open field assay evaluated the developmental/neurobehavioral reflexes of pups. LD50 was higher than 5.0 g/kg. The extract did not affect the gestation number, born/dead-born offspring number and the female weight during pregnancy. The weight and the physical development of both genders pups were not affected (p > 0.05), but the uprightness latency and the negative geotaxis reflexes were enhanced and the rearing frequency decreased (p < 0.05). Ambulation, cleaning activity, sleeping time, and immobility were not affected (p > 0.05). We concluded that Cg extract showed low toxicity to pregnant rats and their litters.

AB  - The recognition that insulin resistance has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) revolutionized our understanding of this complex disorder. PCOS causes major metabolic and reproductive morbidities, including substantially increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. Insulin-sensitizing drugs (ISDs) ameliorate reproductive abnormalities, restore ovulation and regular menses, increase pregnancy rates and reduce androgenic symptoms in affected women with PCOS. Accordingly, ISDs, specifically metformin, have been widely adopted as therapy for this condition. A recent, large, randomized, multicenter, clinical trial that assessed live-birth rates rather than surrogate end points suggested that metformin alone is inferior to clomiphene citrate in treating infertility associated with PCOS. There is, furthermore, no evidence to support the use of metformin during pregnancy to prevent spontaneous abortions or gestational diabetes mellitus in women with PCOS. Renewed safety concerns about thiazolidinediones followed recent studies that reported increased cardiovascular morbidity with these agents. These concerns might preclude thiazolidinedione use in otherwise healthy women with PCOS. Finally, although ISDs improve insulin action and cardiovascular disease risk, there is no evidence that they provide long-term health benefits in PCOS. This article discusses the role of ISDs in PCOS in light of these new data. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Expression of the Notch effector gene Hes1 is required for maintenance of neural progenitors in the embryonic brain, but persistent and high levels of Hes1 expression inhibit proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Here, by using a real-time imaging method, we found that Hes1 expression dynamically oscillates in neural progenitors. Furthermore, sustained overexpression of Hes1 downregulates expression of proneural genes, Notch ligands, and cell cycle regulators, suggesting that their proper expression depends on Hes1 oscillation. Surprisingly, the proneural gene Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) and the Notch ligand Delta-like1 (Dll1) are also expressed in an oscillatory manner by neural progenitors, and inhibition of Notch signaling, a condition known to induce neuronal differentiation, leads to downregulation of Hes1 and sustained upregulation of Ngn2 and Dll1. These results suggest that Hes1 oscillation regulates Ngn2 and Dll1 oscillations, which in turn lead to maintenance of neural progenitors by mutual activation of Notch signaling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective. To compare a so-called mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment strategy with the standard IVF treatment on the following aspects: the chance of a pregnancy resulting in full-term live birth within 1 year, patient discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs. Design. Randomised, open-label, prospective trial (www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN35766970). Method. 404 patients were assigned to undergo either a mild treatment, consisting of ovarian stimulation with a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist combined with single embryo transfer, or the standard treatment consisting of prolonged stimulation with a GnRH agonist combined with the transfer of two embryos. The primary outcome measures were: (1) the percentage of cumulative pregnancies within one year after randomisation leading to full-term live birth; (2) total costs per couple and child up to 6 weeks after expected delivery; and (3) overall patient discomfort. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle and was intended to show that the mild treatment was not inferior to the standard treatment; the non-inferiority threshold was -12.5%. Results. The proportion of cumulative pregnancies resulting in full-term live birth after 1 year was 43.4% in the mild and 44.7% in the standard treatment group. The lower limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval was equal to -9.8%. The respective proportion of couples with multiple pregnancies was 0.5% versus 13.1% (p < 0.0001), and the average total costs were € 8,333.- versus € 10,745.- (difference: € 2,412.-, 95% CI: 703-4,131). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, and sleep quality. Conclusion. After 1 year of treatment, the cumulative percentage of pregnancies leading to full-term live birth and the total patient discomfort were the same for the mild treatment (average 2.3 IVF-cycles) and the standard treatment (average 1.7 IVF-cycles). The mild treatment significantly reduced the number of multiple pregnancies and the overall costs.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review is to access the current state of knowledge concerning the role for melatonin in human pregnancy. Melatonin is a neuroendocrine hormone secreted nightly by pineal gland and regulates biological rhythms. The nighttime serum concentration of melatonin shows an incremental change toward the end of pregnancy. This small lipophilic indoleamine crosses the placenta freely without being altered. Maternal melatonin enters the fetal circulation with ease providing photoperiodic information to the fetus. Melatonin works in a variety of ways as a circadian rhythm modulator, endocrine modulator, immunomodulator, direct free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant and cytoprotective agent in human pregnancy, and it appears to be essential for successful pregnancy. It also seems to be involved in correcting the pathophysiology of complications during pregnancy including those due to abortion, pre-eclampsia and fetal brain damage. The scientific evidence supporting a role for melatonin in human pregnancy is summarized. © 2008.

AB  - We investigated how maternal melatonin is regulated in pregnant rats. To examine the involvement of the conceptus (fetus and placenta) in serum melatonin concentrations, the number of conceptuses was experimentally reduced to one on day 7 of pregnancy (1-conceptus group). Maternal circulating nighttime melatonin levels increased toward day 21 of pregnancy and rapidly decreased to the non-pregnancy levels after parturition, whereas the maternal serum nighttime melatonin levels of the 1-conceptus group on day 21 of pregnancy were significantly lower than normal pregnancy bearing dams more than 10 conceptuses. When the fetuses were removed by fetectomy (all fetuses but not the placentae) on day 12 of pregnancy, serum melatonin concentrations were not decreased. To examine the source of circulating maternal melatonin, mRNA expression of N-acetyltransferase (NAT), which is a late limiting enzyme for melatonin synthesis, was examined in the placenta and fetal pineal. NAT was not expressed in the placenta and was negligible in the pineal gland of the fetus compared with the mother's pineal gland. To examine the effect of placental hormones on maternal melatonin production, a conditioned medium, which was made by incubating placenta of day 20 of pregnancy with medium, was injected into the 1-conceptus dams from day 17 to day 20 of pregnancy. Injection of conditioned medium significantly increased serum melatonin concentrations compared with the control values whereas charcoal treatment abolished the stimulatory effect of conditioned medium. In conclusion, maternal circulating melatonin is from the maternal pineal gland and is increased by placental hormones during pregnancy. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Non-dipping pattern of circadian blood pressure in preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The pathogenetic mechanisms of this relationship are still unclear. We investigated whether non-dipping in preeclampsia could relate to endothelial activation or damage. Methods: Participants, 20 women with normal pregnancy (mean age 29.9 ± 5.7 years) and 31 women with preeclampsia (mean age 29.1 ± 5.1 years), un- derwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf), marker of endothelial damage and of soluble adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1), and markers of endothelial activation were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays. Results: Based on whether the nocturnal mean arterial pressure (MAP) relative to the daytime MAP declined by less than 10%, 21 women with preeclampsia were categorized as non-dippers. Compared to healthy pregnant women, patients with preeclampsia showed significantly enhanced levels of vWf (206.9 ± 40.6 vs. 123 ± 24 IU/dl;p<0.01) and sVCAM-1 (2,269 ± 426 vs.1,159.8 ± 340 ng/ml; p < 0.01). In addition, significantly higher levels of vWf (224.5 ± 34.9 vs. 170 ± 23 IU/dl; p < 0.01) and sVCAM-1 (2,405 ± 421.4 vs. 1,983 ± 276.7 ng/ml; p = 0.007) were determined, when women with preeclampsia and nocturnal hypertension (non-dippers) were compared to dippers. The results were similar even after adjustment for severity of preeclampsia. In contrast, neither preeclampsia nor dipping status had an effect on sICAM-1 levels. Conclusion: Nocturnal hypertension in preeclampsia is associated with elevated levels of molecules related to endothelial damage. Endothelial damage is a recognized pathogenetic factor for atherosclerosis and history of preeclampsia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In this context, possible clinical im-plications of our findings deserve further investigation. Copyright © 2007 S. Karger AG.

AB  - This study re-examined the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant women in Japan based on the diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG), and to epidemiologically clarify factors associated with RLS, including sleep disorders and pregnancy status. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at 344 clinical obstetric institutions in Japan. A total of 19441 women with a confirmed pregnancy were instructed to complete a self-administered questionnaire during the time they spent waiting for a consultation. univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used. The prevalence of RLS among the women was 2.9%. The prevalence by age group exhibited a U-shaped curve with the value for those in their thirties as the minimum. The prevalence became more than twice higher in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were stronger associations between RLS and the third trimester of pregnancy, multipara, smoking, subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, early morning awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.92, 0.76, 1.54, 1.68, 2.44, 1.80, 1.89, respectively). The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women in Japan was not as high as previously reported, similar to that for the general Japanese population. As the prevalence of RLS is lower than that in Western countries, genetic backgrounds may contribute more to the observed differences than pregnancy does. In this study, like others, the prevalence of RLS increased during the third trimester of pregnancy, and strong associations were observed between RLS and difficulty initiating sleep and between RLS and difficulty maintaining sleep. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate psychological aspects of childhood asthma and the connections between the illness and behavioral disturbances in asthmatic children. Study design: We selected a group of 47 asthmatic children and a control group of 47 healthy children. The only criterion for inclusion was that the children be between 4 and 10 years of age; criteria for exclusion were neurological pathologies, cognitive retardation, and serious or chronic systemic disease. The collaboration of a psychologist and a comparative examination of questionnaires used in medical literature helped us prepare a calibrated questionnaire for our study. Results: In our study, the asthmatic children show significantly more behavioral and psychological disturbances than the children in the control group. Conclusions: Within the group of asthmatic children the boys and the children whose illness has lasted less than 4 years, are at greater risk of such disturbances; stressful situations connected to the birth or previous pregnancies can be seen more often in the group of asthmatic children than in the control group; before the onset of the illness the asthmatic children had significant sleep disturbances. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Aim: To analyse the importance of mothers' smoking during pregnancy and/or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in early childhood for children's health and well-being at the age of 3 years. Methods: Four groups from a population based cohort (n = 8850) were compared: children with nonsmoking mother during pregnancy and nonsmoking parents at the age of 3 years (n = 7091); children with only foetal exposure (n = 149); children exposed only postnatally (n = 895) and children exposed both pre- and postnatally (n = 595). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Children exposed both pre- and postnatally had more wheezing (1.14; 1.07-1.21) and rhinitis (1.16; 1.06-1.26), used more cough-mixture (1.07; 1.01-1.14) and broncodilatating drugs (1.08; 1.02-1.15) and suffered more from excessive crying (1.31; 1.13-1.51) and irritability (1.27; 1.09-1.48) compared to children with nonsmoking parents. Children exposed only postnatally had more rhinitis (1.24; 1.12-1.37), used more cough-mixture (1.14; 1.05-1.29) and suffered more from poor sleep (1.26; 1.07-1.47) than children of nonsmoking parents. Children with prenatal exposure only used more broncodilatating drugs (1.45; 1.03-2.04) and suffered more from poor sleep (2.06; 1.09-3.87). Conclusion: Health differences, small but significant, indicate that prenatal and/or postnatal ETS exposure alone, or in combination, seems to interfere with child health, supporting the importance of zero tolerance. However, as most smoking parents in Sweden try to protect their children from ETS exposure, the results also might indicate that protective measures are worthwhile. © 2007 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Maternal exposure to wood fuel smoke may lead to impaired fetal growth due to hypoxia and or oxidative stress from smoke constituents such a carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Objectives: We studied the risk of low birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth weight in relation to reported use of wood for cooking during the prenatal period, compared with natural gas (NG). Methods: We studied a historical cohort of women who had a singleton live birth in the years 2000-2002, from a semirural area of Pakistan. Infants birth weight was obtained from records, and prenatal records had data for maternal body mass index and parity. Cooking habits, daytime sleep habits, and type of fuel used during the pregnancies in 2000-2002 were ascertained by a survey done in 2004-2005. We performed multiple linear and logistic regression modeling using propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables. Results: Unadjusted mean (± SD) birth weight was 2.78 ± 0.45 kg in wood users, and 2.84 ± 0.43 kg (p < 0.06) in NG users. Infants born to wood users averaged 82 g lighter than infants born to NG users when weight was adjusted for confounders (p < 0.07). The rate of LBW (< 2,500 g) was 22.7% among wood users compared with 15.0% in NG users (p < 0.01), for an adjusted relative risk of 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.34). The population attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use was estimated to be 24%. Conclusion: Cooking with wood fuel during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable exposure, was associated with LBW and marginally lower mean birth weight compared with using NG.

AB  - The use of antihypertensive agents in pregnancy for control of mild-to-moderate hypertension or for control of severe hypertension is summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Currently, there is little evidence to support the concept that BP control in pregnant women with chronic hypertension will prevent the subsequent occurrence of preeclampsia, itself the cause for most adverse outcomes in these patients. As BP falls in early pregnancy, decreasing or even discontinuing medication and monitoring is often possible in women with mild or moderate hypertension. Acknowledging limitations in evidenced-based data and other concerns discussed above regarding gestational age, we recommend a threshold for treatment of most pregnant hypertensive women of 140 to 150 mm Hg systolic, and/or 95 to 100 mm Hg diastolic to prevent worsening hypertension in the mother. Acceptable agents include methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine in standard doses. Atenolol use should probably be avoided in pregnancy, because it has been associated with slightly lower birth weights. ACE-Is and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in all trimesters; when administered in the second and third trimesters, they are associated with a characteristic fetopathy, neonatal renal failure, and death, and, thus, are contraindicated. Recent data suggest that they should also be avoided in the first trimester. Finally, control of severe hypertension has been studied in a recent meta-analysis, and this suggests that intravenous labetalol or oral nifedipine is as effective as intravenous hydralazine, with fewer adverse effects. Many research questions surrounding hypertension in pregnancy and preeclampsia remain unanswered. Advancement of clinical knowledge requires studies that are large, collaborative, and multicentered. For example, to better understand the need for antihypertensive therapy in mild-tomoderate chronic hypertension, a study designed to detect a moderate (20%) relative risk reduction in preeclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction would require a randomized trial with enrollment of 1000 to 3000 women with chronic hypertension. Preconception management of hypertension, the necessity for antihypertensive agents, specific drug agents, racial differences, BP levels for initiation of therapy, and treatment targets all remain to be determined. Current guidelines rely only on evidence from small, largely underpowered trials and expert opinion. Finally, studies of antihypertensive medication in pregnancy often evaluate the effectiveness of a drug without examining fetal outcomes associated with harm; future studies must include detailed outcomes of risk and benefit for both the mother and baby. Better surveillance systems to routinely monitor adverse events and numbers of women exposed to particular agents are required to guide treatment efficacy, advance our knowledge of drug safety, and ultimately improve treatment options. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Background: Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC) is a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome named because of a characteristic facies, cardiac anomalies, and ectodermal abnormalities. While considerable literature describes the main features, few studies have documented the frequencies of less common features allowing a greater appreciation of the full phenotype. Methods: We have analysed clinical data on 38 individuals with CFC and a confirmed mutation in one of the genes known to cause the condition. We provide data on well-established features, and those that are less often described. Results: Polyhydramnios (77%) and prematurity (49%) were common perinatal issues. 71% of individuals had a cardiac anomaly, the most common being pulmonary valve stenosis (42%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (39%), and atrial septal defect (28%). Hair anomalies were also typical: 92% had curly hair, 84% sparse hair, and 86% absent or sparse eyebrows. The most frequent cutaneous features were keratosis pilaris (73%), hyperkeratosis (61%) and nevi (76%). Significant and long lived gastrointestinal dysmotility (71%), seizures (49%), optic nerve hypoplasia (30%) and renal anomalies, chiefly hydronephrosis (20%), were among the less well known issues reported. Conclusion: This study reports a broad range of clinical issues in a large cohort of individuals with molecular confirmation of CFC.

AB  - Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS), these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing, male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood. The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments. Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown. However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic mechanisms. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genetic and environmental agents that disrupt organogenesis are numerous and well described. Less well established, however, is the role of delay in the developmental processes that yield functionally immature tissues at birth. Evidence is mounting that organs do not continue to develop postnatally in the context of these organogenesis insults, condemning the patient to utilize under-developed tissues for adult processes. These poorly differentiated organs may appear histologically normal at birth but with age may deteriorate revealing progressive or adult-onset pathology. The genetic and molecular underpinning of the proposed paradigm reveals the need for a comprehensive systems biology approach to evaluate the role of maternal-fetal environment on organogenesis.

AB  - Approximately a quarter of the female workforce in Canada works shifts. Shift workers experience a misalignment between their endogenous circadian rhythms and their sleep/wake cycle, which can result in various health and psychosocial problems, including sleep disruptions, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders, and effects on relationships and mood. Shift-working women also have several gender-specific health concerns and may be especially at risk for developing menstrual cycle irregularities, problems with reproductive health, and breast cancer. This article includes a theoretical background on circadian rhythms and clock genes, presents general problems of circadian misalignment, and discusses the specific issues associated with shift work as they pertain to women. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with significant changes in sleep architecture and the subjective quality of sleep. These changes are caused by the many physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy (eg, altered hormone levels, increased urination at night, changes in body size) and post partum, especially with a newborn to tend. Although most women negotiate the disruption to their sleep very well, others may experience such severe disruption to sleep that it compromises their physical well-being and mental health. Physicians providing care for pregnant women must inquire about sleep patterns; if a woman is reporting significant difficulty coping with the disruption, a thorough history should be taken. Primary sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and further investigation and treatment may be warranted. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in late pregnancy is as high as 15%, a result of normal physiologic processes occurring during pregnancy, and its prevalence in pre-eclampsia is even higher. The cardiovascular risks associated with SDB have an even stronger association in pregnancy: with SDB in pregnancy there is an eightfold relative risk of developing systemic hypertension, primarily because the vascular inflammatory processes leading to endothelial dysfunction that occur in SDB are increased during pregnancy. The fetal effects of maternal cardiovascular compromise arising from SDB include growth restriction and impaired movement. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Complications during pregnancy and birth asphyxia lead to brain injury, with devastating consequences for the neonate. In this paper we present evidence that the steroid environment during pregnancy and at birth aids in protecting the fetus and neonate from asphyxia-induced injury. Earlier studies show that the placental progesterone production has a role in the synthesis and release of neuroactive steroids or their precursors into the fetal circulation. Placental precursor support leads to remarkably high concentrations of allopregnanolone in the fetal brain and to a dramatic decline with the loss of the placenta at birth. These elevated concentrations influence the distinct behavioral states displayed by the late gestation fetus and exert a suppressive effect that maintains sleep-like behavioral states that are present for much of fetal life. This suppression reduces CNS excitability and suppresses excitotoxicity. With the availability of adequate precursors, mechanisms within the fetal brain ultimately control neurosteroid levels. These mechanisms respond to episodes of acute hypoxia by increasing expression of 5α-reductase and P450scc enzymes and allopregnanolone synthesis in the brain. This allopregnanolone response, and potentially that of other neurosteroids including 5α-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (TH-DOC), reduces hippocampal cell death following acute asphyxia and suggests that stimulation of neurosteroid production may protect the fetal brain. Importantly, inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis in the fetal brain increases the basal cell death suggesting a role in controlling developmental processes late in gestation. Synthesis of neurosteroid precursors in the fetal adrenal such as deoxycorticosterone (DOC), and their conversion to active neurosteroids in the fetal brain may also have a role in neuroprotection. This suggests that the adrenal glands provide precursor DOC for neurosteroid synthesis after birth and this may lead to a switch from allopregnanolone alone to neuroprotection mediated by allopregnanolone and TH-DOC. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Headache patterns for both primary and secondary headaches are often modified in women during pregnancy. Although approximately two thirds of women with migraines experience headache improvement during pregnancy; women who continue to suffer from migraine or other headaches during pregnancy need effective clinical care to include appropriate diagnostic studies, counseling about expectations during pregnancy and lactation, and modifications in therapeutic regimens to minimize risk to the fetus and nursing baby. This review describes the epidemiology of headache during pregnancy and lactation, to include both effects of these conditions on headache activity and possible concerns about how a maternal headache diagnosis may influence the course and outcome of pregnancy. Although restrictions in diagnostic testing and medication interventions are often necessary during pregnancy and breastfeeding, this review describes evaluation and management strategies that provide effective clinical care while minimizing risk to the developing baby. © 2008 Future Drugs Ltd.

AB  - The main concerns associated with epilepsy during pregnancy consist of maternal and fetal risks from uncontrolled seizures, and harmful effects of the treatment on the development of the offspring. Although seizure control is maintained in the majority, worsening occurs in a fraction of childbearing women with epilepsy. As multiple factors associated with pregnancy may have a negative impact on epilepsy, a careful analysis of the situation should be performed in those who deteriorate. Emotional and behavioural influence, including insufficient sleep and treatment non-compliance, as well as physical factors, such as emesis and pelvic distortion, should receive attention. The serum concentrations of almost all antiepileptic drugs decrease during pregnancy, particularly those which are metabolised by glucuronidation. The inter-individual variability is pronounced. In highly protein-bound drugs, such as phenytoin and valproate, unbound drug is less affected than total concentrations. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam concentrations may decrease by more than 50% in the course of pregnancy; monohydroxyoxcarbazepine by up to 30-40%. Appropriate clinical follow-up tailored to individual needs and supported by therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed in pregnant women with epilepsy. Education concerning reproductive issues is an essential part of the epilepsy service to fertile women. © 2007 British Epilepsy Association.

AB  - Underlying maternal vascular disease has been implicated as one of several pathways contributing to preterm delivery (PTD) and psychosocial factors such as hostility, anomie, effortful coping, and mastery may be associated with PTD by affecting maternal vascular health. Using data from the Pregnancy Outcomes and Community Health (POUCH) study, we included 2018 non-Hispanic White and 743 African American women from 52 clinics in five Michigan, USA communities. Women were interviewed at 15-27 weeks' gestation and followed to delivery. We found that relations between psychosocial factors and PTD subtypes (i.e. medically indicated, premature rupture of membranes, spontaneous labor) varied by race/ethnicity and socio-economic position (Medicaid insurance status). Among African American women not insured by Medicaid, anomie levels in mid-pregnancy were positively associated with medically indicated PTD after adjusting for maternal age and education. Among all women not insured by Medicaid, hostility levels were positively associated with spontaneous PTD after adjusting for maternal race/ethnicity, age, and education. Failure to detect links between psychosocial factors and PTD risk in poorer women may be due to their excess risk in multiple PTD pathways and/or a more complex web of contributing risk factors. In a subset of 395 women monitored for blood pressure, anomie scores were positively associated with systolic blood pressure and heart rate and hostility scores were positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and mean arterial pressure in models that included time, awake/asleep, race/ethnicity, and age as covariates. Further adjustment for body mass index and smoking attenuated the anomie-vascular relations but had little effect on the hostility-vascular relations. Overall this study of pregnant women provides some physiologic evidence to support findings linking levels of anomie and hostility with risk of PTD.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence and factors associated with co-sleeping and nighttimewaking among the children of the Pelotas 2004 cohort at 12 months of age. Methods: All children born in the city of Pelotas, RS, Brazil during 2004 were enrolled on a longitudinal study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and once more at 12 months of age to obtain information on their sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics and on their children's sleep and the environment in which their children sleep. Co-sleeping was defined as habitually sharing the bed with another person. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression. Results: The prevalence of co-sleeping at 12 months was 45.8% (95%CI 44.2-47.3). Co-sleeping was more common among mothers with low socioeconomic status, less education, younger mothers, mothers with more previous births and among children who wake at night. The prevalence of nighttime waking was 46.1% (95%CI 44.6-47.7). Nighttime waking was more common among boys and among the offspring of mothers who had had a greater number of previous pregnancies and of mothers who had been employed while pregnant. Conclusion: Co-sleeping and nighttime waking are common among this study population, indicating a need to continue follow-up in order to observe how long these habits persist through childhood and to investigate their consequences for child development and behavior.

AB  - Objectives: To describe infant and maternal characteristics among infants with plagiocephaly and to quantify time trends in potential risk factors for plagiocephaly. Design: Case-only study. We described the characteristics of individuals born between 1987 and 2002. We also compared characteristics of individuals born from 1987 through 1990, before the American Academy of Pediatrics 1992 sleep-position recommendations, with those of individuals born from 1991 to 2002. Setting: Children's Craniofacial Center at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington. Participants: Subjects included 2733 infants diagnosed with deformational plagiocephaly or brachycephaly before 18 months of age who were born from 1987 to 2002. Main Outcome Measure: Descriptive statistics, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Among individuals born from 1991 to 2002, 91.6% had occipital-only flattening, 17.2% were brachycephalic, 67.7% were boys, and 9.9% were multiple birth infants. As compared with individuals born from 1987 through 1990, those born from 1991 to 2002 were more apt to be a multiple birth (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8, 14.1) and to have a mother ≥35 years of age (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.3); they were hospitalized less commonly at birth for 4 or more days (OR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.06). Conclusions: Several risk factors for plagiocephaly were more common among individuals born after the 1992 American Academy of Pediatrics sleep-position recommendations. These results are consistent with the explanation that supine sleeping modifies the association between such risk factors and plagiocephaly. Further studies with a control group are needed to validate this conclusion.

AB  - Improved treatment of breast cancer in premenopausal patients increased survival rates, but the therapy may influence fertility and ovarian function. Currently there is a big public and individual interest of breast cancer affected women in preservation of ovarian function and fertility. Chemotherapy induced amenorrhea (CIA) has many objective (osteoporosis, cardiovascular, urogenital atrophy, cognitive etc.) and subjective (hot flushes, sleep disturbances, change of mood etc.) consequences. In patients with breast cancer who wish to avoid a CIA and to preserve their fertility ovarian protection by GnRH agonists, cryopreservation of operative sampled ovarian tissue or obtained fertilized or non-fertilized eggs after stimulation and puncture or embryos after in vitro fertilization are technically possible. However there are no evidence-based recommendations for preservation of fertility or ovarian function in breast cancer patients. Except the cryopreservation of embryos all other procedures are experimental. It is also undefined who is going to carry the costs. Moreover, there are recent data that the reappearance of ovarian hormones may stimulate occult tumor cells in hormone sensitive breast cancer. Therefore it seems necessary to inform breast cancer patients about the possible negative effects of preservation of ovarian function. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article. Copyright © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

AB  - Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breast-feeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses. © 2008 Nordic College of Caring Science.

AB  - Interferon-α-2b (IFNα2b) is the only effective adjuvant therapy for melanoma patients at high risk of recurrence that has been approved by regulatory authorities worldwide. However, IFN toxicities increase the risk of poor treatment compliance and impair the potential for benefit from this agent. A review of the literature demonstrated little recent attention to supportive care in the management of IFN toxicities. An international group of experts with extensive personal experience in the use of IFNs worked together to develop practical guidelines for the use of IFNs. Practical recommendations were developed for patient education on the use of IFN; initial patient assessment and monitoring, including contraindications to the use of IFN, monitoring and managing adverse events, and IFN dose modification and discontinuation; IFN injection procedures; treatment of elderly patients; and use during pregnancy and nursing. Successful adjuvant therapy of melanoma with high-dose IFN requires close compliance with the treatment regimen. Recommendations for the recognition and management of adverse events are designed to enable more patients to complete the full planned course of treatment. © 2008 American Cancer Society.

AB  - A sample of 750 women were interviewed during pregnancy on their depression and anxiety symptoms, substance use and demographic variables. A subsample was seen again at the neonatal stage (n = 152), and their infants were observed for sleep-wake behavior. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to caffeine use. Mothers who consumed more caffeine also smoked more often, were younger, were less educated, reported less sleep effectiveness and more obstetric complications. Their newborns were lower birthweight, they spent less time in REM sleep, and they showed more stress behaviors including hiccups, tremors and jerkiness. © Copyright (c) by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - Depressive symptomatology can proceed from altered hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenocortex (HPA)-axis function. Some authors stress the role that early life stress (ELS) may play in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. However, the involvement of the HPA-axis in linking prenatal ELS with depressive symptoms has not been tested in a prospective-longitudinal study extending until after puberty in humans. Therefore, we examined whether antenatal maternal anxiety is associated with disturbances in HPA-axis regulation and whether the HPA-axis dysregulation mediates the association between antenatal maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms in post-pubertal adolescents. As part of a prospective-longitudinal study, we investigated maternal anxiety at 12-22, 23-32, and 32-40 weeks of pregnancy (wp) with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In the 14-15-year-old offspring (n=58) HPA-axis function was measured through establishing a saliva cortisol day-time profile. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Children's Depression symptoms Inventory (CDI). Results of regression analyses showed that antenatal exposure to maternal anxiety at 12-22 wp was in both sexes associated with a high, flattened cortisol day-time profile (P=0.0463) which, in female adolescents only, was associated with depressive symptoms (P=0.0077). All effects remained after controlling for maternal smoking, birth weight, obstetrical optimality, maternal postnatal anxiety and puberty phase. Our prospective study demonstrates, for the first time, the involvement of the HPA-axis in the link between antenatal maternal anxiety/prenatal ELS and depressive symptoms for post-pubertal female adolescents. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

AB  - Blood Services, which, in the UK, spend over 0.5% of the NHS budget, are generally subject to quality, regulatory, economic and political authority. As only persons in good health should give blood, Services have refined donor selection criteria and aim to base them on evidence; but they also have to balance the number of donations collected with product demand. Applying selection criteria inevitably leads to deferrals, which donors experience very negatively. Compared with successful donors, even temporary deferrals reduce return rates significantly, especially of first attenders. In order to encourage donor return and sustain supplies, selection criteria should be optimal. However, a major tool for managing patients - evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - cannot apply to donor selection, so criteria have to be defined by alternatives, such as clinical studies, epidemiology and even what experts deem to be pathophysiologically feasible. The recommended volume of blood taken from each donor at each attendance (450 mL, which was based on old studies) was increased because of greater processing losses (buffy-coat derived platelets, leucofiltration etc.). Although faint rates and donation-induced iron depletion are reduced by lowering bleeding volume and bleeding less frequently, other optimizing strategies including iron supplementation have been trialled and could be enhanced by more RCTs. Better but more complex indicators of donor iron status than one-off Hb thresholds are possible. Regulators and decision-makers must encourage more studies. This review does not consider aphaeresis donors of blood components other than red cells in detail, or the prevention of transfusion-transmitted infections. © 2008 The Author.

AB  - There is a need to assess the welfare of dairy cows that live outdoors under cold and wet conditions. This study combined a number of techniques to measure stress and make an assessment of welfare in this situation. Two groups of ten non-pregnant, non-lactating Holstein Friesian cows were exposed to a week of wind and rain (WR) or housed indoors (I) with pre- and post-treatment weeks indoors in a cross-over design. Wind and rain consisted of continual air movement (7.1 kph) using fans, water sprinkling for 15 min (3.0 mm) per hour, a mean temperature of 3.4°C and wind chill of -0.3°C. Internal body temperature was recorded every ten min and behaviour for 16 h per day. Blood, faeces and infrared temperatures were sampled at 0800h each morning during treatment weeks, and three times per week during pre- and post-treatment weeks. All cows were challenged with 2 ml Leptoshie/d Vaccine (CSL Animal Health, Australia) subcutaneously after 3 days of cold exposure to test immune responses. During WR, cows spent a greater proportion of time standing and less time lying down and eating than during I. Infrared temperatures were lower during WR than I in both dorsal and orbital (eye) regions. There was a distinct diurnal pattern of internal body temperature which had a greater amplitude during WR than I resulting from both a lower minimum and a higher maximum. The time of the minimum was 40 min later for WR than I. The overall mean body temperature was 0.07°C higher in WR than I. There were greater increases in plasma and faecal cortisol during WR than I, respectively. Total T4 was higher during WR than I. Non-esterified fatty acid concentration was higher in the week following WR than I. Total white blood cell numbers were lower during WR than I. No treatment differences were found for creatine kinase or for tumour necrosis factor, heat shock protein 90, interleukin 6 or interferon gamma expression in response to vaccination. In conclusion, this study applied a suite of stress measures to dairy cows exposed to extreme cold and wet conditions. Together, these measures indicated activation of the stress axis, physiological and behavioural adaptations to cold and a reduction in welfare. A number of these measures could be used to assess welfare under cold conditions on farms. © 2008 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.

AB  - Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutaric aciduria type II is a rare disorder affecting the metabolism of fatty acid oxidation and several mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes. Narcolepsy and cataplexy is a disorder affecting sleep cycles and rapid eye movement activity. There is little information on outcome or management for either disorder in pregnancy. CASE: This is a case of a 16-year-old with glutaric aciduria type II and narcolepsy with cataplexy, treated with L-carnitine, riboflavin, fluoxetine, and modafinil during pregnancy. Intrapartum management included intravenous carnitine administration, and the patient underwent cesarean delivery at term without complication. CONCLUSION: This inborn error of metabolism and sleep disorder can be effectively treated during pregnancy with nutritional supplementation and stimulants. Because of the risk of cataplexy during labor, cesarean delivery is recommended to minimize the patient's risk. © 2008 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The obesity epidemic is of some concern in women of reproductive age. Maternal obesity is associated with many pregnancy complications, especially gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Delivery in obese women is characterized by a high caesarean-section rate and an increased risk of anaesthetic and postoperative complications. Weight retention after birth may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in the long term. Foetal risks include macrosomia, malformations and increased perinatal mortality, with the long-term infant health marked by a higher risk of obesity and metabolic disorders. Optimal management includes preconception counselling, pregravid weight-loss programmes, monitoring of gestational weight gain, repeated screening for pregnancy complications and long-term follow-up to minimize the social and economic consequences of pregnancy in overweight women. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate barriers preventing pregnant women from using insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 5 years after the launch of the national malaria strategy promoting these measures in Kenya. Methods: All women aged 15-49 years were interviewed during a community survey in four districts between December 2006 and January 2007. Women pregnant in the last 12 months were asked about their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN, antenatal care (ANC) services and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead assets were recorded and used to develop a wealth index. Travel time to ANC clinics was computed using a geographic information system algorithm. Predictors of net and IPT use were defined using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended an ANC clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women took at least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women from the least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT services (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women who used IPT were more likely to use ITNs (OR = 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who lived more than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR = 0.61, 0.46-0.81) to use ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those who used ITN (OR: 1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPT-SP. Conclusion: Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) may have various specific developmental roles in brain development. Nevertheless, specific effects of AChE inhibition during early brain development have not been adequately described. Therefore, methanesulfonyl fluoride (MSF), an irreversible AChE inhibitor that shows high selectivity for the CNS was used to produce AChE inhibition in utero to study subsequent adult behaviors, sleep, and cholinergic markers. Rats exposed to MSF in utero showed a deficit in spatial learning tasks using appetitive motivation but, surprisingly, they performed equally well or better than controls when aversive motivation was used. One hypothesis was that MSF treatment in utero affected the response to stress. Tests of anxiety however showed no differences in basal levels of anxiety. Studies of sleep behavior, however, indicated a higher level of REM sleep which is only seen during the light phase of male rats exposed to MSF in utero as compared to controls. No differences in cholinergic markers in the brains of adults were found except that females exposed to MSF in utero had a higher level of ChAT activity in the synaptosomal fraction of the hippocampus. Even so, whether cholinergic alterations accompany the in utero MSF exposure remains to be determined. The failure to find widespread changes in cholinergic markers in the adult brains suggests changes in behaviors should be further investigated by testing the participation of postsynaptic mechanisms, measuring of cholinergic markers during earlier development periods and the possible participation of other neurotransmitter systems to clearly reveal the role of the cholinergic system following in utero MSF exposure. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To examine the nature of the earliest reported symptoms in women who develop a bipolar affective puerperal psychosis (PP). Design: A retrospective interview study. Setting: Women were recruited for clinical and molecular genetic studies of PP from a national PP network, articles in the national press and referrals from UK specialist perinatal psychiatry services. Sample: One hundred and twenty-seven women met the criteria for an episode of strictly defined bipolar affective PP developing within 4 weeks of childbirth. Methods: Participants were interviewed using the Schedule for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry and hospital records were reviewed. Lifetime and puerperal episode diagnoses were made according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) based on all the available information. During interview, participants were asked to describe the earliest symptoms they believed to be related to their illness onset. The day of onset for each symptom was recorded. Main outcome measures: We present subjectively experienced emotional and behavioural changes occurring within 3 days of childbirth, reported by four or more women. Results: Seventy-three percent of women recalled experiencing an onset of symptoms by day 3. The most commonly recalled symptoms were feeling excited, elated or high (52%), not needing to sleep or not able to sleep (48%), feeling active or energetic (37%) and talking more or feeling very chatty (31%). Conclusions: Hypomanic symptoms are particularly characteristic of the early postpartum in women who develop PP. These types of symptoms should be carefully monitored in individuals at high risk of PP episodes. © 2008 The Authors.

Methods: A total of 1,130 women were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies as part of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Genetics Initiative Bipolar Disorder Collaborative Study and were asked whether they had ever experienced mood symptoms within four weeks postpartum. Women were also asked whether either of two major depressive episodes described in detail occurred postpartum. We examined the odds of postpartum mood symptoms in female siblings, who had previously been pregnant and had a diagnosis of bipolar I, bipolar II, or schizoaffective (bipolar type) disorders (n = 303), given one or more relatives with postpartum mood symptoms. Results: The odds ratio for familial aggregation of postpartum mood symptoms was 2.31 (p=0.011) in an Any Mood Symptoms analysis (n = 304) and increased to 2.71 (p = 0.005) when manic symptoms were excluded, though this was not significantly different from the Any Mood Symptoms analysis. We also examined familial aggregation of postpartum major depressive episodes; however, the number of subjects was small. Conclusions: Limitations of the study include the retrospective interview, the fact that the data were collected for other purposes and the inability to control for such factors as medication use. Taken together with previous studies, these data provide support for the hypothesis that there may be a genetic basis for the trait of postpartum mood symptoms generally and postpartum depressive symptoms in particular in women with bipolar disorder. Genetic linkage and association studies incorporating this trait are warranted. © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard.

AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC, Sanfilippo C syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acetyl-CoA:α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT). We performed a clinical study on 29 Dutch MPS IIIC patients and determined causative mutations in the recently identified HGSNAT gene. Psychomotor development was reported to be normal in all patients during the first year of life. First clinical signs were usually noted between 1 and 6 years (mean 3.5 years), and consisted of delayed psychomotor development and behavioral problems. Other symptoms included sleeping and hearing problems, recurrent infections, diarrhoea and epilepsy. Two sisters had attenuated disease and did not have symptoms until the third decade. Mean age of death was 34 years (range 25-48). Molecular analysis revealed mutations in both alleles for all patients except one. Altogether 14 different mutations were found: two splice site mutations, one frame shift mutation due to an insertion, three nonsense mutations and eight missense mutations. Two mutations, p.R344C and p.S518F, were frequent among probands of Dutch origin representing 22.0% and 29.3%, respectively, of the mutant alleles. This study demonstrates that MPS IIIC has a milder course than previously reported and that both severity and clinical course are highly variable even between sibs, complicating prediction of the clinical phenotype for individual patients. A clear phenotype-genotype correlation could not be established, except that the mutations p.G262R and p.S539C were only found in two sisters with late-onset disease and presumably convey a mild phenotype. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Life-history trade-offs between components of fitness arise because reproduction entails both gains and costs. Costs of reproduction can be divided into ecological and physiological costs. The latter have been rarely studied yet are probably a dominant component of the effect. A deeper understanding of life-history evolution will only come about once these physiological costs are better understood. Physiological costs may be direct or indirect. Direct costs include the energy and nutrient demands of the reproductive event, and the morphological changes that are necessary to facilitate achieving these demands. Indirect costs may be optional 'compensatory costs' whereby the animal chooses to reduce investment in some other aspect of its physiology to maximize the input of resource to reproduction. Such costs may be distinguished from consequential costs that are an inescapable consequence of the reproductive event. In small mammals, the direct costs of reproduction involve increased energy, protein and calcium demands during pregnancy, but most particularly during lactation. Organ remodelling is necessary to achieve the high demands of lactation and involves growth of the alimentary tract and associated organs such as the liver and pancreas. Compensatory indirect costs include reductions in thermogenesis, immune function and physical activity. Obligatory consequential costs include hyperthermia, bone loss, disruption of sleep patterns and oxidative stress. This is unlikely to be a complete list. Our knowledge of these physiological costs is currently at best described as rudimentary. For some, we do not even know whether they are compensatory or obligatory. For almost all of them, we have no idea of exact mechanisms or how these costs translate into fitness trade-offs. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - Introduction: Doppler sonography is an established method in fetal medicine. Up to now a possible circadian rhythm of fetal and maternal Doppler parameters has only been insufficiently characterized and documented. This survey aimed at evaluating the significance of Doppler parameters with regard to diurnal variations. We have analyzed whether or not a circadian rhythm of fetal and maternal Doppler parameters is detectable. Material and Methods: A non-selected collective of 100 patients with a singleton pregnancy between the 20th and 39th week of gestation was examined with Doppler sonography at the Medical School of Hannover. Besides the Doppler sonography, which was performed at three fixed times a day, the maternal blood pressure was examined each time. Outcome parameters were resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the A. umbilicalis, A. cerebri media and the Aa. uterinae as well as the maternal blood pressure. Results: There were no significant differences for the RI, PI and V max of the Aa. uterinae for the whole collective, nor for the subgroups of maternal hypertonia, preeclampsia, notching and fetal growth restriction (IUGR). There were also no significant diurnal variations of the Doppler parameters for the fetal vessels. In particular, there were no differences in the measured Doppler parameters in comparison to the collective with unremarkable gravidity. In some subgroups statistical significance could be achieved, but due to the minor variations, no clinical importance has to be considered. Conclusion: A circadian rhythm of the Doppler parameters could not be confirmed in the examined collective. The time of the applied Doppler sonography on physiological conditions might represent a factor which does not affect the validity of the Doppler sonographic results. As a consequence a single Doppler examination at a freely chosen time seems to be sufficient to obtain a correct assessment of fetal and maternal blood perfusion. Further studies on larger collectives are necessary to evaluate the clinical importance of a possible circadian rhythm, especially in fetuses with pathological Doppler values. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of circadian rhythm changes on fetal-placental development in pregnant rats. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Pregnant rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups with 10 rats in each group. Group 1: 12 hours light 12 hours dark period (n:10, Control Group); Group 2: 6 hours light 6 hours dark period (n:10); Group 3: constant light group (n:10); Group 4: constant dark group (n:10). Rats were made to deliver by cesarean birth at the end of their pregnancy and their placenta, number and weight of the offspring, and placental histopathological changes were examined. FINDING: Fetal number in the constant dark group was found significant in comparison to constant light group (p<0.01). Fetal weight in all groups with altered circadian rhythm was significantly lower than that in the control group (p<0.01). The decrease in fetal weight was more evident in the constant light group than in the constant dark group (p<0.01). Comparison of the histopathological findings of the placenta showed that placental edema, fibrin accumulation and leukocyte infiltration were significantly higher in constant light and constant dark groups than in other groups (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Circadian rhythm change in pregnancy adversely affects the fetal-placental development. More detailed studies are needed to clarify this mechanism.

AB  - In nature and under laboratory conditions, dams nurse rabbit pups once daily for a duration of fewer than 5 min. The present study explored neural mechanisms mediating the timing of nursing in this natural model of food anticipatory activity, focussing on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the locus of the master circadian clock and on the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), a region implicated in timing of food-entrained behavior. Rabbit pups are born in the dark, with eyelids closed. Nursing visits to the litters also occurs during the dark phase. To explore the effect of the timing of feeding, pups were maintained in constant darkness, while females housed in a light-dark cycle were permitted to nurse their pups either during the night (night-fed group) or day (day-fed group). All pups exhibited anticipatory locomotor activity before daily nursing. In the SCN, PER1 and FOS peaked during the night in both groups, with a longer duration of elevated protein expression in the night-fed group. In contrast, DMH peak PER1 expression occurred 8 h after pups were fed, corresponding to the shift in timing of nursing. Comparison of nursed and 48 h fasted pups indicates that the timing of PER1 expression was similar in the SCN and DMH, with fewer PER1-positive cells in the latter group. The results indicate that rabbit pups show food anticipatory activity, and that timing of nursing differentially affects PER1 expression in the SCN and DMH. © The Authors (2008).

AB  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited at approximately 22 weeks gestation at prenatal clinics. Of these, 86 (20%) were diagnosed as depressed. The women were seen again at approximately 32 weeks gestation and after delivery. Chronicity of depression was evidenced by continuing high depression scores in those women diagnosed as depressed. Comorbid problems were chronically high anxiety, anger, sleep disturbance, and pain scores. Less optimal outcomes for the depressed women included lower gestational age and lower birthweight of their newborns. Copyright © 2008 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The functioning of the genome is tightly related to its architecture. Therefore, understanding the relationship between different regulatory mechanisms and the organization of chromosomal domains is essential for understanding genome regulation. The majority of imprinted genes are assembled into clusters, share common regulatory elements, and, hence, represent an attractive model for studies of regulation of clusters of non-paralogous genes. Here, we investigated the relationship between genomic imprinting and diurnal regulation of genes from the imprinted domain of mouse chromosome 12. We compared gene expression patterns in C57BL/6 mice and congenic mice that carry the imprinted region from a Mus musculus molossinus strain MOLF/Ei. In the C57BL/6 mice, a putative enhancer/oscillator regulated the expression of only Mico1/Mico1os, whereas in the congenic mice its influence was spread onto Rtl1as, Dio3 and Dio3os, i.e. the distal part of the imprinted domain, resulting in coordinated diurnal variation in expression of five genes. Using additional congenic strains we determined that in C57BL/6 the effect of the putative enhancer/oscillator was attenuated by a linked dominant trans -acting factor located in the distal portion of chromosome 12. Our data demonstrate that (i) in adult organs, mRNA levels of several imprinted genes vary during the day, (ii) genetic variation may remove constraints on the influence of an enhancer and lead to spreading of its effect onto neighboring genes, thereby generating genotype-dependent expression patterns and (iii) different regulatory mechanisms within the same domain act independently and do not seem to interfere with each other. © The Author 2007.

AB  - Our aim was to measure the correlation between fetal electrocardiographic (FECG) recordings of low-risk pregnancies and polysomnographic (PSG) study parameters in low-risk infants born at term as a measurement of perinatal sleep-development continuity. We designed a short, prospective, observational follow-up of physiologic parameters between fetuses and newborns. We studied 10 fetuses from low-risk pregnant female out-patients and the same subjects as low-risk newborns delivered at term. Fetal state (FS) was defined in FECG recordings reassembling the following: fetal state I (quiet sleep or QS); fetal state II (active sleep or AS); fetal state III (quiet waking), and fetal state IV (active waking). Percentages of AS, QS, and wakefulness in PSG studies of newborns were also determined. Comparisons of FS I with QS showed a significant reduction in QS, while comparison of FS II with AS showed significant reduction in AS. Negative correlations were found between FS I with QS, and FS II with AS. Number of cycles in FECG recordings and PSG sleep cycles also demonstrated significant correlation. In conclusion our data showed partial but significant sleep function continuity from fetal to neonatal period. ©Ivyspring International Publisher. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins. Design: Descriptive longitudinal pilot study. Setting: Recruitment from 2 hospital postpartum units. Data collected in parents' homes. Participants: Eight primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation. Methods: Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue, and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables. Results: Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not significantly different between parents and remained constant over time. Conclusion: Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors that influence sleep in parents of twins. © 2008 AWHONN.

AB  - Objective: To simultaneously investigate the polysomnography (PSG) and nonstress test (NST) records of pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to observe NST changes during maternal desaturation and determine maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods: A prospective observational study of pregnant women assessed by questionnaire for symptoms of OSA. Women with self-reported frequent snoring or apnea were offered PSG and NST. Result: OSA was diagnosed in 4 (11.4%) of the 35 pregnant women who underwent PSG. Three (75%) had fetal heart decelerations accompanying maternal desaturation. The neonates of women diagnosed with OSA had lower mean Apgar scores and birth weights compared with neonates of women without OSA. Three neonates from the women diagnosed with OSA were admitted to the newborn healthcare unit. Conclusion: OSA in pregnancy has important maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should be assessed for symptoms of OSA and suspected cases should be offered PSG. © 2007 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - Objective: To describe sleep characteristics in high-risk antepartum inpatients. Design: Prospective descriptive design. Setting: Tertiary hospital in southern California. Participants: A convenience sample of 39 antepartum women. Methods: Data were collected from participants' medical records, questionnaires (General Sleep Disturbance Scale), actigraphy on days 3 to 4 after admission, and a sleep diary that included reasons for awakening and morning and evening fatigue ratings. Results: Week gestation ranged from 24 to 35 weeks. Sleep time varied from 310 to 492 minutes and averaged 6.7 hours/night. The women were awakened 9 to 32 times/night and averaged 18 awakenings. They napped an average of 124 minutes throughout the day. Women averaged 3.9 on the General Sleep Disturbance Scale when retrospectively considering 7 days before hospitalization and scored 4.1 when considering the current 3 days of hospitalization. In the diary, most rated their sleep quality as Fairly Good or Very Good (62%-71%), but 29% said Very Bad on night 2, and 38% said Very Bad on night 3. Conclusion: Frequent interruptions during the night do not allow for mothers to receive the restorative sleep they need. © 2008 AWHONN.

AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in asthma patients and can contribute to sleep disruption. The aim of the present study was to determine the time related disribution of GER events together with their impact on sleep in asthmatic subjects with GER disease symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: 18-65 years, controlled moderate to severe asthma and GER-compatible clinical evidence. The exclusion criteria were: chronic obstructive lung disease, smoking, infections of the upper airways, use of oral corticosteroids, other co-morbidities, pregnancy, sleep-related disorders, night-time shift work, and the use of substances with impact on sleep. Asthmatic patients with nocturnal symptoms were excluded. All-night polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring were recorded simultaneously. Of the 147 subjects selected, 31 patients and 31 controls were included. Seventeen patients were classified as DeMeester positive and 14 as DeMeester negative. Both groups displayed similar outcomes when general variables were considered. Sleep stage modification one minute prior to GER was observed in the DeMeester-positive group. Awakening was the most frequent occurrence at GER onset and during the 1-min period preceding 38% of the nocturnal GER. Sleep stage 2 was also prevalent and preceded 36% of GER events. In the DeMeester-negative group, awakening was the most frequent response before and during GER. Modifications in sleep stages, arousals or awakenings were associated with 75% of the total GER events analyzed during the period of one minute before and after the fall of esophageal pH below 4 in the DeMeester-positive group. These data provide evidence that sleep modifications precede the GER events in asthmatic patients.

AB  - Objectives: To present a longitudinal overview of the sleep schedules during weekdays and the weekend in a large sample of children and to examine the sleep-wake schedules in relation to nocturnal sleep duration and birth season. Design: Longitudinal survey design. Setting: Data were collected by home interviews and questionnaires. Participants: Data for sleep schedules at the ages of 4, 5, and 6 years on weekdays were obtained for 1112 children. Data for bedtimes on the weekend were available for 1094 children, and data for wake times on the weekend were available for 1083 children. Outcome Measures: Habitual bedtimes and wake times during weekdays and the weekend were reported by the mothers at the 3 ages. Nighttime sleep duration was calculated from bedtime to wake time. Birth characteristics came from medical records. Results: As children grow up, we found later bedtimes on the weekend for a given bedtime on weekdays. Interestingly, most children slept less during the weekend compared with weekdays. No significant difference (P>.10 for all) was found in the seasonal distribution of births in any of the sleep-wake schedules. Conclusions: Despite a lack of a strong preference for sleep timing during childhood, the displacement of bedtime toward later hours during the weekend starts early in life. More important, sleep-wake patterns are associated with sleep duration and later bedtimes on the weekend seem to shorten sleep duration in most children. ©2008 American Medical Association.

AB  - Obstetric cholestasis is an intrahepatic multifactorial disease, unique to pregnancy which presents with intense pruritis and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). It commonly presents in the third trimester and becomes more severe with advanced gestation. The prevalence of obstetric cholestasis is influenced by genetic and environmental aspects and varies in different populations. The pathogenesis appears to relate to a predisposition to the cholestatic effect of increased circulating oestrogens and progestogens. Also genetic mutations have been reported in a sub-group of women with elevated γ-GT. There can be significant maternal morbidity due to intense pruritis and consequent sleep deprivation. There may be malabsorption with steatorrhea resulting in vitamin K deficiency, prolongation of clotting times and increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Caesarian section rate is much higher for women with obstetric cholestasis. The potential fetal risks include preterm labour and prematurity and unexplained intrauterine death. The aim of the management of obstetric cholestasis is to avoid fetal complications and to relieve maternal symptoms. A variety of drug therapies have been used to reduce maternal pruritis. Policies of active management and induction of labor before 38 weeks may improve pregnancy outcome. Obstetric cholestasis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other causes of pruritis should be excluded.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The supine (back) sleep position has been found to be an important factor in the reduction of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This paper will examine infant sleep position in Oklahoma and offer recommendations to increase safe sleep practices for Oklahoma infants. METHODS: Oklahoma Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were used to estimate prevalence of sleep position among demographic maternal groups and related health behaviors. Chi-square tests were used to determine significance at p< 0.05. Logistic regression modeling was used to produce adjusted odds ratios to measure the association of selected independent variables and sleep position. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of Oklahoma newborns were placed on their backs to sleep most of the time, far short of the Healthy People 2010 goal of 70%. Almost 1 in 5 infants were placed on their stomachs to sleep, a known risk factor for SIDS. Women between 100-184% of the federal poverty level, African American women and mothers with more than one child were those least likely to place their infants on their backs to sleep. CONCLUSION: Overall, the issue of not utilizing the recommended safe sleep position, the supine position, is pervasive among all maternal groups in Oklahoma. Significant differences were present for only a few variables (race, income, parity) indicating a strong need for a consistent message on sleep position for all Oklahoma parents and grandparents.

AB  - Background: Concerns regarding potential harmful effect of medications on fetuses often result in inadequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy, whereas risks posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma are often underestimated. Objective: To evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on preterm delivery and fetal growth. Methods: Study participants were individuals enrolled in the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study between February 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003. Pregnant women with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 719) evaluated their asthma control repeatedly during pregnancy based on symptom frequency and interference with daily activities and sleep and reported hospitalizations and unscheduled clinic visits for asthma exacerbations. The incidence of preterm delivery, the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, and mean birth weight were evaluated relative to asthma symptom control and exacerbation measures. Results: The incidence of preterm delivery was significantly higher among patients with inadequate asthma symptom control during the first part of pregnancy (11.4%) compared with patients with adequate asthma control (6.3%; P = .02). Similarly, patients who were hospitalized for asthma during pregnancy had a higher incidence of preterm delivery (16.4%) compared with asthmatic women without a history of hospitalization (7.6%; P = .02). The effect seemed independent from use of systemic corticosteroids and other covariates. Neither the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction nor mean birth weight varied by any measures of asthma symptom control or exacerbations. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a substantial risk for preterm delivery posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma and provides additional evidence regarding the importance of adequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy to maintain optimal asthma control.

AB  - Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare itching bullous disease of pregnancy and the postpartum period. We describe the use of a new methodology for measuring the nature and intensity of itching in a 21-year-old woman with pemphigoid gestationis. At 19 weeks gestation, she developed an itchy rash over the limbs, which spread to the trunk. Blisters then appeared on the hands which subsequently also involved the feet. Intense nocturnal wrist activities in this patient, measured with a wrist monitor and defined as average acceleration in the early hours of sleep, were even higher than that in patients with severe eczema, with an average value of 181.00 ± 43.49 (mean ± standard error) g/min for the first three hours, versus 84.47 ± 8.53 g/min for the group of 24 eczema subjects. Most wrist activities were slower movements at 0 to 1 Hz. This is in striking contrast to the scratching activities at 0 to 3 Hz in eczema subjects. There have been no therapeutic trials for PG. Topical steroid and oral antihistamines are usually ineffective, but worked in our patient. We also discuss the potential application of the monitor in assessing the nature of various dermatological or systemic itching disorders. © 2008 The International Society of Dermatology.

AB  - Objective: To identify factors predictive of either lateral or prone infant sleep positioning. Study design: We used data for 11 340 mother-infant pairs from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State, 1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning. Results: Factors associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth, maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity. Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were predictive only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary insurance, receipt of government benefits, low infant gestational age, and low birth weight were predictive only of lateral sleep positioning. Conclusions: Factors predictive of either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Shorter sleep duration is linked to obesity, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. Whether sleep deprivation during the postpartum period affects maternal postpartum weight retention remains unknown. This study examined the association of sleep at 6 months postpartum with substantial postpartum weight retention (SPPWR), defined as 5 kg or more above pregravid weight at 1 year postpartum. The authors selected 940 participants in Project Viva who enrolled during early pregnancy from 1999 to 2002. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios of SPPWR for sleep categories, controlling for sociodemographic, prenatal, and behavioral attributes. Of the 940 women, 124 (13%) developed SPPWR. Sleep distributions were as follows: 114 (12%) women slept ≤5 hours/day, 280 (30%) slept 6 hours/day, 321 (34%) slept 7 hours/day, and 225 (24%) slept ≥8 hours/day. Adjusted odds ratios of SPPWR were 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.42, 6.94) for ≤5 hours/day, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97) for 6 hours/day, and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) for ≥8 hours/day versus 7 hours/day (p = 0.012). The adjusted odds ratio for SPPWR of 2.05 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.78) was twofold greater (p = 0.02) for a decrease in versus no change in sleep at 1 year postpartum. Sleeping ≤5 hours/day at 6 months postpartum was strongly associated with retaining ≥5 kg at 1 year postpartum. Interventions to prevent postpartum obesity should consider strategies to attain optimal maternal sleep duration. © The Author 2007. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

AB  - Pregnant mothers should avoid taking SSRI antidepressants - they are hazardous to the developing fetus, cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn baby, and induce biochemical and morphological abnormalities in the brain. If pregnant mothers need help with sad or anxious feelings, they should seek counseling or psychotherapy, especially family therapy involving the child's father, as well as other sources of emotional support. © 2008 Springer Publishing Company.

AB  - Objective: To identify biological and socioeconomic factors associated with the neurological development of Mexican infants born at term, as measured by brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs). Subjects and methods: We conducted a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic and biological factors. Results: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR = 3.63, 95% CI 1.23-10.67) after adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of arachidonic acid intake during pregnancy for short latency BAEPs and adequate fetal myelination. © 2007.

AB  - Background: Prevalence of asthma in developed countries increased between the 1970s and the 1990s. One factor that might contribute to the trends in asthma is the increased use of acetaminophen vs aspirin in children and pregnant women. Objective: To examine relationships between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and incidence of respiratory symptoms in the first year of life. Methods: A total of 345 women were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy and followed up with their children through the first year of life. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy was determined by questionnaire and related to incidence of respiratory symptoms. Results: Use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy was significantly related to wheezing (odd ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.0) and to wheezing that disturbed sleep (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.8) in the first year of life after control for potential confounders. Conclusion: This study suggests that use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy may be related to respiratory symptoms in the first year of life. Additional follow-up will examine relationships of maternal and early childhood use of acetaminophen with incidence of asthma at ages 3 to 5 years, when asthma diagnosis is more firmly established.

AB  - The treatment of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period raises unique concerns about safety for the developing fetus and the infant. An increasing number of studies suggest adverse effects from untreated stress, anxiety and depression as well as adverse effects from antidepressant and other psychotropic medications. Even when studies suggest a lack of short-term adverse effects with some medications, the paucity of systematic longitudinal follow-up studies investigating the development of children exposed to medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding causes apprehension. This review's objective is to highlight what is currently known about the negative effects of untreated disease and exposure to psychotropic medication, the treatment dilemmas confronting women with perinatal depression and issues that future studies should address so that a woman with perinatal depression can make an optimally informed decision. © 2008 Canadian Medical Association.

AB  - Objective: Large population studies have shown that low back pain affects about 50% of pregnant women. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of the BellyBra® in pregnant women with back pain is associated with changes in assessments of pain severity, physical activity and satisfaction with life after 3 weeks of intervention compared with tubigrip, a more generic form of support. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: A tertiary referral hospital in Australia. Population: Women between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy with lumbar back or posterior pelvic pain. Methods: Participants were randomised to the BellyBra® (the study device) or to tubigrip (the control) by means of computer-generated numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were pain severity and physical activity, and the secondary outcome was satisfaction with life. Results: One hundred and fifteen women consented to participate in the trial. Mean visual analogue scale scores of pain severity decreased from 6.1 to 4.5 in the study device group (P = 0.001) and from 6.0 to 4.7 in the control group (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference between the groups in this outcome (P = 0.61). However, the study device group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in Likert scale assessments of the impact of back pain on sleeping (P = 0.007), getting up from a sitting position (P = 0.02) and walking (P = 0.001) than the control group. There was also a significant reduction in the use of analgesic medication in the study group (P = 0.01). Conclusion: The BellyBra® and tubigrip were both associated with a reduction in the severity of pregnancy-related low back pain. The BellyBra® was more effective than tubigrip, however, in alleviating the impact of pain on a number of physical activities that constitute daily life. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Despite the traditional notion that pregnancy is a time of joy and emotional well being, evidence suggests that it does not protect women against mental illness. Untreated mental illness carries wide-ranging repercussions for mother, child and family that often outweigh those associated with treatment. Clinical management is complex, involving competing risks to mother and offspring; the challenge lies in effectively treating mental illness, whilst minimising exposure of the child to harmful medication. The paucity of robust published evidence on which to base the principles of psychiatric care further compounds the issue. Pregnancy significantly affects plasma drug levels and immature foetal/neonatal physiology renders the child prone to damage from pharmacological agents, all of which cross the placenta/enter breast-milk to varying degrees. Risks include teratogenicity, obstetrical complications, perinatal syndromes, and long-term behavioural problems. Despite evidence that some psychotropic drugs may be safe during pregnancy, knowledge regarding the risks of antenatal exposure to medications remains far from complete. The pregnant or breastfeeding woman requires an individualised risk-benefit analysis with regard to the commencement or continuance of psychotropic medication. If treatment is deemed necessary, monotherapy at the lowest possible dose should be prescribed. More robust safety data is available for older psychotropic drugs, which should be employed in preference to newer agents with unestablished safety profiles. Pregnant/breastfeeding women should also be educated with regard to early detection of signs of drug toxicity in both themselves and their babies. Despite shared responsibility, the ultimate decision with regard to reasonable risk, and what constitutes it, rests with the informed patient. Close psychiatric monitoring and coordinated multidisciplinary care with the obstetrician and paediatrician combine with such informed patient choices to comprise the components of a holistic model of care, targeted at optimizing the complex management of women with psychiatric illness during pregnancy. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: As pediatricians, we often experience agitated infants worrying their parents by crying for hours on end. Frequently, these infants are troubled by colics, but ever so often, no organic reason for such agitated behavior can be found. Prenatal as well as birth-related traumatization can lead to angst and emotional shock, thereby hindering the flow of qi in the body. Preterm babies can suffer a traumatization by the sudden birth and a sense of being "forced into the world" too early. The baby described in this case study was a preterm after 28 weeks with a very difficult postnatal period and extreme periods of agitation and crying. No objective reason for these "crying-fits" could be determined. Objective: To evaluate a diagnose using the criteria of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and then treat the baby accordingly, using laser acupuncture. Method: Heart rate monitoring over the 14 days before and during laser therapy. Discussion: Laser acupuncture treatment made the child calmer. The baby was able to relax and sleep more frequently. During the time of treatment, the mean heart rate dropped over more then ten beats per minute. Unfortunately, laser therapy could not be continued after the baby's discharge from the hospital. To improve parent-child-interaction, we decided to treat the child with a daily low dose of Phenobarbital. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects and methods: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI) > 25, AHI < 5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI < 25, AHI < 5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson's and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25 ± 0.23, 0.58 ± 0.55, and 0.51 ± 0.37 mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n = 23), obese non-apneics (n = 45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n = 29), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p = 0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p = 0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r = 0.22, p = 0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r = 0.10, p = 0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (β = 0.02, p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To explore the practices of Canadian obstetricians, family physicians, and midwives in recommending bed rest or activity restriction for women at risk for preterm birth (PTB) and to assess the decisional conflict experienced by care providers when they recommend these therapies. Methods: A self-administered mail survey of prenatal care providers was carried out using Dillman's Tailored Design Method. Analysis included descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. Results: The survey was distributed to 1441 potential participants; of these, 1172 were eligible participants, and 516 (44.2%) completed the survey. For women at risk of PTB, 60 of 170 obstetricians (35%), 88 of 206 family practitioners (42.7%), and 30 of 140 midwives (21.4%) recommended bed rest in hospital; 110 of 170 obstetricians (64.7%), 144 of 206 family practitioners (69.9%), and 73 of 140 midwives (52.1%) recommended bed rest at home. These recommendations occurred despite the response from about two thirds of each professional group that the effectiveness of bed rest was in the fair-to-poor range in helping to prevent PTB. The mean score on the Provider Decision Process Assessment Instrument, measuring decisional conflict for all care provider groups, was 30 (SD 7.4) (possible score range 12-60). There were no significant differences in decisional conflict scores among provider groups (F [2,347] = 2.24; P = 0.11). Conclusion: Care providers have been discouraged from routinely recommending bed rest for women at risk of PTB because of potential adverse side effects. This study demonstrates that most Canadian prenatal care providers have not been persuaded to incorporate these recommendations into practice. Except for women with multiple gestation, there is inconsistent practice in recommending bed rest and activity restriction. Additionally, Canadian prenatal care providers have some decisional conflict about using this therapy. These results provide some of the first Canadian perspectives on the practice of prescribing therapeutic bed rest for PTB. © 2008 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population, 1 RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis, 2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960. 3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy. 5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) 6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa, 7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria, 8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL). 11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity 10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for the PLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works; 5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The incidence of positional plagiocephaly (PP) has increased during the last 2 decades in the Netherlands. Although this is generally solely attributed to the advice to put babies on the back during their sleep, other factors might be of influence. Because the advice to take folic acid (FA) was initiated in the same period as the sleeping advice, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of FA on PP.It is known that a daily intake of 400 μg of FA around the time of conception is advised in periconceptive women to prevent development of neural tube defects. The maximal daily dietary folate intake is considered to be 250 mg with a bioavailability of 50% to 70%. However, periconceptional women may take a multivitamin containing pteroylmonoglutamine in addition to a FA supplement (isolated pteroylmonoglutamine). Therefore, the daily intake of FA will exceed 1 mg daily, which is considered the upper limit of daily folate ingestion.Data from the "Maastricht Cohort and Intervention study about pregnancy related girdlepain" were used to study the amount of folate containing supplemental intake of all the 7526 women. In this study, women were prospectively questioned about their FA intake. The entire cohort, considered the control group, was compared with a subgroup of women within this cohort with children with PP, treated by a plastic surgeon, considered the PP group.Double use, defined as isolated FA preparations in addition to folate containing supplements (vitamins), was seen more frequently in women giving birth to children with PP. In the PP group, double use was seen in 33.3% of the women compared to 13.2% in the control group.Although no statistical analysis could be made because the PP group was too small, the use of too high dosages of FA might have an adverse effect in causing more PP. This article does not want to discuss the beneficial effect of FA during pregnancy. However, we observed a potential empirical relation between PP and FA double intake requiring attention in more extensive studies. ©2008Muntaz B. Habal, MD.

AB  - Objective: To report the case of a neonate presenting with nonautoimmune thyrotoxicosis and failure to thrive in whom an activating TSHR mutation was suspected. Methods: We describe the clinical and laboratory findings in a neonate who presented with nonautoimmune thyrotoxicosis and failure to thrive, including results of DNA analysis of TSHR, which encodes the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Relevant literature is also reviewed. Results: The proband was born spontaneously at 35 weeks' gestation, and his early neonatal period was remarkable for meconium aspiration, pneumothorax, hepatomegaly with associated elevated transaminases, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. On days 9 and 11 of life, thyroid function studies revealed hyperthyroidism, which remained persistent on day 26 of life. On day 44 of life, the infant was admitted to the hospital. The mother reported he had an increased activity level, disturbed sleep, jitteriness, and exaggerated startle response. Weight was at the third percentile. After additional workup, Lugol's iodine solution, propanolol, and propylthiouracil were prescribed, which led to improvement in thyroid function. No TSHR antibodies were detected in the mother's or patient's sera. Analysis of the patient's DNA revealed a heterozygous T-to-C substitution at amino acid 568 in exon 10 (Ile568Thr), which predicts an isoleucine to threonine conversion in the second extracellular loop of TSHR. The mutation was not identified in the parents' DNA. Conclusions: A mutation causing constitutive activation of TSHR was confirmed in this patient, a finding that has implications for genetic counseling and consideration of total thyroidectomy or long-term thionamide therapy followed by radioiodide ablation as treatment options. Although rare, TSHR mutations should be considered in an infant presenting with thyrotoxicosis in absence of demonstrable TSHR antibodies in serum. © 2008 AACE.

AB  - Migraine prophylaxis is a stepwise procedure with lifestyle advice followed by consideration of medications. Patients should be advised to try to maintain a regular lifestyle, with regular sleep, meals, exercise, and management of stress, perhaps through relaxation techniques or other ways that are sensible for them. If this regimen does not adequately control their migraines, preventatives are indicated. Patients can choose between evidence-based nutraceuticals such as riboflavin, feverfew, butterbur, or coenzyme Q10, or more traditional pharmaco-therapeutics. Medicine choices are somewhat limited by what is available in each country, but from the full range, the medicines of first choice are beta-adrenoceptor blockers, flunarizine, topiramate, and valproic acid. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are particularly useful in patients also suffering from hypertension or tachycardia. Following recent studies, topiramate has become a first choice for episodic as well as chronic migraine. It is the only prophylactic drug that may lead to weight loss, but it is sometimes associated with adverse cognitive effects. Valproic acid and flunarizine also have very good prophylactic properties. However, valproic acid is often associated with adverse effects, and flunarizine is unavailable in many countries, including the United States. If sequential monotherapies are ineffective, combinations of first-line drugs should be tried before advancing to drugs of second choice, which are associated with more adverse effects or have less well-established prophylactic properties. Amitriptyline should be used carefully because of its anticholinergic effects, although it is useful in comorbid tension-type headache, depression, and sleep disorders. Methysergide is very effective, but it has been supplanted or even made unavailable in many countries because of its well-described association with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Pizotifen has a slightly better safety profile but is unavailable in the United States. Aspirin is particularly useful in patients needing platelet inhibitors for other medical conditions, but the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding must be considered. The prophylactic properties of magnesium, riboflavin, and coenzyme Q10 are low at best, but their lack of severe adverse effects makes them good treatment options. Magnesium may be particularly useful during pregnancy. Lisinopril and candesartan were shown to be effective in single trials and are preferable in patients with hypertension. Acupuncture may be another alternative; although controlled trials have failed to differentiate its effect from placebo, it is at least innocuous. Botulinum toxin A is not effective in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine. Copyright © 2008 by Current Medicine Group LLC.

AB  - Background. Conduct disorders related to hyperactivity and significant attention deficit are caused by several types of risk factors-genetic, biological, environmental and psychosocial. A cohort of children was followed longitudinally in a prospective study during the pregnancy and childhood (ELSPAC). In the age of 7 years, marked behavioural divergences were described in 4,4% of children by their attending physicians. These children were also more often afflicted by other pathological symptoms (hyperactivity, sleep and psychomotor disorders). From the data collected from parents and physicians in the previous phases of investigation we selected possible risk factors which affect the prenatal and postnatal periods: prenatal exposure of children to smoking, alcohol, chemical substances, prenatal development complications, the level of education of parents, family dysfunction, alcoholism of both parents, conflicts with the police, mother's disturbed mental health. Methods and Results. In the sample of 3752 children from the city of Brno, no behavioural divergence was found in 96.5% of cases. The presence of one or two of the four observed divergences occurred in 3.2% and 3 to 4 conduct disorder symptoms occurred in 0.3% children, significantly more often in boys. The children with conduct disorders compared to the children with no symptoms had significantly lower average birthweight, lower head circumference, their mothers had more often lower education, smoked and had psychological problems in childhood and as adults and the fathers had more often conflicts with the law. Conclusions. The ELSPAC study did not have the methodological possibility of studying the genetic-environmental interactions; nevertheless it contributes to the evidence supporting that some factors can negatively effect the foetal development and the unfavourable family environment can participate in the development of conduct disorders which can progress during lifetime.

AB  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with a wide spectrum of pathophysiologic consequences. Most cases are inherited and caused by sarcomeric protein gene mutations, although phenocopies are often encountered. Genomic research and family studies have improved our recognition of the disease and understanding of its natural history; however, tenuous links exist between genotype and phenotype and thus far have done little to alter clinical management. Surgery and, more recently, implantable cardiac defibrillators have had an impact on sudden cardiac death rates, with improved short-and medium-term survival. Therefore, managing heart failure has become increasingly challenging. Although heart failure due to fibrosis and a progressive loss of contractile function is common, treatment remains largely empiric. Case series and animal studies suggest that biventricular pacing and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modifiers may be useful in some patients, but there is a need for large prospective randomized controlled trials to study these and other treatments. Risk stratification and eligibility for sports participation remain hot topics, but one of the greatest challenges is the management of a growing cohort of asymptomatic gene carriers identified during family screening. Ultimately, major advances in treatment and disease prevention will come from a better understanding of the genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles of individual patients. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

AB  - The interest in paediatric sleep disorders over the last few decades has had its main focus on the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) - healthy infants who go to sleep and never wake up again. Overall, this is the most dramatic form of paediatric sleep disordered breathing. By contrast, classical presentations of sleep disordered breathing in children, such as snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea as well as their clinical implications have been greatly neglected and underestimated in the past. In contrast to snoring in adults, snoring in children has so far generally been regarded as noisy breathing witli no significant impact on the general health of children. This is also to a lesser extent true for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). The sometimes dramatic complications of OSAS, such as cor pulmonale and developmental retardation have at least indicated that OSAS in children is important and may have a great impact on the general health of children. This has led to an increased interest from a clinical as well as a scientific point of view with some important findings, mainly that sleep disordered breathing in childhood varies from sleep disordered breathing in adulthood and that even mild to moderate disease has a huge impact on the general health of children, mainly on neurocognitive development.

AB  - Ethanol's effects on the developing brain include alterations in morphology and biochemistry of the hypothalamus. To examine the potential functional consequences of ethanol's interference with hypothalamic differentiation, we studied the long-term effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on basal circadian rhythms of core body temperature (CBT) and heart rate (HR). We also examined the late afternoon surge in corticosterone (CORT). Core body temperature and HR rhythms were studied in separate groups of animals at 4, 8, and 20 months of age. The normal late afternoon rise in plasma CORT was examined in freely moving male rats at 6 months of age via an indwelling right atrial cannula. Results showed that the CBT circadian rhythm exhibited an earlier rise after the nadir of the rhythm in fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) males at all ages compared to controls. At 8 months of age, the amplitude of the CBT circadian rhythm in FAE males was significantly reduced to the level observed in controls at 20 months. No significant effects of prenatal ethanol exposure were observed on basal HR rhythm at any age. The diurnal rise in CORT secretion was blunted and prolonged in 6-month-old FAE males compared to controls. Both control groups exhibited a robust surge in CORT secretion around the onset of the dark phase of the light cycle, which peaked at 7:30 p.m. Whereas FAE males exhibited a linear rise beginning in mid afternoon, which peaked at 9:30 p.m. These results indicate that exposure to ethanol during the period of hypothalamic development can alter the long-term regulation of circadian rhythms in specific physiological systems. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, including drug- and electroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major chronotherapeutic inventions-light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain long-term improvement. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Significant overlap exists between the risk factors for pre-eclampsia and sleep-disordered breathing. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been proposed as therapy for pre-eclampsia. This prospective, longitudinal study was designed to characterize sleep-related breathing patterns in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia risk factors, and to describe the effects of early nasal CPAP therapy in these patients. Methods: Twelve pregnant women with pre-eclampsia risk factors underwent polysomnography to characterize sleep-related breathing abnormalities and baseline blood pressure determination. Patients with airflow-limitation underwent nasal CPAP titration and were treated with optimal pressures. Periodic assessments of CPAP compliance and tolerance, sleep quality, and blood pressure control were performed until delivery or pre-eclampsia onset. CPAP retitration was performed between weeks 20 and 22 of pregnancy. Results: Mean respiratory disturbance index was 8.5 ± 2.6 events/h of sleep, and initial nasal CPAP pressures were 5-6 cm H2O with an increase to 6-9 cm H2O after recalibration. All subjects with chronic hypertension maintained blood pressures below 140/90 with a mean diurnal blood pressure of 122 ± 2.5 mm Hg over 83 ± 1.5 mm Hg. Patient characteristics of obesity and prior pre-eclampsia were associated with pregnancies complicated by spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, or pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: Early application of nasal CPAP in pregnant women alleviated sleep-related breathing disturbances but was not sufficient to prevent negative pregnancy outcomes. Obesity and prior pre-eclampsia appeared to be important factors and were associated with the worst complications. However, nasal positive pressure may still be beneficial to decrease severity of outcomes, particularly if individualized to patient risk factors, more particularly hypertension at pregnancy onset. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the development of accurate and sensitive assays for measuring melatonin in plasma and saliva, it has been possible to advance our understanding of human chronobiology. In particular, the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is expected to have an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of circadian phase disorders and their treatment with appropriately timed bright light exposure and/or low-dose melatonin administration. The phase angle difference (PAD) between DLMO and mid-sleep can be used as a marker for internal circadian alignment and may also be used to differentiate individuals who are phase advanced from those who are phase delayed (a long interval indicates the former and a short interval indicates the latter). To provide a corrective phase delay, light exposure should be scheduled in the evening and melatonin should be administered in the morning. To provide a corrective phase advance, light exposure should be scheduled in the morning and melatonin should be administered in the afternoon/evening. The study of patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), as well as individuals who are totally blind, has resulted in several findings of interest to basic scientists, as well as psychiatrists and sleep specialists. ©2007 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB  - Serum corticosterone was previously studied in numerous elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays), but the role of this steroid, widespread throughout many taxa, has yet to be defined. The goal of this study was to test whether corticosterone varied in response to acute and chronic capture stress, and across the reproductive cycle in the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, and Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina. Serum corticosterone in S. tiburo increased following capture and again 24 h post-capture, possibly caused by interference with 1α-hydroxycorticosterone, the primary stress hormone in elasmobranchs. Higher serum concentrations in males compared to females were observed in both species. Variations in corticosterone also occurred during the reproductive cycle in both species. Consistent with other taxa, elevations in male bonnethead sharks and stingrays coincided with peak testicular development and mating. Elevations in female bonnethead sharks occurred from the time of mating through sperm storage into early gestation. In contrast, corticosterone levels in female stingrays were low during their protracted mating season, but elevated through late gestation and parturition. These results indicate that corticosterone has a limited role, if any, in acute and chronic stress associated with capture in S. tiburo, but likely has physiological functions associated with its glucocorticoid properties across the reproductive cycle of both species. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Various aspects of pineal structures and functions have been reviewed, mainly relating to our own observations and experiments. The pineal gland shows high amplitude circadian rhythms in cellular and metabolic activities, which are changeable under various circumstances. The pineal hormone appears to participate in the body's adaptive regulatory system mostly by cooperative and modulatory mechanisms, particularly in relation to environmental changes including stress/invasion, timing of physiological processes including reproductive activities, and possibly exogenous and endogenous pathological changes such as inflammatory disease and tumor. Pineal effects are variable due to the sensitivity/state of target mechanisms. For example, the pinealectomy effects on adreno-medullary adrenaline cells were more evident in comparison with the 'sham-pinealectomy' group than the normal group, and the pinealectomy effects on female reproductive activities were age-dependent. In any case, the pineal hormone retains physiological functions at least till middle age. Pineal actions are mainly inhibitory, but can be also stimulatory as shown in immune regulatory mechanisms. It has long been known that big differences in pineal structures and functions exist between mammals and submammals and that mammals show characteristic development of the brain, autonomie nervous system and unique style of reproduction including pregnancy and suckling. These and other related results seem to support a hypothetical view that the pineal hormone was involved in drastic reorganization of the regulatory system occurred in the evolutional process from submammals to mammals and became participated in the system which regulates complex body mechanisms in mammals.

AB  - Synchrony - a construct used across multiple fields to denote the temporal relationship between events - has been applied to the study of mother-infant interaction and is suggested here as a framework for the study of interpersonal relationships. Defined as the temporal coordination of micro-level social behavior, parent-infant synchrony is charted in its development across infancy from the initial consolidation of biological rhythms during pregnancy to the emergence of symbolic exchange between parent and child. Synchrony is shown to depend on physiological mechanisms supporting bond formation in mammals - particularly physiological oscillators and neuroendocrine systems such as those involving the hormone oxytocin. Developmental outcomes of the synchrony experience are observed in the domains of self-regulation, symbol use, and the capacity for empathy across childhood and adolescence. Specific disruptions to the parameters of synchrony that may be observed in various pathological conditions, such as prematurity or maternal affective disorder, are detailed. A time-based, micro-analytic behavioral approach to the study of human relationship may offer new insights on intersubjectivity across the lifespan.

AB  - Odour and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were measured on two 3000-sow swine farrowing farms, one with open earthen manure storage (EMS) and another with negative air pressure (NAP) covered EMS. Air samples were taken in Tedlar bags with a vacuum chamber from exhaust fans of barns and the NAP EMS. A wind tunnel was used to collect air samples from the manure surface in the open EMS. Collected samples were analyzed for odour concentrations with a dynamic dilution olfactometer and for GHG concentrations with gas chromatography. The average odour emission rate of the two farms was 316 OU s-1 AU-1 (AU - animal unit) from farrowing rooms and 113 OU s-1 AU -1 from gestation rooms. Odour emission from the NAP EMS was negligible in comparison with the open EMS. The open EMS contributed 57% to the total odour emission from the operation; whereas the NAP EMS contributed only 2% to the total emission. The total odour emission from the farm with NCP EMS was 58% of that from the farm with open EMS. The CO2 emission rates from the building exhaust ranged from 4.8 to 16.6 kg d-1 AU-1 and the rate from farrowing rooms was significantly higher than that from gestation rooms. The CH4 emission rates from the building exhaust ranged from 73 to 351 g d-1 AU-1. Both CO2 and CH4 emissions (CO2 = 2 g d-1 m-2; CH4 = 0.3 g d-1 m-2) from the secondary cell of the NAP EMS were negligible in comparison with the primary cell (CO2 = 89 g d-1 m-2; CH4 = 30 g d-1 m-2) or with the open EMS (CO2 = 455 g d-1 m-2; CH4 = 44 g d-1 m-2). The CO2 emission rate from the primary cell of the NAP EMS was significantly lower than that from the open EMS. Although the CH4 emission rate from primary cell of the NCP EMS was not significantly different from the open EMS, the total CH4 emission from the NCP EMS was only 26% of that from the open EMS because the size of the primary cell of the EMS was small in comparison with the open EMS.

AB  - During pregnancy several physical and hormonal alterations may affect normal sleep and the respiratory system and predispose pregnant women to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or worsen pre-existing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). SDB has been associated with several complications of pregnancy affecting maternal and fetal health. Clinicians should evaluate more closely obese pregnant women and those who develop hypertension. Early recognition and treatment of SDB may improve the outcome of pregnancy but the indications for treatment of OSAS need to be investigated. The diagnosis of OSAS in pregnancy requires a high index of suspicion and prevention of suspected SDB should be incorporated in the management of pregnancy. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the potential benefit of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) administration in pregnant women recognized to have hypertension early in pregnancy. Methods: This is a randomized study comparing the addition of nasal CPAP treatment to standard prenatal care to standard prenatal care alone in hypertensive women treated with alpha-methyl dopa during early pregnancy. Pregnant women with hypertension were recruited by their obstetricians and completed baseline sleep questionnaires and visual analogue scales on snoring and sleepiness. Subjects were then randomized to receive either CPAP with standard prenatal care (treatment group) or standard prenatal care alone (control group) with routine obstetric follow-up. Nocturnal polysomnography was performed in all patients randomized to the treatment group for initial CPAP titration. Periodic assessment of blood pressure control and CPAP compliance was performed by the same specialist at each scheduled follow-up visit. Results: In the control group (n = 9), a progressive rise in blood pressure with a corresponding increase in alpha-methyl dopa doses was observed, beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy. There was also an increase in the number of non-scheduled post-natal visits during the first postpartum month. Pre-eclampsia occurred in one subject; the remaining eight patients had normal pregnancies and infant deliveries. In the treatment group (n = 7), blood pressure was noted to decrease significantly as compared to the control group with associated decreases in doses of antihypertensive medications at six months of gestation. All treated patients experienced uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered infants with higher APGAR scores at one minute post-delivery compared to those of controls. Conclusion: In pregnant women with hypertension and chronic snoring, nasal CPAP use during the first eight weeks of pregnancy combined with standard prenatal care is associated with better blood pressure control and improved pregnancy outcomes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sleep is undoubtedly disturbed during pregnancy. The disturbances include an increase in nocturnal awakenings and greater periods of time spent awake during the night, as well as complaints of fatigue during the day. Although nausea (i.e., morning sickness) is most commonly expected in the first trimester, an increase in fatigue, which is often a consequence of disturbed sleep, is actually the first symptom of pregnancy (Lee 2006). Various contributors have been suggested or implicated in the magnitude of sleep disturbances in pregnancy, including hormonal, physiologic, physical (Baratte-Beebe and Lee 1999), and behavioral changes (Buster and Carson 2003; Challis and Lye 2003). As pregnancy progress, other symptoms contribute to sleep disturbances, some of them being fetal movements, leg cramps, shortness of breath, and an inability to get comfortable (Baratte-Beebe et al. 1999). This review will extend beyond the description of how sleep patterns change during pregnancy to suggest that there is an important relationship between pregnancy-associated sleep disturbances and cytokine and hormone changes that may have relevance to maternal and fetal health. Discussion will include how disturbances experienced during pregnancy are associated with cytokine alterations and hormonal changes, and how these relationships could add to a woman's risk for developing pregnancy complications or experiencing poor pregnancy outcomes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Epidemiological studies indicate that sleep disturbances in general population are highly frequent. It is estimated that approximately 40 million people in the USA has some kind of problem with sleep. The most frequent sleep complaint is insomnia whose prevalence is around 50% some time in the life. Only a small part of this population refer their sleep problems to the medical doctor with the consequence that only a minority is adequately diagnosed and treated. Sleep problems may appear at any age, and the epidemiological studies indicate the increase of specific prevalence with advancing age, with a special increase in the adults. It is estimated that the prevalence of sleep problems in childhood and adolescence is present in 25-40%. Some of the problems are more frequent in the female population, although not as a rule. The best example for this is the observed prevalence of sleep apnea which is present in 24% of male and only 9% of female population. Sleep problems are often associated with other diseases such as psychiatric or kidney diseases (patients on hemodialysis). However, their frequency may increase in physiologic conditions such as pregnancy. Overall characteristic of sleep diseases is that they may compromise daily functioning by causing deficits in memory, decrease in concentration, depressive mood, irritability, decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, having as a consequence decrease in the quality of life.

AB  - The goal of this report is to review all aspects of sleepwalking (SW), also known as somnambulism. Various factors seem to initiate SW, especially drugs, stress, and sleep deprivation. As an etiology, heredity is important, but other conditions include thyrotoxicosis, stress, and herpes simplex encephalitis. Psychological characteristics of sleepwalkers often include aggression, anxiety, panic disorder, and hysteria. Polysomnographic characteristics emphasize abnormal deep sleep associated with arousal and slow wave sleep fragmentation. In the differential diagnosis, the EEG is important to properly identify a seizure disorder, rather than SW. Associated disorders are Tourette's syndrome, sleep-disordered breathing, and migraine. Various kinds of treatment are discussed, as are legal considerations, especially murder during sleepwalking. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The traumatic loss of an unborn child after TOP due to fetal malformation and/or severe chromosomal disorders in late pregnancy is a major life-event and a potential source of serious psychological problems for those women. To obtain information on the course of grief following a traumatic loss, 62 women who had undergone TOP between the 15th and 32nd gestational week were investigated in a longitudinal study design and compared with 65 women after spontaneous delivery of a full-term healthy child. Grief, posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety and psychiatric disorders were evaluated 14 days, 6 months and 14 months after the event, implementing validated self-report and clinician rated instruments. Compared to women after spontaneous delivery, women after induced TOP were significantly more stressed regarding all psychological outcomes at all three measuring points. Especially, 14 months after TOP 13.7% of the women fulfilled all criteria of a complicated grief diagnoses following Horowitz et al. (1997, Am J Psychiat 154:7904-7910). 16.7% were diagnosed as having a manifest psychiatric disorder according to DSM-IV. All in all, 25% of these women were critically affected by the traumatic loss. TOP for fetal anomaly is to be seen as a major life event, which causes complicated grief reactions and psychiatric disorders for a substantial number of women. © 2007 Springer.

AB  - Objective: To examine the extent to which maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits are associated with obesity and overweight in 5-year-old Japanese children. Research Method and Procedures: We studied 1417 mother-child pairs enrolled in Project Enzan - a prospective cohort study. The dependent variables, childhood overweight and obesity, were defined with an international cut-off value. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits were used as independent variables. Results: Maternal smoking habits were associated with overweight in the 5-year-old children [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 4.11]. Maternal sleep duration of ≥8 h/d negatively affected childhood overweight (adjusted OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.04). Children whose mothers skipped breakfast were likely to become overweight (adjusted OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.77). The results of childhood obesity analysis were similar to those of childhood overweight analysis. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that there are effects of smoking during early pregnancy and other maternal lifestyle habits on the onset of childhood obesity in Japan. Therefore, interventions in maternal lifestyle habits are required to prevent childhood obesity, and these interventions should be initiated before pregnancy. Copyright © 2007 NAASO.

AB  - Since postpartum blues was described by Savage in 1875, the controversy regarding its nature and cause has been sustained. In a first part, the author reviews the conventional clinical assessment of the blues as described in international medical literature. Its constitutive symptoms are mundane, of an affective, emotional, cognitive or psychosomatic nature. On the other hand, their originality resides in the mildness, unusual nature and progressive profile of their expression. Some elements speak in favour of the normality of this phenomenon, such as its mildness and great frequency. But others give indication of a pathological process, notably its links with various entities or illnesses such as the premenstrual syndrome, acute psychoses and postpartum depressive moods. This aspect has moreover led to search for shared causes to these different co-morbidities, such as a constitutional predisposition, somatobiological disorders, a psychosocial condition or psychodynamic mechanisms. This debate, however, is far from being settled. In a second part - and in continuity with a previous work - the author adds three other symptoms to this classical approach: drop in intrinsic weight, decrease of activity and positivity to the dexamethasone test. In order to do so, he defines the notion of "gross prepartal weight" (weight as measured before delivery) and "neat prepartal weight" (resulting from the substraction of the foeto-annexial package from the gross prepartal weight). At the same time, he compares these data with those resulting from a questioning of twenty-one new mothers out of a university hospital ward on obstetrical difficulties, end-of-pregnancy psychic disorders or PMS case history. These analyses establish no specific link between the appearance of blues, the average age of the parturients, the notion of previous blues, lacteal inhibition under bromocryptine. On the other hand, as stated in the literature, the appearance of postpartum blues is closely connected to previous PMS history, a painful delivery, or a psychologically difficult end of pregnancy. The originality of these results consists of two elements: (1) the correlation between the intensity of the blues and the weight gain during pregnancy; (2) a probable increase of neat weight, as the author has defined it, in the first days following postpartum. In a more general way, the role of weight variation stands out distinctly if the weight curves during gestation and the aggravation of psychiatric morbidity are observed in parallel. In the analysis of surgical blues by Illes, the severity of cluster scores of decrease of activity and of vigilance is noted, along with a culmination of the pathology on the second day (and not on the fifth day as in postpartum), which can justifiably be attributed to the suddenness and precocity of weight drop. Also related to the role of weight, numerous quasi-experimental, historical or clinical situations of weight loss and their psychiatric impact can be quoted. On another level, one should consider the decrease of activity in the approached situations. While basic metabolism increases during pregnancy progressively to 20%, delivery occurs through short but intense efforts. Postpartum implies a sudden deceleration in the course of which a physiological bradycardian phase around the fifth day can be underlined, as Magnin well described it. Some authors have positively correlated the blues to the intensity of labour, which corresponds to the degree of deceleration. In the same way, symptoms of sleep apnea syndrome have been linked to its fragmentation and to O2 desaturation induced intellectual lapses, but an involvment of diurnal fits of sleepiness cannot be rejected. In the same spirit, the activating role, prior to their mood stabilizing effect, of antidepressants is well known and the role of the musculorespiratory peak of the convulsive crisis in sismotherapies can be looked into. Finally, the nearly constant positivity to the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is a symptom devoid of causal participation. Since Carrol's study, the frequent positivity of this test has been observed in depressed subjects. But there are multiple causes for positivity, starting with immediate postpartum, to such an extent that some authors have considered the test as more characteristic of the postnatal period than of any psychic disorder. However, the frequency of denutrition complications in DST - positive cases (insufficiently controlled diabetics, alcoholics, the aged and postpartum of course) is to be underlined. Numerous Anglo-Saxon authors have moreover put the emphasis on the link between weight loss and DST positivity, although they underlined the limits of this explanation. This is how the variations of activity may constitute an additional etiology. Actually, even if Weitzman has privileged the level of hypnic inhibition in regulating plasma cortisol, the inverted correlation between the latter's variations and those of activity is indeed striking. In this hypothesis, depressed subjects' curves would diverge mostly in the daytime to the extent of a difference in activity or a lack of activity more distinct than at night. To support this thesis, we will also point out the lower sensitivity of the test in ambulatory care, which may reflect a relative mildness of these cases but also a better activity, the standardization of the test when a depressive phase changes to excitement, the early standardization of the DST before the improvement of the mental state during sismotherapy or sleep deprivation. Weight loss and decrease in activity, which are of a physiological nature, would thus have a causal value, and the DST would only reflect these two elements. In the last part, the author engages in various physiopathological hypotheses and some commentaries. In his physiopathological hypotheses, he takes up Delay's idea of a regulating centre of mood, potentially subjected to variations of weight and activity. He mentions in particular that these variations may compensate each other, as with anorectics, or increase each other, as in postpartum blues. In his commentaries, he expands the previous ideas into his favourite theme, the deep motive for his research, which is the consubstantiality of acting and of being as the cornerstone of the holistic unity of the living, this concept being otherwise developed in an additional work quoted in reference. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2007.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. Methods: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Results: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. Conclusion: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention.

AB  - Background: Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are still widely practiced. However, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in people with insomnia. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED (the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), TCMLARS (Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database, the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, from inception to 2006, and the sleep bibliography, which is available at www.websciences.org/ bibliosleep. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving participants of any age with any type of insomnia were included. Included trials compared acupuncture with placebo or sham or no treatment, or acupuncture plus other treatments compared with the same other treatments. Trials that compared only acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone against other treatments alone were excluded, since they did not yield the net effect of acupuncture. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality according to a set of criteria for risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Relative risk (RR) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were used for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Data were combined in meta-analyses (on an intention-to-treat basis), where more than one trial without significant clinical heterogeneity presented the same outcome. Main results: Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 590 participants with insomnia, of whom 56 dropped out. Participant age ranged from 15 to 98 years, and the duration of insomnia varied from 6 months to 19 years. Co-existing medical conditions contributing to insomnia included stroke, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Apart from conventional needle acupuncture, different variants of acupuncture such as acupressure, auricular magnetic and seed therapy, and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) were evaluated. Meta-analysis was limited because of considerable heterogeneity between comparison groups and between outcome measures. Based on the findings from individual trials, the review suggested that acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve sleep quality scores when compared to placebo (SMD = -1.08, 95% CI = -1.86 to -0.31, p=0.006) or no treatment (SMD-0.55, 95%CI = -0.89 to - 0.21, p=0.002). TEAS also resulted in better sleep quality score in one trial (SMD= -0.74, 95%CI = -1.22 to -0.26, p=0.003). However, the efficacy of acupuncture or its variants was inconsistent between studies for many sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency, total sleep duration and wake after sleep onset. The combined result from three studies reporting subjective insomnia improvement showed that acupuncture or its variants was not more significantly effective than control (RR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.68 to -4.03) and significant statistical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study reported an adverse event, with one out of 16 patients (6.3%) withdrawing from acupuncture because of pain. Authors' conclusions: The small number of randomised controlled trials, together with the poor methodological quality and significant clinical heterogeneity, means that the current evidence is not sufficiently extensive or rigorous to support the use of any form of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. Larger high quality clinical trials employing appropriate randomisation concealment and blinding with longer follow-up are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.

AB  - Patients who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) present with infertility, recurrent miscarriages, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and acne. Many also have metabolic and hormonal abnormalities that can significantly increase risk for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and endometrial carcinoma. PCOS patients should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea. Early recognition may reverse physical signs of the disease, while correcting the metabolic abnormalities that can pose significant health risk if untreated. Although lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy are used to treat PCOS, there are few long-term outcome data regarding benefits of metabolic interventional strategies. Insulin sensitizers can improve ovulatory function, lower insulin resistance, lower androgen levels, and increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Further studies should yield other treatment options. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group (EURLSSG) is an association of European RLS experts who are actively involved in RLS research. A major aim of the Study Group is the development and continuous improvement of standards for diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Several members developed study designs and evaluation methods in investigator-initiated trials early in the 1990s, and all members have since contributed to many pivotal and nonpivotal drug trials for the treatment of RLS. The recommendations on clinical investigations of pharmacological treatment of RLS patients summarize the group's expertise and knowledge acquired through clinical trials. The recommendations primarily address how to plan and conduct confirmatory, randomized clinical studies in patients with idiopathic RLS. Advice is presented for the diagnosis of RLS and clinical and polysomnographic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary and secondary endpoints for an evaluation of efficacy are based on a critical description of validated methods for both short- and long-term trials, also in special populations (children, pregnant women, elderly patients). The recommendations include the assessment of augmentation. Finally, general issues including the evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as specific neurological and cardiovascular risks and sleep attacks/daytime somnolence, are discussed. The aim of these recommendations is to support research groups or pharmaceutical companies in the design of optimized study protocols. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Background. To determine the levels of oxidative stress markers in pregnant women who snore and compare with non-snoring pregnant women. Fetal outcome of these 2 groups was also evaluated. Materials and methods. Prospective, case control study. Some 40 pregnant women who snored and 43 non-snoring pregnant women were evaluated. The glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels of the 2 groups were studied. Infant birthweight, Apgar scores, and other indicators of fetal outcome were obtained. Results. The mean level of GSH-Px was significantly lower in the pregnant women who snored (p=0.005), while the mean level of MDA was significantly higher in this group (p=0.005). Levels of MPO were comparable between the groups (p>0.05). The pregnant women who snored did not have infants with evidence of an increase in compromised outcome. Conclusion. Although the pregnant women who snored had high levels of MDA, they did not appear to be at increased risk for delivering infants with fetal compromise. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Despite declines in prevalence during the past two decades, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) continues to be the leading cause of death for infants aged between 1 month and 1 year in developed countries. Behavioural risk factors identified in epidemiological studies include prone and side positions for infant sleep, smoke exposure, soft bedding and sleep surfaces, and overheating. Evidence also suggests that pacifier use at sleep time and room sharing without bed sharing are associated with decreased risk of SIDS. Although the cause of SIDS is unknown, immature cardiorespiratory autonomic control and failure of arousal responsiveness from sleep are important factors. Gene polymorphisms relating to serotonin transport and autonomic nervous system development might make affected infants more vulnerable to SIDS. Campaigns for risk reduction have helped to reduce SIDS incidence by 50-90%. However, to reduce the incidence even further, greater strides must be made in reducing prenatal smoke exposure and implementing other recommended infant care practices. Continued research is needed to identify the pathophysiological basis of SIDS. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Early environmental conditions may affect the development and manifestation of circadian rhythms. This study sought to determine whether the maintenance of rats under different T-cycles during lactation influences the subsequent degree of dissociation of the circadian rhythms of motor activity and core body temperature. Two groups of 22 day-old Wistar rats were kept after weaning under T-cycles of 22 h (T22) or 23 h (T23) for 70 days. Subsequently, they were kept in constant darkness (DD). Half of the animals in each group were born and reared under these experimental conditions, while the other half were reared until weaning under 24 h LD cycles (T24). Rats transferred from T24 to T22 or T23 showed two circadian components in motor activity and temperature, one entrained by light and the other free-running. In T22, there was also desynchronization between temperature and motor activity. Rats submitted to T23 from birth showed higher stability of the 23 h component than rats transferred from T24 to T23 after weaning. However, in comparison to rats born under T24 and subsequently changed to T22, animals submitted to T22 from birth showed shorter values of the period of the non-light-dependent component during T22, more aftereffects when transferred to DD, and a lack of desynchronization between motor activity and temperature. The results suggest that T-cycles in the early environment may modify overt rhythms by altering the internal coupling of the circadian pacemaker. Copyright © Informa Healthcare.

AB  - The nocturnal surge of melatonin is the endocrine expression of the circadian system and is essential for organizing the timing of various endogenous processes. Previous works suggest that, in the beginning of a defense response, the increase in circulating tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) leads to a transient block of nocturnal melatonin production and promotes a disruption of internal time organization. In the present paper, the concentration of melatonin and cytokines [TNF-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12] in the colostrum (postdelivery day 3) and in the milk (postdelivery days 10, 15, 20 and 30) obtained at midday and midnight from mothers who gave birth by vaginal or cesarean section were compared. The nocturnal melatonin surge observed 3 days after vaginal delivery was absent after cesarean section. IL-12 presented no daily variation in either case, while daily variations in IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-5 were observed after vaginal delivery and cesarean section. On the other hand, the increase in TNF-α after cesarean section resulted in suppression of the nocturnal melatonin surge. Daily variation of IL-2 was only observed after recovery of the nocturnal melatonin surge, 30 days after cesarean section. The present paper supports the hypothesis of a cross-talk between the pineal gland and the immune system, which could represent a putative immune-pineal axis. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling plays a crucial role in vertebrate segmentation. The FGF pathway establishes a posterior-to-anterior signaling gradient in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), which controls cell maturation and is involved in the positioning of segmental boundaries. In addition, FGF signaling was shown to be rhythmically activated in the PSM in response to the segmentation clock. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the FGF receptor gene Fgfr1 abolishes FGF signaling in the mouse PSM, resulting in an arrest of the dynamic cyclic gene expression and ultimately leading to an arrest of segmentation. Pharmacological treatments disrupting FGF signaling in the PSM result in an immediate arrest of periodic WNT activation, whereas NOTCH-dependent oscillations stop only during the next oscillatory cycle. Together, these experiments provide genetic evidence for the role of FGF signaling in segmentation, and identify a signaling hierarchy controlling clock oscillations downstream of FGF signaling in the mouse.

AB  - Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) differentially interacts with chromatin to regulate essential genes. Because complete ADNP deficiency is embryonic lethal, the outcome of partial ADNP deficiency was examined. ADNP +/- mice exhibited cognitive deficits, significant increases in phosphorylated tau, tangle-like structures, and neurodegeneration compared with ADNP+/+ mice. Increased tau hyperphosphorylation is known to cause memory impairments in neurodegenerative diseases associated with tauopathies, including the most prevalent Alzheimer's disease. The current results suggest that ADNP is an essential protein for brain function and plays a role in normal cognitive performance. ADNP-deficient mice offer an ideal paradigm for evaluation of cognitive enhancers. NAP (NAPVSIPQ) is a peptide derived from ADNP that interacts with microtubules and provides potent neuroprotection. NAP treatment partially ameliorated cognitive deficits and reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in the ADNP+/- mice. NAP is currently in phase II clinical trials assessing effects on mild cognitive impairment. Copyright © 2007 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

AB  - Objectives: To monitor preterm infants in a cot and a car seat and compare an observed car seat trial with polysomnography (PSG). Design: Non-randomised controlled trial. Setting: Regional neonatal unit. Patients: Preterm infants before discharge. Interventions: Nap PSG respiratory ana sleep variables were measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate. Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of the PSG and observed tests were predefined. Main outcome measures: Difference in respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG. Results: 20 infants (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and arousals in the cot than the car seat (p = 0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively). Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG. Conclusions: Immature infants exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.

AB  - Mosquito net ownership is rising in sub-Saharan Africa but will substantially reduce malaria only if nets are used and the most vulnerable household members sleep under them. We used data from 9 large-scale household surveys conducted in 6 African countries from 2000 to 2004 that enumerated all household members and nets owned, analyzing only net-owning households. Across countries, women of reproductive age and children under 5 (without gender bias) were most likely to use the net; least likely were children of age 5-14 and adult males. Nets commonly covered 2-3 people. If a baby net was used, fewer people used the family net. Pregnant women were more likely to use a net in 2004 than in 2000. In several countries, a sizable minority of nets owned were not used. Understanding intra-household net-use patterns helps malaria control programs more effectively direct their efforts to increase their public health impact.

AB  - Background: The medical students' knowledge about basic medical neuroscience in the preclinical level may be fragmented and incomplete. Objective: Evaluate the knowledge of students prior to a lecture on epilepsy in clinical level. Material and Method: One hundred ten fourth-year medical students' knowledge was accessed by a self-administered questionnaire. Results: The presented results revealed that 91.8% of respondents knew that epilepsy arose from a transient dysfunction in the brain. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs) were the most common type (91.5%) they knew and absence seizures were the least common type (33.6%) they knew. All of them knew that eating pork and punishment of gods did not cause epilepsy. However, 50% thought that genetics was a cause and 80.3% did not know that stroke and sleep deprivation (92.7%) cause epilepsy. About treatment and prognosis, only 28.2% of respondents thought epilepsy can be cured and patients should take antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure free 2-5 years (48.2%), life long (33.6%). They knew that the patients should be prohibited from driving (80%), working on machinery (74.5%), and (27.3%) avoid drinking. However, they knew that the patients could marry (100%), get pregnant (98.2%), and lactate (91.9%). Regarding the first aid management, 50.9% of them recommended that placing a piece of wood between the teeth during a seizure and perform chest compressions (20.0%). Means knowledge scores is about 60%, the highest score is the definition of epilepsy (90.2%) and the lowest is type of seizure (43%). Conclusion: The findings indicated that lecturers should review aspects of pathophysiology and emphasize on type of seizure, cause, consequences, and prognosis including first-aid management.

AB  - Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a recurrent disorder that occurs in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. It is characterized by intense physical, psychological, and behavioral changes that interrupt interpersonal relationships and disrupt the lives of affected women. Premenstrual syndrome is believed to affect 75% of women of childbearing age. Because no tests can confirm PMS, the diagnosis should be made on the basis of a patient-completed daily symptom calendar and the exclusion of other medical disorders. PMS symptoms occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and remit with the onset of menstruation or shortly afterward. The aetiology of PMS is still unknown uncertain, but are likely associated with aberrant responses to normal hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. A wide range of therapeutic interventions has been tested in the treatment of premenstrual symptoms. Most non-pharmacological interventions that have been proven efficacious require a series of interventions. If non-medical approaches are ineffective, drug therapy may be appropriate. Several pharmaceutics agents have been shown to relieve symptoms. Calcium carbonate and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have demonstrated excellent efficacy. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Migraine is a painful condition that predominantly affects women. Aside from the headache pain, migraine sufferers can experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and increased levels of stress, anger, and apprehension both during and between attacks (the cycle of migraine). Moreover, migraine is associated with the impairment of social, family, and work-related activities. Unfortunately, clinicians tend to focus treatment on the frequency and severity of migraine and often fail to address the overall functional impairment associated with this disorder. The goal of this review is to highlight the cycle of migraine and discuss its impact on the health and well-being of women. The frequency and severity of migraines, including interictal symptoms, should be considered when deciding on the most appropriate migraine therapy. Attention should also be given to the potential association between migraine and the physiological and hormonal changes that occur during menarche, pregnancy, or perimenopause. Healthcare providers should ask specific questions and be encouraged to expand dialogue with patients to reveal the full impact that migraine has on the daily activities of women both during and between attacks. This can help improve treatment strategies for the patient, with the goal of substantially improving symptoms, interictal distress, and the performance of their daily activities. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of epilepsy requires special considerations for certain groups of patients. In this review we will address some of these situations, such as epilepsy in women and the elderly. REVIEW SUMMARY: Epilepsy in women has specific implications, because a significant proportion of women will present epilepsy during reproductive age, affecting contraception, pregnancy, fetal development, and lactation. Moreover, the influence of sex hormones on the evolution of epilepsy is known, as well as the effects of treatment with antiepileptic drugs on fertility, endocrine function and possible adverse effects on weight, to say nothing of cosmetic aspects, sexual function, and bone metabolism. All these factors must be taken into account in the treatment and monitoring of women with epilepsy. The incidence of epilepsy is greater in the elderly than in other population groups and is under diagnosed. The special characteristics of this population, such as the presence of concomitant diseases or greater sensitivity to adverse effects, requires a thorough knowledge of the different options of antiepileptic drugs for each situation. CONCLUSION: This article reviews the different types of epilepsy most frequently observed in the elderly, etiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder in which the adrenal cortex fails to secrete sufficient amounts of steroid hormones. All adrenal hormones are affected in primary adrenal insufficiency, whereas only glucocorticoid secretion is deficient in secondary adrenal insufficiency. Low doses of hydrocortisone/cortisone acetate (20 mg and 25 mg daily, respectively) subdivided in thrice-daily administration approach the physiological cortisol profile and resolve clinical features. Clinical assessment is the mainstay for establishing adequacy of corticosteroid replacement therapy as no biochemical/hormonal marker is fully reliable. Glucocorticoid replacement has to be potentiated during stressful events (e.g., surgery, infection, delivery and trauma). Fludrocortisone (0.05 - 0.2 mg daily) is administered in order to normalise blood pressure and potassium levels, aiming for plasma renin activity in the upper normal range. Dehydroepiandrosterone (20 - 50 mg daily) may prove beneficial, but cannot as yet be recommended for routine clinical use. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Levetiracetam (LEV) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that is effective against a variety of seizure types. It is a pyrridoline derivative with a very favourable pharmacokinetic profile: excellent bioavailability, linear kinetics, minimal plasma protein binding and quick achievement of steady state concentrations. It is not metabolized through the P450 hepatic cytochrome system, does not induce its own metabolism and has no clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. It is available as film-coated tablets, liquid formulation for oral ingestion and intravenous concentrated solution. Controlled and open-label studies have shown its efficacy and safety as initial monotherapy and add-on treatment for partial-onset seizures in children and adults, and also as add-on therapy in refractory partial and primary generalized seizures. Its rapid onset of action, lack of drug-drug interactions and availability as an intravenous solution make it an optimal drug to treat epilepsy associated with other medical conditions. Preliminary reports also suggest potential efficacy in refractory status epilepticus, although this is not a registered indication. Levetiracetam is generally well tolerated, and no serious idiosyncratic side effects have been reported so far. Behavioral side effects (hostility up to aggressive behaviour) are not uncommon. Small, uncontrolled studies have suggested potential therapeutic potential in difficult-to-treat dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, tremors of different etiologies, migraine prophylaxis and mood disorders. This needs to be confirmed in larger, controlled studies. © 2007 Prous Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water supply is a basic public problem. In modern science, three periods with different approaches to define recommended water intake in adults can be distinguished. Pediatricians agree that hydration in children may be optimal only in breastfed infants. More data are required on the health effects of different hydration states and varying water intakes in particular age and gender groups to define optimal ranges of water intake. The fetus grows in an exceptionally well-hydrated environment. Water metabolism shows several peculiarities in preterm and term infants. Infant diarrhea remains a major topic of basic and clinical research. Water intoxication in infants, toddlers, and children is rare and can only be found in exceptional circumstances. Hydration status characterized by hyponatremia may play a role in the pathogenesis of febrile convulsions in toddlers. There is increasing indirect evidence that spontaneous drinking behavior of a population may be fixed and anchored in the age range of toddlers. Sex differences in hydration status are common, but not obligatory. What causes theses differences? What is behind the various circadian rhythms of urine osmolality in children? At what age and in what quantities can alcohol and caffeine consumption be tolerated? How can individual susceptibility be defined? Reflecting on the modern epidemic of obesity in children and adolescents, a public consensus concerning use and misuse of sweetened drinks seems mandatory. Dietary reference intakes of water refer to 24-hour intake. In nutritional counselling, food and meal-based dietary advice is primarily given. Young parents are confronted with a flood of advice of varying quality. Recommendations on fluid consumption should be collated and revised. © 2007 American College of Nutrition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. We investigated whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) is associated with the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in young adulthood. METHODS. The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5-27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring. RESULTS. The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing. CONCLUSIONS. Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold. Copyright © 2007 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Introduction: We studied whether maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy adversely influence lung growth and development of the offspring, resulting in poor early life lung function. Methods: Infants were participants of the Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER). Lung function measurements (single occlusion technique) were performed during natural sleep. Questionnaire data were used to obtain information on maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy. Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and resistance and compliance of the respiratory system, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results: Lower values of compliance (Crs) were found in infants of mothers with respiratory infections during pregnancy; Crs fell by 5.5% (P = 0.031). The difference in Crs between infants of mothers with and without respiratory infections during pregnancy remained unchanged and statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables. The more respiratory infections the mother experienced during pregnancy, the lower the value of Crs was in her offspring (P for trend = 0.016). Using Crs corrected for body weight the relationship with maternal infections was non-significant, however still showing a trend. Conclusions: The results of this study may indicate that mothers who experience respiratory infections during pregnancy have newborns with lower compliance of the respiratory system. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background. The goal of this study was to describe the physiological reactions of pregnant women confronted with an experimental psychosocial stressor, and to determine whether the protocol is adequate for stress testing during pregnancy. Methods. Healthy primiparae (n=120) took part in a public speaking and mental arithmetic test. Results. The protocol was found to induce significant increases in saliva cortisol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. The physiological reactions were relatively large compared to those of earlier published studies using physical and psychological stressors during pregnancy, but comparable or slightly lower than those of a group of non-pregnant participants (n=31) tested with a similar protocol. Also, inter-individual variability in reactivity was found, with subjects differing substantially in the magnitude of their reactions to the experimental situation. The cardiovascular responses were correlated to each other and to the overall level of cortisol during the test. Finally, reactivity showed circadian variations with cortisol and systolic blood pressure reactions significantly different (i.e. smaller or even absent) in subjects tested in the morning compared to those tested in the afternoon. Testing in the afternoon hours is recommended. Conclusions. The protocol described in this paper appears to constitute an adequate tool for studying differences in maternal stress reactivity during pregnancy, and as such, can be valuable for studies on maternal prenatal stress. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We present a favorable effect of ACTH therapy on a girl with early myoclonus encephalopathy (EME) with infantile spasms. Hydrops fetalis and intrauterine growth retardation had been evident from fetal period, and she was born with severe asphyxia at 31 gestational weeks. Erratic myoclonia with partial seizures developed at one month of age, and EEG showed suppression-burst patterns. She was diagnosed as having EME, and treated with anticonvulsant agents. Her seizures were intractable and persisted all day long. Erratic myoclonia with partial seizures progressed to infantile spasms at five months. ACTH therapy was initiated at six months. This ceased her infantile spasms, and also improved of erratic myoclonia and partial seizures. Erratic myoclonia during sleep disappeared, and decreased while awake. EME is one of the severe intractable types of epilepsy during early stage of life. It is characterized by myoclonus such as erratic myoclonia, and partial seizures. Few agents are effective. In EME with infantile spasms. ACTH therapy might be one of choices to be tried.

AB  - Background. The molecular components determining the timing for birth remain an incompletely characterized aspect of reproduction, with important conceptual and therapeutic ramifications for management of preterm, post-term and arrested labor. Methodology/Principal Findings. To test the hypothesis that oxytocin mediates circadian regulation of birth, we evaluated parturition timing following shifts in light cycles in oxytocin (OT)-deficient mice. We find that, in contrast to wild type mice that do not shift the timing of birth following a 6-h advance or delay in the light cycle, OT-deficient mice delivered at random times of day. Moreover, shifts in the light-dark cycle of gravid wild type mice have little impact on the pattern of circadian oxytocin release. Conclusions/Significance. Our results demonstrate oxytocin plays a critical role in minimizing labor disruption due to circadian clock resetting. © 2007 Roizen et al.

AB  - The acute side effects caused by cannabis use are mainly related to psyche and cognition, and to circulation. Euphoria, anxiety, changes in sensory perception, impairment of memory and psychomotor performance are common effects after a dose is taken that exceeds an individually variable threshold. Cannabis consumption may increase heart rate and change blood pressure, which may have serious consequences in people with heart disease. Effects of chronic use may be induction of psychosis and development of dependency to the drug. Effects on cognitive abilities seem to be reversible after abstinence, except possibly in very heavy users. Cannabis exposure in utero may have negative consequences on brain development with subtle impairment of cognitive abilities in later life. Consequences of cannabis smoking may be similar to those of tobacco smoking and should be avoided. Use by young people has more detrimental effects than use by adults. There appear to be promising therapeutic uses of cannabis for a range of indications. Use of moderate doses in a therapeutic context is usually not associated with severe side effects. Current prohibition on cannabis use may also have harmful side effects for the individual and the society, while having little influence on prevalence of use. Harm is greatest for seriously ill people who may benefit from a treatment with cannabis. This makes it difficult to justify criminal penalties against patients. © 2007 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zürich.

AB  - Circadian rhythmicity is a fundamental characteristic of organisms, which helps ensure that vital functions occur in an appropriate and precise temporal sequence and in accordance with cyclic environmental changes. Living beings are endowed with a system of biological clocks that measure time on a 24-hr basis, termed the circadian timing system. In mammals, the system is organized as a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, commanding peripheral clocks located in almost every tissue of the body. At the cell level, interlocking transcription/translation feedback loops of the genes Bmal-1, Clock, Per1-2, and Cry1-2, named clock genes, and their protein products results in circadian oscillation of clock genes and of genes involved in almost every cellular function. During gestation, the conceptus follows a complex and dynamic program by which it is simultaneously fit to develop and live in a circadian environment provided by its mother and to prepare for the very different environment that it will experience after birth. It has been known for a number of years that the mother tells the fetus the time of day and season of the year, and that the fetus uses this information to set the phase of fetal and neonatal circadian rhythms. There is evidence that the maternal rhythm of melatonin is one of the time signals to the fetus. In the last few years, the study of the development of the circadian system has turned to the investigation of the oscillatory expression of clock genes and their possible role in development, and to answering questions on the organization of the fetal circadian system. Emerging evidence shows that clock genes are expressed in the oocyte and during early and late development in embryo/fetal organs in the rat and in a fetal primate. The data available raise the intriguing possibility that the fetal SCN and fetal tissues may be peripheral clocks commanded by separate maternal signals. The rapid methodological and conceptual advances on chronobiology may help to unravel how the developing embryo and fetus faces time in this plastic period of life. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Richter fully appreciated the fundamental biological importance of sex differences, in particular the challenges of female reproductive function to the two classes of behavior that most engaged him, endogenous rhythms and "self-regulatory" behaviors. Indeed, his contributions in these areas justify honoring him as one of the founders of behavioral neuroendocrinology. During the 1920s Richter, together with Wang, Kinder and other students, performed elegant phenomenological and mechanistic studies of sex differences in rats' spontaneous locomotor activity, nest building, and food intake. All of these behaviors display rhythms entrained to the ovarian cycle in female rats, and Richter's analyses of them formed the bases of many current areas of behavioral neuroscience. Slightly later, Richter made fundamentally important discoveries related to nutrient self-selection in pregnant and lactating rats, including changes in micronutrient and macronutrient selection. These data played a major role in the development of his concept of behavioral regulation of homeostasis. Unfortunately, some of these discoveries are rarely recalled. This is both historically regrettable and potentially an impediment to contemporary research progress. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been established that estrogen can alter circadian rhythms in behavior and endocrine physiology in rodents. The uterus is a reproductive organ that is critical dependent on regulation by ovarian steroids. Here, we examined the expression of Per1 in diffierent comnpartments of the uterus, and explored whether the ovarian steroids could regulate Per1 expression employing ovariectomized rat uterus. RT-PCR analysis showed that Per1 was cyclically expressed in the uterus. As revealed by in situ hybridization, the staining intensity of Per1 mRNA was stronger at ZT 8 than at ZT 0 in the uterine luminal epithelium (LE), stroma (S), and myometrium (M) compartments, but was not changed in the glandular epithelium (GE). Both in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that estradiol (E2) administration induced high expression of Per1 in the LE, GE, and M, and less expression in the S compartment. Progesterone (P4) treatment resulted in an obvious enhancement of Per1 expression in the LE, GE, and S, but unchanged in the M compartment. Furthermore, the E2- and P4-activated Per1 expression was significantly repressed by their respective antagonists, ICI182 780 and RU486. These findings were further supported by RT-PCR analysis of Per1 expression in cultured uterine stromal cells. Collectively, the present data indicate that E2 and P4 might be involved in modification of circadian rhythm via direct regulation of the expression of clock genes. © 2007 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of acupressure and vitamin B6 in the outpatient treatment of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Study design: Pregnant volunteers with symptoms of mild to moderate nausea and vomiting between 6 and 12 weeks' gestation participated in a 7-day clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a device for acupressure therapy and placebo drug or an otherwise identical but non-stimulating placebo device and vitamin B6. The primary outcome measure was self-recorded symptoms according to Rhodes index. Secondary outcome measures were weight gain and medication use. Results: The mean change in Rhodes index was not significantly different between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in weight gain and medication use between the two groups. Conclusion: Acupressure therapy is not more effective than vitamin B6 in reducing nausea and vomiting in symptomatic women in the first trimester of pregnancy. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a distressing urge to move the legs and sometimes other parts of the body. Diagnosis is based on clinical features that may be easily remembered with the mnemonic URGE: Urge to move, Rest induced, Gets better with activity, and Evening and night accentuation. RLS is common, Its prevalence increases with age, and women are more frequently affected. The course is chronic with often severe sleep disruption, including periodic leg movements. Differential diagnosis Includes disorders of restlessness and leg discomfort. Primary RLS is familial and likely to be genetic. Important causes of secondary RLS are end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. Every patient should be checked for iron status with a serum ferritin measurement.

AB  - Pregnant women experience disturbed sleep that varies throughout the gestational period. In clinical studies of nonpregnant cohorts, data link disturbed sleep with increases in inflammatory markers. Emerging evidence has also found associations between increased inflammation and medical morbidity, including various pregnancy complications. The authors have previously shown a correlation between sleep disturbances and serum cytokine levels. They extend this initial observation by evaluating the relationship between sleep during mid and late pregnancy and inflammatory cytokines in both serum and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subjective sleep during pregnancy, described by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and sleep diaries, and circulating and stimulated measures of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were evaluated in 19 pregnant women. The authors found that greater sleep complaints in late pregnancy were associated with both increased circulating and stimulated IL-6 levels. Short sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency in both mid and late pregnancy were associated with higher stimulated levels of IL-6. No relationships were observed for TNF-α. These preliminary findings indicate that women who experience sleep disturbances as early as mid gestation are likely to have an increase in inflammation. © 2007 by the Society for Gynecologic Investigation.

AB  - Study Objective: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by passive smoking. In this study we investigated the effects of passive smoking on sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Design: Two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys conducted in 2002 and 2006. Setting: Clinical institutions specializing in obstetrics and gynecology that participated in the nationwide surveys: 260 in the 2002 survey and 344 in the 2006 survey. Participants: 16,396 and 19,386 pregnant women in Japan surveyed in 2002 and 2006, respectively. Intervention: N/A. Measurements and Results: Pregnant women exposed to passive smoking were likely to have sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably. Smoking pregnant women had the same sleep disturbances and also experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and early morning awakening. The prevalence of 5 types of sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably) among nonsmokers with environmental tobacco smoke showed a mean value intermediate between that of active smokers and that of non-smokers without environmental tobacco smoke. Conclusion: Passive smoking is independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy.

AB  - Study objectives: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). Design: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. Setting: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone. Participants: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 ± 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 ± 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 ± 6.34 years). Interventions: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors. Measurements and Results: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors. Conclusion: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

AB  - Polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female hormonal disorders. Its multiple components - reproductive, metabolic, neoplasic and cardiovascular - have a major impact on the public health. Androgen excess and resistance to insulin, probably from genetic origin, are responsible for most of the clinical symptomatology. Resistance to insulin seems to be accompanied by a greater risk of glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, lipidic anomalies and can involve the development of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, sleep apnea syndrome is more progressively described in PCOS. Infertility, menses disorders and hirsutism often push these patients to consult their physician. A better understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms led to the emergence of new therapeutic options increasing the sensitivity to insulin. Besides the pregnancy wishes, cares aim to attenuate the marks of the hyper-androgenism (hormonal treatment and cosmetic) and to correct cardiovascular, respiratory and gynaecological risk factors. In case of infertility by anovulation, cares must be performed by trained experts to minimize the risk of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancies. A gradation from loose weight to clomiphene citrate ovulation induction, ovarian drilling, low dose gonadotropin, in vitro fertilisation, or in vitro maturation of oocytes should bring back good reproduction potential. © 2007.

AB  - Introduction: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is thought to be due to compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It is known that carpal tunnel pressures are elevated in wrist postures of flexion and extension and in those patients with CTS. Classic symptoms of CTS include night waking with pain, tingling, and numbness. These classic symptoms stimulated our interest in the relationship of sleep to the development of CTS. Method: We reviewed the literature surrounding the epidemiology of CTS and the literature regarding sleep disturbances. Through careful distillation of these studies and a process of reasoning, we have developed a hypothesis for a causal mechanism of CTS. Results: Epidemiologically, it has been shown that CTS is associated with age, gender, increased body mass index (BMI), diabetes, pregnancy, and is more common in some populations. The same associations noted above for CTS are strongly associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances due to age, gender, BMI, pregnancy, and population variations are all associated with sleeping in the lateral position supporting the hypothesis that a common causative mechanism of CTS is sleeping in a lateral position. Discussion: We believe that the epidemiologic associations with CTS act through a common causative mechanism, increased sleeping in the lateral position which puts the wrist at increased risk of flexion or extension, compressing the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. This hypothesis is simple and explains the connection between a previously unconnected group of epidemiologic associations. This realization has real clinical significance in that it focuses our attention on the early disorder when it is completely reversible. It clarifies previously confused clinical circumstances, creates research questions that can be tested, and it invites us to change our clinical perspective in this most common form of nerve compression. © American Association for Hand Surgery 2007.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of acupuncture under real life conditions, in the treatment of emotional complaints during pregnancy. Methods: A group of 51 conventionally treated pregnant women (with counselling by their physicians and nurses) was allocated by chance into two groups to be either treated or not by acupuncture. Both groups (28 in the study group and 23 in the control group) presented emotional complaints such as anxiety, depression and irritability. They reported the severity of symptoms using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10; and they rated how much the symptoms disturbed five aspects of their lives: mood, sleep, relationships, social activities, sexual life and joy of living. Traditional acupuncture was used. In order to facilitate protocols we used pre-programmed points. Up to four points were permitted as optional points. Results: Three women from the acupuncture group and four from the control group dropped out of the study. Over the study period, the NRS scores of intensity of emotional distress decreased by at least half in 15/25 (60%) of patients in the study group and in 5/19 (26%) of those in the control group (P=0.013). The impact of the distress on three out of the five aspects of life was significantly less in the acupuncture group when compared with the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Emotional complaints are very common in pregnancy and medication is always a risk. In this study, acupuncture seems to be an efficacious means of reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life of women with emotional complaints during pregnancy. Large randomised studies are recommended to confirm these results.

AB  - Background: Fetal behavioral states are important indicators of fetal physiology and pathology associated to typical fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. Aim: To provide linear and nonlinear analysis of FHR patterns associated with fetal behavioral states regarding a better understanding of these states and patterns. Study design and subjects: Fifty FHR tracings from normal term pregnancies with a median duration of 40.3 min were acquired with the SisPorto® 2.01 system for computerized analysis of cardiotocograms. Each tracing was divided into consecutive 10-minute segments and each segment was classified by two experts as pattern A, B, C or D. Outcome measures: Linear and nonlinear indices were computed in each segment, namely mean FHR, long-term irregularity index (LTI), very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency spectral indices, approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). Kappa statistic (κ) and proportions of agreement (Pa) were used for assessment of inter-observer agreement. Bootstrap percentile confidence intervals and nonparametric statistical tests were calculated for statistical inference. Results: Overall agreement between experts in pattern classification was good to excellent with values for κ and Pa of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.94) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96), respectively. Most linear domain indices increased significantly with rising fetal activity whereas the opposite occurred with nonlinear indices, except for SampEn(2, 0.1). LF/(MF + HF) ratio also significantly increased with fetal activity, denoting an increased sympatho-vagal balance. Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that entropy and linear variability indices measure different FHR features. FHR patterns associated with active sleep (B) and active wakefulness (D) evidenced more signs of autonomous nervous system activity, with sympatho-vagal imbalance, and less signs related to complexity or irregularity control systems than patterns associated with calm sleep (A) and calm wakefulness (C). © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurological disorder. It usually appears when patients try to relax in the evening or to sleep at night with, sometimes, unpleasant restless feelings in their legs and/or need to move them which can be relieved by movement or walking. RLS is a very common condition and, often, disabling; epidemiological studies suggest that it affects 5-10% of the general population in the United States and Northern Europe. It occurs typically in adults and elders, but it can affect also children. The prevalence and severity of RLS increase with age and its incidence in women is the double than in men. The most frequent form of RLS is idiopathic, but it can occur as a consequence of or in association with a series of different clinical conditions, such as iron deficiency, pregnancy, renal failure, spinocerebellar ataxia, spinal stenosis, polyneuropathies, lumbosacral radiculopathy, and Parkinson's disease. The current therapeutic approach is based on dopamine-agonists which are usually effective for the relief of the subjective symptoms and motor disturbances which precede and accompany RLS patients' sleep. The knowledge of this syndrome is important for the real possibility to modify positively its disturbing symptoms.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Synthetic ligands to one family member, PPARγ, are currently widely used as treatment for chronic diseases such as diabetes type II and other insulin resistances, e.g. as seen in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Moreover, novel approaches employing knock-out mice demonstrated that PPARγ seems to play a key role in placental and fetal development. This review describes recent insights into the role of PPARs in human reproduction with specific reference to infertility, placental maturation and fetal development as well as disturbed pregnancy. Further, we highlight the current knowledge on synthetic ligands to PPARγ used as a treatment in women with PCOS. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.

AB  - Objective: To collect data regarding breastfeeding practice and the implementation of evidenced based primary prevention programmes for a medical audit and specific intervention planning in public health. Methods: 19 family paediatricians, 11 from Palermo, Sicily, and 8 from the province underwent a longitudinal study on a cohort of newborns in the first semester 2005 up to six months of age by submitting a questionnaire to mothers during well child visit at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Results: 494 newborns were recruited; 485 completed the follow up. In 74% delivery was in public health hospitals, the remaining part in private hospitals. 50.3% were cesarean sections (43.5% in public hospitals; 69.3% in private hospitals). Only 16.6% of mothers underwent a preparatory course during pregnancy up to birth. The rate of complete breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding + predominant breastfeeding) at hospital discharge was 64% and at 6 months 19%. Complete breastfeeding was significantly higher and lasted more in newborns breastfed within 6 hours from birth and in newborns who did not receive any supplementation during hospitalisation. There were no significant differences regarding the type of delivery. A higher educational level, a previous breastfeeding experience and a preparatory pregnancy course were positively linked to the duration of breastfeeding. Only 64% of mothers had received at hospital discharge specific advice regarding newborn's sleeping position; a correct behaviour reached about 78% of cases, due to the family paediatrician's advice, nevertheless in time this effect slowly weakened. At the first well child visit only 72% of parents declared to use a safety car seat for his child and 94% at six months of age. 50% of children were exposed to passive smoking and only 7.5% of parents corrected their behaviour during the follow up. Only 5.3% of women assumed folic acid at least 1 month before conception. Conclusion: Results confirm the difficulty in transferring scientific knowledge in practices. Stimulating with appropriate tools the sharing of guide lines among professionals of different health services and monitoring their realization is a good challenge for future.

AB  - Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Over- and under-use of amiodarone is common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Because of adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000,1 reviews indications for use of amiodarone and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects.

AB  - Antimalarial drugs remain the major intervention tool for the global malaria control efforts that save millions of lives. Nonetheless, emergence and spread of Plasmodium parasites resistant against chloroquine and other major antimalarial drugs has brought the urgency to develop a new generation of safe and effective drugs against malaria. In this article, the safety data for major antimalarial drugs is reviewed. Although an ample amount of clinical data regarding the safety and tolerabiltiy of several of these drugs in older children and adults is available, more critical safety and tolerability studies in pregnant women and young children is desirable. To offset the partial loss in efficacy due to drug resistance in malaria parasites acquired against specific drugs, treatment regimens often rely upon the combination of two or more drugs. However, combination therapy requires additional safety, toxicity and tolerability studies in all population groups where these drugs are administered. A uniform standard in assessing the safety and tolerability of antimalarial drugs will be useful in the formulation and implementation of malaria treatment policies that are based on the drug effectiveness, safety and tolerability. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Sleep/wake regulation is quite different during the neonatal and adult periods. Although cholinergic neurons have been recognized to be the major source of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep regulation in adulthood, their effect on neonatal REM sleep remains to be discovered. Current evidence suggests that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) may play a role in REM promotion during the neonatal period. We conducted the following study to test our hypothesis that blocking CRF R1 receptor would reduce REM sleep in developing rat pups. First, rat pups were surgically implanted with electrodes on postnatal day (PN) 13. On PN 14, six hours of polysomnographic (PSG) data were collected before and after administration of three different doses of NBI 27914 (NBI), a CRF R1 receptor antagonist. Compared with baseline, REM sleep was significantly reduced in all groups treated with NBI but not with dimethyl sulfoxide/saline. The reduction of REM sleep was dose-related and was replaced primarily by non-REM (NREM) sleep. Second, two groups of rat pups were given a single dose of either NBI or vehicle on PN 14 for quantification of ACTH and acetylcholine without PSG recording. NBI induced no change of either ACTH or acetylcholine. Third, the effect of administering atropine (6 mg/kg) on sleep/wake in two-week-old rats was investigated. Atropine suppressed REM sleep significantly and increased wakefulness simultaneously. Our data revealed that blockage of CRF R1 receptors deprives neonatal REM sleep. The mechanism for CRF in enhancing REM sleep may be associated with but not be similar to the cholinergic mechanism. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report on a 3-year-old male, born at 34 weeks of gestation, with marked pre- and postnatal overgrowth, birth weight of 6,600 g, length of 61 cm, and head circumference of 38.5 cm. A striking phenotype was recorded at birth, which became more evident during the follow-up period. He had macrobrachycephaly, facial abnormalities, small thoracic cage, long trunk, deformed spine, rhizomelia, large hands and feets, absent subcutaneous fat, small umbilical hernia, inguinal hernias, and large joints with mild contractures. Hypoglycemic episodes and obstructive apnea complicated the neonatal period. During follow-up, overgrowth continued with a height of 146 cm (+11.65 SDS) and a weight of 39 kg (BMI 18.3 kg/m2) at 3.5 years. Endocrinological work-up disclosed extremely low levels of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factors, and insulin. What makes our patient unique is the association of marked prenatal overgrowth; unusual phenotype; skeletal dysplasia caused by accelerated endochondral ossification resulting in cartilage hyperplasia of the skull base and spine, and postnatal gigantism; and complete absence of subcutaneous fat. Other well-known overgrowth syndromes were excluded. We hypothesize that autocrine/paracrine growth factors could be the cause of excessive endochondral ossification. Alternately, activating mutations in transcription factors involved in both growth and endocrine/metabolic homeostasis could be responsible for this unusual phenotype. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Chronic hyper-activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis is associated with the suppression of reproductive, growth, thyroid and immune functions that may lead to various pathological states. Although many individuals experiencing stressful events do not develop pathologies, stress seems to be a provoking factor in those individuals with particular vulnerability, determined by genetic factors or earlier experience. Exposure of the developing brain to severe and/or prolonged stress may result in hyper-activity of the stress system, defective glucocorticoids-negative feedback, altered cognition, novelty seeking, increased vulnerability to addictive behaviour, and mood-related disorders. Therefore, stress-related events that occur in the perinatal period can permanently change brain and behaviour of the developing individual. Prenatal restraint stress (PRS) in rats is a well-documented model of early stress known to induce long-lasting neurobiological and behavioural alterations including impaired feedback mechanisms of the HPA axis, disruption of circadian rhythms and altered neuroplasticity. Chronic treatments with antidepressants at adulthood have proven high predictive validity of the PRS rat as animal model of depression and, reinforce the idea of the usefulness of the PRS rat as an interesting animal model for the design and testing of new pharmacologic strategies in the treatment of stress-related disorders. © 2007.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether prematurity affects heart rate responses during spontaneous arousals. Polygraphic recordings were performed during undisturbed daytime naps in 35 preterm infants (gestational age at birth 32 ± 2 weeks) and 35 term infants. Arousals were scored according to the recommendations of the International Paediatric Work Group on Arousals and categorized either as cortical arousals (CA) or subcortical arousals (SCA). Heart rate (HR) and respiratory frequency (RF) were measured during arousal and during the 10-s and 30-s period before and after arousal. Changes in HR and RF were expressed as the percentage of modification normalized for the 30-s period preceding arousal. Altogether, 122 arousals in preterm infants (66 CA, 56 SCA) and 105 arousals in term infants (57 CA, 48 SCA) were scored. Mean duration of the arousal period was 9 ± 4 s and 8 ± 3 s, respectively. In term infants, a significant increase in HR during arousal could be shown (11.3 ± 8.2%; p < 0.001), whereas this increase was significantly greater during CA compared to SCA (13.7 ± 6.2% versus 8.4 ± 9.4%; p < 0.001). In contrast, HR decreased during arousal in preterm neonates (- 3.9 ± 19.3%; p < 0.05). These findings suggest that cardiovascular control seems to be maturationally delayed in preterm infants, which may contribute to their increased risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Insomnia is a common sleep disorder with devastating socioeconomic consequences. Even though there are pharmacological and behavioral treatments for insomnia, most of the patients are treated with medications. However, the long-term use of medications to treat insomnia is questioned and has potential side effects. More and more Americans are seeking complementary/alternative treatments for many conditions including insomnia and there are anecdotal reports/case series of use of acupuncture in treating insomnia. To examine critically the role of acupuncture in treatment of insomnia, we performed a systematic review of published literature. Among the selected studies for review many were clinical case series and few open or randomized clinical trails. Even though several of these studies did not clarify the nature of insomnia (primary vs. secondary), it seemed that many of the subjects enrolled in these studies had co-morbid other psychiatric (depression or anxiety disorders) and/or medical conditions (Hemodialysis, Stroke, Pregnancy). Except for few, several of these studies had methodological limitations. Despite the limitations of the reviewed studies, all of them consistently indicate significant improvement in insomnia with acupuncture. Further methodologically strong, randomized controlled studies with large sample size are needed to assess the usefulness of acupuncture in treatment of insomnia and explore the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture on sleep and sleep disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Activity during pregnancy has health implications for mother and child. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to examine changes in activity levels during pregnancy; the influence of socioeconomic factors and well-being on activity, and the influence of activity on maternal anthropometric measures and birth outcome. Twenty-four hour activity diaries were collected for 3 d in months 4 and 7 of pregnancy in 197 volunteers. Anthropometric measures and questionnaires to determine personal details were collected at these times and 2 months post-partum. Health records were used to supply infant measures. The time spent on each activity category was calculated, and used to calculate overall daily metabolic equivalents (METs). Low socioeconomic (SES) group 24 h activity levels were significantly higher than for high SES or welfare groups (p = 0.013). Activity declined throughout pregnancy in all groups (p = 0.002). Women with children had higher 24 h activity, spending 41% more time walking and (or) on housework than nulliparous women (p = 0.013). Reduced well-being was associated with lower levels of activity. Sleep and lying down time influenced 2 month post-partum body mass (upper quartile gained 2.54 kg, lower quartile lost 0.24 kg, p ≤ 0.001). Mean infant gestational age increased with increasing 24 h activity (p = 0.047). No infants were born prematurely to mothers who spent more than 190 min/d walking or doing housework activities in month 4. Probability of infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) declined with time spent walking or doing housework in month 4 (p = 0.007). Mean (SE) birth weight was 3883 (±165) g in the 10% of women spending less than 530 min sleeping or lying down per day, compared with 3413 (±104) g in the 10% of women spending 725 min or more sleeping or lying down. Socioeconomic factors were therefore important influences on activity levels during pregnancy. Inactivity, especially in early pregnancy, was associated with more maternal weight retention at 2 months post-partum and a greater probability of admission to NICU and premature delivery. © 2007 NRC.

AB  - Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) are synthetic molecules that promote secretion of growth hormone by activation of the GHS receptor (GHSR). Ghrelin is the endogenous ligand of this receptor, which was isolated from gastric mucosa. This peptide is widely expressed in different tissues and has a broad spectrum of effects. This review summarises: i) structure and pharmacokinetics of the more important GHS; ii) structure, distribution and subcellular pathways of ghrelin; iii) structure, distribution and signal transduction of the GHS receptors; and iv) effects of GHS in different tissues and organs and the potential therapeutic role of ghrelin and GHS. There are increasing evidences that GHS and ghrelin have a wide range of actions both in physiological and pathological conditions. Potential therapeutic applications of these GHS are constantly increasing and clinical trials are needed to establish usefulness of these compounds. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Fertility in Australia has risen since 2001. Some have attributed this to the universal Maternity Payment introduced with the 2004 budget, or to Treasurer Peter Costello's call to parents to have three children, also made in 2004. But these interventions occurred after fertility had begun to rise. Moreover, qualitative interviews with 15 mothers in regional New South Wales show that they had had little effect on these women. Factors that did affect them included anxiety about beating the biological clock, the desire to have the number of children that their own childhood had taught them to prefer and constraints such as lack of social support and fears about their inability to pay for the education of their children.

AB  - Background. Snoring is common in pregnancy, but there are only a few studies that have investigated the relationship of snoring and pregnancy complications. We aimed to investigate the relationship of snoring and witnessed sleep apnoeas with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Methods. A questionnaire was administered on the day of delivery to 456 women at the Department of Obstetrics, Hospital Donación F. Santojanni, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pregnancy complications and blood pressure measurements were recorded from each woman's medical chart. Results. Some 156 (35%) of 447 women with singleton pregnancies who answered the questionnaire, snored at some time during their pregnancy. Snoring was related to pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia combined, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.16-2.84; p <0.01), independent of body mass index before pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy, neck circumference, smoking, alcohol and age. Witnessed sleep apnoeas were also related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease, with an adjusted odds ratio of 8.00 (95% CI: 2.71-23.55; p <0.001). Daytime sleepiness was more prevalent in snoring women. Conclusions. Snoring and witnessed sleep apnoeas are independently related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background. Prenatal exposure to cocaine can be deleterious to embryonic brain development, but the results in humans remain controversial, the mechanisms involved are not well understood and effective therapies are yet to be designed. We hypothesize that some of the prenatal effects of cocaine might be related to dysregulation of physiological rhythms due to alterations in the integrating circadian clock function. Methodology and Principle Findings. Here we introduce a new high-throughput genetically well-characterized diurnal vertebrate model for studying the mechanisms of prenatal cocaine effects by demonstrating reduced viability and alterations in the pattern of neuronal development following repeated cocaine exposure in zebrafish embryos. This effect is associated with acute cocaine-induced changes in the expression of genes affecting growth (growth hormone, zGH) and neurotransmission (dopamine transporter, zDAT). Analysis of circadian gene expression, using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR), demonstrates that cocaine acutely and dose-dependently changes the expression of the circadian genes (zPer-3, zBmal-1) and genes encoding melatonin receptors (zMelR) that mediate the circadian message to the entire organism. Moreover, the effects of prenatal cocaine depend on the time of treatment, being more robust during the day, independent of whether the embryos are raised under the light-dark cycle or in constant light. The latter suggests involvement of the inherited circadian factors. The principal circadian hormone, melatonin, counteracts the effects of cocaine on neuronal development and gene expression, acting via specific melatonin receptors. Conclusions/Significance. These findings demonstrate that, in a diurnal vertebrate, prenatal cocaine can acutely dysregulate the expression of circadian genes and those affecting melatonin signaling, growth and neurotransmission, while repeated cocaine exposure can alter neuronal development. Daily variation in these effects of cocaine and their attenuation by melatonin suggest a potential prophylactic or therapeutic role for circadian factors in prenatal cocaine exposure. © 2007.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the association between the regularity of sleep patterns for first-time Japanese mothers in the early postpartum period and the sleep and wake activity of their infants and partners. Longitudinal time-series studies of 101 healthy Japanese childbearing couples were conducted between May 2002 and January 2003. Data were obtained from couples at 32-6weeks pregnancy and 4-5weeks after birth. The questionnaire packet for each father and mother included a demographic questionnaire, a sleep-wake log for 7 days, a social rhythm metric for 7 days and a morningness-eveningness questionnaire. A four-stage hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed in which the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength was the dependent variable. The variance in postpartum sleep-wake rhythm strength for first-time mothers was explained by three predictor variables. Household income, the mother's chronotype during pregnancy and the father's daily social rhythm at 4-5weeks after birth made unique contributions to the variance (24.7%) in the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5weeks postpartum. A mother's own tendency to be a morning or evening chronotype and the regularity of the father's daily schedule of activities appear to influence first-time mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength during early postpartum recovery more than disruptions from the infant's sleep-wake activity itself. Health-care providers should counsel couples on how factors associated with the parents themselves may impact on the regularity of a mother's sleep patterns. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

AB  - Delta-brush is the dominant pattern of rapid oscillatory activity (8-25 Hz) in the human cortex during the third trimester of gestation. Here, we studied the relationship between delta-brushes in the somatosensory cortex and spontaneous movements of premature human neonates of 29-31 weeks postconceptional age using a combination of scalp electroencephalography and monitoring of motor activity. We found that sporadic hand and foot movements heralded the appearance of delta-brushes in the corresponding areas of the cortex (lateral and medial regions of the contralateral central cortex, respectively). Direct hand and foot stimulation also reliably evoked delta-brushes in the same areas. These results suggest that sensory feedback from spontaneous fetal movements triggers delta-brush oscillations in the central cortex in a somatotopic manner. We propose that in the human fetus in utero, before the brain starts to receive elaborated sensory input from the external world, spontaneous fetal movements provide sensory stimulation and drive delta-brush oscillations in the developing somatosensory cortex contributing to the formation of cortical body maps.

AB  - Dysfunction in menstrual physiology has pronounced effects on quality of life, involving mood changes, body image, infertility, and pregnancy complications. Light exposure may affect menstrual cycles and symptoms through the influence of melatonin secretion. The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the current state of knowledge about the effects of light and melatonin secretion on menstrual phase and cycle alterations. A brief overview of the influence of melatonin on human physiology is included. There is evidence of a relationship between light exposure and melatonin secretion and irregular menstrual cycles, menstrual cycle symptoms, and disordered ovarian function. In women with a psychopathology such as bipolar disorder or an endocrinopathy such as polycystic ovary syndrome, there seems to be greater vulnerability to the influence of lightdark exposure. Research on the complex role of lightdark exposure in menstrual physiology has implications for treatment of menstrual-associated disorders. © 2007 Sage Publication.

AB  - The timing of puberty is a critical life history trait of short-lived species; spring-born individuals mature rapidly and breed in the season of birth, whereas young born in midto late summer delay puberty until the next spring. The cues that govern the transition from rapid to delayed maturation in natural populations remain unknown. To identify ecologically relevant photoperiod cues that control timing of puberty, we monitored nine cohorts of female Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) born every 2 wk from 4 wk before to 12 wk after the summer solstice in a simulated natural photoperiod (SNP). Hamsters born by the summer solstice underwent rapid somatic growth and achieved puberty that summer; among females born 2-4 wk after the solstice, some delayed puberty by many weeks, whereas others manifested early puberty. Hamsters born 6 or more weeks after the solstice generally delayed puberty until the following spring. The transition from accelerated to delayed pubertal development in the SNP occurred at day lengths that induce early puberty when presented as static photoperiods. Despite differences in timing of birth and timing of puberty, fall and subsequent spring seasonal events occurred at similar calendar dates in all cohorts. We found no evidence that prenatal photoperiod history influenced postnatal development of female hamsters. Considered together with a parallel study on males, the present findings point to sex differences in responsiveness to natural photoperiod variations. In both sexes, incrementally changing photoperiods exert a strong organizing effect on seasonal rhythms. Copyright © 2007 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: We have previously reported higher and more variable salivary morning cortisol in 13-year-old adolescents whose mothers were depressed in the postnatal period, compared with control group adolescents whose mothers did not develop postnatal depression (PND). This observation suggested a biological mechanism by which intrafamilial risk for depressive disorder may be transmitted. In the current article, we examined whether the cortisol disturbances observed at 13 years could predict depressive symptomatology in adolescents at 16 years of age. Methods: We measured self-reported depressive symptoms in 16-year-old adolescents who had (n = 48) or had not (n = 39) been exposed to postnatal maternal depression and examined their prediction by morning and evening cortisol indices obtained via 10 days of salivary collections at 13 years. Results: Elevated morning cortisol secretion at 13 years, and particularly the maximum level recorded over 10 days of collection, predicted elevated depressive symptoms at 16 years over and above 13-year depressive symptom levels and other possible confounding factors. Morning cortisol secretion mediated an association between maternal PND and symptomatology in 16-year-old offspring. Conclusions: Alterations in steroid secretion observed in association with maternal PND may provide a mechanism by which risk for depression is transmitted from mother to offspring. © 2007 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Photoperiodism research has relied on static day lengths and abrupt transitions between long and short days to characterize the signals that drive seasonal rhythms. To identify ecologically relevant critical day lengths and to test the extent to which naturally changing day lengths synchronize important developmental events, we monitored nine cohorts of male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) born every 2 wk from 4 wk before to 12 wk after the summer solstice in a simulated natural photoperiod (SNP). SNP hamsters born from 4 wk before to 2 wk after the solstice underwent rapid somatic and gonadal growth; among those born 4-6 wk after the solstice, some delayed puberty by many weeks, whereas others manifested early puberty. Hamsters born eight or more weeks after the solstice failed to undergo early testicular development. The transition to delayed development occurred at long day lengths, which induce early puberty when presented as static photoperiods. The first animals to delay puberty may do so predominantly on the basis of postnatal decreases in day length, whereas in later cohorts, a comparison of postnatal day length to gestational day length may contribute to arrested development. Despite differences in timing of birth and timing of puberty, autumn gonadal regression and spring gonadal and somatic growth occurred at similar calendar dates in all cohorts. Incrementally changing photoperiods exert a strong organizing effect on seasonal rhythms by providing hamsters with a richer source of environmental timing cues than are available in simple static day lengths.

AB  - Background: Experimental animal data link prenatal stress with sleep disturbance in offspring, but the link in humans is unclear. Aims: To investigate the link between prenatal maternal anxiety and depression and infant sleep disturbance from 6 to 30 months of age. Study design: Longitudinal prospective study of a large birth cohort from pregnancy to 30 months. Questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression were completed by mothers at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks and 8 months postpartum. Subjects: The ALSPAC cohort, a prospective community study of women in the UK who have been followed since pregnancy. Outcome measures: Measures of total sleep time, number of awakenings, and broadly defined sleep problems were available on children at ages 6, 18, and 30 months. Results: Reliable measures of total sleep time, nighttime awakenings, and sleep problems were identified at 6, 18, and 30 months. Higher levels of prenatal maternal anxiety and depression predicted more sleep problems at 18 and 30 months, after controlling for postnatal mood and obstetric and psychosocial covariates; the association was not restricted to clinical extremes. No link with total sleep time was observed. Conclusions: Mood disturbance in pregnancy has persisting effects on sleep problems in the child, a finding that is consistent with experimental animal research. The findings add to a growing literature showing that maternal prenatal stress, anxiety, and depression may have lasting effects on child development. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective.: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Method.: Five hundred institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Results.: Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank. Conclusion.: Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The presence of underlying respiratory disease in the pregnant woman may implicate complications for the mother and the foetus which are potentially fatal. Pregnancy may also alter the course of the disease, making it fundamental to recognise and prevent its progression. It is important to know the respiratory physiology during pregnancy, in order to better preview the behaviour of these illnesses. In this article, a review of the current literature was performed on some the respiratory diseases that affect the pregnant woman, but are not specifically caused by it. Among these, asthma is one of the most important, given its frequency and the possibility to obtain good control and prevent complications. The frequent undermedication of these patients is one of the main causes of exacerbation and complications; it is therefore necessary to know the safety profile and current indications for the medications used in its treatment. Thromboembolic disease is another very frequent cause of morbidity and mortality, and its diagnosis implicates a major challenge, needing a very high suspicion. Diagnostic exams, namely radiological, are not to be postponed, and the radiation dose used is safe for the foetus. Other less frequent problems are also reviewed, which also have a great impact on the pregnancy: pneumothorax, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and sleep disturbances. Finally, pregnancy in the transplant recipient is also reviewed. In conclusion, the multidisciplinary approach of these patients must be emphasized. The accurate diagnosis and control of the underlying respiratory disease may avoid most of the complications affecting mother and foetus.

AB  - In the present study, we administered two low protein diets (LPDs) to rats during pregnancy and lactation and determined their effect on the ontogeny of select hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in their offspring. The L93 and LM76 LPDs were derived from the American Society of Nutrition recommended AIN93G and a modified version of the AIN76A purified control diets, respectively. The LPDs contained 8% crude protein in the form of casein, whereas the purified control diets contained 19% casein. A regular cereal-based diet (NP) was also included, and, therefore, a total of five groups were tested. Pups in all five groups were weaned onto a regular NP diet on postnatal day 28. Perinatal LPD altered the activities of a number of P450 isoforms in 28-day-old male and female offspring. However, nutritional rehabilitation abolished most of these changes as evidenced by lack of differences between the five groups in the activities of P450 isoforms in either 65- or 150-day-old offspring. Interestingly, 58-day-old female offspring in the LM76 group but not those in the L93 group exhibited shorter hexobarbital sleep time than the purified control group. However, hexobarbital hydroxylase activity and the amount of CYP2C12 protein, an important P450 isoform involved in hexobarbital metabolism in females, were unchanged. This suggests that the decrease in hexobarbital sleep time in this group is not due to an increase in the activity of hexobarbital-metabolizing enzymes. In summary, perinatal LPDs produced transient alterations in activities of select hepatic P450s and resulted in a gender- and diet-dependent long-term alteration in hexobarbital pharmacodynamics.

AB  - The safety of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine as used in general practice in England was examined by prescription-event monitoring (PEM). Patients were identified from dispensed National Health Service (NHS) prescriptions issued by general practitioners (GPs) for quetiapine between October 1997 and July 1999. The outcome data were event reports obtained by sending questionnaires ('green forms') to the prescribing doctor at least 6 months after the first prescription for an individual patient. Green forms with clinically useful information on 1728 patients (median age 39 years (IQR 30-56); 53% female) were received. The most frequently reported event during the first month of treatment was 'drowsiness/sedation' (47; 3% cohort). This was also the most frequently reported specified adverse drug reaction (ADR) to quetiapine (7; 11% of 65 reported ADRs) and the highest reported clinical reason for stopping quetiapine (51; 6% of the 734 reported reasons for stopping). There was a low incidence of extrapyramidal disease (21 during treatment, 1% of cohort) and hyperprolactinaemia (three during treatment, 0.2%) in this study. Three cases of diabetes mellitus in this cohort were reported to be a new diagnosis. Six pregnancies were reported during treatment with quetiapine, five of which were exposed during the first trimester only. There were four live births with no reported congenital abnormalities. Fifty-six deaths were reported during this study (3% cohort). The most frequently reported causes of death related to the cardiovascular (18) and respiratory (15) systems. The results of this post-marketing surveillance study demonstrated that quetiapine is generally well-tolerated when used in general practice. © 2007 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

AB  - Background: Mass, free distribution (Catch-up) of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) during measles vaccination campaigns achieves immediate, high and equitable coverage for both ITNs and measles vaccine. Maintaining high coverage over time requires long-term, routine access to new nets (Keep-up). In many settings, only one approach - either campaign or routine delivery - has been available and have been seen as competing methods. Relying only on campaigns achieves high coverage at the cost of lack of later access. Relying solely on routine coverage builds a delivery infrastructure but may lead to slower rates of coverage and inequities. A combined Catch-up/Keep-up approach has been a common feature of vaccination programs for many years. We assessed the 3-year effects of a one-time Catch-up campaign followed by clinic-based social marketing for routine Keep-up on ITN coverage and use. Methods: In December 2002, ITNs were distributed to all children attending a measles vaccination campaign in a rural district of Ghana. In the 3 years following that campaign, the district began offering ITNs at a subsidized price to pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics. This Keep-up scheme did not become fully operational until 2 years after the campaign. A coverage survey was conducted 38-month post-campaign using a standard two-stage cluster sampling method. Results: Coverage of nets was high due to the combined contributions of both Catch-up and Keep-up. There were 475 households in the survey with at least one child less than 5 years of age. Among these households, coverage was 95.6% with any net, 83.8% with a campaign net, and 73.9% with an ITN. Of all children, 95.7% slept in a household that had a net, 86.1% slept in a household that had a campaign net. Not all available nets were used as only 59.6% of children slept under an ITN. The source of the nets was 77.7% from the campaign and 20% from routine clinics. Compared to households that participated in the campaign, households with children born after the campaign had higher rates of net ownership (75.1% vs. 67.7%, P = 0.04). Equity was high as the ratio of coverage in the lowest wealth quintile to that in the highest was 0.95 for ITN ownership and 1.08 for ITN use. These coverage and use rates were similar to those previously reported 5-month post-campaign, suggesting no decrease over 3 years. Conclusion: A high level of ITN coverage and use was achieved and sustained by sequential community-based mass campaign Catch-up and clinic-based Keep-up distribution. The campaign nets covered virtually all extant households while clinic-based distribution provided nets for the new sleeping spaces created post-campaign. Because nets can be shared, and most children are born into families that already have a net, the number of new nets needed to sustain high coverage is substantially lower than the number of newborn children. A Catch-up/Keep-up strategy combining mass campaigns for children and clinic-based distribution to pregnant women is an efficient strategy for achieving and sustaining high net coverage. Assuring proper use of nets is a remaining challenge. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Maternal deprivation (MD) is a neonatal stressor that leads to behavioral and molecular manifestations of chronic stress in adulthood. Recent evidence has suggested that stress may impact wake regulation through corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and the orexinergic system. We studied the wake/sleep features and brain levels of orexin and orexin receptors in adult rats neonatally subjected to either ten days of MD or a control procedure from postnatal day 4. At 3 months of age, one set of rats from both groups underwent 48 h of polysomnographic recording. All rats (including those that did not undergo surgery) were subsequently sacrificed for ELISA, radioimmunoassay and western blot measurement of orexins, orexin receptors and CRH in multiple brain regions. Neonatal MD induced an increase of total wake time (decreased total sleep) during the light period, which corresponds to human night time. This increase was specifically composed of quiet wake, while a small but significant decrease of active wake was observed during the dark period. At the molecular level, MD led to increased hypothalamic CRH and orexin A, and frontal cortical orexin 1 receptors (OX1R). However, hippocampal orexin B was reduced in the MD group. Our study discovered for the first time that the adult MD rat has sleep and neurobiological features of hyperarousal, which is typical in human insomnia. We concluded that neonatal MD produces adult hyperarousal in sleep physiology and neurobiology, and that the adult MD rat could be a model of insomnia with an orexinergic mechanism. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In newborns, hypoxia elicits defensive behaviors including awakening from sleep, body movements and crying. An inability to produce this defense response is a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome and other respiratory control disorders. In this study, we examined the possibility that the defense response to hypoxia in newborns is partly determined by early exposure to hypoxia. We explored this possibility in 6-day-old mice, which resemble human preterm infants of approximately 25-30 weeks' gestational age. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were recorded as a marker for the defense response to hypoxia. In a conditioning experiment, newborn mice were exposed to two artificial odors (conditioned stimuli, CS). For acquisition (two trials), pups were exposed to one odor (CS+) in a hypoxic gas mixture (10% O2, which was the unconditioned stimulus, US) and to another odor (CS-) in air. Then, the pups were exposed to each odor while breathing air. Newborn mice produced significantly more USVs when exposed to the odor previously paired with hypoxia than to the control odor. Thus, associative learning may shape the defense response to hypoxia in newborns. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is the hypothalamic peptide that controls the function of the pituitary-adrenal axis in response to stress. CRH is also expressed abundantly in the human placenta and is present in high concentrations in maternal and fetal plasma during late pregnancy. During pregnancy, CRH derived from the placenta is thought to play a crucial role in the regulation of fetal maturation and the timing of delivery, and CRH has also been implicated in the control of fetal-placental blood flow. Elevated CRH concentrations, as compared with gestational age matched controls, occur in patients in preterm labour. The exponential curve depicting the CRH increase is shifted to the left in women who will subsequently deliver preterm and to the right in women who will deliver post dates. This has led to the suggestion that CRH production is linked to a placental clock which determines the length of gestation. Clinically, maternal plasma CRH concentrations may be useful in identifying women at high risk of preterm delivery and CRH antagonists may be useful in preventing preterm labour. As significant CRH production by the placenta is restricted to primates, future research must take into account the species specificity of the mechanisms regulating parturition. A number of significant gaps remain in our knowledge of the function of this peptide in pregnancy. This review examines the current evidence regarding the role of CRH in human parturition.

AB  - The circadian clock, regulating hormonal secretion and metabolisms in accordance with the environmental light-dark cycle, resides in almost all peripheral tissues as well as in the superchiasmatic nucleus. Clock gene expression has been found to be noncyclic during spermatogenesis and the differentiation of thymocytes. However, currently little is known about how cell differentiation could affect circadian clockwork. We performed this study using the in vitro real-time oscillation monitoring system to examine the clockwork in several types of diferentiating cells originated from reproductive tissues of transgenic rats (constructed with Period gene 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase reporter gene). After treatment with dexamethasone (DXM), persistent oscillation of Per2 expression was observed in both gonadotropin-induced and pregnant ovarian luteal cells, proliferative uterine stromal cells (USCs), and nondifferentiating testicular interstitial cells, with a cyclic period of ∼24 h. In contrast to these cell types, only one cycle of oscillation was sustained in granulosa cells undergoing differentiation. Additionally, Per2 oscillation was irregular in USCs undergoing decidualization induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate plus N6, 2-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate. Furthermore, no oscillation of Per2 expression was evoked by DXM in Leydig cells and thymocytes. In conclusion, the present study characterized the oscillation of Per2 gene expression in several types of ovarian, uterine, and testicular cells, and it is strongly suggested that circadian clockwork is affected during cellular differentiation. © 2007 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It has been shown that biological rhythms influence the pharmacology and effects of anaesthetic agents such as local anaesthetics, hypnotics and muscle relaxants. This review discusses the latest findings and their consequences for anaesthesiological practice. RECENTS FINDINGS: Opioids and new local anaesthetics exhibit circadian changes when they are injected into spinal or epidural spaces for labour pain analgesia. Other studies have demonstrated that propofol and ketamine have maximal duration of action when they are injected during a period of rest in animals (at night in humans). It has been also shown that propofol can perturb the central circadian pacemaker and so cause a phase-shifted advance in effect on activity in rats. SUMMARY: Although studies are lacking for most newer anaesthetic agents used in humans, recent findings emphasize once again that chronobiology should be considered in studies of anaesthetic drugs. Circadian rhythms should be considered in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses so that proper research protocols can be designed. The implications of chronobiology for the practice of clinical anaesthesia are probably of lesser importance because of the use of patient-controlled devices for pain management, monitoring of muscle paralysis and depth of anaesthesia monitors. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Objective - The scope of this study is to detect whether or not the entropy (E) circadian rhythm (CR) is maintained preserved in sinusal R-R intervals (SRRI), its loss being the expression of a transition to an indeterministic chaos in heart rate variability (HRV). Methods - The E of SRRI was estimated in 14 type I diabetic pregnant women (DPW) in the first trimester of an apparently uncomplicated gestation (7 patients - mean age = 30.3 ± 4.1 y - without clinical and laboratory evidence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy, and 7 patients - mean age = 30.7 ± 3.6 y - with positive tests for a cardiac dysautonomia). The E CR was studied via the single cosinor method, and summarized via the population-mean cosinor method. Results - The E CR was found not to be preserved in both the investigated type I DPW, despite the occurrence of the SRRI CR. Conclusions - The loss of the E CR confirms that in type I DPW there is a transition to an indeterministic disorder in HRV due to the lack of an autocorrelated periodic chaos in cardiac pacing. Such an unphysiological neurovegetative regulation suggests a new silent cardiac dysautonomic syndrome, that we intend to call "minimum delirium cordis syndrome" (MDCS). Can the MDCS be regarded as a condition of cardiovascular risk? To answer this question, it seems justified to suggest that the study of the E CR should be added to the routine tests that are presently applied to clinical analysis of the Hotter ECG, being the classic tests of linear analysis not methodologically suitable for detecting the indeterministic chaos of the MDCS.

AB  - Objective: Routinely antepartal cardiotocogram (CTG) is recorded for 30 min in order to obtain normal resting phases (<30 min) or a decrease of irregulatory due to hypoxia (>30 min) or to differentiate these from each other. In case of early onset of hypoxia first pathological findings might only be seen by chance in incidentally recorded CTG. The goal of this study was, if a continuous 24-h CTG allows an earlier detection of beginning hypoxia in case of normal pregnancies of 36-42 weeks compared to pregnancies of 25-30 weeks of gestation, and if there are any differences between both groups concerning the qualitative and quantitative description or the detection of a circadian rhythm. Methods: 21 patients in each group had 24-h CTGs by means of telemetry (Hewlett-Packard type 78101A, 80110A). In both study groups, fetal heart-rate tracing included a full qualitative and quantitative description. Comparison of the results of both groups was done to look for early signs of pathological findings concerning reduced fetal well-being and a potential day and night rhythm. Results: In comparison to 36-42 weeks of pregnancies 25-30 weeks had significantly more physiological undulatory oscillation and less narrowed undulatory oscillation (P < 0.001), as well as less resting phases (P < 0.001). Baseline tachycardia and bradycardia showed significantly increasing quantity (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Twenty-four-hour CTG is a good screening method to detect early onset of hypoxia in case of second and third trimester pregnancies and a big help to detect a fetus at risk earlier. In future computerized CTG-systems should be proved in this connection and should be compared with our study. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Metastin, a 54-residue peptide, was identified as the cognate ligand of human G-protein-coupled receptor GPR54. Since metastin is a gene product of the human metastasis suppressor gene 'KiSS-1', early studies on metastin were focused on its activity as a tumor metastasis suppressor. Recently, there have been some reports that metastin is found in human plasma and is particularly abundant in the plasma of pregnant women. Dysfunction of the GPR54 receptor causes diseases that are characterized by an insufficient release of gonadotropin and lack or delay of pubertal maturation. This information strongly suggests that metastin is involved in the regulation of reproductive endocrine functions. In order to determine the plasma levels of metastin and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) in an isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) patient, who received intermittent administrations of LHRH, we tried to establish a sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassay. The plasma LHRH levels of the patient were very high, while plasma metastin levels were at almost the same levels as circadian rhythms of healthy male humans. In the central nervous system, metastin stimulates the neuroendocrine reproductive axis. However, the effects of peripheral metastin are not known. Our result suggested that peripheral metastin had a genesis and activity different from central metastin. Copyright © 2007 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common movement disorder characterized by a circadian variation in symptoms involving an urge to move the limbs, usually the legs. Pregnant women, patients with end-stage renal disease or iron-deficiency anemia, and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) have a significantly higher prevalence of RLS. The classic presentation includes the onset or worsening of symptoms when at rest and the circadian pattern of exacerbation of symptoms at night. These symptoms reflect a circadian fluctuation of dopamine in the substantia nigra. Patients with RLS have lower levels of dopamine in the substantia nigra and respond to iron administration. Iron, as a cofactor in dopamine production, plays a central role in the etiology of RLS. Folic acid administration has also been shown to alleviate the symptoms of RLS and may play a role in the treatment of primary (familial) RLS.

Prenatal stress potentiated the inhibitory processes in young animals. In aging female rats, the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system to feedback signals significantly decreased and circadian stress reactivity was disturbed. These data suggest that maternal stress modifies the age-related pattern of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical regulation in female progeny. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.

AB  - Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit seasonal cycles of reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from the pineal gland. Short-duration Mel signals stimulate reproduction and long-duration signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel signals are decoded at the level of neural target tissues remains uncharacterized. In Siberian hamsters, exposure to short day lengths or injections of Mel in long days results in a decrease in hypothalamic expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA. Dio2 catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus exposure to short and long day lengths should decrease and increase hypothalamic T3 concentrations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T3 administered to short-day hamsters would mimic exposure to long day lengths with respect to gonadal stimulation. Hamsters gestated and raised in short day lengths that exhibited photoinhibition of the testes were given daily subutaneous injections of T3 or saline vehicle for 4 wk beginning at week 12 of life. The results indicate that exogenous T3 induced gonadal growth in short-day hamsters and delayed spontaneous gonadal development by an interval equal to the number of weeks during which T3 was administered. T 3 injections delayed gonadal regression if given coincident with the transfer of hamsters from long to short day lengths. These results suggest that T3 mimics long day exposure in Siberian hamsters and may serve as an intermediate step between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive response.

AB  - Retinoic acid (RA) is a signaling molecule synthesized from vitamin A that controls gene expression at the transcriptional level by functioning as a ligand for nuclear RA receptors. RA plays an essential role during embryonic development in higher animals by regulating key genes involved in pattern formation. RA is required for induction of several Hox genes involved in patterning of the hindbrain and spinal cord as neuroectoderm emerges from the primitive streak. Recent findings indicate that RA is also required to ensure bilaterally symmetrical generation of left and right somites as presomitic mesoderm emerges from the primitive streak. RA may control somitogenesis through its ability to repress posterior ectodermal expression of fibroblast growth factor-8 (Fgf8) for a short period of time during the late primitive streak stage when the somitogenesis clock initiates. During this tight temporal window, RA is required to limit Fgf8 expression to the most posterior ectoderm (epiblast), thus preventing ectopic Fgf8 expression in more anterior ectoderm including the node ectoderm and neuroectoderm. Although Fgf8 is required for the node to impart left-right asymmetry on specific tissues (heart, visceral organs, etc.), excess Fgf8 signaling following a loss of RA may stimulate the node to generate asymmetry also in presomitic mesoderm, leading to left-right asymmetry in the somitogenesis clock. These findings suggest that human vertebral birth defects such as scoliosis, an abnormal left-right bending of the vertebral column, may be caused by a defect in RA signaling during somitogenesis. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Pregnancy-associated sleep disorders are frequent, multiple and rather neglected. In this series, sleep disorders were evaluated, retrospectively, according to 106 questionnaires given during the post-partum period. Insomnia, restless leg syndrome, snoring, and need for more sleep, were the most frequent sleep disorders during pregnancy. They became more frequent and disturbing as pregnancy evolved. Mood alterations, lack of productivity, troubles of concentration and of memory, were present but not only due to sleep disorders. No consequence of sleep disorders occurred on labour duration or on the mode of birth. Few patients (n=25) complained about these troubles. A treatment was prescribed to 16 of them. It was efficient in ten cases. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: Approximately two-thirds of term vertex fetuses are in the left occiput position in utero. However, little is understood about the physiology of maternal-fetal positioning during pregnancy. It was hypothesized that fetal left occiput positioning is affected by maternal positioning. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between maternal positioning in late pregnancy and fetal positioning in utero. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Ueda Hospital, Kobe, Japan. Eligible women were limited to low-risk pregnancies ending in spontaneous vaginal delivery with singleton vertex fetuses. Information obtained from the mother included the preference of positioning during sleep in the second half of pregnancy. Fetal information recorded after delivery included fetal positioning. Results: Eighty-one (50.6%) of 160 evaluated women preferred left lateral positioning while 70 (43.8%) women preferred right lateral positioning in the second half of pregnancy. Seventy-seven (51.7%) of 149 evaluated fetuses were in the left occiput position while 72 (48.3%) fetuses were in the right occiput position in utero. Maternal left lateral positioning with fetal left occiput position in utero was the predominant positioning (41 of 149, 27.5%). However, there was no statistical relationship between maternal positioning and fetal occiput positioning in utero. Conclusion: More women prefer the left lateral position during the second half of pregnancy. More fetuses are in the left occiput in utero during the late stage of pregnancy. However, no statistical relationship was observed between maternal and fetal positioning. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) consists of four obligatory features: (1) an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; (2) the urge to move, or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting; (3) the urge to move, or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and (4) the urge to move, or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. The cause of idiopathic and familial RLS is unknown, although the most important pathophysiologic clues come from autopsy material showing that iron is decreased in the substantia nigra of patients with RLS. There is also some evidence that underactivity of the endogenous dopaminergic and the endogenous opioid system with its enkephalins and endorphins may be pathogenetic as well. Secondary forms of RLS may be associated with peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathy, low ferritin levels, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis. Pregnancy can be an exacerbating factor for RLS. Dopaminergic agonists are the first line of treatment, but opioids, gabapentin (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines are effective as well. Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are present in many but not all adult patients with RLS (80%), and PLMS also occurs with high prevalence in normal older adults even if RLS is not present. PLMS is therefore neither a sensitive nor specific-enough index of RLS to be diagnostic of RLS. PLMS without RLS rarely results in symptomatic sleep disruption, but in cases where symptomatic sleep disruption in the absence of RLS can definitely be attributed to the PLMS, the diagnosis of periodic limb movement disorder is made. However, it is not uncommon for a patient's PLMS to disrupt the sleep of the bed partner. © 2007 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-7% of reproductive-aged women. Although the diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been debated, it is frequently characterized by hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss), oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The reproductive and metabolic complications associated with the syndrome can be serious, so a comprehensive approach to the evaluation and treatment of affected women is important. Menstrual cycle control is necessary to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, and this can be accomplished with hormonal contraception, progesterone therapy, and weight loss (if overweight). In women desiring pregnancy, commonly used ovulation induction therapies include weight loss, clomiphene citrate, and/or metformin. Cosmetic issues such as hirsutism, acne and male-pattern hair loss can be challenging to cope with. Treatment options include estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptive agents, antiandrogens, and topical agents. More permanent hair reduction can be achieved with electrolysis and laser therapy. Evaluation of metabolic complications includes risk assessment for diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Women with PCOS should also be screened for sleep apnea, as this has been reported to occur more commonly in women with PCOS. Finally, mental health issues such as depression and eating disorders may be present. Many of the complications associated with PCOS can be managed with therapeutic lifestyle change, including a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss (if overweight), and psychological support. Pharmacological therapies are also available to effectively regulate menstrual cycles and manage cosmetic complications. This article will review the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in PCOS.

AB  - Night sweats has been defined as drenching sweats that require the patient to change bedclothes. In current studies night sweats appear in 30% of non-obstetric patients and affects approximately 60% of pregnant women. Differential diagnoses include infections, malignancy, medications, hot flashes and panic attacks, making of each patient a challenge. We present two patients with night sweating. After excluding systemic diseases the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux was made, with excellent response to anti-reflux treatment. The presentation of our two patients coupled with a deep literature review, underscores the importance of gastroesophageal reflux as a cause of night sweating. Copyright © 2007 Aran Ediciones, s.l.

AB  - The present review, to the authors' knowledge, is the first to specifically address the relationships between microcirculation and metabolic syndrome, a cluster of metabolic and cardiovascular modifications highly prevalent in the general population. Its close link to overweight and insulin resistance makes it the main cause of the worldwide burden of type 2 diabetes. However, metabolic syndrome is also observed in many other diseases, particularly, but not exclusively, those where insulin resistance is a main feature. Analysis of the literature reveals that this clinical situation is invariably linked to microvascular disturbances, such as abnormalities in arteriolar reactivity, capillary recruitment, permeability, and hemorheology. A particularly interesting observation is that these defects in small vessel structure and function are seen very early in life or disease. Very importantly, they further suggest that microcirculatory abnormalities may be not only secondary but also causal to the development and/or aggravation of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Mechanisms responsible for these modifications remain largely unknown, but insulin's vascular effects in the microvascular network, detailed in this review, are at least one example of such connections. The existing data point to a clear, at least bidirectional, relationship between microcirculation and metabolic syndrome. Additional studies should determine the level of reciprocal causality.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the costs associated with obesity in France. Methods: We used data from the 2002 survey on health and social protection as well as health care consumption data from the EPAS sample of the national health insurance funds. After excluding those younger than 18 years, pregnant women and people diagnosed with cancer, we classified subjects as underweight, normal weight, or obese and then studied two subpopulations: (P1) obese patients (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2) and (P2) patients who were obese or overweight (BMI ≥ 27kg/m2) and had additional cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction (present or history), transient ischemic attack, intermittent claudication or sleep apnea. The Heckman approach was used to adjust for several factors. Results: The study included 4651 individuals, with a mean age was 47 years. The obesity prevalence rate was estimated at 10.7% for P1; the P2 prevalence was 16.0%. Average healthcare costs for the entire study group were 1534€, 1105€ for ambulatory care (72%) and 429€ (28%) for inpatient care. Costs for obese subjects (P1 and P2) averaged 2500€, twice the costs for normal-weight people (1263€). After taking into account age, sex, socioeconomic status, alcohol consumption and smoking, the 100% reimbursement rate for chronic diseases (all else being equal), the extra cost of obesity, compared with normal weight, was estimated between 506€ (P1) and 648€ (P2). Conclusion: The annual total cost of obesity was estimated to range from 2.1 to 6.2 billion euros in 2002 and account for 1.5 to 4.6% of total health expenditures in France. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Background: Duloxetine and escitalopram were compared in an 8-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results regarding the primary objective of the study (onset of antidepressant action) have been previously published. The current paper focuses on the longer-term (8-month) comparisons of efficacy and safety between duloxetine and escitalopram. Research design and methods: Upon completion of the 8-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, acute-treatment phase (duloxetine 60 mg/day (n = 273), escitalopram 10 mg/day (n = 274), placebo (n = 137)), patients remaining in the duloxetine (n = 188) and escitalopram (n = 208) groups were eligible for double-blind dose increases (duloxetine to 120 mg/day, escitalopram to 20 mg/day), and placebo non-responders were eligible for double-blind rescue to active drug. Main outcome measures: Efficacy was primarily assessed using the HAMD17. Safety/tolerability assessments included spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), overall rates and reasons for discontinuation, laboratory analyses, and vital signs. Results: Both drugs demonstrated similar remission rates over the course of the study, with the probability of remission reaching 70% (duloxetine) and 75% (escitalopram) at 8 months (p = 0.44). Similar improvement was observed for both duloxetine and escitalopram on efficacy measures with the exception of the sleep subscale of the HAMD17, wherein escitalopram had a statistically significant advantage over duloxetine in improving sleep. Over the entire 8-month study, discontinuation rates differed significantly for duloxetine (62%) compared with escitalopram (55%; p = 0.02). Rates of discontinuation due to AEs did not differ significantly between duloxetine (12.8%), escitalopram (12.0%), and placebo (10.2%) (p &gt; 0.05 all pairwise comparisons). AEs associated with duloxetine tended to emerge early in treatment (e.g., nausea, dry mouth), whereas AEs associated with escitalopram tended to emerge later in treatment (e.g., diarrhea, weight increase). The incidence of sustained hypertension was similar between drugs (1.5 vs. 1.1% patients for duloxetine and escitalopram, respectively). Statistically significant drug differences were identified in the mean changes from baseline to study endpoint for pulse (+3.05 beats per minute (bpm), duloxetine; -0.89 bpm, escitalopram; p &lt; 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (+3.73 mmHg, duloxetine; +0.31 mmHg, escitalopram; p &lt; 0.05), but not diastolic blood pressure (+0.81 mmHg, duloxetine; -0.24 mmHg, escitalopram; p = 0.27). At 8 months, mean change in weight was significantly higher for escitalopram compared with duloxetine (+0.61 kg, duloxetine; +1.83 kg, escitalopram; p &lt; 0.05), however, the incidence of treatment-emergent abnormal weight gain (&gt;7% increase in weight from baseline) was similar between drugs and was significantly greater for both duloxetine and escitalopram compared with placebo. Limitations: Because so few patients on placebo (n = 15), in comparison to duloxetine (n = 104) or escitalopram (n = 123), completed the entire 8-month study, the power to detect a difference between the active treatments and placebo after 8 weeks was significantly decreased and very likely insufficient. Conclusion: Throughout the 8-month study, similar improvement was observed for both duloxetine and escitalopram on most efficacy measures with the exception of the sleep subscale of the HAMD17. Drug differences were identified in safety/tolerability measures. © 2007 Librapharm Limited.

AB  - Context: Many US clinicians and laboratory personnel are unfamiliar with the diagnosis and treatment of malaria. Objectives: To examine the evidence base for management of uncomplicated and severe malaria and to provide clinicians with practical recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in the United States. Evidence Acquisition: Systematic MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2006 using the search term malaria (with the subheadings congenital, diagnosis, drug therapy, epidemiology, and therapy). Additional references were obtained from searching the bibliographies of pertinent articles and by reviewing articles suggested by experts in the treatment of malaria in North America. Evidence Synthesis: Important measures to reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria in the United States include the following: obtaining a travel history, considering malaria in the differential diagnosis of fever based on the travel history, and prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Chloroquine remains the treatment of choice for Plasmodium falciparum acquired in areas without chloroquine-resistant strains. In areas with chloroquine resistance, a combination of atovaquone and proguanil or quinine plus tetracycline or doxycycline or clindamycin are the best treatment options. Chloroquine remains the treatment of choice for all other malaria species, with the exception of P vivax acquired in Indonesia or Papua New Guinea, in which case atovaquone-proguanil is best, with mefloquine or quinine plus tetracycline or doxycycline as alternatives. Quinidine is currently the recommended treatment for severe malaria in the United States because the artemisinins are not yet available. Severe malaria occurs when a patient with asexual malaria parasitemia, and no other confirmed cause of symptoms, has 1 or more designated clinical or laboratory findings. The only adjunctive measure recommended in severe malaria is exchange transfusion. Conclusions: Malaria remains a diagnostic and treatment challenge for US clinicians as increasing numbers of persons travel to and emigrate from malarious areas. A strong evidence base exists to help clinicians rapidly initiate appropriate therapy and minimize the major mortality and morbidity burdens caused by this disease. ©2007 American Medical Association.

AB  - Some 10% of the labour force work during night hours. According to an EU directive night workers should be offered preventive health examinations. It is well known that night work is related to sleep disorders but the epidemiologic evidence linking night work with increased occurrence of peptic ulcers, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease and spontaneous abortions is still limited and provides no strong rationale for preventive health examinations. This article argues that individual health examinations should be integrated into primary preventive activities at the workplace.

AB  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequently occurring neurological disease that is often associated with sleep disorders and reduced quality of life. The cause of RLS still has not been clearly established; however, the dopaminergic and opioid systems and iron metabolism appear to have major roles in the disease. The therapy of choice is treatment with dopaminergic drugs. In addition, opiates and anticonvulsants such as gabapentin are used. The most important side effect of dopaminergic therapy is augmentation. If therapy-related augmentation occurs while taking levodopa, the medication should be changed to dopamine agonists. If augmentation occurs while taking dopamine agonists, opiates or gabapentin should be taken instead.

AB  - Present research aim is to determine whether quantitative measurements of 8 and 12 h urine protein vs. 24 h sample are accurate in diagnosing preeclampsia and in differentiating mild from severe disease. The longitudinal-experimental method conducted on 60 preeclamptic women (30 patients with mild preeclampsia and 30 patients with severe preeclampsia). The 8, 12 and 24 h urine protein were compared and results were analyzed by the SPSS-10 statistical software. There was a significant relation between diagnosis of preeclampsia and the amounts of 8, 12 and 24 h urine protein (p = 0.000). The relation of systolic (p = 0.000) and diastolic (p = 0.001) blood pressure with severity of preeclampsia was significant. There was significant relation between gestational age and severity of disease (p 0.012) but the relation of gestational age with parity, gravidity, serum creatinine level, urine volume and urine creatinine level was not significant (p>0.05). Determining total protein of 8 and 12 h urine samples can be a good alternative for 24 h urine protein measurement. This would lead to a faster diagnosis for severe preeclampsia, earlier treatment and consequently reducing morbidity and mortality of mother and fetus/infant.

AB  - Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common severe neuromotor disability in childhood affecting 2-3.5/1000 live born neonates worldwide. Etiological factors are mostly related to perinatal non-progressive brain damage i.e. hypoxic-ischemic, haemorrhagic, vascular lesions, hyperbilirubinaemia and perinatal infection. Periventricular hypoxic-ischemic white matter lesions in prematures (PVL), are the most common cause of neurological impairments in childhood mostly presenting as cerebral palsy and visual disorder. Cognitive/behavioural problems and epilepsy are also common comorbidity. Incidence and severity of white matter lesions as well as cerebral palsy are related to gestatonal age. Gestational-age specific prevalence of CP varies from 77/1000 below 28 weeks, 40/1000 between 28 and 31 weeks, and 1.1/1000 in term neonates. Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE) is a multicentric project of CP registration comprising 8 countries by now. SCPE proposed simplified classification of the subtypes of CP according to neurological findings i.e. spastic CP (bilateral, unilateral spastic-hemiplegia), dyskinetic CP (dystonic, choreoathetotic) and ataxic CP. More detailed subdivision of CP uses functional grading i.e. Gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) for lower and Bimanual Fine Motor Function (BFMF) for upper limbs. Etiological factors for CP could be determined in 70% of children with CP respectively, 66% in preterms and 73% in term neonates. In 17% of preterms prenatal and in 49% postnatal risk factors are supposed. In 38% of term neonates pre- and in 36% peri/neonatal risk factors are present. Postnatal neuroimaging, intracranial ultrasonography and in particular MRI enables insight in timing and brain lesions/abnormalities related to CP. In first and secound trimestar developmental abnormalities occurred, between 24 and 34 weeks gestation white matter lesions, whereas basal ganglia and cortex are damaged after 34 weeks gestation respectively. Over 75% of lesions causing CP occur in third trimestar with pre/perinatal onset. Early diagnosis of CP implies better prognosis of neuromotor outcome. Therefore many clinical and paraclinical procedures are used to identify neonates/young infants at risk for CP. Neurological examination combined with assessment of general movements in preterm and term neonates, neonatal primitive reflexes, antigravitation tests are the most commonly used method of clinical evaluation along with impaired regulatory mechanisms i.e. excessive crying, sleep disturbances, eating problems etc. After first months, deviant simptoms are more predictive of spastic or dystonic syndrome, with abnormalities of the muscle tone, prolonged persistance of primitive reflexes, abnormal antigravitation tests and retarded motoric development. Paraclinical diagnostic methods i.e. neuroimaging and evoked potentials enable early detection of perinatal brain damage which correlate with unfavourable neuromotor outcome. Intracranial ultrasonography is the modality of choice in visualisation of peri-intraventricular haemorrhage/postventricular dilatation and focal cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Diffuse periventricular white matter lesions in terms of hypomyelinisation need to be diagnosed by high resolution MRI. Neurophysiology in particularly SSEP of n. tibialis ant. is highly sensitive in functional assessment of neonates at risk for CP.

AB  - Background: Secondary hypertension is the most frequent cause of high blood pressure (BP) in children, promoting the development of cardiovascular diseases and their clinical consequences. The problem is important especially in the young because of the possibility of intervention at the early stage of disease. The aim of the study was to characterize children with secondary hypertension. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 29 children, aged 8.2 ± 5.7, with diagnosed secondary hypertension. Subjective symptoms of high BP, previous treatment, birth outcomes, family history of hypertension and anthropometric data were obtained. BP was analyzed on the basis of ambulatory BP monitoring. Left ventricular structure was assessed using M-mode echocardiography. All children underwent routine blood tests and were consulted by an ophthalmologist. Results: The most frequent cause of hypertension was coarctation of the aorta (24/29) whereas the others were renal disease (2/29), renovascular disease (2/29) and steroid treatment (1/29). Familial hypertension was found in one girl. Diurnal BP was 125.7 ± 17.9 mmHg for systolic and 70.9 ± 16.7 mmHg for diastolic. Hypertensive abnormalities of the retinal vasculature was recognized in 5 children. Improper daily BP variability concerned 12 patients. Left ventricular mass was 76.9 ± 51.3 g and LVMI was 42.1 ± 11.7 g/m2.7. Left ventricular hypertrophy was found in 14/26 children. Conclusions: In children, secondary hypertension is associated with marked improper daily BP profile. Retinopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy are frequent in children with secondary hypertension. Copyright © 2007 Via Medica.

AB  - Objective: There is increasing evidence that antenatal stress has long-lasting effects on child development, but there is less accord on the mechanisms and the gestational window of susceptibility. One possible mechanism is by foetal exposure to maternal cortisol. To explore this, we investigated the relationship between cortisol in maternal plasma and amniotic fluid, and any moderating influence of gestational age. Patients and measurements: Two hundred and sixty-seven women awaiting amniocentesis for karyotyping were studied. Samples were collected between 0900 and 1730 h. Gestational age was determined to the nearest day by ultrasound biometry and time of collection noted to the nearest 15 min. Total cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay in paired amniotic fluid and maternal blood samples (n = 267) [gestation range 15-37 weeks, median 17 weeks (119 days)]. Results: Both maternal and amniotic fluid cortisol levels increased with gestation (r = 0.25, P < 0.001; r = 0.33 P < 0.001, respectively). Amniotic fluid cortisol was positively correlated with time of collection (r = 0.22, P < 0.001) and negatively with maternal age (r = -0.24, P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between amniotic fluid cortisol with maternal plasma levels (r = 0.32, P < 0.001), which persisted after multivariate analysis controlling for gestation, time of collection and maternal age. The association appeared to be dependent on gestational age, being nonsignificant at 15-16 weeks' gestation and increasing in strength thereafter. Conclusion: This study shows a positive correlation between maternal and amniotic fluid cortisol levels, which becomes robust from 17 to 18 weeks onwards. The results provide support for the hypothesis that alterations in maternal cortisol may be reflected in amniotic fluid levels from this gestation. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Experimental animal studies and epidemiological and clinical human studies demonstrate that atypical infant-caregiving can exert short- and long-term effects on offspring phenotype, including increased long-term risk of affective disorders. Whilst the early environment is therefore a major determinant of behavioral, physiological and neurobiological phenotypes, the effects of early adversity exhibit individual variation, presumably due to differences in environment-genotype interactions. Twin studies provide a powerful model with which to study such interactions. However, human twin studies rarely include analysis of genotype-environment interactions or of individuals exposed to extreme environments, and rat studies have rarely attempted to utilize littermates (i.e. dizygotic twins) to investigate environment-genotype interactions. Here, we report on the effects of repeated deprivation of caregiving in the common marmoset, a primate that exhibits dizygotic twinning and bi-parental care. Breeding pairs each contributed early deprived (ED) twins and control (CON) twins, thereby allowing for the study of effects of ED, parentage and ED-parentage interaction. Significant ED×parentage interaction effects were obtained for basal urinary, plasma and cerebrospinal-fluid cortisol titers (infancy-adolescence), and basal levels of social and maintenance behaviors (juveniles); basal urinary cortisol titers during a 2-week period of repeated psychosocial challenge (juveniles), and social and exploratory behavior during psychosocial challenge (juveniles). Significant main effects of ED were obtained for: basal levels of time spent in contact with parents (ED>CON; juveniles) and in locomotor activity (ED<CON; adolescents); basal and psychosocial-stress-related systolic blood pressure (ED>CON; juveniles); time spent in locomotor activity (ED<CON), contact calling (ED<CON) and exploring novelty (ED>CON) during psychosocial challenge (juveniles). This study provides evidence for long-term effects of early environment on bio-behavioral traits and states in marmosets specifically, and the importance of including parental factors in developmental studies in mammals generally. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly remains a diagnosis of concern in infancy. This study evaluates factors affecting the onset, treatment, and outcomes of nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly. METHODS: A retrospective chart review and telephone survey were performed. A posterior occipital deformation severity score was used. Factors such as demographics, behavioral and helmet therapy, feeding patterns, torticollis, multiple gestation pregnancies, prematurity, and congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly were evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred five infants were identified. Of these, 95 percent were Caucasian, 93 percent were from two-parent households, and 70 percent were from households earning more than $50,000. Repositioning was attempted in 95 percent, and 45 percent progressed to helmet therapy. When comparing change in posterior occipital deformation severity score with helmet therapy to repositioning, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Forty-nine percent of patients were breast-fed, and when compared with the general population, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Twenty percent of infants had torticollis, and when compared with population norms, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Twelve percent of patients were twins, and when compared with population norms, more twinning occurred (p < 0.05). Congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly was found in 10 percent of patients and did not result in an increased risk of progression to helmet therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates trends that may predict additional risks for developing nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly, including torticollis, plural births, and increased socioeconomic affluence. In addition, the nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly cohort was breast-fed less than the general population, demonstrating that breast-feeding may be preventative, as breast-fed infants are repositioned more frequently and sleep for shorter periods. As in other studies, cranial molding helmet therapy was more effective in correcting nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly than repositioning alone. ©2007American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

AB  - Efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are often equivalent, hence selection of an AED is often determined by the adverse effects (AEs). The development of neurocognitive AEs is almost inevitable with use of AEDs, especially in high-risk groups. Teratogenesis with major or minor malformations is of great concern during the first trimester of pregnancy, but an increasing body of information suggests that potential neurocognitive developmental delay may also occur with use of AEDs in the latter part of pregnancy. Decreased bone mineral density has been found in adults and children receiving both enzyme-inducing AEDs and valproate, an enzyme-inhibiting drug. AEDs may influence the lipid profile, body weight, reproductive, hormonal and other endocrine functions, and sleep architecture. There are age-specific AEs related to pharmacokinetic differences that have been highlighted in this review with emphasis on the pediatric population. A classification of AEs using different parameters is also included. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Postnatal depression is a common condition that may have a significant negative impact on both infant and mother, often remaining undiagnosed and untreated. Development of effective means of detection, prevention and treatment of postnatal depression is a major health challenge. The objective of this article is to critically review pharmacological, psychological and psychosocial approaches of prevention and treatment for postnatal depression. There is little evidence of short-term success for preventive interventions and some evidence of short-term success for treatment interventions. No preventive or therapeutic studies, however, have provided evidence for long-term success. There is a need for future research into the prevention and treatment of postnatal depression including the assessment of long-term effects on the child's development as well as feasibility in relation to cost-effectiveness. © 2007 Future Drugs Ltd.

AB  - Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug approved for use as an adjunct agent in partial-onset seizures in adults and children aged ≥ 4 years. It was also approved as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adults and adolescents aged ≥ 12 years with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. A parenteral intravenous formulation has recently become available allowing for its use when oral administration is temporarily not feasible. Available literature has demonstrated and supported that levetiracetam has an acceptable safety profile and this review discusses the safety profile of levetiracetam, with attention to special populations. The most common adverse effects are somnolence, asthenia and dizziness, which usually appear early after initiation of levetiracetam therapy and generally resolve without medication withdrawal. The most serious adverse effects are behavioral in nature and are more common in children and in patients with a prior history of behavioral problems. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - The current debate about HRT and bioidentical hormones seems to be largely based on emotional arguments for and against their use. A calmer evaluation that looks at the evidence for a positive outcome of normal menopause and the reasons that the current arguments for and against have evolved over time is in order. When hormone replacement is indicated by symptoms in addition to laboratory evaluation, replacement should not be withheld. However, a careful, dispassionate approach that takes into account our relatively primitive ability to measure and modulate hormones is needed. The therapies should be chosen on the basis of the patient's individualized needs and capacity to follow a prescribed regimen. Informed consent should be included in the discussion. Bioidentical hormones allow for the possibility of following hormone levels, especially when metabolites are also evaluated. The careful practitioner will want to engage the patient's ability to determine if the therapy is working and when symptoms suggest that a refill might contain more or less of the preparation than prescribed. When the pharmaceutical industry, the journals publishing scientific findings, educators, practitioners, and the proponents of complementary and alternative therapies put the needs of the patient before their own, we will all have an easier time determining which therapies to use and when to use them.

AB  - Objectives: Maternal-infant bedsharing is a common but controversial practice. Little has been published about who bedshares in the United States. This information would be useful to inform public policy, to guide clinical practice and to help focus research. The objective was to explore the prevalence and determinants of bedsharing in Oregon. Methods: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a population-based random sample of women after a live birth. Women were asked if they shared a bed with their infant "always," "almost always," "sometimes" or "never." Results: 1867 women completed the survey in 1998-99 (73.5% weighted response rate). Of the respondents, 20.5% reported bedsharing always, 14.7% almost always, 41.4% sometimes, and 23.4% never. In multivariable logistic regression, Hispanics (adjusted odds ratio [ORa] 1.69, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.17-2.43), blacks (ORa 3.11, 95% CI 2.03-4.76) and Asians/Pacific Islanders (ORa 2.14, 95% CI 1.51-3.03), women who breastfed more than 4 weeks (ORa 2.65, 95% CI 1.72-4.08), had annual family incomes less than $30,000 (ORa 2.44, 95% CI 1.44-4.15), or were single (ORa 1.55, 95% CI 1.03-2.35) were more likely to bedshare frequently (always or almost always). Among Hispanic and black women, bedsharing did not vary significantly by income level. Bedsharing black, American Indian/Alaska Native and white infants were much more likely to be exposed to smoking mothers than Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander infants (p < 0001). Conclusions: Bedsharing is common in Oregon. The women most likely to bedshare are non-white, single, breastfeeding and low-income. Non-economic factors are also important, particularly among blacks and Hispanics. Campaigns to decrease bedsharing by providing cribs may have limited effectiveness if mothers are bedsharing because of cultural norms. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

AB  - With societal trends towards increasing age at starting a pregnancy attempt, many women are concerned about achieving conception before the onset of infertility, which precedes menopause. Couples failing to conceive a pregnancy within 12 months are classified as clinically infertile, and may be recommended for assisted reproductive therapy (ART). Because many ART procedures are expensive and may convey an increased risk of adverse outcomes for the offspring, it is advantageous to decrease time to pregnancy by natural methods. One possibility is to intentionally time intercourse during the days of the menstrual cycle having the highest conception probabilities. This article proposes a Bayesian decision theoretic approach for searching for optimal rules for timing intercourse based on cycle day, secretions and other information. Good rules result in high conception probabilities while requiring minimal targeted intercourse. A biologically based statistical model is used to relate cycle day and biomarkers to the conception probability. A stochastic search procedure is then developed to search for rules with high expected utility, and the methods are applied to data from a recent Italian study.

AB  - There are a growing number of concerns about the utilization of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in late pregnancy and the onset of perinatal complications. This review aimed to analyze and summarize the studies evaluating the risk of perinatal complications (such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, withdrawal or toxic phenomena, and other detrimental events/poor neonatal outcomes) related to maternal SRI use in late pregnancy. A computerized search of MEDLINE (1966-January 2007) and PsycINFO (1974-January 2007) databases was performed. Articles describing perinatal complications after late in utero exposure to SRIs were selected and also reviewed for additional references. Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria. Exposure to SRIs late in pregnancy is clearly associated with an increased risk of infants developing a constellation of symptoms, including CNS and respiratory effects, often requiring close infant observation and supportive or specific treatment in intensive care units. Such symptoms are not always due to toxic or withdrawal reactions. Indeed, some evidence suggests that SRIs may interfere with the physiology of the respiratory system and parasympathetic activity in neonates. Of the most methodologically relevant studies reviewed, 50% have been published in the last 3 years. Hence, it is possible that further concerning data will become available in the future. For these reasons, the opportunity of tapering and discontinuing SRIs in late pregnancy should be taken into consideration, although to date the evidence to support such a clinical decision is preliminary. © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Study Objectives: To demonstrate that fetal heart rate measured by ultrasound can be successfully captured and monitored throughout the nocturnal polysomnogram. Methods: Fetal heart rate by ultrasound using an abdominal belt (Hewlett Packard Fetal Monitor 8040A) was measured during 1 overnight polysomnogram in volunteers in late pregnancy and added to a digitized polysomnography system (Alice 4, Respironics) Results: In 6 women with a single fetus in their third trimester, the fetal heart rate monitor band only infrequently needed to be readjusted. Fetal kicks and movements resulted in signal loss, usually with subsequent recapture without having to awaken the mother. Conclusions: Fetal heart rate, 1 of the classic signals of fetal distress, can be added to the nocturnal polysomnogram with minimal disruption of maternal sleep and with signal capture throughout the night.

AB  - The occurrence of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy is well known. However, the mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors that predispose women to have restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. A total of 146 pregnant women were included in the study. Patients were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics, complications of pregnancy, medical therapy (vitamin and iron intake), sleep disorders, muscle cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Electroneurography, routine blood biochemistry tests, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests were performed and vitamin B12, folic acid, serum iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, iron saturation, prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were measured. Of the participants, 38 were diagnosed as having restless legs syndrome. In women with restless legs syndrome, additional medical problems, night cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness were more frequent. In women without restless legs syndrome, serum hemoglobin levels were significantly higher and the use of supplemental iron or vitamins was greater. Among the women with restless legs syndrome, progesterone levels were slightly higher but this difference was not statistically significant. In summary, in this study, lower hemoglobin levels and supplementation deficits of iron and vitamins were found be the risk factors for restless legs syndrome in pregnancy. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - The human foetus begins preparation for extrauterine life in the 26th week of gestation. Victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) were described as having less-intensive reactions to environmental stimuli than their siblings. They were described as less-active physically and more breathless and exhausted during feeding. These foetal-like qualities are similar to the microgravity deconditioning of the space traveller and the autonomic dysfunction of hypokinetic humans. During quiet sleep, a group of near-miss SIDS victims displayed a faster heart-rate and a decreased movement-time, compared to controls. Another group of SIDS victims linked delayed repolarisation and sympathetic overactivity of the nervous system. The excessive Q-T wave intervals, cardiac instability and autonomic dysfunction tended to coincide with the peak incidence of SIDS which is the normal period of autonomic transformation at 2-3 months of age. Sympathetic hyperactivity transforms the subject into an energy-intensive species with an accelerated heartbeat, intensive vasoconstriction and general reactions to a hostile environment. Energy-intensive species (flight-oriented species) were sensitive to selenium (Se) deficiency. Altered mitochondrial structure and defective electron transport of heart mitochondria were features of this syndrome. Runaway excessive sympathetic autonomic activity transforms the subject into an energy-intensive species responsive to selenium. Groups of Se-deficient lambs confined for eight weeks developed abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs). Groups exercised daily on a treadmill or Se-supplemented groups retained virtually normal ECGs. Foetuses and subjects unreactive to the environment are space travellers lacking parasympathetic stimuli to the brain. Decreased movement-time deprives the brain receptors of the stimulus induced by gravity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethanol exposure during gestation can have devastating consequences on the developing organism. Children who have a history of prenatally exposure to ethanol may show morphological and functional alterations, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, specific cranial/facial features, and dysfunction of central nervous system, is the most severe end of FASD. FAS or FASD children are known to suffer from disturbance of sleep and/or food intake behaviors. These neuropsychiatric symptoms may be due to impairment of the system regulating circadian rhythms. Recently, animal studies revealed that ethanol exposure during brain development can cause alterations in the circadian rhythm and its regulating system. We examined the effects of pre- or postnatal exposure to ethanol on the circadian rhythm in adulthood by measuring deep body temperature and wheel running activity in rats. After a phase delay in the light/dark cycle, ethanol-exposed rats took longer than control rats to resynchronize to the new light/dark cycle. These results suggest that both pre- and postnatal ethanol exposure impair the development of the circadian clock response to light cue. Because abnormal development of the circadian clock system might contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in FASD, it is believed that normalizing the disturbed rhythm improves the symptoms. However, the mechanisms of dysfunction and potential interventions for disturbance of circadian clock system still remain to be elucidated. Further investigations are required to fully understand long-term effects of ethanol on the development of circadian rhythms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. METHODS: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a sleep consciousness, and bed-sharing. Mercer's 1/4s stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives. Copyright © 2007 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy, associated with arterial hypertension, pre-eclampsia and adverse outcome of the newborn, has been described. Usually it can successfully be treated with non-invasive ventilation. A 36-year-old, twin-pregnant woman at 28 + 6 weeks of gestation presented with the complaints of snoring and nocturnal oxygen desaturations. Polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea (respiratory disturbance index [RDI] 104/h, minimal oxygen saturation in pulse oximetry [SpO2/min] 75%). First therapeutic approaches including oxygen supplementation, non-invasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure - spontaneous (BiPAP-S) remained without success. Only after ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure in spontaneous/timed modus (BiPAP-ST) combined with additional oxygen supplementation a satisfactory treatment result could be achieved (RDI 32/h, SpO2/min 85%). Because of progressive pre-eclampsia despite therapy at 31+0 weeks of gestation cesarean section was performed and 2 healthy children were delivered. After surgery non-invasive ventilation had to be continued for another six weeks before the condition improved. In contrast to the documented benefits of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in pregnant women the literature, in our case even with sufficient therapy of sleep apnea progressive pre-eclampsia and premature delivery could not be prevented. Possible explanations include the short treatment duration and existence of twin pregnancy. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - Women report their sleep to be disrupted during pregnancy. Sleep deprivation has been linked to elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. No information currently addresses the sleep-immune relationship during pregnancy. This study explores the relationship between subjectively reported sleep variables and circulating serum cytokine levels. Pregnant women (n = 35; mean age = 31.0 ± 3.7 years) seen once a trimester completed sleep questionnaires, gave blood and recorded their sleep on a sleep diary at home for 2 weeks. Nonpregnant women (n = 43; mean age = 28.2 ± 5.2 years) underwent the same protocol once. Subjective sleep variables were compared to serum cytokine levels for IL-4, -6, -10 and TNF-α as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) determined by ELISA. Nonparametric analyses and linear regression were performed to explore relationships between the sleep and immune variables. Pregnant women subjectively reported their sleep to be worse than in the nonpregnant group. Serum cytokine levels differed between the two groups and varied by trimester. As anticipated, IL-10 was significantly higher in all trimesters; however CRP, an indicator of systemic inflammation, was higher in all trimesters compared to the nonpregnant sample. Subjectively reported sleep disruption was associated with increases in TNF-α in the pregnant sample and CRP in the nonpregnant sample. These data confirm that disrupted sleep experienced during pregnancy, as well as during the nonpregnant state, is related to increases in inflammatory markers. Future exploration of these relationships should include functional assessments of immunity as well as polysomnographically recorded sleep. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. METHODS: This longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time 1 and Time 4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

AB  - Sleep disturbance is a typical complaint during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies of this phenomenon have not measured sleep in the last days of pregnancy as women transition into labor. Poor sleep can have potentially adverse effects on labor and delivery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep obtained in the 5 days preceding childbirth, and the relationship between sleep in this time frame and both pain and fatigue during early labor. METHODS: Thirty-five nulliparous women were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to hospital admission. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Most women experienced spontaneous labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset. Results from this study can be used to advise women in late pregnancy about expected sleep patterns and measures to optimize sleep and rest.

AB  - SubCoeruleus (SubC) neurons, which are thought to modulate rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, were recorded in brain stem slices from 7- to 20-day rats and found to manifest spikelets, indicative of electrical coupling. Spikelets occurred spontaneously or could be induced by superfusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol. Whole cell recordings revealed that carbachol induced membrane oscillations and spikelets in the theta frequency range in SubC neurons in the presence of fast synaptic blockers. Electrical coupling in neurons is mediated by the gap junction protein connexin 36 (Cx 36). We found that Cx 36 gene expression and protein in the mesopontine tegmentum decreased during development. Cx 36 protein levels specifically in the SubC decreased in concert with the developmental decrease in REM sleep. The presence of electrical coupling in the SubC introduces a novel potential mechanism of action for the regulation of sleep-wake states. Copyright © 2007 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - Laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are triggered by the contact of liquids with the laryngeal mucosa. In the mature organism, LCR trigger lower airway protective responses (coughing, effective swallowing, and arousal) to prevent aspiration. General belief holds that LCR are responsible for apnea and bradycardia in the newborn mammal, including humans. Our laboratory has recently shown that LCR in full-term lambs are consistently analogous to the mature LCR reported in adult mammals, without significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire M, Nsegbe E, Gagnon-Gervais K, Samson N, Moreau-Bussiere F, Fortier PH, and Praud J-P. J Appl Physiol 98: 2197-2203, 2005). The aim of the present study was to assess LCR in nonsedated, newborn preterm lambs born at 132 days of gestation (term = 147 days). The preterm lambs were instrumented for recording glottal adductor electromyogram, electroencephalogram, eye movements, heart rate, respiration, and oximetry. A chronic supraglottal catheter was used for injecting 0.5 ml of saline, distilled water, and HCl (pH 2) during quiet sleep, active sleep, and wakefulness on postnatal days 7 (D7) and 14 (D14). Laryngeal stimulation by water or HCl on D7 induced significant apneas, bradycardia, and desaturation, which, at times, appeared potentially life-threatening. No significant apneas, bradycardias, or desaturation were observed on D14. No consistent effects of sleep state could be shown in the present study. In conclusion, laryngeal stimulation by liquids triggers potentially dangerous LCR in preterm lambs on D7, but not on D14. It is proposed that maturation of the LCR between D7 and D14 is partly involved in the disappearance of apneas/bradycardias of prematurity with postnatal age.

AB  - Comorbidity is defined as an illness that occurs more frequently in association with a specific disorder than would be found as a coincidental association in the general population. Conditions that are frequently comorbid with migraine include depression, anxiety, stroke, epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other pain disorders. In addition, many common illnesses occur concomitantly (at the same time) with migraine and influence the treatment choice. Migraine management, and especially migraine prevention, can be challenging when patients have comorbid or concomitant illnesses. The objectives of this initiative are to review the literature on managing patients who have migraine and common comorbidities, present additional clinical approaches for care of these difficult patients, and evaluate the areas in which research is needed to establish evidence-based guidelines for the management of migraine with associated comorbid conditions. © 2007 the Authors.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to describe the role of insulin resistance in the etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome and to review the results of treatment with the insulin sensitizing drug metformin. RECENT FINDINGS: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a heterogeneous combination of clinical, hormonal, and reproductive abnormalities associated with insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk factors. Reduction of hyperinsulinism and improvement of insulin sensitivity with metformin has been reported to ameliorate these abnormalities in many, but not all studies, with few adverse effects. SUMMARY: Metformin may be the drug of first choice for most, if not all women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, either alone or in combination with other treatments. Further investigation is necessary to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment necessary to maximize response. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - The clinician is often asked by the family whether their child is developmentally well or not. It is necessary to be precise whether a child has developmental departure, delay, stagnation or regression. The dysmorphic phenotype if present in any child can be associated with implications developmentally. The central motor dysfunction is a sequel to an insult to the developing brain through a causal pathway rather than because of one particular offending factor cerebral palsy is one of the central motor dysfunctions. The less pronounced ones are developmental motor disorder, developmental co-ordination disorder and minor neurological dysfunction. The classification of cerebral palsy is currently based on the motor abnormalities, accompanying impairments, anatomical and neuro-imaging findings, and causation and timing. The state of cerebral hypotonia and cerebral hypertonia are two different phases in motor consequences following an insult to the growing brain from which a preschool child may recover or proceed to develop cerebral palsy. The Gross Motor Function Measure is an objective and quantifiable way of monitoring motor skills in children with cerebral palsy. The developmental assessment, screening for co-morbidity and developmental assistance are the three key interventions which will define the developmental outcome in children. All Pediatricians need to be familiar with transition planning for children when children grow older.

AB  - Introduction. Neonatal polysomnography studies (electroencephalogram, electrooculography, body movements, cardiorespiratory frequencies) were performed in 101 newborn full-term infants diagnosed with severe birth asphyxia. Patients and methods. To analyse results, the sample was divided into two groups, depending on whether hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) had occurred or not. The results of the polysomnography studies were correlated with those from the full-term neurological examination and the sequelae from the neurological development during the first two years of life. Results. Significant correlations were obtained among the variables that were studied. The normality observed in the electrophysiological study in the group of patients with severe asphyxia without HIE was associated with a full-term neurological examination and with a neurological development that has progressed in a satisfactory manner. In the group of patients with grade II HIE there was a predominance of severe alterations in the full-term neonatal polysomnography study, which were significantly correlated with the pathological full-term neurological examinations and serious sequelae from neurological development. Conclusions. It has been proved that neonatal polysomnography studies are a valuable aid in evaluating the neurological status of newborn infants in a critical condition and in predicting the sequelae of neurological development in the first two years of life. Further research should be aimed at determining the effects exerted by the daily administration of medication (sedatives, anaesthetics and antiepileptic agents) in critical newborn infants on electrical activity in the brain and the cyclic structuring of the different phases of sleep. © 2007, Revista de Neurología.

AB  - Background: Research in the field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) has revealed that depression is associated with inflammation manifested by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Discussion: The old paradigm described inflammation as simply one of many risk factors for depression. The new paradigm is based on more recent research that has indicated that physical and psychological stressors increase inflammation. These recent studies constitute an important shift in the depression paradigm: inflammation is not simply a risk factor; it is the risk factor that underlies all the others. Moreover, inflammation explains why psychosocial, behavioral and physical risk factors increase the risk of depression. This is true for depression in general and for postpartum depression in particular. Puerperal women are especially vulnerable to these effects because their levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly increase during the last trimester of pregnancy - a time when they are also at high risk for depression. Moreover, common experiences of new motherhood, such as sleep disturbance, postpartum pain, and past or current psychological trauma, act as stressors that cause proinflammatory cytokine levels to rise. Breastfeeding has a protective effect on maternal mental health because it attenuates stress and modulates the inflammatory response. However, breastfeeding difficulties, such as nipple pain, can increase the risk of depression and must be addressed promptly. Conclusion: PNI research suggests two goals for the prevention and treatment of postpartum depression: reducing maternal stress and reducing inflammation. Breastfeeding and exercise reduce maternal stress and are protective of maternal mood. In addition, most current treatments for depression are anti-inflammatory. These include long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, cognitive therapy, St. John's wort, and conventional antidepressants. © 2007 Kendall-Tackett; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Recent advances in oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation technology have not only brought hope to women facing premature loss of ovarian function; it can also be utilized for healthy women seeking to extend their biological clocks. This is a major issue of contention in healthcare ethics. Proponents of this new technology argue that this enables women to fully pursue educational and career goals in their youth, whilst upon reaching middle age they would have more financial resources for their offspring. Nevertheless, this argument is flawed by the reality that even if the cryopreservation of oocytes and ovarian tissue were optimized, this would in no way be a guaranteed route for women to have biological children later in life. Moreover, because only a limited amount of autologous reproductive material can be cryopreserved and stored for a single healthy woman, there is a risk of material depletion before reproductive success is attained. Another prime consideration is the increased morbidity and mortality associated with clinical assisted reproduction in older women. Hence, it is suggested that the cryopreservation and storage of oocytes and ovarian tissues be restricted only to women facing the prospect of premature ovarian failure.

AB  - I Denmark 30% of females in the reproductive age regularly have shift work. 22 epidemiological papers were studied looking at associations between shift work and abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, and birth weight. No convincing associations were observed between rotating shift work or fixed nightshift and negative pregnancy outcome. Some epidemiological support was found for a relation between fixed nightshift and late abortion/stillbirth. If fixed night work for all pregnant women is avoided, seven late abortion/stillbirths a year can be prevented. Fixed night work for pregnant women should be avoided.

AB  - Background. An increasing number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa are changing to artemisinins combination therapy (ACT) as first or second line treatment for malaria. There is an urgent need to assess the safety of these drugs in pregnant women who may be inadvertently exposed to or actively treated with ACTs. Objectives. To examine existing published evidence on the relationship between artemisinin compounds and adverse pregnancy outcomes and consider the published evidence with regard to the safety of these compounds when administered during pregnancy. Methods. Studies on ACT use in pregnancy were identified via searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and Current Contents databases. Data on study characteristics, maternal adverse events, pregnancy outcomes and infant follow up were extracted. Results. Fourteen relevant studies (nine descriptive/case reports and five controlled trials) were identified. Numbers of participants in these studies ranged from six to 461. Overall there were reports on 945 women exposed to an artemisinin during pregnancy, 123 in the 1st trimester and 822 in 2nd or 3rd trimesters. The primary end points for these studies were drug efficacy and parasite clearance. Secondary endpoints were birth outcomes including low birth weight, pre-term birth, pregnancy loss, congenital anomalies and developmental milestones. While none of the studies found evidence for an association between the use of artemisinin compounds and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, none were of sufficient size to detect small differences in event rates that could be of public health importance. Heterogeneity between studies in the artemisinin and comparator drugs used, and in definitions of adverse pregnancy outcomes, limited any pooled analysis. Conclusion. The limited data available suggest that artemisinins are effective and unlikely to be cause of foetal loss or abnormalities, when used in late pregnancy. However, none of these studies had adequate power to rule out rare serious adverse events, even in 2nd and 3rd trimesters and there is not enough evidence to effectively assess the risk-benefit profile of artemisinin compounds for pregnant women particularly for 1st trimester exposure. Methodologically rigorous, larger studies and post-marketing pharmacovigilance are urgently required. © 2007 Dellicour et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment might lessen both patients' discomfort and multiple births, with their associated risks. We aimed to test the hypothesis that mild IVF treatment can achieve the same chance of a pregnancy resulting in term livebirth within 1 year compared with standard treatment, and can also reduce patients' discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs. Methods: We did a randomised, non-inferiority effectiveness trial. 404 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonist co-treatment combined with single embryo transfer) or a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos). Primary endpoints were proportion of cumulative pregnancies leading to term livebirth within 1 year after randomisation (with a non-inferiority threshold of -12·5%), total costs per couple up to 6 weeks after expected date of delivery, and overall discomfort for patients. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN35766970. Findings: The proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term livebirth after 1 year were 43·4% with mild treatment and 44·7% with standard treatment (absolute number of patients=86 for both groups). The lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI was -9·8%. The proportion of couples with multiple pregnancy outcomes was 0·5% with mild IVF treatment versus 13·1% (p<0·0001) with standard treatment, and mean total costs were €8333 and €10745, respectively (difference €2412, 95% CI 703-4131). There were no significant differences between the groups in the anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, or sleep quality of the mother. Interpretation: Over 1 year of treatment, cumulative rates of term livebirths and patients' discomfort are much the same for mild ovarian stimulation with single embryos transferred and for standard stimulation with two embryos transferred. However, a mild IVF treatment protocol can substantially reduce multiple pregnancy rates and overall costs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In mammals, the circadian oscillator within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) entrains circadian clocks in numerous peripheral tissues. Central and peripheral clocks share a molecular core clock mechanism governing daily time measurement. In the rat SCN, the molecular clockwork develops gradually during postnatal ontogenesis. The aim of the present work was to elucidate when during ontogenesis the expression of clock genes in the rat liver starts to be rhythmic. Daily profiles of mRNA expression of clock genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, Clock, Rev-Erbα, and Bmal1 were analyzed in the liver of fetuses at embryonic day 20 (E20) or pups at postnatal age 2 (P2), P10, P20, P30, and in adults by real-time RT-PCR. At E20, only a high-amplitude rhythm in Rev-Erbα and a low-amplitude variation in Cry1 but no clear circadian rhythms in expression of other clock genes were detectable. At P2, a high-amplitude rhythm in Rev-Erbα and a low-amplitude variation in Bmal1 but no rhythms in expression of other genes were detected. At P10, significant rhythms only in Per1 and Rev-Erbα expression were present. At P20, clear circadian rhythms in the expression of Per1, Per2, Rev-Erbα, and Bmal1, but not yet of Cry1 and Clock, were detected. At P30, all clock genes were expressed rhythmically. The phase of the rhythms shifted between all studied developmental periods until the adult stage was achieved. The data indicate that the development of the molecular clockwork in the rat liver proceeds gradually and is roughly completed by 30 days after birth.

AB  - Prokineticins are multifunctional secreted proteins that were originally identified as regulators of intestinal contraction but subsequently shown to affect vascular function, hyperalgesia, spermatogenesis, neuronal survival, circadian rhythm, nociception, feeding behaviour, immune responses, haematopoiesis and the development of the olfactory and gonadotropin-releasing hormone systems. Their role in the reproductive tract is still not fully elucidated, although they are reputed to increase microvascular permeability. Expression of prokineticins and their receptors has been reported in the ovary, uterus, placenta, testis and prostate. Their expression has also been reported in various pathologies of the reproductive tract, and future studies will highlight whether inhibition of prokineticin function in these pathologies would be a useful therapeutic target. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Synchrony, a construct used across multiple fields to denote the temporal relationship between events, is applied to the study of parent-infant interactions and suggested as a model for intersubjectivity. Three types of timed relationships between the parent and child's affective behavior are assessed: concurrent, sequential, and organized in an ongoing patterned format, and the development of each is charted across the first year. Viewed as a formative experience for the maturation of the social brain, synchrony impacts the development of self-regulation, symbol use, and empathy across childhood and adolescence. Different patterns of synchrony with mother, father, and the family and across cultures describe relationship-specific modes of coordination. The capacity to engage in temporally-matched interactions is based on physiological mechanisms, in particular oscillator systems, such as the biological clock and cardiac pacemaker, and attachment-related hormones, such as oxytocin. Specific patterns of synchrony are described in a range of child-, parent- and context-related risk conditions, pointing to its ecological relevance and usefulness for the study of developmental psychopathology. A perspective that underscores the organization of discrete relational behaviors into emergent patterns and considers time a central parameter of emotion and communication systems may be useful to the study of interpersonal intimacy and its potential for personal transformation across the lifespan. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

AB  - It is well-known that physiological phenomena and certain diseases, including neonatal granulocytosis, age-associated granulocytosis, periodontitis, pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, hemorrhoids, endometriosis, and NSADs-enteritis, are accompanied by tissue destruction and granulocytosis. We investigated what is a key factor connecting tissue destruction and granulocytosis, attention being focused on adrenergic receptors on granulocytes and stressinduced sympathetic nerve stimulation. If we introduce the concept that "granulocytosis and subsequent tissue destruction are induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation," the mechanisms underlying many physiological phenomena and the etiology of several uncurable diseases in humans can be clearly understood. © 2007 Humana Press Inc.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that fat content of expressed human milk from mothers of preterm infants is higher in samples expressed in the evening than in the morning during the first 7 weeks of lactation. Methods: The authors collected samples of expressed human milk obtained from 22 mothers of growing preterm infants, born at 26 to 31 weeks gestation, who routinely expressed all their milk every 3 hours using breast pump from the beginning of the second week to the seventh week after delivery. One aliquot was obtained from the first morning expression and the second from the evening expression. The entire aliquot was collected and mixed, and creamatocrit (CMT) was measured in a capillary. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and analyses were by repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Mean CMT was significantly higher in evening than morning samples during the whole lactation period, week after week (p &lt; 0.0001). Neither CMT values nor the morning-evening difference in CMT values correlated with gestational age, birth weight, or week of lactation. Morning CMT correlated significantly with evening CMT (R2 = 0.28, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Circadian variations in CMT are consistent during the first 7 weeks of lactation. The authors speculate that if higher caloric content expressed human milk is needed in a specific preterm infant, evening samples should be used preferentially, if available. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Deficiencies in maternal endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) have been associated with pregnancy complications, intrauterine growth retardation, and altered vascular function in offspring. In the present study, we investigated the influence of the maternal eNOS genotype on offspring's blood pressure, heart rate, and locomotor activity. The effect of maternal eNOS genotype was made by comparing telemetered blood pressure and activity between 2 groups of 13- to 16-week-old male heterozygous eNOS knockout mice, 1 produced by a cross of eNOS knockout (eNOS) mothers and wild-type (eNOS) fathers (eNOS offspring, N=11), the other by a cross of eNOS mothers and eNOS fathers (eNOS offspring, N=10). Data were also collected for homozygous eNOS and eNOS mice (N=15 each). Heterozygous eNOS knockout mice exhibited blood pressures that were intermediate to the eNOS and eNOS groups. Relative to eNOS mice, eNOS mice exhibited significant increases in nocturnal diastolic arterial pressure and diurnal variations (dark-light difference) in systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial pressure. In addition, indices of spontaneous nocturnal locomotor activity, including both the proportion of time spent active and the intensity of activity when active, were also significantly increased. Heart rate did not differ between the groups. Our results suggest that the maternal eNOS genotype influences both blood pressure and behavior of offspring, possibly as a consequence of developmental programming associated with intrauterine growth retardation. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum 11-dehydrocorticosterone (4-pregnen-21-ol-3,11,20-trione). The antiserum against 11-dehydrocorticosterone 21-hemisuccinate-conjugated bovine serum albumin was raised in rabbits. As an enzyme-labeled antigen, 11-dehydrocorticosterone 21-hemisuccinate was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Two ELISA systems were established: one without the extraction of steroids from serum (direct method), and another that used an HPLC purification step (HPLC method). The cross-reactivity of all steroids tested against the antibody was low except cortisone (92%); however, since cortisone levels in rats and mice are negligible, cortisone does not interfere with this direct ELISA. The measurable range of serum 11-dehydrocortiocosterone in both the direct and HPLC methods was 0.3-250 ng/ml and 0.78-400 ng/ml, respectively. Both methods displayed satisfactory parallel dilution, recovery and reproducibility; moreover, the values obtained with each method significantly correlated with the alternate method. To evaluate the two ELISA systems, the serum concentrations of 11-dehydrocorticosterone in normal rats and mice were determined by these two systems. The levels in Wistar rats fluctuated from 3 to 14 weeks of age (7.8±2.6 ng/ml) but at 1 week (1.7±1.2 ng/ml) were significantly low compared to other ages. No sex differences were found in rats and mice. Further, using the proposed direct method, chronological changes of rat serum 11-dehydrocorticosterone levels after 11-dehydrocorticosterone administration have been investigated together with corticosterone levels. These results verify that the proposed ELISA for 11-dehydrocorticosterone is useful for measuring 11 β-HSD activities in combination with the determination of serum corticosterone in rats and mice. © 2007 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

AB  - Although multiple condition dependence in dispersal is common, the proximate mechanisms that integrate information from multiple sources remain largely unknown. In the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), earlier studies have shown that maternal plasma corticosterone level interacts with maternal phenotype to affect offspring phenotype and dispersal strategy, and may reflect the mother's external and/or internal environment. However, the mechanism by which these two types of environmental information are integrated has not been identified. We explored the possibility that the timing and duration of the corticosterone signal are the key factors by which the message is modulated. We found that the timing of corticosterone exposure affects the juvenile phenotype: an exposure to corticosterone early in development has negative effects on juvenile size, weight, and body condition, that can nevertheless be restored in the case of a prolonged exposure. The duration of corticosterone exposure affects the dispersal strategy, although the precise effect depends on the sex ratio of the clutch. That is, in female-biased clutches, a prolonged exposure during gestation promotes philopatry of juveniles, while a short exposure enhances their dispersal, a result that is consistent with kin competition theory. Therefore, our results demonstrate that while corticosterone titer may signal a mother's external and/or internal environment to her developing young, differences in the timing and duration of this endocrine signal produce offspring with specialized phenotypes that exhibit different dispersal strategies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of infants' sleep and crying on marital relationship in first-time parent couples (N = 107) during the 1st year after birth. Control variables are parents' insomnia and parental self-efficacy in handling the baby. Questionnaires were administered to both parents before birth, at 2 and 7 weeks after birth, and at 1 year after birth. Results show that marital problem-solving ability did not change but that marital satisfaction diminished significantly over time. Crying was the main child variable that affected marital satisfaction. Fathers' self-efficacy contributed positively to marital problem solving and negatively to paternal insomnia. Both maternal and paternal insomnia affected spouses' insomnia. As infant sleep problems may worsen preexisting parental insomnia, it is recommended that first-time parents be informed about treatments of insomnia.

AB  - The Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory motor disorder, characterized by an unpleasant (and sometimes painful) sensation, most often localized deep within both legs, manifested by an urge to move the legs that worsens with inactivity, in the evening and during the night. In addition to be tiresome, RLS mostly impacts sleep. RLS is a clnical diagnosis based entirely on patien'ts symptoms. Its severity depends on how frequent, long lasting and painful the symptoms are, and on how much they impact on sleep, mood and quality of life. Seventy to 90 % of the patients present atso involuntary, periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) or awake. As many as 8.5% French adults (10.8% women, 5.8% men) experience RLS once a year, while 4.4% patients are suffering from RLS at least once a week. Although the physiopathology of RLS is incompletety elucidated, several factors may contribute to its expression: genetics and circadian factors, and a central dysfunction of dopamine, opioid and iron storage. RLS is generaly idiopathic with family aggregation in 63% to 92% patients. RLS can be secondary to iron brain deficiency, pregnancy, uremia and neuropathy. Serum ferritin levels (norms >50 mg/L) shouid be determined, and iron supplementation may be beneficiai in iron-deficient patients. Patients with minor symptoms may try to avoid caffeine, alcohol and sport in the evening, to have regular sleep schedules, and to walk or have an important mental activity (eg writing, doing cross-words) during symptoms. For other patients, three classes of drugs are mostly used and best analyzed: dopaminergic agents, antieplieptics (including benzodiazepines), and opioids. The evening intake of 50 to 200 mg of levodopa can be enough to improve RLS and sleep symptoms, but its short half-life exposes patients to the risk of end-of-the-night rebounds and augmentations (development of RLS earlier, in the afternoon and in the arms), so that dopamine agonists have become the drugs of choice. They have demonstrated efficacy not only in RLS but aiso in PLMS, using large, double blind, placebo-controlled trials. Opioids and antiepileptics can be used in painful RLS, with the risk of rapid addiction. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: To describe clinical characteristics of infants with colic admitted to hospital because of ongoing excessive crying (colic). Methods: Characteristics of 104 infants admitted to hospital because of severe excessive crying (cases) were compared to those of 100 healthy thriving controls randomly selected from records of well baby clinics. Results: Half of the cases were reported to cry excessively from the day of birth, and feeding changes had been recommended in 77%. A medical cause of excessive crying was identified in none of the cases. Almost all infants showed a rapid transition to normal crying behaviour during admission; none cried for >3 h per day. Mean gestational age and mean Apgar scores were slightly lower in cases than in controls. There was a trend of positive family history of atopy being more common in controls (45%) than in cases (38%, p = 0.14). Feeding problems were more common in cases (71%) than in controls (36%, 95% CI for difference 21.6%-46.9%). Pregnancy or birth complications were much more common in cases (85%) than in controls (37%; 95% CI 35%-58%). Conclusions: Infants with severe excessive crying show normalization of crying behaviour during hospital admission, and are unlikely to have medical causes for their colic. The most important risk factor for excessive crying was a complicated pregnancy or birth, suggesting that this might predispose parents to regard normal crying behaviour as excessive. © 2007 The Author(s).

AB  - Chronic constant hypoxia (CCH) and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) are known to have deleterious effects on the central nervous system. Because of the difference in the pattern of hypoxic exposure, it is possible that the pathological outcome would vary. The N-acetyl aspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio is a reliable marker of neuronal integrity, and this can be noninvasively measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. P2 CD1 mouse pups with their dams were exposed to either CCH, where the FIO2 was maintained at 11% continuously or to CIH, where the FIO2 was varied between 21 and 11% every 4 min. P30 mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia for 4 wk demonstrated a significant decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio in the hippocampus and thalamus, which was reversed by a subsequent exposure to 4 wk of normoxia. Meanwhile, mice exposed to 4 wk of constant hypoxia did not demonstrate any differences in their NAA/Cr ratios from controls in these brain regions. These results indicate that an intermittent pattern of hypoxic exposure may have a more adverse effect on neuronal function and integrity than a continuous one. The reversal of NAA/Cr levels to baseline during the return to normoxia indicates that therapeutic strategies targeted at alleviating the intermittent hypoxic stress in diseases, such as obstructive sleep apnea, have the potential for inducing significant neurocognitive recovery in these patients.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of trained cultural mediators in promoting, among immigrant mothers, four preventive interventions for their infants: immunization, breastfeeding, sleeping position, passive smoking exposure. Methods: 142 immigrant pregnant women in Trieste and Bologna, speaking Chinese, Serbian-Croatian, Arabian and Urdu, were randomized in two intervention groups: one receiving a booklet or home visits from trained cultural mediators and a control group exposed to routine health care. Quantitative data were collected at enrolment, soon after birth, and at three and six months after birth. Qualitative data were collected from a sub-group of 19 women through focus groups and in-depth interviews. Results: A considerable proportion of data was missed after birth (49%) and at six months (30%) for different reasons. Analysis of results, limited to data gathered at enrolment (98%) and at three months (87%), shows no difference in compliance with preventive interventions among the three study groups. There were, however, statistically significant differences among both linguistic groups and research sites. Multivariate analysis confirmed the lack of differences among groups, but could not isolate language and residence as variables associated with different health practices due to the homogeneity within linguistic groups and research sites. The qualitative analysis associated differences in health practices with cultural motivations that were specific for each linguistic group, but not with the three study groups. Discussion: The lack of a demonstrated effectiveness of a booklet or a home visit by cultural mediators could be due to different reasons. Some may be related with the design of these interventions, some to the limitations of the study, some with specific cultural elements within each linguistic group.

AB  - Introduction: Double J ureteral stents are being used in urological practice for more than 25 years and in the recent years indications have continued to expand. Thus the complications and side effects of ureteral stents are also more frequent than previously reported. In addition to the severe complications resulting from forgotten or intentionally left stents for longer durations in ureters, they might also cause physical and emotional side effects due to bothering symptoms. The majority of the uncomfortable symptoms are related to urinary tract and these symptoms have severe negative impact on patients' general health status and quality of life. In this study, we evaluated the symptoms bothering the patient and impairing the quality of life due to stents. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty eight men and 79 women who were treated with ureteral double J stents were recruited. The patients were followed with a questionnaire consisting of 14 questions concerning urgency, incontinence, painful voiding, incomplete emptying, urethral pain, hematuria, sleep disturbance, need for analgesics, overall weakness, social life enjoyment, sexual dysfunction, getting permission from work/school, urinary tract infection and the need for extra antibiotics at 1 and 4 weeks after stent insertion and 1 week after stent removal. In addition to the presence or absence of a symptom, the frequency of the symptom, when it is present, was also asked based on a subjective classification [occasionally (25%), sometimes (50%), most of the time (75%), all of the time (100%)]. The symptoms of each period are compared by statistical analysis. Results: The mean age was 40.1 (range: 8-80) years. The indications for double J insertion were nephroureterolithiasis (n: 184), pregnancy related hydronephrosis (n: 8), malignancy (n: 7), ureteropelvic junction obstruction (n: 5), ureterovesical junction obstruction (n: 2), perforation (n: 1). There was no history of previous double J stent insertion in any patient. Double J stents were inserted to the right, left and both ureters in 92, 100 and 15 patients respectively. All double J stents used in the study were made up of polyethylene and except for 4 patients' stents with 6F diameter and 26 cm length were inserted. In the 4 pediatric patients 4.8 F diameter and 16 cm length double J stents were used. There was no change in the social life enjoyment with stent placement or removal. All other symptoms increased with the increased duration of the stent and decreased with the removal. The most significant two symptoms at the post insertion one week were painful voiding (43%) and urgency (41%) resulting from irritation of the stent. Also these two symptoms were significantly high (73%) at the fourth week. Conclusion: The results of our study indicates that ureteral stents have negative impact on general health status, sexual functions, school/work performance and quality of life in addition to the increased urinary tract related symptoms, and these negative effects increase with the duration of the stent. Therefore, the indications and durations of the ureteral stents must be revisited in the light of the quality of life, and unnecessary insertions and longer durations should be avoided.

AB  - Spontaneous coronary dissection is a rare cause of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Idiopathic spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) occurs in patient without risk factors for coronary artery disease and without underlying pregnancy. We describe a case of idiopathic spontaneous coronary dissection after sleep deprivation presenting with acute myocardial infarction. A 40 year old woman presented to an emergency department with squeezing substernal chest pain lasting 1 hour following 72 h sleep deprivation due to overtime work. On admission, ECG showed no significant ST change. But the level of CK-MB and Troponin T were increased up to 77.54 ng/ml and 1.62 ng/ml, respectively. Emergent coronary angiography demonstrated a longitudinal dissection of the middle portion in the diagonal artery with TIMI III flow to the distal part of the vessel. Because the dissected vessel was too small to pass the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and deploy the stent, angioplasty was not performed. Under medical treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel and unfractionated heparin, conservative management was proposed; she remained free of symptom and discharged free of chest pain and in good condition. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several clinical reports have indicated that autistic patients often show disturbance of the circadian rhythm, which may be related to dysfunction of the serotonergic system in the brain. Using rats exposed prenatally to valproic acid (VPA) as an animal model of autism, we examined locomotor activity and feeding under a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle, and found disturbance of the circadian rhythm characterized by frequent arousal during the light/sleep phase. In addition, measurement of brain serotonin (5-HT) level using in vivo microdialysis showed that the brain 5-HT level in VPA-exposed rats was significantly higher than that in control rats. These results suggest that a higher brain 5-HT level might be responsible for the irregular sleep/awake rhythm in autism. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - Rodent studies have revealed that the early rearing environment plays an important role in the development of stress vulnerability, memory and cognition. Although early lighting conditions (ELC) are involved in these neuronal developments through both maternal and offspring behavior, their influence has not been fully elucidated. Thus, by using Sprague-Dawley rats, we examined whether ELC affected maternal care by the dam and the subsequent neurodevelopment of the offspring. Prolonged dark phase conditions (PDC) (light/dark, 6/18 h) and prolonged light phase conditions (light/dark, 18/6 h) were administered from postnatal day 2 to postnatal day 14. Throughout this period, maternal care and the circadian rhythmicity of dams were investigated. In adolescence and adulthood of the offspring, we measured anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, object recognition memory, activity rhythm and corticosterone response to stress with hippocampal expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate and glucocorticoid receptor mRNAs. PDC altered maternal care and circadian rhythmicity in the dam compared with normal lighting conditions and prolonged light phase conditions. PDC markedly increased anxiety-like behavior, decreased social interaction and object recognition memory, and inhibited corticosterone feedback in offspring later in life. Furthermore, hippocampal levels of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B mRNA in rats subjected to PDC were significantly lower than in animals subjected to normal lighting conditions. In the adult offspring, the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity was not affected. These findings suggested that ELC affect mother-infant interactions and subsequently at least partially alter the neurobehavioral development of offspring. © The Authors (2007).

AB  - Reducing the dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) has been shown to be an effective means of preventing parturient paresis in confinement systems where cows are offered a total mixed ration containing DCAD-reducing mineral compounds (anionic salts). Such a supplementation strategy is not possible in cows being group fed forages precalving, and little is known about the effect of supplementing these cows with large amounts of anionic salts twice daily. Eight non-lactating, pregnant Holstein-Friesian cows were allocated to two levels of DCAD (-20 and +18 meq/100 g DM) for 24 d, with an intensive Ca balance undertaken in metabolism stalls following a 2-week acclimatization to diet. The basal diet was 3 kg DM of crushed barley and 7 kg DM of pasture-hay. Urine and faeces were collected separately, weighed daily for 5 d and analysed for Ca content. Urinary Ca, creatinine and hydroxyproline concentration and plasma Ca concentration were determined during the period of the balance study. The diurnal pattern in urine and rumen pH was determined over 2 d. Decreasing DCAD reduced (P<0.001) the pH of urine, and increased (P<0.05) Ca absorption. Plasma Ca concentration was not affected by DCAD, and DCAD did not affect the output of urinary hydroxyproline, a marker of bone resorption. Twice-daily supplementation of anionic salts was sufficient to reduce the pH of blood and increase gastrointestinal Ca absorption. There was no diurnal variation in the pH of urine, suggesting that time of sampling to determine efficacy of DCAD in reducing systemic pH was not important. © Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research 2006.

AB  - Pregnant women (N = 253) were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 22.3 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 83) and non-depressed groups based on a SCID diagnosis of depression. They were then given self-report measures on sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety and anger, and their urine was assayed for norepinephrine and cortisol. These measures were repeated during their third trimester (M = 32.4 weeks). Their newborns were then observed during sleep. During both the second and third trimesters, the depressed women had more sleep disturbances and higher depression, anxiety and anger scores. They also had higher norepinephrine and cortisol levels. The newborns of the depressed mothers also had more sleep disturbances including less time in deep sleep and more time in indeterminate (disorganized) sleep, and they were more active and cried/fussed more. © 2006.

AB  - Sleep quality is integral to optimal physical functioning and mental health during pregnancy. There has, however, been little work conducted to determine the most appropriate measure of sleep quality in this clinical group, a surprising observation given the complex and dynamic psychobiology of pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.

AB  - Background: Longitudinal studies of sleep during normal pregnancy and post-partum are rare, and interpretation of the findings is often hampered by methodological issues. Consequentially, there is still limited information on what constitutes normal sleep quality and quantity across pregnancy and early post-partum, for both nulliparous and multiparous women. Aims: To quantify the change and variability in sleep duration and quality across pregnancy and post-partum for healthy nulliparous and multiparous women. Methods: Nineteen women (eight nulliparous and 11 multiparous) wore an actigraph and completed a sleep diary to objectively measure sleep for seven nights during the second trimester, one week prior to delivery, and at one and six weeks post-partum. Mixed model analysis of variance and logistic regression were used to investigate changes in sleep across this timeframe. Results: The largest changes in sleep occurred in the first week post-partum (1.5 h less sleep than during pregnancy, three times more sleep episodes in 24 h, 70% of women regularly napping during the day, and greatest day-to-day variability in sleep). Compared to multiparas, nulliparas generally had less efficient sleep, spent more time in bed and had greater wake after sleep onset in the second trimester, and spent less time in bed and had fewer sleep episodes a day at one week post-partum. Conclusions: These changes should be used to inform women about the extent of change in sleep, particularly early post-partum, and to help health-care providers identify women experiencing severe sleep loss and disruption and discuss possible coping strategies with them. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

AB  - Maternal pregravid obesity is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes during pregnancy. In early pregnancy there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. In later gestation maternal metabolic manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, become clinically recognized because of the increased insulin resistance in obese compared with nonobese women. In women with pregestational glucose intolerance, hypertension, central obesity, and lipid disorders, the physiologic changes in pregnancy increase the risk of problems previously not routinely encountered during pregnancy. These include chronic cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. At parturition the obese patient is at an increased risk of cesarean delivery and associated complications of anesthesia, wound disruption, infection, and deep venous thrombophlebitis. For the fetus there are short-term risks of fetal macrosomia, more specifically obesity, and long-term risks of adolescent components of the metabolic syndrome. Although preliminary results of bariatric surgery are encouraging, the procedure is expensive and not for all obese women, and we recognize that long-term follow-up data on offspring of obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery before pregnancy are lacking. In the interim, we need to encourage obese women to lose weight before conception, using lifestyle changes if possible. During pregnancy, weight gain should be limited to Institute of Medicine guidelines (currently under review) and encouragement given for physical activity. © 2007 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of back pain and treatment satisfaction in a population of low-socioeconomic pregnant women. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design to determine the prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy for 599 women. Women completed an author-generated musculoskeletal survey in the second trimester of their pregnancy that addressed pain history, duration, location, and intensity, as well as activities of daily living, treatment frequency, and satisfaction with treatment. Results: Sixty-seven percent of the total population reported musculoskeletal pain, and nearly half presented with a multi-focal pattern of pain that involved 2 or more sites. Twenty-one percent reported severe pain intensity rated on a numerical rating scale. Eighty percent of women experiencing pain slept less than 4 hours per night and 75% of these women took pain medications. Importantly, 85% of the women surveyed perceived that they had not been offered treatment for their musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion: Multi-focal musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy was prevalent in this underserved patient population. The pain in this population negatively affected sleep and treatment appeared inadequate. © 2007.

AB  - The premature infant is at increased risk of cerebral white matter injury. Melatonin is neuroprotective in adult models of focal cerebral ischemia and attenuates ibotenate-induced white matter cysts in neonatal mice. Clinically, melatonin has been used to treat sleep disorders in children without major side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin in the immature brain following intrauterine asphyxia. Fetal sheep at 90 d of gestation were subjected to umbilical cord occlusion. Melatonin (20 mg/kg, n = 9) or vehicle (n = 10) was administered IV to the fetus, starting 10 min after the start of reperfusion and continued for 6 h. Melatonin treatment resulted in a slower recovery of fetal blood pressure following umbilical cord occlusion, but without changes in fetal heart rate, acid base status or mortality. The production of 8-isoprostanes following umbilical cord occlusion was attenuated and there was a reduction in the number of activated microglia cells and TUNEL-positive cells in melatonin treated fetuses, suggesting a protective effect of melatonin. In conclusion, this study shows that melatonin attenuates cell death in the fetal brain in association with a reduced inflammatory response in the blood and the brain following intrauterine asphyxia in mid-gestation fetal sheep. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007.

AB  - Objective: To assess the safety of chloroquine (CQ) as prophylaxis against Plasmodium vivax infection during pregnancy. Method: One thousand pregnant Karen women were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine (500 mg phosphate (or 300 mg base) weekly). Women received a median (range) chloroquine phosphate total dose of 9500 (1500-17 500) mg. The mothers were actively followed from inclusion to delivery and their infants until 12 months of age. Results: Chloroquine prophylaxis completely prevented P. vivax episodes; 10.1% (95%CI: 7.3-14.5) of women in the placebo group experienced at least one episode of vivax malaria but no episode occurred in women in the CQ group. By contrast, the numbers of P. falciparum episodes were similar in each group: 7.4% (95%CI: 3.7-11.1) and 5.6% (95%CI: 3.3-7.9) in the placebo and CQ groups respectively (P = 0.56). Chloroquine prophylaxis was well tolerated and there was no difference in the proportions of reported side effects between CQ treated and placebo groups except for the duration of palpitations and sleeping disorders which were more frequent in those who had received CQ. Chloroquine prophylaxis had no impact on maternal anaemia, birth weight, gestational age, development of newborns or on growth, neurological development or visual acuity in infants at 1 year of age. Conclusion: Chloroquine is safe and effective as prophylaxis against P. vivax during pregnancy in this population. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We investigated the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) on heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in the presence of orthostatic stress among near- and full-term neonates. PCE infants (n = 21) and controls (n = 23) were enrolled within 120 h of birth. ECG was recorded for an hour during quiet sleep, 30 min in supine position and then 30 min in an inclined position. Linear mixed models were used to analyze HR and HRV in the time domain and wavelet and power spectrum analyses in the frequency domain. PCE infants had tachycardia both before (p = 0.091) and after tilting (p = 0.015), but with a clear interaction between PCE and orthostatic stress (p = 0.049). Compared with controls, PCE infants had a delayed and prolonged reaction to orthostatic stress. There was also a pronounced interaction with regard to log-transformed SDDRR, a measure of HRV (p = 0.049). Controls experienced an instantaneous increase in log (SDDRR) followed by a prompt return to normal levels, while PCE infants had a gradual increase that did not dissipate quickly. Frequency-domain analyses also distinguished between the cocaine-exposed infants and the controls. Results suggest that the effects of PCE on the development of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems could lead to altered cardiovascular function. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007.

AB  - The cardiovascular risk associated with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has recently attracted much interest. Women with PCOS are more likely to fulfill the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, a cluster of related cardiometabolic factors known to predict longterm risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. We review the literature pertaining to the link between the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and PCOS. We focus on the influence of obesity and hyperandrogenemia, and on strategies for identifying cardiovascular risk in PCOS. Copyright © 2007 by Current Medicine Group LLC.

AB  - This article reviews the evidence for the current UK Department of Health recommendations for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and suggests other factors that should be considered. The wording of the Department of Health recommendations for SIDS prevention has changed over the past 6 years, but the specific recommendations are largely consistent with the scientific evidence. The emphasis on thermal and illness factors and immunisation could be reduced. Bed sharing and sharing the parental bedroom should be given more emphasis. Two major recommendations need to be discussed in greater detail: (1) breast feeding and (2) pacifier use. Meta-analyses or reviews looking at each risk factor or a combination or risk factors are required. Further, it is recommended that a committee is established that reviews the recommendations and publishes the evidence that leads to these recommendations, as is done by the American Academy of Pediatrics Taskforce on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

AB  - Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone are potent agonists at the GABA A receptor and suppress the fetal CNS activity. These steroids are synthesized in the fetal brain either from cholesterol or from circulating precursors derived from the placenta. The concentrations of allopregnanolone are remarkably high in the fetal brain and rise further in response to acute hypoxic stress, induced by constriction of the umbilical cord. This response may result from the increased 5α-reductase and cytochrome P-450SCC expression in the brain. These observations suggest that the rise in neurosteroid concentrations in response to acute hypoxia may represent an endogenous protective mechanism that reduces excitotoxicity following hypoxic stress in the developing brain. In contrast to acute stress, chronic hypoxemia induces neurosteroidogenic enzyme expression without an increase in neurosteroid concentrations and, therefore, may pose a greater risk to the fetus. At birth, the allopregnanolone concentrations in the brain fall markedly, probably due to the loss of placental precursors; however, stressors, including hypoxia and endotoxin-induced inflammation, raise allopregnanolone concentrations in the newborn brain. This may protect the newborn brain from hypoxia-induced damage. However, the rise in allopregnanolone concentrations was also associated with increased sleep. This rise in sedative steroid levels may depress arousal and contribute to the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Our recent findings indicate that acute hypoxic stress in pregnancy initiates a neurosteroid response that may protect the fetal brain from hypoxia-induced cell death, whereas the decline in allopregnanolone levels after birth may result in greater vulnerability to brain injury in neonates.

AB  - It is important to consider the potential contribution of seasonality to postpartum depression (PPD; Hiltunen et al, 2004). A possible link between seasonality and PPD may have implications for not only choice of treatment, but also in considering pregnancy planning. The objectives of this pilot study were to examine whether women with seasonal mood changes demonstrated greater incidence of PPD, and to determine if seasonality scores were predictive of PPD. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ; Rosenthal et al, 1987) was used to assess seasonality of mood. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between clinical factors, SAD diagnosis, SPAQ global seasonality score (GSS) and season of SPAQ administration and PPD. In our sample, twice as many women in the PPD group were found to have SAD compared to the control group. The PPD group also had a higher group GSS mean (10.44) than did the control group (8.84). However, logistic regression analysis showed that higher seasonality scores in women with PPD were not necessarily predictive of PPD. While more women in the PPD group reported increased seasonal weight fluctuation and less sleep in the spring and summer, these items alone did not predict depression after childbirth. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The steroid cortisol is an extensively studied and important variable in developmental and other behavioral studies. Cortisol has been assayed by various methods using a range of substrates including blood, saliva, and urine. Cortisol in blood exists in two forms. While most is bound to carrier proteins, a small portion exists in a soluble free form. The informed choice of cortisol fraction and measurement method is critical for research. Such choices should be influenced by understanding the characteristics of the various cortisol fractions, along with their binding proteins' biological functions and relationship to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The goal of this paper is to familiarize researchers with key points for evaluating the choice of total and free cortisol in research as well reviewing various options for measuring free cortisol. These points are raised with special emphasis on their significance during pregnancy and the post-partum. Such information may prove useful in informing researcher's cortisol-related protocols and in the interpretation of cortisol data. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Obesity is a multifactorial disease of epidemic and global proportions that poses the most significant threat to the health of our younger generations. Those who are the most extremely affected bear the largest burden of health problems. In the US, extreme obesity affects approximately 9 million adults and 2 million children, and is associated with both immediate health problems and later health risk, including premature mortality. Present medical and behavioral interventions for extreme obesity in adults and children rarely result in the significant, durable weight loss necessary to improve health outcomes, prompting a search for more aggressive measures. Weight loss (bariatric) surgery has been advocated as an intervention for those with extreme obesity. In adults, bariatric surgery results in prolonged weight control and improvement in serious obesity comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemias, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. A surge in weight loss operations for adolescents has been observed recently, with a threefold increase in case volumes nationwide from 2000 to 2003. Current evidence suggests that after bariatric surgery, adolescents lose significant weight and serious obesity-related medical conditions and psychosocial status are improved. Thus it is reasonable to propose that bariatric surgery performed in the adolescent period may be more effective treatment for childhood-onset extreme obesity than delaying surgery for extremely obese youth until adulthood. This position has been echoed by a number of groups and an independent systematic review. Finally, it is conceivable that bariatric surgery performed in adulthood for childhood onset extreme obesity may not be as effective for comorbidity treatment as surgery performed earlier during adolescence. The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence, which supports early rather than later use of bariatric surgery in the treatment of extreme obesity, and to present this information in light of the medical and surgical risks of bariatric surgery. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

AB  - Pineal melatonin regulates circadian rhythms and influences sleep. Melatonin also has protective actions against tissue damage from free-radicals and other toxins. Evidence is presented that this indoleamine is involved in pre- and postnatal brain (and ocular) development and intrauterine growth. In the absence of maternal melatonin, short gestation infants have a prolonged period of melatonin deficiency. Melatonin supplementation, which has a benign safety profile, may help reduce complications in the neonatal period that are associated with short gestation. We believe that this treatment might result in a wide range of health benefits, improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells employ the photopigment melanopsin and provide light information to brain areas responsible for the regulation of circadian rhythms. The expression of melanopsin is regulated by environmental illumination, but it remains to be clarified whether the rods and cones are involved. Here, we examined the influence of 5 days of constant light and dark conditions on melanopsin mRNA and protein expression in newborn albino rats, in which functional rods and cones have not yet been developed. We found that the melanopsin mRNA level was unaffected, whereas the melanopsin protein level was more than two-fold higher in the darkness-adapted group than in pups raised in constant light. In pups raised during 12:12 h light/dark cycles, the melanopsin protein level was significantly higher during the day than at night. Our findings indicate that melanopsin protein changes are independent of input from the rods and cones. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Background: An association has been proposed between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders. Ambulatory blood pressure and carotid artery elasticity were therefore prospectively investigated in matched PCOS and control pregnancies. Methods: Twenty two PCOS-control subject pairs with singleton pregnancies, matched for age, body mass index, parity and ethnicity, were recruited in the first trimester (T1, 11-13 weeks). Ambulatory blood pressure recording for 24 h and carotid artery ultrasound for elasticity estimation were performed in T1 and in the second (T2, 22-24 weeks) and third (T3, 32-34 weeks) trimesters. Results: At nearly all time points during gestation, ambulatory systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were elevated in PCOS versus control pregnancies. Carotid artery stiffness index was greater and compliance was less in PCOS pregnancies compared with controls. Differences in night-time systolic pressure and carotid artery elasticity were greatest in T3. PCOS also increased the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension (6 of 22 cases versus 0 of 22 in controls; P = 0.011). Conclusions: Pregnant women with PCOS have higher baseline ambulatory blood pressure and impaired arterial elasticity, suggestive of disturbed vascular adaptation to pregnancy. © The Author 2007.

AB  - A thorough presentation of the influence of thyroliberin (TRH) on vasopressin and oxytocin release from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system is presented. Thyroliberin affects in different ways both neurohormone secretion in females during lactation according to the water-electrolyte metabolism in the course of the circadian rhythm of vasopressin and oxytocin release as well as during in vitro incubation of isolated neurointermediate lobe or hypothalamo-neurohypohysial explants. The results showed that: TRH acts as a stimulator of oxytocin release into the blood by equilibrated water-electrolyte metabolism, TRH acts in the central nervous system as an inhibitory neuromodulator of vasopressin and oxytocin release from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system under in vitro conditions, by osmotic stimulation, as well as in females during lactation, TRH inhibits AVP release in acute bleeding-provoked hypovolemia and alters the circadian rhythm of vasopressin and oxytocin release. It is assumed that this neuropeptide can interact with the mechanisms engaged in vasopressin and oxytocin release and can disturb these mechanisms, especially under conditions of augmented demand of the organism for these neurohormones.

AB  - Cortisol is used in research as a biomarker of psychological stress. Logistical considerations argue for collecting as few samples as possible, balanced against diurnal rhythms and intra-individual variations. 100 pregnant women gave five saliva samples a day for 3 days, at waking, 30 min after waking, and 11:00 a.m., 5:00 p.m., and 9:00 p.m. Timing of collection was confirmed by monitors. Another sample was taken during a clinic visit. Using the 15 measures as the gold standard, correlations and mean area under the curve (AUC) were compared with subsets and the single clinic sample to evaluate alternate collection protocols. Five samples in 1 day, or protocols involving morning and night samples, had the highest correlations with mean AUC (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.82 to 0.88). Standardizing the clinic measurement to a single time of day did not substantially improve correlations with mean AUC. Correlations with measures of reported stress were also not strong. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is evidence from several prospective studies that stress during pregnancy can affect the behavioural, emotional and cognitive development of the fetus and the child. Animal models suggest that this may be mediated via the HPA axis. Interventions to reduce stress in pregnant women are now a priority. Large prospective studies are providing increasing independent evidence that maternal stress/anxiety during pregnancy can affect fetal brain development, having adverse effects on the child's emotional, behavioural and cognitive development. It is suggested that the function of fetal programming is linked with a predictive adaptive response. Environmental influences on the mother are preparing the child in her womb for the external environment it is likely to inhabit. This is different from the genetic changes and mutations which will be effective for many generations. These affect circadian rhythm including sleep habit, and other aspects including laterality and sexuality. Their seriousness is now well enough established to feature in an American Child Health strategic plan 2005-10. Animal studies have provided a basis for human studies.. Antenatal maternal stress in rats leads to anxiety in the offspring. It can alter laterality - right-handedness etc - and sexuality, and disrupt the circadian rhythm including sleep pattern. Prenatal stress reduces the animal's later negative feedback, the calming effect of cortisol, by reducing the cortisol receptors in the hippocampus. In monkeys likewise, maternal prenatal stress leaves the offspring with a lower attention span and more anxiety. There are greater cortisol responses, and imaging also reveals more dopamine receptors to be affected by that stress neurotransmitter. So there is objective evidence of mammalian prenatal stress effects on offspring. In a group of anxious mothers, a simple arithmetic exercise met with a rise in fetal heart-beat, showing that maternal stress clearly affects the fetus. Dr Glover's human research has made use of the ALSPAC community study program. The strongest effects discerned of maternal prenatal stress on the offspring were on behavioural and emotional problems.. The strength of effect was stronger from stress at 32 weeks prenatally than 18 weeks, and resulted in double the levels of the offspring's hyperactivity, and emotional and conduct disorders. The children of anxious mothers in late pregnancy had high waking level of cortisol. In a separate study her group has shown that prenatal stress can affect the child's cognitive development also. In this study it was stress due to relationship problems with the partner, particularly emotional cruelty and separation, which had the largest effect on the child. Studies show that stress acts on the hypothalamus to produce corticotrophin releasing hormone, which in turn acts on the pituitary gland to produce adreno-corticotrophic hormone. This stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete cortisol for negative feedback to the hippocampus to stabilise the system. Yet both maternal and fetal cortisol are a positive stimulus on placental CRH. These results suggest the importance of detecting and treating affective disorder and relationship stress during pregnancy, both for the direct benefit to the mother herself, and particularly to help reduce later development of behavioural and other problems in children. © 2007 A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - Maternal adversity is associated with long-lasting consequences on cognitive development, behavior and physiological responses in rat offspring. Few studies have examined whether repeated maternal stress produces repeated activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in mothers and whether it modifies maternal behavior. Here, we tested a novel model of perinatal stress using repeated exposure to "purely" psychological stressors throughout the gestation and lactation periods in rats. We first tested the diurnal influences of repeated 1-h strobe light exposure on maternal corticosterone secretion. Despite the hyporesponsiveness to stress documented in late pregnant and lactating mothers, we observed an enhanced response to strobe light in the afternoon compared to the morning in stressed mothers during lactation. Next, dams were exposed to 24-h forced foraging followed by 10-h wet bedding during the diurnal peak of corticosterone secretion. Although no corticosterone responses to forced foraging and wet bedding were observed, the combination of both stressors had a significant effect on maternal behavior. Mother-pup interactions were significantly altered during the first 8 days of lactation. Taken together, these findings suggest that lactating mothers maintain responsiveness to specific and repeated psychological stressors, in particular at the time of the diurnal peak in corticosterone secretion. Depending on the stressor applied, either neuroendocrine activation or changes in maternal behavior might be important determinants of the long-term consequences in the offspring. The combination of forced foraging, wet bedding and strobe light might represent a novel model of mild maternal adversity using "purely" psychological stressors. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Explanations for the chemosensory abilities of newborn mammals focus primarily on food (milk) acquisition and communication (e.g., maternal-infant bonding). However, the relative importance of the main and accessory (vomeronasal) olfactory systems is hypothesized to differ at birth between altricial and precocial mammals. Strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorises) possess main and accessory olfactory systems, and vary in life-history traits related to infant dependency and maturation. Accordingly, this study examines the size and maturational characteristics of vomeronasal (VNNE) and olfactory (OE) neuroepithelia in strepsirrhines. Serially sectioned heads of 18 infant cadavers were examined microscopically for neuroepithelial distribution. Measurements were taken on the length of the nasal fossa on one side that was occupied by VNNE and OE. The data were corrected for body size using the cranial length or body mass, and were then examined for correlation with several life-history variables, as well as activity pattern. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to identify cells in the VNNE and OE that express olfactory marker protein (OMP), a marker of mature olfactory neurons. Relative OE extent was not significantly correlated with any of the life-history variables. Relative VNNE length was negatively correlated with relative gestation length and relative neonatal mass (P < 0.05). However, when we corrected for phylogenetic relationships, we found no significant correlations between either of the neuroepithelial measurements and life-history variables. Immunohistochemical findings suggest that OE has more OMP-reactive cells than VNNE in all species. OMP-reactive cells appear to be less numerous in diurnal species compared to most nocturnal species. These results indicate that the VNNE may be relatively longer at birth in altricial species. However, it remains uncertain how phylogeny and/or ontogeny may explain these findings. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are specialized cells in smooth muscle organs that generate and propagate pacemaker activity, receive inputs from motor neurons, and serve as mechanosensors. In the gastrointestinal tract, development and maintenance of the ICC phenotype have been linked to intracellular signaling via Kit, but its role in development of ICC during embryogenesis is controversial. Here we have studied the development of functional ICC-MY during the late gestational period in mice. Blocking Kit with a neutralizing antibody before and after development of spontaneous electrical activity (E17 to P0) caused loss of ICC-MY networks and pacemaker activity. ICC-MY and pacemaker activity developed normally in W/+ and WV/+ heterozygotes, but failed to develop between E17 to P0 in W/WV embryos with compromised Kit function. Muscles treated with Kit neutralizing antibody or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (STI571), from E17-P0 for 3 days caused loss of functionally developed ICC-MY networks, but ICC-MY and pacemaker activity recovered within 9 days after discontinuing treatment with neutralizing antibody or imatinib mesylate. These data suggest that Kit signaling is an important factor in lineage decision and in the development of functional ICC in late gestation. ICC-MY demonstrate significant plasticity in gastrointestinal tissues. Manipulation of the ICC phenotype might provide useful therapies in gastrointestinal disease where the Kit-positive cell population is either lost or amplified. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The prevalence of secondary hypertension can be underestimated if appropriate tests are not performed. The importance of selecting patients with a high pre-test probability of secondary forms of hypertension is first discussed. The laboratory tests currently used for seeking a cause of hypertension are critically reviewed, with emphasis on their operative features and limitations. Strategies to identify primary aldosteronism, the most frequent form of secondary hypertension, and to determine its unilateral or bilateral causes are described. Treatment entails adrenalectomy in unilateral forms, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in bilateral forms. Renovascular hypertension is also a common, curable form of hypertension, that should be identified as early as possible to avoid the onset of cardiovascular target organ damage. The tests for its confirmation or exclusion are discussed. The various tests available for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which is much rarer than the above but extremely important to identify, are also described, with emphasis on recent developments in genetic testing. Finally, the tests for diagnosing some rarer monogenic forms and other renal and endocrine causes of arterial hypertension are explored. Copyright © 2007 Informa Healthcare.

AB  - Early life events and childhood infections have been associated with the development and onset of inflammatory bowel disease in adulthood. However, the consequences of neonatal infection in the development and severity of colitis are not established. We investigated the effects of a neonatal (postnatal day 14) or juvenile (postnatal day 28) immune challenge with LPS on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced damage and weight loss, as well as on food intake and body temperature in adult rats. Neonatally (n)LPS-treated rats developed more severe colitis than control animals, reflected in a greater loss of weight and a significantly increased macroscopic tissue damage score. These findings were associated with a hypothermic response after TNBS treatment in nLPS rats, but not in neonatally saline-treated rats receiving TNBS. These differences were not seen after TNBS in rats that had received LPS on postnatal day 28. Plasma corticosterone was measured as an index of adult hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation as was TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Four days after TNBS treatment, plasma corticosterone was unaltered in all groups; however, TNF-α was significantly increased in adult TNBS-treated rats that had LPS as neonates compared with all other groups. In conclusion, neonatal, but not later, exposure to LPS produces long-term exacerbations in the development of colitis in adults. This change is independent of HPA axis activation 4 days after TNBS treatment but is associated with increased circulating TNF-α, suggestive of an exaggerated immune response in adults exposed to neonatal infection.

AB  - Background. During the course of pregnancy, the mother's sleep changes both quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific patterns can be identified but very little is known about sleep and sleep disorders during pregnancy. Objectives. (1) We wanted to obtain a quantitative and qualitative description of sleep during pregnancy where sleep patterns appear to be particularly perturbed, basing our study on interrogations of women more than six month pregnant. (2) We wanted to identify the most obvious causes of sleep disorders and their impact on the mother's perception of pregnancy. (3) We also wanted to ascertain the usual management for sleep disorders and propose possible adjustments to meet the patient's demands. Material and methods. A prospective questionnaire was proposed from July to September 2005 to 150 women (93 outpatients and 57 inpatients) attending the Paule-de-Viguier University Hospital in Toulouse. Data collected were compared with using univariate analysis (Fisher exact test or chi-square test as appropriate). Data were processed with EpiInfo. Results. Decreased quantity and quality was a characteristic feature of sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy. Sleep was perturbed most in women aged over 30 years and with multiple pregnancy. Parity, hospitalization, drug treatments did not affect sleep significantly. Several causes were identified. Women described the physical and psychological problems caused by the lack of sleep as very important. The question of sleep was not often discussed at medical consultations, except perhaps during hospitalization. Many women complained about their sleep. The solutions proposed did not fulfill the patients desires. Women set up rituals to favor sleep, especially during hospitalization. Conclusion. Sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy is decreased in quality and quantity towards the end of pregnancy. Hospitalization does not necessarily favor worse sleep. Taking into account the patient's sleep pattern at the end of pregnancy, in order to favor the delivery prognosis, and the quality of the mother-infant relationship, is an important element for patient follow-up and hospital management practices. Listening to the patient's desires and small gestures to help sleep, provided by midwives and the entire medical team, should be proposed before medications. © 2007. Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objective: To describe a case of early pregnancy failure in a patient who was not an optimal candidate for suction aspiration because of her body habitus and history of a myocardial infarction that was treated medically with misoprostol. Design: Case report. Setting: Academic tertiary-care hospital. Patient: A 43-year-old woman with morbid obesity, coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, obstructive sleep apnea, and other medical problems who presented with an early pregnancy failure. Intervention: Medical management with 800 μg of vaginal misoprostol in an inpatient setting with cardiac monitoring. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ultrasonographic resolution of intrauterine pregnancy, vaginal bleeding, and cardiac events. Result(s): No gestational sac was visualized by ultrasound on the second hospital day, the patient's hemoglobin value at discharge was 12.1 mg/dL, and no adverse cardiac events occurred. Conclusion(s): Medical management with misoprostol on an inpatient basis is a possible alternative to dilation and curettage in patients with complex medical problems and early pregnancy failure. © 2007 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Pregnant women who lie in a supine position may develop syncopal symptoms. However, of those women who become symptomatic, only 2% to 4% have significant aortocaval compression. Even in this small minority of symptomatic women, there is no evidence of fetal compromise. The advice often given to pregnant women to lie on the left side is therefore not relevant. In some women, experiencing a pre-syncopal episode will cause them to avoid lying in the supine position. © 2007 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - Objective: To identify and quantify frontal sharp transients found in neonatal polysomnography of healthy full term newborns in each stage of the sleep-wake cycle within the first 48 hours of life. Method: The EEG from healthy term 32 newborns, legal age of two days and with adequate monitoring during pregnancy. Frontal sharp transients (FST) were quantified, according to synchronous or asynchronous, in each stage of the sleep-wake cycle. The results were compared by Kruskal-Wallis-test . Results: FST were counted individually in each sleep phase, being present during quiet sleep (QS) in all tracings. FST bilateral and synchronous and lateralized FST were more frequent during QS (p<0.05). Conclusion: Lateralized FST were found mostly during quiet sleep. FST asynchronous in healthy full term newborns were normal and depended of FST density. FST unilateral appearance should not necessarily be considered abnormal as well.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and REM sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, with the greatest decrease occurring at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 150 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, three times per day, from day E14 until parturition, and the pups allowed to mature. We analyzed (a) intrinsic membrane properties of PPN neurons in slices from pups aged 12-21 days, and (b) the sleep state-dependent P13 auditory evoked potential, which is generated by PPN outputs, in animals allowed to age to adolescence. We found significant changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of PPN cells in prenatally exposed animals compared to intact ones, rendering these cells more excitable. In addition, we found disturbances in the habituation to repetitive stimulation in adolescent, freely moving animals, suggestive of a deficit in the process of sensory gating. These findings could explain some of the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The health of future generations, both physical and psychological, depends upon good parental and early environment, free particularly from malnutrition, toxins and undue stress. Education about these negative influences is urgent, especially to encourage childbearing women in a healthy diet and lifestyle. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking in pregnancy have been known since the 1970s, yet in Germany, for example, 60% of all children are conceived, carried, born into a household where at least one adult smokes. Even if the father desists from smoking at home, the nicotine in his body tissues is transmitted to anyone near him, for example his wife when they sleep near each other. More than one glass of beer, wine or spirits per week during the pregnancy can be detected at birth. Alcohol in early in the pregnancy - just when many mothers are unaware they are pregnant - can produce significant physical malformation, especially in the face. Prenatal exposure to alcohol has significant effects on the intelligence and behaviour of the child. Many of these children are very restless. Even slight amounts of poisoning during the pregnancy are related to the development of a negative self-image and the compensatory behaviour of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in later life. The Prenatal Deprivation and Poisoning Syndromes have not only been related to heart disease and eating disorders in the area of general health but also in the area of psychological health to the Borderline Personality Disorder. Undue stress of any kind during the pregnancy leads to problems for the developing child. © 2007 A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - Any plans for pregnancy must be discussed in detail with women with bipolar disorders. They must be informed about the risks related to it and the need for some precautions. Because of the risk of relapse during pregnancy, the risk/benefit ratio of maintaining or starting prophylactic treatment should be assessed, taking into account family history and frequency of recurrences. Lithium may be used during pregnancy under close monitoring. Most anticonvulsants are contraindicated because of their teratogenicity. During the post-partum period, prophylaxis is required in most cases because of the high risk of relapse. If no prophylaxis was given during pregnancy, it must be started quickly after delivery to be effective when the risk is at its highest, i.e., during the first two weeks after delivery. Women with bipolar disorders should be advised against breast-feeding to avoid exposure of the infant to psychotropic medication. Because breast-feeding can be stressful and causes sleep deprivation, it may increase the risk of relapse. Second-generation antipsychotic agents should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding because inadequate information is currently available about their safety. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Conventional wisdom teaches that chronic headaches typically improve and often abate during pregnancy, leading many clinicians to take a wait-and-see approach of delaying treatment in hopes of seeing spontaneous improvement. Although headaches do improve in later pregnancy for up to 50% of chronic headache sufferers, headaches persist and may even worsen for the remainder. Clinicians must recognize that treating headache during pregnancy is important in order to limit excessive use of over-the-counter pain remedies, dehydration, and pain-related disability. Safe and effective medication and nonmedication treatment options are available for the pregnant headache sufferer, including both acute care and preventive therapies. Care of the pregnant headache patient should begin before she is known to be pregnant, when the fertile female is initially established as a patient. Preconception planning should include modification of medication regimes to include medications safe for use during early pregnancy, when the woman may not yet realize she is pregnant, and effective nonmedication therapies, such as relaxation, biofeedback, and lifestyle modification.

AB  - Vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control in hazardous situations is important. Our hypothesis is that the prerequisite for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is impaired vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control. Prematurity is a risk factor for SIDS, and postnatal intermittent hypoxia may contribute to this risk. We studied heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses in 10 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who were born at 27 ± 2.4 (2330) wk of gestation. Twenty healthy term infants served as controls. Cardiovascular tests were performed under polysomnographic control during slow-wave sleep (SWS) at a corrected age of 12 ± 3.5 (719) wk. Control infants showed biphasic HR and BP responses to side motion with an immediate increase followed by a modest decrease and return to baseline. Compared with the controls, half of the BPD infants had altered BP responses (p“ 0.005) without an early increase, followed by a more prominent decrease in BP. BPD infants also presented with a greater variability in BP responses to head-up tilts than did the controls (p“ 0.001). In conclusion, these findings suggest that some BPD infants have impaired vestibular sympathoreflexmediated cardiovascular control. This dysfunction may become critical in life-threatening situations.

AB  - Objective: To assess the profile of metabolic abnormalities in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients and methods: In a case-control study conducted in two years, from April 2003 to March 2005, data obtained from polysomnography study, lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, serum insulin, insulin resistance, leptin and adiponectin levels, were compared between the various groups. Included in the study were OSA subjects from a sleep laboratory and matched controls from the community. Those with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV heart failure, pregnancy, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, or who were on treatment for hyperthyroidism, on systemic steroid treatment, or on hormonal replacement therapy, were excluded from the study. Results: Forty apneic obese subjects (AHI = 32.19, range 13-52.75) were compared with 40 non-apneic obese controls (AHI = 1.3, range 0-2.45) and 40 normal weight control subjects (AHI = 0.7, range 0-1). No significant difference was noted in levels of fasting blood sugar, insulin resistance (obese apneics 61.9, obese controls 47.8, non-obese controls 19.1), leptin (obese apneics 10.65 μg/L, obese controls 8.52 μg/L, non-obese controls 2.83 μg/L) or adiponectin (obese apneics 4959.3 ng/ml, obese controls 5706 ng/ml, non-obese controls 7412 ng/ml) in the OSA group compared to obese controls. Conclusions: OSA has no independent association with lipid abnormalities, insulin resistance, serum leptin and adiponectin levels. In multivariate analysis, obesity was the major determinant of metabolic abnormalities in this cohort. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterised by a complaint of an almost irresistible urge to move the legs. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. In doubtful cases, neurophysiological examinations, such as polysomnography and/or a suggested immobilisation test, can be performed to confirm a clinical suspicion of RLS. Several other conditions may present sensorimotor complaints with features similar to RLS; a careful sleep history is required to avoid a misdiagnosis. Three different scales have been validated to assess the severity of RLS. In the general population, RLS prevalence ranges from 0.1% to 11.5%, with a high number of patients affected by a primary form of the sleep disturbance (70%-80%). However, several clinical conditions have been associated with RLS, such as iron deficiency, uraemia, pregnancy and polyneuropathy. Furthermore, recent studies show that RLS may be associated also to type 2 diabetes mellitus and to multiple sclerosis. RLS has a negative impact on sleep, cognitive functions, quality of life and mental status. Higher awareness of RLS among physicians is required; it remains an underdiagnosed clinical condition. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2007.

AB  - The phytoterapic Sonotabs® composed by dry extracts of Passiflora incarnata ("maracuja"), Salix alba ("salgueiro") and Crataegus oxycantha ("crataegus") was investigated from the potential of toxicological effects when orally administered during all the pregnancy to Wistar rats, ten times the prescribed dosage to humans. The gestational, fetal and post-natal effects were evaluated. The phytoterapic efficacy was investigated by measuring both locomotor and exploratory activity in male rats, after the oral administration of the human prescribed dose, in open-field study and barbituric (sodium pentobarbital) sleeping time. The results indicated that the phytoterapic, in the tested doses and treatment duration, didn't cause any adverse effect in pregnant rats nor in the fertility. The litter size and post-natal development were not adversely affected. The efficacy evaluation shows significant reduction in ambulatory activity (34,6%) and exploratory activity (34,5%) in the phytoterapic treated group. The sleeping time induced by sodium pentobarbital was significantly increased (20%). The results indicate the efficacy of the phytoterapic as sedative and/or hypnotic.

AB  - Background: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience back pain and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating back and pelvic pain in pregnancy. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group's Trials Register (February 2006). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of back or pelvic pain in pregnancy. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results: We found no studies dealing specifically with prevention of back or pelvic pain. We included eight studies (1305 participants) that examined the effects of adding various pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy, acupuncture and pillows to usual prenatal care. For women with low-back pain, participating in strengthening exercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercises (standardised mean difference (SMD) -5.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.40 to -4.27), and water gymnastics reduced pain intensity and back pain-related sick leave (relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92) better than usual prenatal care alone. The specially-designed Ozzlo pillow was more effective than a regular one in relieving back pain (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55), but is no longer commercially available. Both acupuncture and stabilising exercises relieved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Acupuncture gave more relief from evening pain than exercises. For women with both pelvic and back pain, in one study, acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy in reducing the intensity of their pain; stretching exercises resulted inmore total pain relief (60%) than usual care (11%); and 60% of those who received acupuncture reported less intense pain, compared to 14% of those receiving usual prenatal care. Women who received usual prenatal care reported more use of analgesics, physical modalities and sacroiliac belts. Authors' conclusions: All but one study had moderate to high potential for bias, so results must be viewed cautiously. Adding pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy or acupuncture to usual prenatal care appears to relieve back or pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care alone, although the effects are small. We do not know if they actually prevent pain from starting in the first place. Water gymnastics appear to help women stay at work. Acupuncture shows better results compared to physiotherapy.

AB  - Steinert disease, also known as myotonic dystrophy type 1, is a muscle disease characterized by myotonia and by multiorgan damage that combines various degrees of muscle weakness, arrhythmia and/or cardiac conduction disorders, cataract, endocrine damage, sleep disorders and baldness. It is the most frequent of the adult-onset muscular dystrophies; its prevalence is estimated at 1/20 000 inhabitants. Diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of an abnormality at the 19q13-2 locus, with the use of molecular genetic techniques. Its transmission is autosomal dominant, and anticipation may occur, that is, disease may be more severe and occur earlier in offspring. Genetic counseling is often delicate for this condition because of the great variability of clinical expression, both within and between families. Prenatal diagnosis is proposed especially for maternal transmission because of the severity of the possible neonatal forms. Management ideally includes multidisciplinary annual follow-up. Disease course is usually slowly progressive but rapid deterioration may sometimes be observed. Life expectancy is reduced by the increased mortality associated with the pulmonary and cardiac complications. © 2007.

AB  - About 7% of the population are affected by the restless legs syndrome (RLS). The most invalidating subjective complaints are dysesthesia / pain / an urge to move the legs (46%), an alteration of sleep (38%), and difficulties in performing activities of daily life (7%). The onset of the disease is variable, ranging from childhood (often unrecognised) to old age. The clinical course is generally chronic with phases of spontaneous remission. The cause of RLS is probably mainly genetic with a dysfunction of iron and dopamine metabolism accentuated by peripheral factors (neuropathy, radiculopathy, and temperature). There are secondary forms of RLS, such as iron deficiency (under debate), side effects of drugs (that can be stopped), renal insufficiency, radiculopathy, and neuropathy. RLS can come up during pregnancy, in particular in the last trimenon. Treatment of aggravating factors and sleep hygiene are general measures. Drug treatment of the RLS comprises levodopa, dopaminergic drugs, opioids, and antiepileptic drugs; however, drug treatment is only necessary in about a third of the affected.

AB  - Problems regulating behaviour and emotions in infancy may be a risk factor for the development of psychopathology later in life. Compelling evidence from animal models suggests that one potential pathway to early dysregulation is fetal programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. According to this model, prenatal maternal stress and anxiety during sensitive periods of development can lead to enduring changes in fetal and offspring neurodevelopment and behaviour. While there is emerging evidence from human studies to suggest a link between maternal negative mood states in pregnancy and various cognitive, behavioural, and emotional disturbances in offspring, it is not yet clear whether the programming mechanism demonstrated in animal studies also applies to humans. Few studies have directly assessed HPA axis function in the infants of prenatally stressed women. Research in this area has been constrained by a number of measurement challenges unique to the assessment of cortisol in infants. This paper discusses these challenges with a view to stimulating further research in the area. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The neuroanatomical and neurophysiological development of the embryo and fetus and unique features of the physiological environment of the fetal brain, features which are lost at birth, support recent conclusions that under normal circumstances awareness (or consciousness) is probably not exhibited by the ovine embryo-fetus before birth and that it appears for the first time only after birth. However, there has apparently been no evaluation of whether or not similar mechanisms modulate awareness-related functions in domestic chicks before and after hatching. This comparative review, in seeking to rectify this, arrived at the following conclusions. First, the neural apparatus of both lambs and chicks appears to be too immature to support any states resembling awareness during at least the first half of pregnancy or incubation. Second, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, which evolves subsequently, shows that states of sleep-like unconsciousness are likely to be continuously present in lambs until after birth, and that such states at least predominate in chicks until after hatching. Third, as in fetal lambs, epochs of so-called ‘wakefulness’ previously reported in chick embryos do not seem likely to represent short periods of awareness in ovo. Fourth, several neurosuppressive mechanisms, with some unique features, also operate or have the potential to operate in chicks before hatching, but a dearth of published information currently hinders a full comparison with those demonstrated to operate in fetal lambs. Fifth, contradicting the intuitive perception that vocalisation pre-hatching by the chick indicates the presence of awareness, published evidence suggests that vocalisation before and during hatching occurs mostly during EEG states indicating sleep-like unconsciousness. Sixth, as seems to be the case for newborn lambs after birth, it is possible that demonstrable awareness may appear for the first time only after hatching in chicks, presumably through waning neurosuppression and burgeoning neuroactivation, but such awareness seems to take longer to manifest itself. However, additional research in chicks is recommended to further assess this suggestion. Particular attention should be given to the status of vocal interactions between hen and chick which begin several days before hatching, and to the operation of neurosuppressive and neuroactivating mechanisms throughout the last 40% of incubation and during and after hatching. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities. In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAβ3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAβ3. Study design: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 μg). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAβ3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. Results: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAβ3 in the embryos (P ≤ .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAβ3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. Conclusion: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAβ3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate. © 2007 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To review the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment modalities for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and to discuss the importance of weighing the risks and the benefits of exposing the fetus or baby to maternal mental illness as opposed to exposure to antidepressant medications. Methods: We conducted a literature search of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases. Key words included the following: perinatal, pregnancy, postpartum, depression, anxiety, pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, psychotherapy, and treatment. Results: Recent literature reflects that both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for perinatal women are associated with positive and negative outcomes. No treatment decision was found to be risk-free. The detrimental effects of untreated mental illness on the mother, as well as on the baby, highlight the need for treatment intervention. The long-term effects of exposure to either medications or maternal mental illness are unknown, as yet. Conclusion: Women with perinatal depression and anxiety disorders require timely and efficient management with a goal of providing symptom relief for the suffering mother while simultaneously ensuring the baby's safety. Although knowledge in the area of appropriate intervention is constantly evolving, rigorous and scientifically sound research in the future is critical.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sleep motor disorder that affects up to 10% of the general population. Except for periodic leg movements (PLM), which can be found in the great majority of RLS patients, no objective hematochimic or neurophysiological markers are available to prove the diagnosis, which is based on clinical standard criteria. Nowadays, the aetiopathogenesis of the syndrome is unknown. In a consistent sample of patients affected by the idiopathic form, the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait related to an unidentified locus, while each symptomatic form is probably linked to a specific cause. Although of possible different origins, both the primary and secondary forms may share the same pathogenetic mechanism, which, even if unclear, could be characterised by a neurological dysfunction of the dopaminergic system. Several issues, including strong efficacy of dopamine-agonist treatments, support this theory, which is currently considered the main pathogenetic hypothesis. Most of the past studies tried to clarify the RLS mechanism using the neurophysiological, biochemical and neuroimaging techniques applied to the field of human research. Now the time has come to accept the challenge in creating an animal model of RLS, which may emerge as a decisive step in understanding RLS pathogenesis, and to develop and test new therapies. Even though there have been a few significant efforts, a valid animal model of RLS still does not exist. In past pioneering studies, the authors attempted to induce restless motor behaviour in animals by different strategies: antidopaminergic pharmacological interventions, spinal or cerebral lesions of specific regions involved in the motor control and in dopamine regulation, and selective deletion of genes coding for dopamine receptors. Rodents (mice and rats) were always chosen by the authors as the animals for their experiments. The current tendency in achieving an RLS model is generally represented by simulation of a symptomatic condition of RLS or by a direct interference of the dopaminergic system. In this regard, the pharmacological method had the intention to reproduce the neuroleptic-induced acathisia, the spinal lesional model was based on the hypothesis of myelopathic- related PLM, and the hypothalamic lesion tested the motor consequence of A11 dopaminergic neurons. Preliminary studies are underway to replicate the pregnancy-related form of RLS by using a hormonal intervention, and the iron-deficiency secondary form by using specific iron-free diets. Today, modern technologies are available to easily replicate in animals most of the symptomatic RLS conditions. In addition, more than a few well validated animal models of different diseases known to be related to RLS or PLM, for instance, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and renal failure, could also be exploited in addressing this topic. The real obstacle in achieving an RLS model is the absence of a certain diagnostic marker to recognise if the animal that underwent the different experimental procedures has developed the RLS condition or not. Concerning this issue, possible specific endpoints are represented by the increase in locomotor activity, which are ascertainable by different techniques, such as openfield or run-wheel activity, or by sleep fragmentation, in which the circadian shift can be verified by applying polysomnography on the animal. PLM are probably the only specific and reliable markers available to recognise and quantify experimentally induced RLS. Despite a few authors who reported the presence of limb-phasic, pseudoperiodic activity during sleep in old or in lesioned rats, the existence of spontaneous or provoked PLM in animals is still debated. Eventually, the PLM features in an animal could be markedly different compared to human ones. To recognise and characterise PLM in animals, three more essential steps are required: a method to record directly, as in humans, the activity of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, a consistent amount of normative control data on the TA activity in healthy animals, and reliable analysis to distinguish the generic phasic muscular activity to a possible unambiguous PLM pattern. This review includes a summary and a critical discussion of the previous tentative RLS models, proposals for other possible animal models, and firstly the preliminary normative data on TA activity during sleep in normal rodents. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2007.

AB  - Many new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have become available over the past 15 years. At the same time, the emphasis on treating patients with epilepsy has grown from stopping seizures to avoiding side effects and maximizing quality of life. This review summarizes currently available AEDs, and presents general treatment principles and guidelines for AED selection. Unfortunately, despite the increased treatment options of today, seizure freedom without side effects remains unattainable for too many patients with epilepsy. Consequently, there remains a significant need for further development of new therapies. © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

AB  - An electroencephatographical survey of 28 healthy children and 87 children with mild types of consequences of CNS perinatal damage has been carried out. The children's age was 1-3 years. The patients have been divided into clinical subgroups as follows: with sleep disorders (24), with myotonic syndrome (20), with general speech underdevelopment (22) and with delayed mental development (21). The results revealed changes in the activity of stem structures as well as of different cortical regions in the groups of children with clinical appearances. Moreover, the data obtained showed specific changes of cross-correlations between cortical regions depending on clinical presentations.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition that is frequently unrecognized, misdiagnosed and poorly managed. It is characterized by uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs developing at rest that compel the person to move; symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS occurs in 7%-11% of the population in Western countries, and many such people experience troublesome symptoms. Primary RLS is familial in up to two thirds of patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. RLS is very responsive to dopaminergic therapies. Rebound of RLS symptoms during the early morning and development of severe symptoms earlier in the day (augmentation) are problematic in those treated for a prolonged period with levodopa. Consequently, dopamine agonists have become first line treatment. Anti-convulsant medications and opioids are helpful in some patients. Correction of underlying problem wherever possible is important in the management of secondary RLS. © 2006 Dove Medical Press Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: To survey the knowledge and implementation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)-protective infant care practices in mothers of infants aged less than 4 months. Methods: A postal survey was carried out of knowledge of SIDS risk factors and infant care practices of 200 mothers with infants aged 6-8 weeks and 3-4 months. Results: Mothers who could cite supine sleeping as protective comprised 84%, while 73% knew that smoking was a risk factor. Fewer knew that room sharing, keeping the face clear of bedding, and avoiding bed sharing and overheating are also protective. Fifty-four percent of the infants usually room-share with a parent, while 39% both room-share and sleep in their own bed. Sixteen percent usually co-slept for part or all of the night. Nearly one-third used pacifiers. Mothers who smoked during pregnancy comprised 8%, while 7% had smoked in the last 24 hours. Most infants (97%) had been breastfed at some time. Conclusions: Maternal education of the benefits of supine sleeping, not smoking, and breastfeeding appear well understood by these mothers. However, more education is needed about other SIDS-protective behaviours such as keeping the face clear and sleeping the infant in their own bed in the parents' room. © NZMA.

AB  - Mouse mammary epithelial cells (HC-11) and mammary tissues were analyzed for developmental changes in circadian clock, cellular proliferation, and differentiation marker genes. Expression of the clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 were elevated in differentiated HC-11 cells, whereas Per2 mRNA levels were higher in undifferentiated cells. This differentiation-dependent profile of clock gene expression was consistent with that observed in mouse mammary glands, as Per1 and Bmal1 mRNA levels were elevated in late pregnant and lactating mammary tissues, whereas Per2 expression was higher in proliferating virgin and early pregnant glands. In both HC-11 cells and mammary glands, elevated Per2 expression was positively correlated with c-Myc and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels, whereas Per1 and Bmal1 expression changed in conjunction with β-casein mRNA levels. Interestingly, developmental stage had differential effects on rhythms of clock gene expression in the mammary gland. These data suggest that circadian clock genes may play a role in mouse mammary gland development and differentiation. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Leptin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) play importants role in the regulation of food intake, energy expanditure, hematopoesis and reproduction. The biological functions of leptin and NPY in fetal development, and their regulation during pregnancy by fetal and maternal factors remain poorly understood. Patients and Methods: From 55 women undergoing diagnostic amniocentesis between the 14th and 18th weeks of gestation samples of amniotic fluid were collected. In accord with the arcadian rhythm of leptin secretion all amniocenteses were performed between 8.00 and 12.00 a.m. The concentrations of leptin and NPY in amniotic fluid were analysed using commercially available RIA's. Results: The amniotic fluid samples of 32 male and 23 female fetuses were determined and demonstrated no gender-dependent differences in leptin and NPY levels. No correlation was found between leptin/NPY and the maternal body mass index. NPY concentrations are lower in advanced gestational age pregnancies. Leptin levels revealed no differences with respect to gestational age. Conclusion: Leptin and NPY levels were independent of fetal gender and maternal BMI. This provides clues for alternative regulatory mechanisms in leptin and NPY secretion. Compared to the data of adults, our findings show high leptin concentrations in the amniotic fluid in the presence of only minor amounts of white adipose tissues which might include the placenta. Our data including the observation of lower levels of NPY in more advanced gestational age support the idea of specific factors regulating leptin and NPY secretion into the amniotic fluid. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - The brainstem development of infants born between 33 and 38 weeks' gestation is less mature than that of a full-term infant. During late gestation, there are dramatic and nonlinear developmental changes in the brainstem with respect to neuronal origin and proliferation, migration pathways, morphologic and neurochemical differentiation, neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, and enzymes, dendritic arborization, spine formation, synaptogenesis, axonal outgrowth, and myelination. This translates into immaturity of upper airway and lung volume control, laryngeal reflexes, chemical control of breathing, and sleep mechanisms. Ten percent of late preterm infants have significant apnea of prematurity and they frequently have delays in establishing coordination of feeding and breathing. Eighty six percent of the 45 preterm infants who were enrolled in the CHIME study after experiencing an ALTE were between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation. Clearly these infants are at risk for respiratory-related problems compared with infants born at term. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of clinical, physiologic, neuroanatomic, and neurochemical data in this specific group of infants. Research focused on this group of infants will not only further our understanding of brainstem maturation during this high-risk period, but will help develop focused plans for their management. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A survey of the nutritional status of women in 6 villages of the Pune district of Maharashtra, India, found young women to have a significantly lower BMI than their male peers. The purpose of this study was to identify social and economic factors associated with this difference in thinness and to explore the behavior in men and women that might underlie these associations. We compared men and women in 90 families in this part of Maharashtra by taking measurements of the height and weight of the married couple of child-bearing age in each family and assessing their social and economic details, fasting practices, and oil consumption. In this agricultural community, women were thinner in joint land-owning families, where the main occupation was farming, than those in nonfarming families. This was not true of men in this type of family. Men in ''cash-rich'' families had higher BMI than men in families without this characteristic. There was no corresponding difference in women's BMI. We then examined the lifestyles of men and women in a subset of 45 of these families. Women were more likely to work full time in farming than men, to carry the burden of all household chores, to have less sleep, and to eat less food away from home than men. Women fasted more frequently and more strictly than men. Despite identifying significant differences in behavior between men and women in the same household, we did not find a direct link between behavior and BMI. We conclude that being married into a farming family is an important factor in determining the thinness of a woman in rural Maharashtra. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of the physiological processes that allow mammals to breed at the optimal time of year given the annual changes in environmental factors of their habitat. Reproductive activity in many mammalian populations shows dramatic seasonal variations with certain species oscillating between periods of reproductive activity and quiescence. The time of the year when animals are reproductively active varies from species to species and depends mainly on the length of gestation. In some mammals, in addition to timing fertilization, environmental cues also time the implantation of the embryo after an obligatory diapause of the blastocysts such as European badger, mink, and roe deer. Photoperiod is the main environmental parameter that controls reproduction and photoperiodic species are divided into two main categories depending on how photoperiod controls the annual rhythms and on the endogenous nature of the annual changes. Circannual species display endogenously generated rhythms, and photoperiod synchronizes these internally generated rhythms (referred to as type II rhythms). Noncircannual species do not display endogenous rhythms and are at least partially dependent on the environment for the generation of the seasonal cycle. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study sought to examine the relationship between time of birth and fetal injury resulting in death. Study design: The Birth-Related Neurologic Injury Compensation Association (NICA) is a Florida organization that pays for the care of infants >2500 g with birth-related brain or spinal cord injury resulting in permanent impairment. We conducted a case-control study using all deaths from the NICA database from 1989 to 2002. Data were collected on the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care of the mother and fetus/child. Time of birth was identified for all cases and compared with a randomly selected control group of 1000 births in 1996 from Florida. Results: Eighty deaths were identified in the NICA database of 447 total cases. Of the 80 cases, 36/80 (45%) were born from 11 pm to 8 am. Of the 999 controls (1 certificate sealed for adoption) 281 (28.1%) were born from 11 pm to 8 am. This yields an odds ratio of 2.09 (95% CI 1.29-3.40) for the association of nighttime birth with fetal injury resulting in death. Conclusion: Fetuses sustaining injuries resulting in death were more than twice as likely as controls to have been born from 11 pm to 8 am. Further studies are needed to determine the factors that affect this association and what changes might need to be made to optimize care regardless of time of day or night. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Prenatal auditory enrichment by species-specific sounds and sitar music enhances the expression of immediate early genes, synaptic proteins and calcium binding proteins (CaBPs) as well as modifies the structural components of the brainstem auditory nuclei and auditory imprinting area in chicks. There is also facilitation of postnatal auditory preference of the chicks to maternal calls following both types of sound stimulation indicating prenatal perceptual learning. To examine whether the sound enrichment protocol also affects the areas related to learning and memory, we assessed morphological changes in the hippocampus at post-hatch day 1 of control and prenatally sound-stimulated chicks. Additionally, the proportions of neurons containing calbindin D-28K and parvalbumin immunoreactivity as well as their protein levels were determined. Fertilized eggs of domestic chick were incubated under normal conditions of temperature, humidity, forced draft of air as well as light and dark (12:12 h) photoperiods. They were exposed to patterned sounds of species-specific and sitar music at 65 dB for 15 min per hour over a day/night cycle from day 10 of incubation till hatching. The hippocampal volume, neuronal nuclear size and total number of neurons showed a significant increase in the music-stimulated group as compared to the species-specific sound-stimulated and control groups. However, in both the auditory-stimulated groups the protein levels of calbindin and parvalbumin as well as the percentage of the immunopositive neurons were increased. The enhanced proportion of CaBPs in the sound-enriched groups suggests greater Ca2+ influx, which may influence long-term potentiation and short-term memory. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A combined time-variant analysis of nonlinear stability and parametric bispectral measures was applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep between 0.7 and 0.9 gestation to examine the maturation of sleep states and synchronization patterns of the ECoG. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already at 0.7 gestation and suggests the presence of premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature NREM sleep. Maturation of NREM sleep begun at 0.78 gestation and preceded that of REM sleep that begun at 0.85 gestation. Our results suggest that maturation of brain stem and thalamic function precedes that of cortical function. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the clinical challenges of obesity in obstetrics from the anaesthetist's viewpoint. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of obesity continues to increase both in the community and on the labour ward. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery are also on rise. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with hypertensive disease (chronic hypertension and preeclampsia), diabetes mellitus (pregestational and gestational), respiratory disorders (asthma and sleep apnoea), thromboembolic disease, caesarean section and infections (primarily urinary tract infections, wound infections and endometritis). Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Obese women are not only at high-risk of airway complications, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, perioperative morbidity and mortality but also pose technical challenges. Obesity also influences the fetal outcomes. Increasing use of regional techniques contributes to the reduced anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Preconception counselling, antenatal screening and anaesthetic assessment are strongly encouraged. SUMMARY: Effective communication and good teamwork between an anaesthetist and an obstetrician are essential for the care of obese parturients. A more liberalized use of regional techniques may be a means of further reducing the anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Introduction. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in the population of pregnant women. Material and methods. We have used a diagnostic questionnaire based upon diagnostic criteria of RLS formulated by International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Pregnant women attending to routine control visits at obstetrics outpatient department participated in the study. Results. We have examined 128 pregnant women. Mean age of the examined group was 27.7 years. Restless legs syndrome was found in 20 of them (15.69%). There was no age difference between RLS-positive and RLS-negative groups. There was no difference in iron and folic acid supplementation intake between the groups. Restless legs syndrome was more frequent among multiparae than among primigravidae. RLS-positive subjects had problems with sleep initiation more frequently. For 25% of RLS-positive subjects the syndrome was the most problematic health complaint. Conclusions. Restless legs syndrome is a frequent problem in the population of pregnant women, leading to sleep disorders. The disease is underdiagnosed in the general practice. Copyright © 2006 Via Medica.

AB  - Women commonly report sleep disorders that may predispose or contribute to the occurrence of other psychiatric problems. Many phases of the life cycle are associated with unique features of sleep disruption that are modulated at least partially by hormonal factors. Pregnancy and peripartum and perimenopausal states are associated particularly with sleep disruption and have the clearest published evidence base. Many factors contribute to a heightened incidence of insomnia in women, including the occurrence or severity of somatic symptoms (eg, hot flashes and dysmenorrhea); psychiatric symptoms, such as depression or anxiety; and intrinsic sleep disorders. The presence of insomnia is associated with poorer quality of life and impaired daytime functioning; its management, therefore, is imperative. Significant physiologic changes in pregnancy lead to several sleep disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing and RLS are common in women but even more in this subpopulation. Given the strong possibility that sleep disorders are contributing to mood changes in pregnant women, careful attention must be paid to the development of treatment strategies that address medical and psychologic factors to assist this vulnerable population fully. For symptomatic menopausal women, HT still is the treatment of choice for short-term management of menopause-related symptoms, in particular hot flashes; however, its safety as a long-term treatment option is questioned, and many physicians and their patients are seeking nonhormonal alternatives. An accurate diagnosis must be made in this population, and treatment of underlying sleep disorders is crucial. Most nonpharmacologic symptomatic treatments for insomnia (eg, stimulus control and sleep restriction) have not been studied systematically in patients who are menopausal, despite their proved efficacy for insomnia in general. The use of antidepressants and herbal preparations seem more helpful when sleep complaints result from the emergence of menopause-related symptoms, depression, or anxiety. Women who suffer insomnia during the menopausal transition or post menopause may benefit from the therapeutic effects of newer agents, such as the non-BZRAs (zolpidem and eszopiclone) and melatonin receptor antagonists; more studies are needed to determine the extent to which these agents can offer a safe and efficacious long-term management of insomnia with a positive impact on daytime function and improvement of quality of life. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The effects of sleep deprivation in pregnancy on the development of hippocampal function of the offspring have been investigated. For this purpose we compared electrophysiological characteristics in the hippocampal slices of 15-20-old-day rats of the control and two experimental groups. In the first experimental group the pups were taken from mother for weighting three times during the first postnatal week and then weekly. Another experimental group was brought up without handling. We found that CA1 population spikes developed to significantly less amplitude in experimental groups of rat pups. This phenomenon was observed at higher intensity of monosynaptic activation, although near-threshold stimuli didn't reveal any differences among groups. However, under paired-pulse stimulation (70 ms inter-pulse interval) small amplitudes in the hippocampal slices of experimental animals could facilitate up to control value, and second in pair responses didn't differ from corresponding control. Our data doesn't confirm the hypothesis about decreased connectivity in the hippocampus of experimental rats, but the efficacy of CA3-CA1 inputs seems to be lower. Besides excitatory transmission, the effectiveness of inhibition of paired-pulse facilitation at 15 ms inter-pulse interval was also significantly decreased. The observed effects of prenatal influences seem to develop under postnatal experience. We observed significant trend to more pronounced modifications upon age especially in the case of early handling and testing.

AB  - Bed-sharing among Barbadian mothers and infants was studied in relationship to maternal and infant characteristics. This prospective study followed 226 healthy, well-nourished mother-infant dyads at birth, 7 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum. At each age, approximately half of the infants shared the same beds as their mothers. Bed-sharing was associated with demographic characteristics, especially fewer home conveniences, and also maternal characteristics, including less information seeking by the mother and younger maternal age at first pregnancy. Bed-sharing was also associated with lower infant birth weights. Maternal moods were significantly correlated with bed-sharing, such that mothers who reported having more despair and anxiety were also more likely to sleep with their infants. Bed-sharing was also significantly associated with increased breastfeeding at all infant ages, but this relationship was no longer significant once the effects of maternal moods were controlled. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing maternal moods in studies evaluating the risk and benefits of bed-sharing. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A number of fundamental milestones define the pace at which animals develop, mature, reproduce and age. These include the length of gestation, the age at weaning and at sexual maturity, the number of offspring produced over a lifetime and the length of life itself. Because a time-scale for dental development can be retrieved from the internal structure of teeth and many of these life-history variables tend to be highly correlated, we can discover more than might be imagined about fossil primates and more, in particular, about fossil hominids and our own evolutionary history. Some insights into the evolutionary processes underlying changes in dental development are emerging from a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling enamel and dentine formation. Our own 18-20-year period of growth and development probably evolved quite recently after ca 17 million years of a more ape-like life-history profile. © 2006 The Royal Society.

AB  - • Chronic heart failure (CHF) is found in 1.5/6-2.0% of Australians. Considered rare in people aged less than 45 years, its prevalence increases to over 10% in people aged, ≥65 years. • CHF is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission and general practitioner consultation in the elderly (≥ 70 years). • Common causes of CHF are ischaemic heart disease (present in > 50% of new cases), hypertension (about two-thirds of cases) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (around 5%-10% of cases). • Diagnosis is based on clinical features, chest x-ray and objective measurement of ventricular function (eg, echocardiography). Plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) may have a role in diagnosis, primarily as a test for exclusion. Diagnosis may be strengthened by a beneficial clinical response to treatment(s) directed towards amelioration of symptoms. • Management involves prevention, early detection, amelioration of disease progression, relief of symptoms, minimisation of exacerbations, and prolongation of survival.

Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns.Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more common in men. SUMMARY: Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Obesity, generally defined as body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 and above, is a universal growing epidemic. From a public health perspective, it represents an important modifiable risk factor for adverse health and pregnancy outcome. There is a significant association between obesity and diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders, ischemic heart disease and sleep apnea. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with fertility treatments, recurrent abortions, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus and other complications such as labor dystocia, mal-presentations, fetal macrosomia, and higher rates of cesarean deliveries. Bariatric surgery is the only effective treatment for morbidly obese patients, and these operations are performed predominantly among women. Few studies have addressed pregnancy outcome after obesity surgery. Basically, pregnancy outcome is comparable to controls of normal BMI. This review aims to present updates on the relationship between obesity and pregnancy outcomes, and the outcome of patients following bariatric surgeries.

AB  - About 20 per cent of pregnant women experience antenatal depression (AD), which not only has deleterious effects on the woman and her baby but also increases the risk of developing postpartum depression. Nurses who understand the prevalence, signs and symptoms and risk factors associated with AD can help to identify it and prevent the sequelae. The signs and symptoms of depression in pregnancy do not differ from depression at any other time. However, AD may go undiagnosed because of a focus on maternal and fetal well-being and the attribution of complaints to the physical and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Risk factors include history of depression, lack of partner, marital difficulties, lack of social support, poverty, family violence, increased life stress, substance abuse, history of previous abortions, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence toward the pregnancy and anxiety about the fetus. Most of the standard treatments for depression can be used in pregnant women, with the exception of some antidepressant medications. Supportive therapies - exercise, adequate nutrition, adequate sleep, and support from family and friends - are also indicated. Screening of women with known risk factors is crucial, but the authors suggest that the high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy indicates a need for universal screening.

AB  - Objective: To compare the current prevalence of risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Sweden with a decade earlier, and assess factors associated with prone sleeping. Methods: The results of a cohort study (Infants of Western Sweden) and a population based case-control study (Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study) were examined. Subjects were 5600 healthy 6 month old infants born in 2003 in the Western Sweden region and 430 healthy Swedish infants born between 1991 and 1995. Results: Prone sleeping decreased from 31.8% to 5.6% and supine sleeping increased from 35.3% to 47.3%. Side or side/supine sleeping increased from 25.2% to 43.8%. Maternal smoking during pregnancy decreased from 23.5% to 9.5%. The risk for prone sleeping increased if the mother was unemployed (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.0), if she was a heavy smoker in the third trimester (OR 44.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 1199.6), and if the child was irritable (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1), shared a bedroom with siblings (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.6), or never used a dummy (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 5.4). Conclusions: Parents have complied with advice to prevent SIDS given at infant welfare centres for the last 10 years. A change in the preferred sleeping position from side variants to exclusively supine, and reducing the number of pregnant women smoking may be beneficial. Use of a prone sleeping position was associated with maternal employment status, maternal smoking, temperament of the child, dummy use, and sharing a bedroom with siblings.

AB  - Objective: A triennial observation of breastfeeding prevalence at 3 and 5 months of age promoted by the Emilia Romagna Region in order evaluate and programme public health interventions. Method: A prevalence study through a survey made to mothers during the first and second vaccine session in public health offices of the Emilia-Romagna Region. This study uses WHO's definitions and recall periods for breastfeeding prevalence studies and investigates also other variables such as sleeping position. Results: In respect to the 1999 observation, breastfeeding prevalence has improved with an absolute increase of "complete" breastfeeding (exclusive + predominant) at 3 months and 5% at 5 months. 13% of interviewed women are not Italian. The most represented nationalities are Eastern Europe/ex USSR nations (4%) and North Africa (3.6%). Conclusions: Complete breastfeeding prevalence in Emilia-Romagna is in slow but constant increase in the last years. These data are nevertheless still low in respect to comparable ones obtained from other Italian regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia) and very distant from WHO's aims. Women coming from other nations compared to Italian women attend less health care preventive services during pregnancy (14 vs 40%, p >0.0001).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare biobehavioral pain responses of preterm infants born at differing gestational ages (GAs) when pain was preceded by a rest period or by a series of routine nursing interventions. METHODS: In a randomized, within subjects, cross-over design, facial (Neonatal Facial Coding System), sleep/wake state and heart rate (HR) responses of 43 preterm infants [mean birth weight: 1303 g (range 590 g to 2345 g); mean GA at birth: 30 weeks (range 25 to 32)] were examined across 3 phases of blood collection (Baseline, Lance, and Recovery) under 2 conditions: pain after a 30-minute rest period versus pain after a series of routine nursing interventions (clustered care). Infant behavioral responses were coded from continuous bedside videotapes. HR was analyzed using custom physiologic signal processing software. RESULTS: Infants born at earlier GA (<30 wk) had equally intense facial responses during the Lance phase regardless of condition. However, later born infants (≥30 wk GA) showed heightened facial responses indicative of sensitized responses during blood collection when it was preceded by clustered care (P=0.05). Moreover, later born infants had significantly lower facial (P=0.05) and HR (P=0.04) reactivity during Recovery when blood collection followed clustered care. DISCUSSION: Earlier born preterm infants showed heightened states of arousal and poor ability to modulate HR during Recovery when an invasive procedure was preceded by routine tactile nursing procedures. Alternatively, later born infants exhibited sensitized responses when clustered care preceded blood collection. Our findings support the importance of cue based individualized approaches to care. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - In rodents, during late embryonic and early neonatal development, circadian rhythms develop in synchrony with those of their mothers, which in turn are synchronized with the environmental photoperiod. This paper examines the effect of maternal ganglionectomy (pineal gland sympathetic denervation) or extirpation of the pineal gland on pups' drinking rhythms, a behavior that is continuously monitored in individual animals starting after weaning and studied up to 3 weeks later. Maternal ganglionectomy or pinealectomy performed on the 7th day of gestation significantly disrupts rat pups' drinking behavior, within and among litters. In both treatments, circadian rhythm characteristics of the free-running period (tau), phase, amplitude and alpha were significantly altered compared to those of the control pups born from sham-operated mothers. With the exception of the alpha component, both maternal treatments have similar effects. When melatonin was given to the mothers instead of the endogenous pineal secretory activity for 5 days during the late period of gestation, this treatment reversed the effects of maternal ganglionectomy and pinealectomy. These observations, together with previous studies of our group, indicate that the maternal superior cervical ganglia and pineal gland are necessary components of the mechanism for maternal synchronization, and that maternal melatonin may, directly or indirectly, affect the performance of the pups' central oscillator during early pup rat development. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: To explore the sleeping problems and related factors among children aged 1 to 24 months in Changsha. Methods: Totally 700 normal children aged 1 to 24 months without severe congenital or infectious disease were randomly selected from 3 neighborhoods of two districts of Changsha. Under strict quality control system, their parents were interviewed with the self-made questionnaire on children sleeping condition including the general condition, sleeping condition in recent 1 month, growth and development and disease of children, pregnant condition, family condition, living condition and sleeping condition of parents. Sleeping problems with children included regaining consciousness at night, falling asleep at evening, breathing with mouth in sleeping at night, snoring in sleeping, sleep lightly with stimulate, hyperkinesias ties in sleeping, sweatiness in sleeping and breath pausing in sleeping. Every item included five levels "never", "once in a while", "once or twice per week", "three to four times per week", and "high frequency". The children were considered having sleeping problems if "once to twice per week" appeared in any item. One person had only one sheet, and the questionnaires were retrieved after checking. Results: Totally 700 questionnaires were sent out, and 672 qualified were retrieved with the efficient rate of 96.0%. (1)The prevalence of sleeping problems in children aged 1 to 24 months in Changsha, was 17.7 %. The male was 14.8%, and female was 21.1%, which had significant differences (X 2 =4.588, P &lt; 0.05). (2)The prevalence of more sweatiness in female child was more higher than male child, which had significantly differences (66 21.1, 53/14.8, X 2 =4.588, P &lt; 0.05). (3)The children aged 1-24 months were divided into 5 age groups, and there were significant differences in the prevalence of sleeping problems in children among different ages (111/ 51.6, 6/2.8, 2/1.9, 0, 0, X 2 =250.042, P &lt; 0.01). The children aged younger than 6 months owed the highest prevalence (51.6%). (4)The single factor gradual regressive analysis was performed according to whether having sleeping problem to screen the related factors with children sleeping problems. The related factors were selected as variables including month age of child, education years of parents, profession of parents, sleeping conditions of child, born condition of children, pregnant condition of mothers, living condition of family, sleeping condition of parents to perform the logistic regression analysis. The 8 variables such as term born child, sleeping time at daytime of child, profession of father, ventilation of child bedroom, passive smoking at home in pregnant period, sleeping bed of child, asphyxiation in coming into the world, sonmiloquence in sleeping of father were involved in the logistic analysis. Conclusion: The prevalence of sleeping problems of children aged 1 to 24 months in Changsha is relatively higher. The younger the children are, the higher the prevalence is. Term born child, total sleeping time at daytime of child, profession of father, ventilation of child bedroom, passive smoking at home in pregnant period, sleeping bed of child, asphyxiation in coming into the world and somniloquence in sleeping of father may influence the occurrence of sleeping problems.

AB  - It is generally assumed that fetal heart rate variability increases with gestation, reflecting prenatal development of the autonomic nervous system. We examined standard measures quantifying fetal heart rate variability, as well as a complexity measure, approximate entropy, in 66 fetal magnetocardiograms recorded from 22 healthy pregnant women between the 16th and 42nd week of gestation. In particular, regularity in the fetal RR interval time series was assessed on the basis of symbolic dynamics. The results showed that, beside an overall increase in fetal heart rate variability and complexity during pregnancy, there was also an increase in specific sets of binary patterns with low approximate entropy, i.e., a high degree of regularity. These sets were characterized by short epochs of heart rate acceleration and deceleration, and comparison with surrogate data confirmed that their random occurrence is rare. The results most likely reflect the influence of increasingly differentiated fetal behavioral states and transitions between them in association with fetal development. ©2006 by Walter de Gruyter.

AB  - Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved by movement, and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day. All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features to confirm the diagnosis. Whilst many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, or in those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients' quality of life. © 2006 EFNS.

AB  - Objective: To elucidate the synchronization of phases of diurnal rhythms in fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline between twin fetuses and the occurrence of sustained fetal tachycardia. Methods: FHR was simultaneously recorded in twins for 24 h in 7 monochorionic diamniotic (MD) and 8 dichorionic diamniotic (DD) twin pregnancies at 35 to 38 weeks of gestation. The diurnal rhythms of the hourly mean FHR baseline were tested in each fetus, and the time of occurrence of sustained fetal tachycardia was compared between twins. The correlation coefficients and phase lags of diurnal rhythms between the hourly mean FHR baselines of twins were calculated in each case. Results: There were significant diurnal rhythms in the hourly mean FHR baselines of all twin fetuses (p < 0.01). The patterns of diurnal rhythms were similar for each pair of twins, with the exception of the periods of sustained fetal tachycardia. Sustained fetal tachycardia was not coincident between twins. Analysis in which the periods of sustained fetal tachycardia were excluded demonstrated a significant correlation between the hourly mean FHR baselines of twins in all cases (p < 0.01). In the case of DD twins, the phase lag between twins was 0; however, phase lags were observed in 4 cases of MD twins. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that the diurnal rhythms in the FHR baseline correlated well between twins, and that the occurrences of sustained fetal tachycardia were completely independent. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - During lactation, the suckling stimulus exerts profound influences on neuroendocrine regulation in nursing rats. We examined the acute effect of pup removal on the estrogen- induced surge of LH secretion in ovariectomized lactating rats. Lactating and nonlactating cyclic female rats were given an estradiol-containing capsule after ovariectomy, and blood samples were collected through an indwelling catheter for serum LH determinations. In lactating, freely suckled ovariectomized rats, estrogen treatment induced an afternoon LH surge with a magnitude and timing comparable to those seen in nonlactating rats. Removal of pups from the lactating rats at 0900, 1100, or 1300 h, but not at 1500 h, suppressed the estrogen-induced surge that normally occurs in the afternoon of the same day. The suppressive effect of pup removal at 0900 h was completely abolished when the pups were returned by 1400 h. In contrast, pup removal was ineffective in abolishing the stimulatory effect of progesterone on LH surges. Double immunohistochemical staining for gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) and c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activation, revealed a decrease, concomitantly with the suppression of LH surges, in the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive GnRH neurons in the preoptic regions of nonsuckled rats. An LH surge was restored in nonsuckled rats when 0.1 μg oxytocin was injected into the third ventricle three times at 1-h intervals during pup removal. These results suggest that the GnRH surge generator of lactating rats requires the suckling stimulus that is not involved in nonlactating cyclic female rats. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - The birth rate for higher order multiples has dramatically increased in recent decades. Multiple gestation pregnancies are considered to be at high obstetric risk. Antepartum bed rest is often prescribed to offset complications despite the lack of evidence for its effectiveness in preventing complications. This longitudinal repeated-measures study identified side effects of antepartum bed rest treatment for 31 hospitalized women with twin or triplet gestation. Maternal weight gain and infant birth weight were recorded. Antepartum stressors were measured by the Antepartum Stressors Hospital Inventory, and depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Antepartum and post-partum side effects of bed rest were also assessed by the Antepartum and Postpartum Symptom Checklists. The weekly rate of maternal weight gain during hospitalization was significantly less than recent recommendations for multiple gestation weight gain (t =- 2.14, p =.04). Infant birth weights were appropriate for gestational age. There were fewer than expected small-for-gestational-age infants. Concerns regarding family status and separation from family were the major antepartum stressors. Women reported a high number of symptoms during bed rest (M=22), which did not significantly change across 2 weeks. CES-D scores for depressive symptoms were high on antepartum hospital admission. Postpartum symptoms were initially high but had significantly declined by 6 weeks: F(1, 27)=15.68, p =.00. These findings suggest that interventions are needed to reduce antepartum maternal weight loss, stress, physiologic and psychosocial symptoms, and depressive symptoms, as well as reduce postpartum symptoms of maternal morbidity.

AB  - Objective: To quantify PH prevalence in primiparous adolescents; define predictive factors for the occurrence of PH and its impact on newborns. Methods: We followed 29 primiparous adolescents from the prenatal period through the 12th week of the puerperium, with a mean of sixteen years of age, served at the Outpatient Facility for Adolescents of Maternidade Escola Assis Chateaubriand (MEAC) of Universidade Federal do Ceará (Fortaleza, Brazil). The pregnant adolescents were divided into two groups, that is, those who remained normotensive (Group I) and those who developed PH (Group II). The variables investigated in the assessment of the value of predictability for the development of PH were anthropometric measures, socioeconomic aspects, smoking habit, inheritance for SAH (father/mother), prenatal tests requested in the first prenatal care visit in addition to microalbuminuria and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in the 28th week of gestation. The pregnant adolescents were followed up at delivery and late puerperium (12th week after the puerperium). The newborns to the mothers included in our study were assessed at birth according to the Apgar score and the Capurro method, for weight, height and perinatal hypoxia. Results: The prevalence of PH was 51.7%. Inheritance for SAH presented the highest predictive value for PH with an odds ratio of 10.99. Diastolic arterial pressure equal to or above 70 mmHg at the gestational age of 35 weeks was statistically significant as a predictive value for PH. At ABPM we found a predictive value for PH: diastolic pressure load during alertness, diastolic and systolic pressure load during night sleep, pressure variability and maximum diastolic pressure during sleep. Specifically a maximum diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) at ABPM during the period of night sleep 364 mmHg presented an odds ratio of 6 for PH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 60% for the development of PH. Conclusion: The research for PH predictive factors in primiparous adolescents showed to be easy to apply and useful to stratify high-risk pregnant women as regards the development of PH.

AB  - Study Objectives: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Design: Cross-sectional, population-based study. Setting: Passo Fundo, Brazil. Participants: 2,285 newborns. Interventions: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed. Measurements and Results: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age ≤ 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. Conclusions: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of this study lies in the future application of this information via public health measures targeted at high-risk populations.

AB  - We present a case of hyperexcitability syndrome observed in a neonate born to a mother who was a heavy user of cocoa and chocolate during pregnancy and lactation. The infant presented jitteriness, irritability, inconsolable crying, excessive sucking, and sleeping difficulties almost immediately after birth. The infant underwent extensive diagnostic studies, but none of the usual causes for its symptoms were identified. The symptoms resolved after the interruption of maternal chocolate consumption. We hypothesize that the heavy exposure to chocolate could be responsible for the hyperexcitability syndrome. Copyright © 2006 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Sentience and consciousness are prerequisites of suffering. Thus, animals must have sufficiently sophisticated neural mechanisms to receive sensory information and to transduce this information into sensations, and they must also be conscious to be able to perceive those sensations. Moreover, those sensations must be sufficiently noxious or aversive to cause suffering. The neural apparatus of embryos and fetuses of farm animals is inadequate to support sentience for at least the first half of pregnancy, but the required structures and mechanisms do develop by the time of birth. Thus, although one of the preconditions for suffering is satisfied shortly before birth, the embryo and fetus are apparently never conscious for the following reasons. The embryo-fetus initially does not have brain structures that are functionally capable of supporting consciousness, and subsequently, when the fetal brain might have that capability, it displays electrical activity indicating a continuous state of sleep and therefore unconsciousness. Furthermore, the fetus is apparently actively maintained in sleep-like states by several endogenous neuroinhibitory mechanisms which involve adenosine (a potent neuroinhibitory and sleep inducing agent), allopregnanolone and pregnanolone (two neurosteroidal anaesthetics), prostaglandin D2 (a potent sleep-inducing hormone), a placental neural inhibitor, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation. Consciousness evidently appears for the first time only after birth. This results from a substantial withdrawal of the neuroinhibitors, especially adenosine, and the involvement of neuroactivators including 17β-oestradiol (a potent neuroactive steroid with widespread excitatory effects in the brain), noradrenaline (released from excitatory locus coeruleus nerves that extend throughout the brain), and a barrage of novel sensory information associated with the newborn's first exposure to air, gravity, hard surfaces, unlimited space and, usually, to cold ambient conditions. We conclude that the embryo and fetus cannot suffer before or during birth. Furthermore, we conclude that suffering can only occur in the newborn when the onset of breathing oxygenates its tissues sufficiently to substantially reduce the dominant adenosine inhibition of brain electrical activity. The implications of these observations for managing fetuses and newborns in ways that minimise suffering are considered briefly. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Studies suggest that sleep deprivation adversely affects performance. We hypothesized that cesarean delivery complications would be more frequent during the night shift (11 pm-7 am), and evaluated morbidities by delivery shift. Study design: Eighteen thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine term women undergoing an unscheduled cesarean delivery in 13 centers from 1999 to 2000 within a prospective observational study were included. Maternal/neonatal morbidities and time from decision to cesarean delivery were evaluated by time of delivery (7 am-3 pm, 3 pm-11 pm, 11 pm-7 am). A composite of maternal morbidities was evaluated by logistic regression controlling for potentially confounding factors. Results: Controlling for age, race, insurance, cardiac disease, preeclampsia, diabetes, previous incision type, and prenatal care, shift of delivery had no impact on maternal morbidity (11 pm-7 am OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.81-1.0]). NICU admissions were slightly increased at night but neonatal complications were not. Conclusion: Maternal and neonatal complications of cesarean delivery do not increase with delivery during the night shift. © 2006 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Facts and hypotheses on the relationship between some children's diseases or disorders and external stressors during the developmental stage of a child, both prenatally and postnatally are described in literature. In this paper the following changes in patterns and causes of the main childhood illnesses are summarized and recommendations for actions are made. • Prematurity • Intra-uterine growth restriction • Testicular dysgenesis syndrome • Type I and Type II diabetes • Asthma, atopy and hay fever • Autism • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) • Learning disabilities • Cancer • Obesity • Hearing problems Results: Literature provides a growing amount of information on changing patterns in childhood diseases. Conclusions: The following recommendations for action are formulated: • Immediate research on endocrine disrupters in relation to prematurity • Diabetes: avoid Maillard Compounds in liquid baby food and in food in general: promote breastfeeding • Asthma: avoid exposure to smoking, the use of chemical household products, dioxin and dioxin-like chemicals, and avoid air pollution with high levels of particulate matter, especially around conception, during pregnancy and in the first years of life • Autism: more research on incidence and causes • ADHD and learning disabilities: more research on prevalence and causes. Preventions: 1) preconception counselling to avoid potentially harmful substances; 2) controlling and further lowering levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, lead and methyl mercury • Cancer: promote breastfeeding, carry out research into effects of foetal exposure to internal fission-product radionuclides • Obesity: stop smoking in pregnancy, avoid parental obesity, longer night sleep • Hearing problems: lower noise levels in discothèques, promote the day-evening-night level to avoid noise (longer night sleep). © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In 2003, the EFNS Task Force was set up for putting forth guidelines for the management of the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and the Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD). After determining the objectives for management and the search strategy for primary and secondary RLS and for PLMD, a review of the scientific literature up to 2004 was performed for the drug classes and interventions employed in treatment (drugs acting on the adrenoreceptor, antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines/hypnotics, dopaminergic agents, opioids, other treatments). Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations formed according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating. Dopaminergic agents came out as having the best evidence for efficacy in primary RLS. Reported adverse events were usually mild and reversible; augmentation was a feature with dopaminergic agents. No controlled trials were available for RLS in children and for RLS during pregnancy. The following level A recommendations can be offered: for primary RLS, cabergoline, gabapentin, pergolide, ropinirole, levodopa and rotigotine by transdermal delivery (the latter two for short-term use) are effective in relieving the symptoms. Transdermal oestradiol is ineffective for PLMD. © 2006 EFNS.

AB  - The pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is complex and remains to be fully elucidated. The condition is predominantly a disorder of the central rather than the peripheral, nervous system, and dopaminergic dysfunction in subcortical systems appears to play a central role. Conditions associated with secondary RLS, such as pregnancy or end-stage renal disease, are characterized by iron deficiency, which suggests that disturbed iron homeostasis may also play a role in the development of the condition. Although most patients with RLS have normal serum ferritin levels, concentrations of ferritin and transferrin in the cerebrospinal fluid are reduced, suggesting iron deficiency within the central nervous system. Although iron is necessary for the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in dopamine synthesis, it is unclear whether this relationship plays a role in the aetiology of RLS. There also appears to be a genetic component, particularly when the condition develops before the age of 45 years. Candidate genetic loci have been located on chromosomes 9p, 12q and 14q, but the genes involved have yet to be identified. How these three identified aetiological factors, namely dopaminergic dysfunction, impaired iron homeostasis and genetic disposition, are inter-related in the genesis of RLS remains unclear. © 2006 EFNS.

AB  - In this paper, we reviewed all existing studies using electroencephalography (EEG) in infants and children with known prenatal exposure to alcohol (PEA). The guiding purposes of the review were to determine if (1) EEG is a useful neuroimaging technique for investigating the brain correlates of PEA in infants and children, (2) there are indeed consistent EEG correlates of PEA in literature, and (3) these EEG correlates can be framed within a coherent picture of emerging implications for the study of PEA and its effects. The review confirms that EEG techniques have proven useful in indicating evidence of differential effects of patterns of PEA and timing in early fetal development and impairment of brain maturation in older children. In general, these techniques could be important in functional assessment of the brain of children affected by PEA, especially if used in conjunction with other neuroimaging techniques. The reviewed studies also suggest that although the impact on sensory and cognitive functions may involve extensive neural networks, there are EEG correlates of PEA which may in the future lead to the identification of neurophysiologic markers. A consistent aspect that emerges from the EEG data is that converging evidence from the study of different systems and processes suggests that PEA may almost invariably have consequences for later neurocognitive development. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Bupropion was initially developed and licensed for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the United States in 1989. It was licensed as a pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in the United States in 1997 and in the United Kingdom in 2000, and for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with seasonal affective disorder in the United States in 2006. Its main mechanism of action is believed to be via dopamine and noradrenalin reuptake inhibition. In addition to proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of major depression, the prevention of depressive episodes in patients with seasonal affective disorder, and as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, bupropion has demonstrated efficacy for attenuation of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and more recently it has shown anti-inflammatory action against proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which may be implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease. The twice-daily sustained-release formulation has been extensively evaluated for smoking cessation and has shown continuous smoking abstinence rates at one year of the order of 20% across many clinical groups including healthy smokers, and smokers with cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive airways disease, depression and schizophrenia. Bupropion is well tolerated with side effects including insomnia, headache, dry mouth, dizziness and nausea. Bupropion is a cytochrome p450 2D6 inhibitor and care must be taken when coprescribing with drugs cleared by this enzyme and when co-prescribing with drugs that lower seizure threshold. Despite the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bupropion as an aid to smoking cessation, its uptake for this indication remains low when compared with nicotine replacement therapy. © 2006 Prous Science.

AB  - Introduction: To prospectively evaluate the frequency of late-night deliveries and the cost of lost office hours, physicians serving mainly uninsured and Medicaid patients in an urban area established databases tracking office demographics and detailed information on each delivery. Subjects and Methods: Time needed in the hospital during routine office hours and late night was tabulated for each delivery. Complete calendar years 2000-2003 were tabulated separately and in total. Overhead and opportunity costs were calculated using historical norms and actual costs. Results: During the study, there were 490 deliveries, with 113 (23%) occurring late at night. Physicians retrospectively self-reported an average of 2.8 hours in the hospital for the average delivery, which included 105 (21%) Cesarean deliveries. There were an average of 9.5 prenatal visits with each delivery, and 23% of deliveries occurred late at night (11 p.m.-6 a.m.). The average delivery produced a net revenue of $1,339. Deliveries caused physicians to be absent from the office for 371.5 hours over the four years. After deducting opportunity cost and continuing overhead, net revenue for the 48-month study period was $646,858. Ancillary revenues were beyond the scope of the study design. Conclusion: These data suggest that delivery services in this community of urban underserved minorities can be self-supporting. This is the first study in the medical literature to provide data describing the impact of deliveries on physician practices outside of residency. Loss of physician sleep and revenue lost secondary to time away from the office were successfully measured. These data suggest that common beliefs frequently overestimate lifestyle interruptions and underestimate the financial losses of failure to deliver babies in this region. Future studies are suggested.

AB  - Independently, prenatal malnutrition and psychological/physical stress have been shown to affect sleep architecture in adult rats. As malnutrition and stress commonly co-exist in malnourished human populations, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the combined effects of these two insults by examining sleep-wake parameters following a brief restraint stress in prenatally protein malnourished rats. The male offspring of rats provided with a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were implanted with recording electrodes beginning at postnatal day 90. Polygraph recordings were obtained to quantify sleep states during the first 4 h of the dark phase of the cycle on 2 consecutive days. The first followed a 24-h habituation session to the recording chamber (baseline). The second occurred at the same time of day but followed 20 min of restraint stress in a Plexiglas tube. During baseline, prenatally malnourished rats spent more time in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in the first 2 h after "lights off" (block 1), and greater amounts of wakefulness (W) with a corresponding reduction in slow wave sleep (SWS) in the second two hours (block 2), as compared with controls. Following stress, the sleep architecture of both groups of rats remained unaltered in block 1 relative to their baseline day. In block 2, both groups exhibited significant reductions in SWS and REMS with significantly greater reductions being expressed in the prenatally malnourished group (most dramatically, REMS was completely eliminated). These findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be more severe in those malnourished human populations subjected to acutely stressful experiences. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the adult mammal the circadian system, which allows predictive adaptation to daily environmental changes, comprises peripheral oscillators in most tissues, commanded by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The external environment of the fetus is provided by its mother. In primates, maternal melatonin is a candidate to entrain fetal circadian rhythms, including the SCN rhythms of metabolic activity. We found in the 90% of gestation capuchin monkey fetus expression of the clock genes Bmal-1, Per-2, Cry-2, and Clock in the SCN, adrenal, pituitary, brown fat, and pineal. Bmal-1, Per-2, and the melatonin 1 receptor (MT1) showed a robust oscillatory expression in SCN and adrenal gland, whereas a circadian rhythm of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found in plasma. Maternal melatonin suppression changed the expression of Bmal-1, Per-2, and MT1 in the fetal SCN. These effects were reversed by maternal melatonin replacement. In contrast, neither maternal melatonin suppression nor its replacement had effects on the expression of Per-2 and Bmal-1 or MT1 in the fetal adrenal gland or the circadian rhythm of fetal plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Our data suggest that maternal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the fetal SCN but probably not for the adrenal gland. Copyright © 2006 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to validate the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20R) questionnaire for the assessment of prolonged fatigue in workers and to define its psychometric properties and fatigue standards for the population of Poland. The questionnaire contains 20 statements, scored on a seven-point scale (1-7), reflecting four aspects of fatigue: subjective feeling of fatigue, reduction of concentration, reduction of motivation, and reduction of physical activity. The outcome yielded by the questionnaire is expressed by the sum of all points scored in responding to all statements and mean values of its components. Material and Methods: The study was carried out in a group (325 men and 363 women) of workers employed in industrial plants, hypermarkets and municipal services; workers of research institutes (81 men and 205 women) and pregnant women (20 persons). Based on the calculated coefficients of correlation between responses to each statement and the total score, strong discriminative power of individual statements was observed. Crombach's alpha was used to assess the consistence of the questionnaire. The coefficient value for the total score was 0.912 and for the fatigue components it ranged from 0.611 to 0.879, which indicates satisfactory reliability of the method. In addition, norms were elaborated using a sten scale. The total value of 40 indicates the borderline between low and moderate and the value of 84 between medium and high level of fatigue. Results: The level of the risk for chronic fatigue was estimated on the basis of investigations among industrial, trade and municipal services workers. In the group of men, the necessity of prolonged standing during work, high physical effort during work, lack of fitting to physical effort during work, and stress connected with responsibility (component of occupational stress) were the risk-increasing factors. In the group of women, they were: lack of fitting to physical effort during work, noise disturbing reasoning of speech and stress connected with psychic load and lack of social support (components of occupational stress). In both groups, sleep disturbances proved to be responsible for increasing risk of the incidence of chronic fatigue. In the group of men - the diet, and in the group of women - exercise during leisure time were found to be protective factors. Conclusions: The study revealed that the CIS20R questionnaire is a good research tool to study chronic fatigue. It was also found that the level of fatigue in the population of Poland is much higher than that in the Netherlands, the country where the questionnaire has been developed. In the Dutch studies, the value of 76 was found to be a borderline between "normal fatigue" and fatigue occurring in people with impaired health. In our studies this value corresponds with six stens, which means that it is still within the range of moderate values. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof. J. Nofera w Łodzi.

AB  - According to the data of direct electroencephalography (EEG) human fetus can develop circadian rhythm of sleep-wake cycle before birth. Healthy fetus during birth is awake and takes an active part in the delivery. The fetus sleep during birth is developed only in hypoxic states. EEG irregularities of sleep are noticed yet in fetal stage. Children aged 0-1 year develop five phases of sleep: drowsiness, active sleep, sleep of middle depth, deep sleep, paradoxical REM sleep. Maturity of superficial sleep terminates by the 10th-12th month of life. The sleep of average depth and deep sleep terminate maturity by the 2nd month of life. Duration of paradoxical sleep increases considerably by the age 12th month and is divided into 2 stages. By the age of 12 months paradoxical sleep remains immature. In children of the same age with CNS disorder the structural composition of sleep changes: active sleep is prolonged, sleep of middle depth is not changed, deep sleep does not develop, paradoxical-REM sleep is atypical.

AB  - Diurnal rhythms of cardiac activity and motion activity of expectant mother fetus with physiological course of pregnancy have been studied at pregnancy terms of 16-28 weeks. A new, original method of analysis of fetus has been proposed. It has been established, that healthy fetus exhibits sharply defined day-and-night variations of physiological functions. Biological rhythms of human fetus are in coordination with the condition of maternal body, but it is in counter phase with it. Dynamic curve of the changing of functioning level of its physiological systems carries biphasic character. "Active" (from 9 am till 2 pm and from 7 pm till 4 am) and "calm" (from 4 am till 9 am and from 2 pm till 7 pm) periods of human fetus have been chosen. The absence of sharply defined biorhythms in terms of 20-24 weeks gestation, shows its developmental retardation and needs timely correction. The results of investigations lay fundamentals of chronobiology and chronotheraphy of human fetus.

AB  - Investigation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) circadian chronological structure changes by means of blood pressure monitoring in healthy pregnant women during development of gestational hypertension (GH) and pre-eclampsia (PE) was carried out. 72 hours blood pressure monitoring (TM-2421 device, Tokyo, Japan) was carried out in 34 healthy pregnant women. Parametric and non-parametric indices of circadian rhythms were determined, which allowed us to include in group A 17 women who had normal BP until delivery. Group B consisted of 17 women with hypertension in II and III trimesters. Increase of hyperbaric index (HBI) of SBP was revealed in the I trimester in women in whom hypertension was developed later in pregnancy. HBI was used as a prognostic criterion of developing MESOR-hypertension long before its clinical manifestation. In the II and III trimesters HBI, per cent time of elevation (PTE%) and MESORs of SBP and DBP circadian rhythms progressively augmented. Pregnant women with hypertension belonged to type non-dipper according to D/N% changes (less then 10%). This may be the result of insufficient decrease of night values of SBP in group B pregnant women, which is characteristic of GH and PE.

AB  - There is a growing recognition that the circadian timing system, in particular recently discovered clock genes, plays a major role in a wide range of physiological systems. Microarray studies, for example, have shown that the expression of hundreds of genes changes many fold in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, liver heart and kidney. In this review, we discuss the role of circadian rhythmicity in the control of reproductive function in animals and humans. Circadian rhythms and clock genes appear to be involved in optimal reproductive performance, but there are sufficient redundancies in their function that many of the knockout mice produced do not show overt reproductive failure. Furthermore, important strain differences have emerged from the studies especially between the various Clock (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycle Kaput) mutant strains. Nevertheless, there is emerging evidence that the primary clock genes, Clock and Bmal1 (Brain and Muscle ARNT-like protein 1, also known as Mop3), strongly influence reproductive competency. The extent to which the circadian timing system affects human reproductive performance is not known, in part, because many of the appropriate studies have not been done. With the role of Clock and Bmal1 in fertility becoming clearer, it may be time to pursue the effect of polymorphisms in these genes in relation to the various types of infertility in humans. © 2006 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

AB  - Over the past generation, aging and female reproduction have been lodged within the gendered and gendering debates regarding women's involvement in the workforce and demographic shifts toward delayed parenting that culminate in discourses on the "biological clock". Technological solutions to the biological clock, specifically in vitro fertilization, have led to clinical attempts to assess "ovarian reserve", or qualitative and quantitative changes in the ovary that correlate with aging and with successful infertility treatment. Rupturing the longstanding historical connections between menstruation and female reproductive capacity by specifically focusing on the aging of a woman's eggs, the clinical designation of "diminished ovarian reserve" has come to imply that a woman has "old eggs". This is associated in practitioners' and patients' minds with the eclipse of a woman's reproductive potential and with hidden harbingers of menopause. In an ethnographic interview study of 79 couples in the US who conceived after using donor oocytes, we found that women voiced two different narratives that described their experience and attitudes when confronted with an apparent age-related decline in their fertility. The "eleventh-hour mom" narrative was voiced by women who initially tried to become pregnant with their own eggs and turned to donated oocytes as a second-choice option, whereas the "miracle mom" narrative was expressed by women who were generally older, some of whom had entered infertility treatment hoping to conceive with their own eggs, but some who knew from the outset that it was not going to be possible. Through their narratives women not only embodied and made meaningful "diminished ovarian reserve" in varying ways that connect with cultural, social, structural/organizational, symbolic and physical aspects of aging, they reproduced the socio-biological project of the biological clock, but rooted this social project in the metaphor of "old eggs" rather than menopause. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Pregnancy Outcomes and Community Health (POUCH) Study enrolled women in their 15th to 27th week of pregnancy from 52 prenatal clinics located in five communities. After the study began, an at-home protocol to measure maternal stress was added, which included collection of urine and saliva twice a day (waking = AM, bedtime = PM) for three consecutive days, and completion of a daily diary. The at-home protocol was in place for 2852 POUCH participants at enrolment, and 81.3% (n = 2318) consented and returned samples and diary. For these analyses, salivary cortisol was analysed in a subset of 846 women who delivered at term. Day-to-day correlation coefficients for AM cortisol (0.45-0.55) exceeded those for PM cortisol (0.31-0.43). Study diaries indicated that there was variation in the time interval between waking and sample collection. Analyses of discrete intervals showed the same awakening response pattern in cortisol levels that has been reported in studies with serial AM sampling. The adjusted mean AM cortisol (μg/dL) was 0.506 at 0-15 min post-waking, 0.544 at 16-30 min (P < 0.05), 0.582 at 31-60 min (P < 0.01), and 0.515 at >60 min post-waking. In addition, adjusted mean AM cortisol in samples collected at or before 9 a.m. was higher than that in samples collected after 9 a.m. (0.564 vs. 0.510 μg/dL, P < 0.01). Among working women, adjusted mean AM cortisol was higher on work days than non-work days (0.564 vs. 0.489 μg/dL, P < 0.01), and in multiparae compared with primiparae (0.551 vs. 0.502 μg/dL, P = 0.07). The parity effect was not evident in non-working women. The adjusted mean PM cortisol significantly increased as week of pregnancy at sampling increased, but was not significantly related to time of collection, work day and parity. Factors influencing AM and PM cortisol levels in pregnancy appear to differ. In studies of AM cortisol levels, it is important to gather data on time of sample collection, interval from waking to sample collection, parity and work. ©2006 The Authors.

AB  - A fundamental characteristic of the vertebrate body plan is its segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis. This segmental pattern is established during embryogenesis by the formation of somites, the transient epithelial blocks of cells that derive from the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm. Somite formation involves a molecular oscillator, termed the segmentation clock, in combination with gradients of signaling molecules such as fibroblast growth factor 8, WNT3A, and retinoic acid. Disruption of somitogenesis in humans can result in disorders such as spondylocostal dysostosis, which is characterized by vertebral malformations. This review summarizes recent findings concerning the role of Notch signaling in the segmentation clock, the complex regulatory network that governs somitogenesis, the genes that cause inherited spondylocostal dysostosis, and the mechanisms that regulate bilaterally symmetric somite formation. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Women generally have more complaints about sleep, compared with men of the same age. At various stages of reproduction, the reasons for these complaints become rather obvious - menstrual cramps and discomfort, pregnancy and postpartum factors, and menopausal hot flashes can fragment sleep. In addition, there are lifestyle factors, such as going to bed late and getting up early in order to attend to various family responsibilities, restricting the time allowed for sleep. Factors outside a woman's control, such as caregiving for sick family members during the night, can also result in disrupted sleep patterns, with little opportunity to make up for the lost sleep on weekends or days off. This article discusses the types of insomnia commonly experienced by women during key reproductive stages of life and proposes gender-specific assessment and management strategies. Pharmacologic management of sleep problems is useful for brief episodes of insomnia, but not usually desirable during pregnancy and lactation, or for management of chronic insomnia. For most women, regardless of reproductive stage, nonpharmacologic strategies that involve behavioral therapies, or short-term focused use of hypnotics at key time points, are more effective for quality of life than is long-term use of pharmacologic interventions.

AB  - For more than two decades, prenatal care has been a cornerstone of our nation's strategy for improving pregnancy outcomes. In recent years, however, a growing recognition of the limits of prenatal care and the importance of maternal health before pregnancy has drawn increasing attention to preconception and internatal care. Internatal care refers to a package of healthcare and ancillary services provided to a woman and her family from the birth of one child to the birth of her next child. For healthy mothers, internatal care offers an opportunity for wellness promotion between pregnancies. For high-risk mothers, internatal care provides strategies for risk reduction before their next pregnancy. In this paper we begin to define the contents of internatal care. The core components of internatal care consist of risk assessment, health promotion, clinical and psychosocial interventions. We identified several priority areas, such as FINDS (family violence, infections, nutrition, depression, and stress) for risk assessment or BBEEFF (breastfeeding, back-to-sleep, exercise, exposures, family planning and folate) for health promotion. Women with chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or weight problems should receive on-going care per clinical guidelines for their evaluation, treatment, and follow-up during the internatal period. For women with prior adverse outcomes such as preterm delivery, we propose an internatal care model based on known etiologic pathways, with the goal of preventing recurrence by addressing these biobehavioral pathways prior to the next pregnancy. We suggest enhancing service integration for women and families, including possibly care coordination and home visitation for selected high-risk women. The primary aim of this paper is to start a dialogue on the content of internatal care. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.

AB  - Aims: To assess the effects of oral pain on oral health-related quality of life during pregnancy and document measures taken by pregnant women seeking relief for oral pain. Their experience of other types of pain were also investigated. Methods: A sample of pregnant women who were admitted to a public hospital to give birth were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. Those who agreed were asked if they had experienced any pain due to problems with their mouth, teeth, or dentures during the 6 months prior to the interviews. Interviewees who answered affirmatively were questioned about the effects of this pain on their normal activities with the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) tool. Results: The study population consisted of 504 subjects (83% of the eligible individuals). A high prevalence of untreated dental caries was found. The prevalences of oral pain, headaches, back pain, and pelvic pain were 39.1%, 61.5%, 59.3%, and 60.9%, respectively. Of those reporting pain, 168 (33.3%) reported having had difficulty doing at least one of the activities included in the OIDP due to oral pain. The most frequently mentioned effects were difficulty in maintaining emotional balance (23.6%), difficulty eating (22.8%), and difficulty cleaning teeth (20%). The mean and median OIDP scores were 13.9% and 8.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Oral pain during pregnancy was an important problem for this group of women and had a negative effect on their quality of life.

AB  - The evolution of our understanding of treatment of asthma begins with assessment of severity which is primarily related to the natural history of the disease. Control is defined as normalizing of the physiologic abnormalities and lessening economic and social burden of the disease. This paper reviews the factors that influence the variability and determinants of asthma control. The tools to validate and access asthma control should be employed in daily clinical practice. Therefore, it is important to determine asthma control based on a multidimensional approach including physiologic assessment, global assessment of functionality, daytime symptoms, nighttime symptoms, healthcare utilization, and adherence to therapy.

AB  - Purpose. The signs and symptoms, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, and options and guidelines for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are reviewed. Summary. RLS was first described in the 17th century and further characterized in 1945. RLS is a common disorder, occurring in about 10% of the population. Patients with RLS often describe the urge to move, uncomfortable sensations, and pain, which begin or worsen during rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting. Symptoms of RLS make sleeping difficult for many patients, and significant daytime difficulties result from the condition. RLS can either be primary or arise from secondary causes that lead to iron deficiency. There is a familial component in primary RLS, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Of individuals with conditions associated with iron-deficiency states, including pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia, 25-30% may develop RLS. The goals of RLS treatment include improving its symptoms and the patient's quality of life. There are limited data on the treatment of RLS. Pharmacologic therapies include iron replacement, dopaminergic agents (e.g., levodopa), dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opi-oids, and benzodiazepines. There have been no systematic trials of nonpharmacologic therapies for RLS, but good sleep hygiene and avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may improve symptoms. Conclusion. RLS is a common disorder thought to involve abnormal iron metabolism and dopaminergic systems. Nonpharmacologic therapy should be suggested for all patients with RLS, but pharmacologic therapy may be required, and evidence is strongest for levodopa and dopamine agonists.

AB  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA = SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ = NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim: To understand the sleep problems in children of 2-6 years old in Changsha as well as its influencing factors. Methods: 650 normal children aged 2-6 years between February and May 2005 were randomly selected from 6 streets, which were randomly selected from 2 administrative areas out of 5 ones. All enrolled subjects were proved to have no preexistent and infection illnesses. Parents were interviewed by self-designed questionnaires about sleep quality of children under strict quality control. The contents of questionnaires included general status, the sleep quality of children in the past month, regain consciousness at night, fall asleep at evening, bed-wetting at night, molar at night, sweatiness in sleeping, the developmental and sickness histories of children since born, condition in pregnant period, basis conditions of family, inhabited environment as well as sleep quality of parents etc. The sleep quality of children included being conscious at night, falling asleep at dusk, bed-wetting at night, night-grinding, sweating in sleeping, somniloquy at night, snoring in sleeping, sleepng lightly with stimulate and crying in sleeping. Each item included 5 levels: never, once in a while, 1-2 times/ week, 3-4 times/week and high frequency. Children were considered to have sleep problems if any item represented as 1-2 times/week or more. Results: A total of 650 questionnaires were sent out and 605 ones were retrieved with the effective rate of 93.1%. 1 The prevalence of sleep problems in Changsha children aged between 2 and 6 years was 34.2% (2.7/ 605), which was 32.0% in male children and was 36.8% in female children. The differences were not significant (χ 2=1.531,P &gt; 0.05). 2 There were no remarkable differences in sleep problems between male and female children (χ 2=0.105-1.808,P &gt; 0.05). 3 The detection rate of sleep problems was the highest (40.6%) in children of 2 years old (F =115.128,P &lt; 0.01). 4 In all sleep problems, the detection rate of sweating much in sleeping at night was higher than other problems in children at different age, and there was no significantly difference in each sleep problem in children among different age group (F=0.074-0.656,P &gt; 0.05).5 The influencing factors of children sleep problems included: attitude of teaching in family, age of child calculated in month, educational years of mother, month-income of family, profession of mother, grinding history in sleeping of mother, methods of childbearing, asphyxiation in coming into the world as well as time of going to sleep at evening of mother. Conclusion: The incidence rate of sleep problems is the highest in Changsha children aged 2 to 6 years. Factors of attitude of teaching in family, age of child, educational years of mother, month income in family, profession of mother, molar in sleeping of mother, methods of childbearing, asphyxiation in coming into the world as well as going to sleep at evening of mother all influencing factors in sleep problems of children. We must pay attention to the prevention and treatment of sleep problems in children.

AB  - The current study investigated the attentional mechanisms associated with goal engagement and disengagement in a lifespan context. Women approaching the end of their childbearing years (N = 29) were compared with women who had passed that deadline (N = 28). Participants' goal engagement was measured with a goal nomination task, an incidental recall task of goal-relevant sentences, visual attention to goal-relevant vs. goal-irrelevant images, and a memory task of goal-relevant images. The attention data indicated that women approaching the deadline had a longer first fixation on baby images than women who had passed the deadline. This novel finding was supported by a replication of the previous finding that women approaching the deadline were more engaged with the goal of childbearing than women who had passed the deadline. The connection between attention and memory of goal-relevant information is explored as evidence of cognition working in the service of motivation and developmental regulation.

AB  - This article examines the question as to what is the right age to reproduce from the biological point of view of its purpose; that of achieving a healthy mother and baby. We start with an assumption that issues surrounding sex, fertility, pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion and childbearing are private and emotionally laden. We are not looking at, nor judging, individual reproductive choices; what might be "right" for one person, or couple, in one context will be unsuitable for another. It is traditional obstetric and gynaecological teaching that human reproductive outcomes are worse at the extremes of maternal age. Yet the advice given in a recent BMJ editorial entitled "Which career first? The securest age for childbearing remains 20-35" appeared to be controversial. The ensuing scientific and media interest raised such headlines as "Horns of the dilemma", "A sinister article", "Late mums face baby misery" and "Are we having children too late? IVF not the answer, say docs". Products have recently appeared on the market offering kits to women to indicate the time left on their 'biological clock' so they can choose whether to continue pursuing their career or try for a baby. Why is there so much interest in the right time to reproduce? Are women (and men) doing something differently compared to the past? If there has been a demographic shift in the age women reproduce (hitherto unexplained), there are important and specific risks older women may face as compared to younger women. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - During the estrous cycle and beginning in estrus, the mammary gland undergoes pregnancy-like development that depends on transcriptional regulation by the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR) and Pax-2 as well as the action of the growth factors Wnt-4 and RANKL. In this report, we first describe the decay and delayed expression of ERα, PR, and Pax-2 proteins as well as depression of Wnt-4 and RANKL mRNA coincident with the strong estrogen surge in proestrus. In time-course studies using ovariectomized mice, a single estrogen injection replicated these delays and caused an 18 h delay in Wnt-4 expression. Molecular time-delay systems are at the core of cellular cycles, most notably the circadian clock, and depend on proteasome degradation of transcriptional regulators that exhibit dedicated timing functions. The cytoplasmic dynamics of these regulators govern delay duration through negative transcription/translation feedback loops. A proteasome inhibitor, PS-341, blocked estrogen-stimulated ERα, PR, and Pax-2 decay and proteasome chymotryptic activity, assayed using a fluorogenic substrate, was elevated in proestrus correlating with the depletion of the transcription factors. The 18-h delay in Wnt-4 induction corresponded to the turnover time of Pax-2 protein in the cytoplasm and was eliminated in Pax-2 knockout mammary tissue, demonstrating that Pax-2 has a unique timing function. The patterns of estrogen-triggered ERα, PR, and Pax-2 turnover were consistent with a negative transcriptional feedback. Retarding the expression of ERα, PR, and Pax-2 may optimize preparations for pregnancy by coordinating expression of critical receptors and transcription factors with rising estrogen and progesterone levels in estrus. The estrogen surge in proestrus has no defined mammotropic function. This study provides the first evidence that it is a synchronizing signal triggering proteasome-dependent turnover of mammary gland ERα, PR, and Pax-2. We hypothesize that the delays reflect a previously unrecognized timing system, which is present in all ovarian target tissues. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that commencing induction of labor in the morning more closely reflects the physiologic timing of onset of labor and is associated with fewer women who remain undelivered 24 hours after cervical ripening and induction begins. METHODS: This was a nested randomized clinical trial, conducted between April 2001 and December 2004. Pregnant women at more than 36+6 weeks gestation with a cephalic presentation who were scheduled for prostaglandin induction of labor were eligible to participate. Women were randomly assigned to either admission in the morning (0800 hours) or admission in the evening (2000 hours). The primary outcome measures were vaginal birth not achieved in 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with associated fetal heart rate changes, and cesarean delivery. RESULTS: A total of 620 women were entered in the trial, with 280 women in the morning admission group and 340 women in the evening admission group. There were no statistically significant differences between the timing of admission for induction and the primary trial outcomes. However, women admitted in the morning were less likely to require oxytocin infusion (morning admission 126 of 280 [45.0%] compared with evening admission 184 of 340 [54.1%]; relative risk 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.70-0.97; P=.022). Nulliparous women admitted in the morning were less likely to require operative vaginal birth (morning admission 10 of 62 [16.1%] compared with evening admission 28 of 82 [34.2%]; relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.90; P=.015). CONCLUSION: For women who require induction of labor, consideration should be given to admission in the morning rather than admission in the evening. © 2006 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Daily stress and sleep deprivation can influence the diurnal pattern of cortisol, which normally consists of high morning levels and a gradual decline throughout the day. While most individuals have consistent declining cortisol concentrations over days, others display either flat or inconsistent profiles. Postpartum mothers experience considerable home demands and sleep deprivation, yet, breastfeeding mothers perceive lower stress and reduced negative mood states compared to bottlefeeders. On the other hand, multiparity (having more than one child) is associated with reduced steepness in diurnal cortisol decline. Interestingly, no study to date has investigated the diurnal cortisol pattern and its stability across days in postpartum women as a function of their choice of infant feeding and parity. In this study, we measured salivary cortisol at four different time points during the day, on two non-consecutive days in first-time (primiparous) and second-time (multiparous) mothers at 5-20 weeks postpartum who were exclusively breastfeeding or bottlefeeding, and in non-postpartum mothers of young children (1-6 years). Among multiparous mothers, we found that cortisol levels in those who were bottlefeeding were higher than in breastfeeding mothers at both awakening and 1600 h. This effect remained significant after controlling for individual differences related to infant feeding choice, such as estradiol levels, education and income. No effect of infant feeding choice on cortisol concentrations was observed in primiparous mothers. While a consistent decline across days was common, some mothers presented a flat or inconsistent profile, a profile that was not associated with infant feeding choice or parity. Importantly, mothers with consistent declining profiles had the highest household income. Our findings suggest that although breastfeeding might promote a tighter regulation of diurnal basal cortisol secretion, in particular for multiparous mothers who are likely to be exposed to greater home demands and maternal responsibilities, some aspects of socioeconomic status such as income can also play a significant role in the stability of diurnal cortisol secretion across days. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: 1) To assess the correlation between urine albumin/ creatinine ratio (ACR) and 24-hour urine albumin excretion in women with pre-eclampsia, 2) to study the influence of potential confounders on this correlation and 3) to assess the variability of ACR between voids during a 24-hour period. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Fetal maternity ward, university hospital. Population: Women with pre-eclampsia scheduled for quantitative albumin measurement with a 24-hour urine collection. Methods: Random urine samples were obtained for analysis of ACRs during the time of 24-hour urine collections in 31 women. ACRs were also measured from the complete 24-hour collections. In five additional women, serial urine samples were obtained during the 24-hour collection. Main outcome measures: Correlation between ACRs and albumin amount in 24-hour urine samples. Variability of the ACRs during a 24-hour collection. Results: The random ACR was poorly correlated to 24-hour excretion of urine albumin (R2 = 0.42). Adjustment for maternal age and nifedipine medication significantly (P = 0.044 and P = 0.023, respectively) improved the correlation (R2 = 0.60). The mean variability (highest/lowest) of ACR during a 24-hour period was 222%. The ACR from the 24-hour collection had an excellent correlation to 24-hour excretion of urine albumin (R2 = 0.96). Conclusions: In women with pre-eclampsia, random ACR is not stable during the day and cannot predict 24-hour urine protein excretion accurately. ACR from the 24-hour collection is an accurate predictor of total albumin amount and can be used to minimise errors from incomplete collections. © RCOG 2006 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

AB  - Prolactin (Prl) has been implicated in reproduction in many mammalian species and is illustrated by the distinctive patterns of secretion during the breeding season, the oestrous cycle and lactation. The recent development of a homologous RIA for measuring the circulating Prl concentrations in brushtail possums has facilitated the reliable measurement of Prl in plasma during different physiological states in this species for the first time. Determination of Prl concentrations during lactation involved the collection of weekly blood samples from eight female possums from the time of parturition through either one or two consecutive lactational cycles. Prl was at baseline levels during early lactation (weeks 0-14 post-partum), and then increased markedly to maximum concentrations at weeks 19-21 before returning to nadir levels at a time coincident with the weaning of pouch young (weeks 23-27). The profile of Prl secretion over the oestrous cycle and in particular at the time of the preovulatory LH surge was obtained from 14 possums during the reproductive cycle, in which preovulatory follicle development and ovulation were monitored by laparoscopy. There was no distinct daily pattern of Prl secretion during the oestrous cycle; however, in 3/4 possums in which a typical preovulatory LH surge was measured, a biphasic preovulatory Prl surge was also observed. The preovulatory Prl surge commenced 2-6 It prior to, and had returned to baseline close to the onset of, the preovulatory LH surge, and a second surge of Prl occurred concomitantly with the delayed preovulatory FSH surge. Seasonality of Prl levels was established from weekly blood samples collected from six barren female possums, and concentrations of Prl were lower during the breeding season compared to the non-breeding season. Additionally, a circadian pattern of Prl secretion was evident in both female and male possums, with Prl levels higher in the morning compared to the afternoon. In conclusion, interpretation of endogenous secretory patterns suggests that Prl may be important during late lactation and at impending ovulation, but the involvement of the circannual rhythm of Prl in the regulation of seasonality in the brushtail possum remains to be determined. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - This exploratory longitudinal study was designed to compare the neonatal illness severity, sleep-wake, and respiratory sleep behaviors of preterm infants whose mothers received prenatal corticosteroids and/or magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) with those of infants whose mothers did not receive these medications. The 134 infants were divided into four groups: those whose mothers received MgSO4 only, those who received steroids only, those who received both MgSO4 and steroids, and those who received neither. The groups did not differ on infant characteristics or illness severity. Infants exposed to MgSO4 had more active sleep without rapid eye movement, indicating poorly organized active sleep. The MgSO4-only group had higher quiet sleep regularity scores and fewer state changes. These findings suggest that fetal exposure to MgSO4 may subtly affect the central nervous system. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In a large HIV-specialty private practice, patients with undetectable or low-grade-positive viral loads with neuropsychiatric side effects or elevated lipids were switched from efavirenz- to nevirapine-based antiretroviral regimens. This is a retrospective analysis of virologic efficacy and changes in adverse neuropsychiatric effects and serum lipid levels after this switch. Forty patients were evaluated. Thirty-six had undetectable viral loads prior to the treatment switch, and their levels remained undetectable after the switch for a median of 25 months (range, 6 to 59 months). Four patients had persistently low-grade-positive viral loads before the switch; viral loads in two of the four patients remained low-grade-positive, while the levels in two patients became undetectable. Twenty patients reporting neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, or fatigue with or without sleep disturbances) before the switch demonstrated significant improvement, with complete resolution of symptoms in 15 patients. Four patients with isolated sleep disturbances had significant improvement. No rash developed in any patient during the switch. Mean lipid levels improved significantly following the switch. Mean total cholesterol decreased 17.8 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 25.5 mg/dL; triglycerides decreased 70.1 mg/dL; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased 5.3 mg/dL (all p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that patients who are virologically controlled on efavirenz-containing regimens with treatment-associated side effects can be successfully switched to nevirapine-containing therapy with maintenance of virologic control, reduction in neuropsychiatric side effects, and improvement in dyslipidemia. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic; its mechanism of action is primarily an antagonism of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The role of ketamine, in particular in lower sub-anaesthetic doses, has recently gained increasing interest in pain management. It has been studied in a considerable number of trials and analysed in meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Based on these data, the primary role of ketamine in such low doses is as an 'anti-hyperalgesic', 'anti-allodynic' or 'tolerance-protective' agent. It therefore has a role in the treatment of opioid resistant or 'pathological' pain (central sensitisation with hyperalgesia or allodynia, opioid induced hyperalgesia, neuropathic pain) rather than as an 'analgesic' in its own right. Low dose ketamine also has 'preventive analgesia' properties. Furthermore, in higher doses it provides effective and safe sedation and analgesia for painful procedures. The place of ketamine in the treatment of chronic pain and the effects of long-term medicinal use remain unclear. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the first part of this article, a critical review of traditional approaches used to estimate daily inhalation rates as a function of age for health risk assessment purposes shows that such rates are not totally reliable due to various biases introduced by both quantitative and qualitative deficiencies regarding certain input parameters. In the second part, the magnitude of under- and overestimations of published inhalation rates derived from each approach is described by a comparison with new sets of physiological daily inhalation rates and distribution percentile values based on total daily energy expenditures (TDEEs) measured by the doubly labeled water (DLW) method. TDEEs are derived from the analysis of deuterium (2H) and heavy oxygen-18 (18O) in urine samples by gas-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry during an aggregate period of over 20,000 days for unrestrained free-living normal-weight individuals aged 2.6 months to 96 years (n = 1252). Regarding physiological values based on DLW measurements, opposite tendencies have been observed between two sets of estimates using time-activity patterns both biased by conservative input data assumptions during sleep and light activities: most estimates based on the time-activity-ventilation approach are overestimated, whereas most of those using metabolic equivalent approach are underestimated. Erroneous food intakes have clearly lead to underestimated rates when used in daily food-energy intake (EFD) and Parameter A approaches. With the latter approach, overestimated basal metabolic rates (BMRs) used in EFD/BMR ratios contribute to the underestimation of inhalation values. Few mean daily inhalation rates and Monte Carlo simulation percentiles based on traditional approaches (57 out of 253) are close to physiological values within a gap of ±5% or less. Aggregate errors in all estimates (in m3/day and m3/kg-day) vary from -52 to +126%. The most accurate daily inhalation rates are those based on DLW measurements with an error of about ±5%, as calculated in previous studies for free-living males and females aged 1 month to 96 years and pregnant and lactating adolescents and women aged 11 to 55 years during real-life situations in their normal surroundings.

AB  - Rapid eye movement sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat. The pedunculopontine nucleus is known to modulate waking and rapid eye movement sleep, and pedunculopontine nucleus neurons are thought to be hyperpolarized by noradrenergic input from the locus coeruleus. The goal of the study was to investigate the possibility that a change in α-2 adrenergic inhibition of pedunculopontine nucleus cells during this period could explain at least part of the developmental decrease in rapid eye movement sleep. We, therefore, recorded intracellularly in 12-21 day rat brainstem slices maintained in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Putative cholinergic vs. non-cholinergic pedunculopontine nucleus neurons were identified using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase histochemistry and intracellular injection of neurobiotin (Texas Red immunocytochemistry). Pedunculopontine nucleus neurons also were identified by intrinsic membrane properties, type I (low threshold spike), type II (A) and type III (A+low threshold spike), as previously described. Clonidine (20 μM) hyperpolarized most cholinergic and non-cholinergic pedunculopontine nucleus cells. This hyperpolarization decreased significantly in amplitude (mean±S.E.) from -6.8±1.0 mV at 12-13 days, to -3.0±0.7 mV at 20-21 days. However, much of these early effects (12-15 days) were indirect such that direct effects (tested following sodium channel blockade with tetrodotoxin (0.3 μM)) resulted in hyperpolarization averaging -3.4±0.5 mV, similar to that evident at 16-21 days. Non-cholinergic cells were less hyperpolarized than cholinergic cells at 12-13 days (-1.6±0.3 mV), but equally hyperpolarized at 20-21 days (-3.3±1.3 mV). In those cells tested, hyperpolarization was blocked by yohimbine, an α-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist (1.5 μM). These results suggest that the α-2 adrenergic receptor on cholinergic pedunculopontine nucleus neurons activated by clonidine may play only a modest role, if any, in the developmental decrease in rapid eye movement sleep. Clonidine blocked or reduced the hyperpolarization-activated inward cation conductance, so that its effects on the firing rate of a specific population of pedunculopontine nucleus neurons could be significant. In conclusion, the α-2 adrenergic input to pedunculopontine nucleus neurons appears to consistently modulate the firing rate of cholinergic and non-cholinergic pedunculopontine nucleus neurons, with important effects on the regulation of sleep-wake states. © 2006 IBRO.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the development of awakenings during preterm and term age in 12 low-risk infants observed between 33 and 40 weeks of post-conceptional age. Waking was been detected through the analysis of body motility. Gross generalized body movements with prolonged startles, marked stretching and writhing was considered as waking, whereas vigorous, forceful abrupt body movements with high frequency tremor sometimes superimposed upon movements were considered as corresponding to crying. Total number of awakenings in the 24 h does not show significant changes with age, whereas the mean duration increases significantly, which is accounted for mainly by those awakenings starting with crying, in particular, during the day. These data suggest a developmental gap between the ability to sustain the waking state, which already starts to increase before term age, and the ability to maintain prolonged sleep episodes, which has been shown to develop later. Furthermore, the developmental difference between awakenings starting with crying and awakenings starting with wakefulness suggests that two kinds of awakenings might be modulated by different factors. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The primary goal of this study was to examine sleep problems in a sample of cocaine-exposed 7-month-old infants and to determine if maternal psychopathology mediated any existing association between substance exposure and sleep behaviors. We also examined the differences in sleep behaviors of cocaine-exposed infants in parental custody and cocaine-exposed infants in nonparental custody. Participants were 65 cocaine-exposed and 53 nonexposed infants and their primary caregivers who were recruited at delivery and assessed at 7 months of infant age. As expected, women who used cocaine during pregnancy had more psychiatric symptoms than nonusers. Prenatal exposure to heavier amounts of cocaine was significantly related to more severe sleep difficulties, and maternal anxiety mediated this association. Approximately 28% of cocaine mothers lost custody of their infants by 7 months of age. Nonmaternal caregivers had significantly fewer symptoms of psychopathology than the cocaine-using women who retained custody of their children. Infants who were in nonparental care at 7 months of age also had less severe sleep problems than did infants who remained in parental care. © 2006 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - A child in his mother's womb is immersed in a bath of stimulations (the ones coming from heart beat, blood flow, breathing, sleep-awake cycle, his mother's voice) and he is able to perceive them through amniotic fluid vibrations. De Casper has shown how, soon after birth, newborns recognize their own mother's voice from other mothers and in respect to his father's voice and that newborns are able to differentiate two different stories and prefer the one they have listened to in the last three months of pregnancy. Another experiment by Hepper has shown that a musical piece in the last three months of pregnancy is recognized by newborns. It seem evident that there is between mother and child a prenatal bond made of sounds.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine patient treatment preferences and satisfaction with an office-based procedure for early pregnancy failure and to compare resource use and cost between office and operating room management of early pregnancy failure. METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study of 165 women presenting for surgical management of early pregnancy failure. Participants completed a preoperative questionnaire addressing treatment preferences and expectations and a postoperative questionnaire measuring level of pain experienced and satisfaction with care. Resource use was determined by measuring the time patients spent at the health care facility and the actual procedure time. Cost was estimated using an institutional database. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen women from the office and 50 from the operating room were enrolled. Patients selecting outpatient management scored "privacy," "avoiding going to sleep," and "previous experience" higher than the operating room group (P < .05). Patients who perceived that their physicians preferred one procedure over the other were more likely to select that procedure (P < .001). Satisfaction was high in both groups, and underestimating the procedure's discomfort was negatively associated with satisfaction (P < .002). Costs were greater than two-fold higher in the operating room group compared with the office group (P < .01). Complications were uncommon, but hemorrhage-related complications were four times more common in the operating room group than in the office group (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Office-based surgical management of early pregnancy failure is an acceptable option for many women and offers substantial resource and cost savings. © 2006 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the prevalence of nocturnal symptoms in a large sample of asthmatic patients, and to assess the agreement between patients' complaints and general practitioners' (GPs') reports in primary care. Design. Cross-sectional survey involved 3,526 GPs and 751 specialists (pulmonologists and allergists) and included 13,493 patients with persistent asthma. Symptoms, treatment, and social and medical data were collected in real time by the patients and their GPs. Setting. France. Results. Prevalence of nocturnal symptoms was 60%. A total of 7,989 patients with nocturnal symptoms had complete data for both patients and GPs; 3,849 (48.1%) had perfect agreement between GP and their complaints for nocturnal symptoms (agreement group; [kappa = 1]); 3,376(42.2%) declared having no symptoms during the night, but these were detected by the GP during the visit (underestimated by patients and detected by GPs); 773(9.6%) declared having nocturnal symptoms, but these were not detected by GPs. Patients with a good agreement with their GP's opinion were significantly more frequently followed-up by a specialist than other patients ( p = 0.002). Conclusions. Nocturnal symptoms appear to be underdeclared by patients. GPs should therefore systematically ask their patients about nocturnal symptoms to increase control of asthma and to adequately manage its treatment. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) continues to be the most common cause of postneonatal infant death. SIDS is a complex, multifactorial disorder, the cause of which is still not fully understood. However, much is known now about environmental risk factors, some of which are modifiable. These include maternal and antenatal risk factors such as smoking during pregnancy, as well as infant-related risk factors such as non-supine sleeping position and soft bedding. Emerging evidence also substantiates an expanding number of genetic risk factors. Interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors may be of critical importance in determining an infant's actual risk of SIDS. Although no practical way exists to identify which infants will die of SIDS, nor is there a safe and proven prevention strategy even if identification were feasible, reducing exposure to modifiable risk factors has helped to lower the incidence of SIDS. Current challenges include wider dissemination of guidelines to all people who care for infants, dissemination of guidelines in culturally appropriate ways, and surveillance of SIDS trends and other outcomes associated with implementation of these guidelines. © 2006 CMA Media Inc.

AB  - Persons with mental retardation are living longer and integrating into their communities. Primary medical care of persons with mental retardation should involve continuity of care, maintenance of comprehensive treatment documentation, routine periodic health screening, and an understanding of the unique medical and behavioral disorders common to this population. Office visits can be successful if physicians familiarize patients with the office and staff, plan for difficult behaviors, and administer mild sedation when appropriate. Some syndromes that cause mental retardation have specific medical and behavioral features. Health issues in these patients include respiratory problems, gastrointestinal disorders, challenging behaviors, and neurologic conditions. Some commonly overlooked health concerns are sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, and end-of-life decisions. Copyright © 2006 American Academy of Family Physicians.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome, which can be defined as a group of recognisable patterns of symptoms or abnormalities that indicate a particular medical situation. The current definition of PCOS requires the presence of two of the following three conditions: (i) oligo- and/or anovulation; (ii) clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism; and (iii) polycystic ovaries - and the exclusion of other aetiologies. It is generally accepted that the prevalence of PCOS is approximately 5-10%, and that of polycystic ovaries alone is 21-23%. Other features of PCOS are obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnoea and infertility. An approach to a patient with possible PCOS should be directed towards making a diagnosis and screening for associated endocrine abnormalities. Therapeutic interventions are directed towards addressing the needs of the patient at present and towards preventing long-term complications of the syndrome. Body mass index, which is a primary mediator in the relationship between PCOS and health-related quality of life in obese PCOS adolescents, may play a similar role in other PCOS patients. Any intervention directed at reducing central obesity will not only improve quality of life but also correct hyperinsulinism and improve fertility and lipid and androgen profiles. It is also the only currently available intervention that can have a lifelong impact on reducing possible long-term complications of the syndrome. Lifestyle modification is the cardinal intervention. Pharmacological treatments are available for specific indications. Infertility can be treated with clomifene (clomiphene citrate), metformin, gonadotropins or surgery to the ovaries. Cyproterone (alone or in combination with ethinylestradiol) and spironolactone are the main drugs used in the treatment of hirsutism. Other drugs that can be considered include flutamide, ketoconazole and finasteride. Women with PCOS require ongoing surveillance to detect impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidaemia, endometrial hyperplasia and consequent complications. Obese women, in particular, require regular glucose tolerance testing because of the potential for rapid progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. The focus of this article is the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of this common endocrine disorder. Diagnostic and co-morbid features are discussed separately to facilitate understanding of PCOS. Symptom-directed strategies, as well as short- and long-term goals of treatment, are outlined. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pregnancy is a unique immunological state. Pregnancy neutrophils differ from those of non-pregnant women as they cannot be fully activated for oxidant production, but yet have higher levels of unstimulated oxidant production. Although reduced activation is due to decreased hexose monophosphate shunt activity, the mechanism enhancing basal oxidant levels is unknown. We hypothesize that myeloperoxidase (MPO) trafficking affects the basal oxidant release by maternal neutrophils. Immunofluorescence microscopy has demonstrated MPO at the surface of pregnancy neutrophils, whereas non-pregnancy cells do not exhibit surface MPO. Adherent pregnancy neutrophils were characterized by high-amplitude metabolic oscillations, which were blocked by MPO inactivation. Conversely, metabolic oscillatory amplitudes of control neutrophils were heightened by incubation with PMA or exogenous MPO. Importantly, MPO decoration of cell surfaces and high-amplitude metabolic oscillations were observed for neutrophils from pregnant but not from non-pregnant mice. However, cells from pregnant MPO knockout mice did not exhibit MPO expression or high-amplitude metabolic oscillations. Unstimulated neutrophils from pregnant women were found to release reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), but cells from non-pregnant women did not. MPO inhibition returned ROM and RNI formation to non-pregnant levels. Hence, MPO trafficking influences metabolic activity and oxidant production in pregnancy. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Background: Circadian (and daily) rhythms are physiological events that oscillate with a 24-hour period. Circadian disruptions may hamper the immune response against infection and cancer. Several immune mechanisms, such as natural killer (NK) cell function, follow a daily rhythm. Although ethanol is known to be a potent toxin for many systems in the developing fetus, including the immune system, the long-term effects of fetal ethanol exposure on circadian immune function have not been explored. Methods: Daily rhythms of cytotoxic factors (granzyme B and perforin), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and NK cell cytotoxic activity were determined in the spleens of adult male rats obtained from mothers who were fed during pregnancy with chow food or an ethanol-containing liquid diet or pair-fed an isocaloric liquid diet. Results: We found that adult rats exposed to ethanol during their fetal life showed a significant alteration in the physiological rhythms of granzyme B and IFN-γ that was associated with decreased NK cell cytotoxic activity. Conclusion: These data suggest that fetal ethanol exposure causes a permanent alteration of specific immune rhythms that may in part underlie the immune impairment observed in children prenatally exposed to alcohol.

AB  - Several conditions are associated with insulin resistance (IR), and the mechanism behind this state is multifactorial. Pathological states (such as visceral obesity, low energy expenditure, high carbohydrate consumption, and sleep deprivation) and more physiological states (such as puberty and pregnancy) will lead to increased IR. During puberty, the high levels of sex steroids as well as the high levels of growth hormone (GH) are responsible for decreased insulin sensitivity. During pregnancy, the high levels of several diabetogenic hormones lead to a state of IR. A pronounced physiological decrease in peripheral insulin sensitivity occurs as pregnancy proceeds. In contrast, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pathological state of carbohydrate intolerance beginning or first recognized during pregnancy, which leads to increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Obese women, an increasing part of the fertile female population, develop a more pronounced IR during pregnancy, with a higher risk of developing GDM. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Colonoscopy is the most commonly used technique for inspection of the colonic mucosa. The safety and effectiveness of colonoscopy in identifying important colonic pathology is directly impacted by the quality of the bowel preparation performed in anticipation of the procedure. Physicians favor preparations associated with the best patient compliance to achieve the best results. Patients favor preparations that are low in volume, palatable, have easy to complete regimens, and are reimbursed by health insurance or are inexpensive. Both patients and physicians favor preparations that are safe to administer in light of existing comorbid conditions and those that will not interact with previously prescribed medications. Aqueous NaP solutions, NaP tablets, and PEG solutions, especially low-volume solutions, are all accepted and well tolerated by the majority of patients undergoing bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Physicians are advised to select a preparation for each patient based on the safety profile of the agent, NaP or PEG, in light of the overall health of the patient, their comorbid conditions, and currently prescribed medications. In certain circumstances, such as bowel preparation in children, elderly patients, patients with renal insufficiency, and those with hypertension who are receiving ACE inhibitors or ARBs, it may be advisable to adhere to PEG-based solutions because of the risks of occult physiologic disturbances that may potentially contraindicate the use of NaP-based regimens. A variety of other preparations, none of which seems as popular because of inferior efficacy and/or patient acceptance, remain available for use in other circumstances in which bowel preparation is necessary. Many adjuncts to bowel preparation have been proposed but remain largely inefficacious and therefore cannot be recommended for routine use. © 2006 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

AB  - Sleep and wake disorders are still under recognised in occupational medicine. Sometimes, they are not due to work conditions, but heightened by them and may impact the work by itself. Sometimes, they are directly caused by work conditions, particularly by night work and shift work which concern 20% of the active population. The consequences of these disorders are potentially severe for individuals (motor vehicle accidents and work accidents, mistakes at works, intestine diseases, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders, fertility and pregnancy, and some kind of cancers). They may also impact dramatically society, as miscellaneous international catastrophes have demonstrated it recently. With the simple use of validated screening tools (sleep questionnaires, Epworth sleepiness scale, sleep logs), work practitioners have the opportunity of detecting sleep and vigilance disorders, following particularly the obligation of a bi annual rhythm of medical visits installed for shift and night workers in 2003. After primary screening, workers with sleep/wake disorders may be opportunely oriented to more complete examination (actimetry, polygraphy, ambulatory polysomnography, Multiple Sleep Latency Test). Some of them would also be followed to assess the efficacy of treatments on vigilance (Multiple Wakefulness Test). © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Bipolar disorders are reported to have a high incidence during childbearing years and the need may arise to start or continue a pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In the last few years several investigations have evaluated the efficacy of emerging mood-stabilizing agents in the treatment of bipolar disorders, such as lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone. A number of studies, which examined the use of oxcarbazepine, point to its potential usefulness in prophylactic treatment. The aim of this review is to compare information from the literature on the safety of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine to the safety data on classic mood stabilizers during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Methods: A computerized search carried out from 1980 to April 5, 2006 led to the summarization of the results. (References were updated after acceptance and prior to publication.) Results: Emerging mood stabilizers show uncertain safety parameters in pregnancy and lactation. Limited information on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine does not suggest a clear increase in teratogenicity, while olanzapine appears to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications in pregnant women. Data about risperidone and quetiapine are still inconclusive. Finally, the literature on the safety of these compounds in breastfeeding is anecdotal. Conclusions: Untreated pregnant bipolar women are at an increased risk of poor obstetrical outcomes and relapse of a.ective symptoms. On the other hand, classic antiepileptic drugs are well-known human teratogens, whereas data on lithium are partially ambiguous. The safety of emerging mood stabilizers in pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been examined extensively. Therefore, when approaching bipolar disorder, if possible, each episode must be considered separately. Copyright © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.

AB  - Based on an overview of the literature, this contribution critically discusses the importance of non-alimentary trigger factors of migraine and tension-type headache. Menstruation, environmental factors, psychological effects as well as sleep disorders and fatigue are mentioned most frequently. According to controlled studies, menstruation is indubitably associated with an increased risk of headache. Although a correlation between specific meteorological parameters and the appearance of headaches was established in some patients, the subjective observations of the patients did not however correlate with the objective weather data. Sensory stimuli function as triggers particularly for migraine with aura. Psychological factors, especially stress and everyday pressures, have been confirmed as trigger factors, but further prospective trials addressing this issue would be advantageous. Additional studies are also needed to elucidate the significance of sleep (disorders) and fatigue since their importance as triggers or symptoms of a headache attack has not been conclusively determined. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2005.

AB  - Purpose of review: Endometrial cancer can affect reproductive-age women who may desire fertility preservation. This article discusses the current, available data about conservative management of endometrial cancer in young women. Recent findings: Reproductive-age women with well differentiated endometrial carcinoma have an overall favorable prognosis provided that the tumor is identified at an early, noninvasive stage; however, advanced disease can be present. This article discusses current modalities to evaluate and clinically stage endometrial cancer including hysteroscopy, dilation and curettage, pelvic ultrasound, abdominopelvic computed tomography scan, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, tumor marker CA125 level, and surgical exploration with laparoscopy or laparotomy. Thorough evaluation is critical as 10 to 29% of young women with endometrial cancer have a synchronous ovarian malignancy. Detailed counseling about the risks and benefits of conservative management, and expectations for fertility after treatment, surveillance, and definitive surgical management is essential. Multiple effective protocols exist for conservative treatment of endometrial cancer, and the initial response rates are as high as 57 to 75%. Successful pregnancies have occurred after conservative management, spontaneously, and with assisted reproductive technologies. Summary: There are no standard recommendations for selection of appropriate women, treatment protocols, or long-term surveillance for conservative management of clinical stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma, and larger prospective clinical studies are warranted. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether parental psychological and physical factors and child factors measured in the first year of life were associated with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children at age 63/4 years. Method: A longitudinal cohort study (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), followed 8,272 children from pregnancy to age 63/4 years. Parental reports of child and parent functioning were gathered. Associations between parental and child functioning assessed at 6 to 8 months postpartum, and RAP measured at age 63/4 years were investigated. Results: The prevalence of RAP in this sample was 11.8%. Both maternal anxiety (adjusted odds ratio = 1.53; 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.89) and paternal anxiety (adjusted odds ratio = 1.38; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.71) in the first year of a child's life were associated with later childhood RAP. Parent reports of child temperament features such as irregular feeding and sleeping were also associated with later RAP. Conclusions: This is the first evidence from a prospective study that anxiety in both mothers and fathers and child temperament features predate the occurrence of RAP in children. These findings highlight the potential importance of addressing parental anxiety in families in which children present with RAP, although some caution should be exercised in their interpretation because of possible reporting bias. © 2006 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc. ) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often "covered" by the presence of physical symp-toms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the "obvious consequence" of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing. The aim of our observation is to reconsider the importance of a complete psychopathological assessment of patients with physical/somatic complaints. This is important for two main reasons: 1) to consider physical complaints as a part of a more complicated syndrome; 2) to achieve as a treatment goal, a remission and not only a reduction of frequency or intensity of these symptoms. Findings from the literature show that physical symptoms may precede and follow major mood episodes, and may contribute, as residual manifestations, to increasing the risk or relapse or recurrence. Our aim is to consider as a new treatment option, these drugs that seem to be as equally effective on mood as on physical symptoms (SNRI). A new SNRI (duloxetine) seems to be useful in order to improve mood symptomatology during acute major depression episodes and to reduce distress due to the persistance of physical symptoms.

AB  - Background: Disruptions in sleep and feeding rhythms are among the consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. Previously, we reported that ethanol exposure during the second trimester equivalent in rats produces long-lasting impairments in circadian system functioning. In the present study, we examined the effects of ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt on the development of the circadian clock system. Methods: Sprague-Dawley male rat pups were exposed to 6.0 g/kg/d ethanol via an artificial rearing procedure on postnatal days (PD) 4 through 9 (EtOH). An artificially reared gastrostomized control group and a normally reared suckle control group were also included. At 10 to 12 weeks of age, wheel-running behavior was measured continuously under a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark (LD) cycle. Thereafter, subjects were exposed to a 6-hour phase delay of the LD cycle, and the ability to adjust to the new LD cycle was evaluated. Results: Before the phase delay, onset time of activity and acrophases of activity in all 3 groups were not significantly different from one another. After the 6-hour LD cycle delay, EtOH subjects were slower to adapt to the new cycle compared with both control groups, as measured by both activity onset and acrophase. Throughout the experiment, activity levels of EtOH subjects tended to be higher compared to both controls. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that ethanol exposure during the third trimester disrupts the ability to synchronize circadian rhythm to light cues. Disruptions in circadian regulation may cause abnormal behavioral rhythmicity, such as disrupted sleep and feeding patterns, as seen in individuals prenatally exposed to ethanol.

AB  - Sleep-wake disturbances and stress hyper-responsiveness have been observed in human neonates, children and adolescents who were exposed to alcohol during the prenatal period. Using the laboratory rat as an animal model, we investigated whether fetal ethanol exposure during gestational days 10-21 affects the circadian function of the stress-axis regulatory β-endorphin neurons in the hypothalamus. Fetal ethanol-exposed rats showed abnormality in the circadian expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA encoding the peptide β-endorphin in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus during the adult period. These rats also showed altered circadian expression of the clock governing Period genes rPer1, rPer2 and rPer3, in the arcuate nucleus, and rPer1 and rPer 2 mRNA levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Laser captured microdissection analysis identified constitutive expression of rPer1, rPer2 and rPer3 genes in β-endorphin-containing neurons. These data suggest for the first time that fetal exposure to ethanol significantly alters the clock mechanisms governing the circadian function of β-endorphin neurons. © 2006 International Society for Neurochemistry.

AB  - A model of the development of L/M cone ratios in the Old World primate retina is presented. It is supposed that during gestation, the cone cycles randomly between states in which it transcribes either L or M opsin. The current state determines and increases the probability that it will transcribe the same opsin in future cycles. These assumptions are sufficient to formalize the process as a Markov chain that can be modeled as an urn containing two types of balls, L and M. Drawing one ball results in the increase of its species and the decrease of the other. Over the long run, the urn will become populated with a single type of ball. This state corresponds to the photoreceptor adopting a fixed identity for its lifetime. We investigate the effect of the number of states and the rule that regulates the advantage of transition toward one cone type or another on the relation between fetal and adult L/M cone ratios. In the range of 100 to 1000 states, small variations of the initial L/M ratio or the transition advantage can each generate large changes in the final L/M ratio, in qualitative accord with the variation seen in human adult retinas. The time course to attain stable L/M ratios also varies with these parameters. If it is believed that the cycling follows a circadian rhythm, then final L/M cone ratios would be expected to stabilize shortly after birth in the human being and the macaque.

AB  - Many popular varieties of commercially sold fish, including tilefish, seabass, shark, and swordfish, contain enough mercury so that eating them once or twice a month can lead to high mercury body burdens. Wisconsin has issued mercury-based sport-fish consumption advice to people of all ages since 1985. Wisconsin's advisory was revised in 2000 to address all inland waters and again in 2004 to integrate information about sport-caught fish with advice for commercially sold fish. Because of the increased popularity of fish as a source of dietary protein, a significant percentage of the US population may be at risk of methylmercury-induced health problems. Although several studies have assessed mercury exposure among children and women of child-bearing age, very little is known about mercury body burdens among men or postmenopausal women. This article describes fish consumption and mercury exposure among 14 people who consumed fish twice a week or more and 1 person who ate no fish. Steady-state blood mercury levels available for 10 adults and 1 child ranged from <5 to 58 μg/L and correlated well with dietary mercury intake estimates. Three of these individuals reported vague, subclinical symptoms such as mental confusion, sleep difficulty, balance problems, or visual disturbances, which improved after their mercury levels returned to normal. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Among women of reproductive age, having children and careers often collide. As many men and women pursue careers, many have doubts as to when and whether they want to have children. At issue is combining childrearing with educational-professional development and accepting the loss of personal freedom that comes with building a family. These men and women are falsely reassured by popular beliefs that steroid contraception delays reproductive aging and that advances in new reproductive technologies can compensate for the age-related decline in fertility. As a result, women and their partners postpone childbearing without fully understanding the possible consequences. Yet age is the single most important determinant of male and female fertility-natural or treated. © 2006 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are essential for normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity; however, recent studies warn that exposure to excess endogenous or synthetic glucocorticoid during a specific period of prenatal development adversely affects HPA axis stability. We administered dexamethasone (DEX) to pregnant rats during the last week of gestation and investigated subsequent HPA axis regulation in adult male offspring in unrestrained and restraint-stressed conditions. With the use of real-time PCR and RIA, we examined the expression of regulatory genes in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and pituitary, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), arginine vasopressin (AVP), glucocorticoid receptors (GR), mineralcorticoid receptors (MR), and 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11β-HSD-1), as well as the main HPA axis hormones, adrenal corticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT). Our results demonstrate that the DEX-exposed group exhibited an overall change in the pattern of gene expression and hormone levels in the unrestrained animals. These changes included an upregulation of CRH in the hypothalamus, a downregulation of MR with a concomitant upregulation of 11β-HSD-1 in the hippocampus, and an increase in circulating levels of both ACTH and CORT relative to unrestrained control animals. Interestingly, both DEX-exposed and control rats exhibited an increase in pituitary GR mRNA levels following a 1-h recovery from restraint stress; however, the increased expression in DEX-exposed rats was significantly less and was associated with a slower return to baseline CORT compared with controls. In addition, circulating levels of ACTH and CORT as well as hypothalamic CRH and hippocampal 11β-HSD-1 expression levels were significantly higher in the DEX-exposed group compared with controls following restraint stress. Taken together, these data demonstrate that late-gestation DEX exposure in rats is associated with persistent changes in both the modulation of HPA axis activity and the HPA axis-mediated response to stress.

AB  - Background: Exenatide is a subcutaneously injected incretin mimetic. It is indicated as adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are already receiving therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or both but continue to have suboptimal glycemic control. Objective: This article reviews available information on the clinical pharmacology, comparative efficacy, tolerability, drug interactions, contraindications and precautions, dosage and administration, availability and storage, and cost of exenatide. Methods: MEDLINE (1966-April 2006) and Web of Science (1995-April 2006) were searched for original research and review articles published in the English language. The search terms used were exenatide, exendin-4, glucagon-Like peptide-1, GLP-1, and incretin mimetic. The reference lists of identified articles were also consulted, as was selected information from the package insert for exenatide. All relevant comparative efficacy studies that were available in published form were included in the review. Results: Naturally occurring incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), exhibit insulinotropic properties after release into the circulation from the gut. As a GLP-1 agonist, exenatide improves glucose homeostasis by mimicking the actions of naturally occurring GLP-1. It improves glycemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations through a combination of known mechanisms, including glucose-dependent insulin secretion, restoration of first-phase insulin response, regulation of glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and decreasing food intake. Three Phase III comparative efficacy trials were identified that enrolled a total of 1446 patients who received exenatide 5 pg SC BID, exenatide 10 μg SC BID, or placebo for 30 weeks in addition to their existing therapy with metformin, sulfonylurea, or both. In these trials, the addition of exenatide was associated with significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values (P &lt; 0.001-P &lt; 0.002), greater proportions of patients achieving an HbA1c ≤7%, significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose concentrations (P &lt; 0.001-P &lt; 0.005), and a dose-dependent progressive weight loss compared with placebo. Nausea (43.5%) was the most commonly reported adverse event in the combined exenatide groups. Other adverse events occurring in &gt;10% of patients receiving exenatide were hypoglycemia (19.6%), diarrhea (12.8%), and vomiting (12.8%). Conclusions: During clinical trials, exenatide added to existing metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy in patients with T2DM reduced fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, with improvements in HbA1c and modest weight loss. The main adverse effect associated with exenatide therapy was nausea. © 2006 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

AB  - The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in 2001 that 51% of married women return to the work force before their children are 1 year old (Rojjanasrirat, 2004). Women's roles in the United States are rapidly changing, and the workplace environment is also changing to meet the added demands of women in the work force. Many women assimilate the multiple roles of wife, mother, and working professional into a cohesive unit; however, this is often difficult. Occupational health nurses play a vital role advocating for women in the work force. A critical area of advocacy (and education) focuses on providing necessary support to pregnant employees.

AB  - In Western countries, 5-11% of all infants are born before 37 weeks of gestation, and with improvements in modern intensive care techniques the number of these preterm infants that survive continues to increase. Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality in developed countries, accounting for 60-80% of infant deaths in those without congenital anomalies. Furthermore, in the post-neonatal period, preterm infants are at four-times greater risk of sudden infant death syndrome. It has been suggested that this increased risk is due to immature autonomic control. This article provides an overview of studies assessing autonomic control of the cardiovascular system in preterm infants. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a noninvasive diagnostic method performed for 24-48 hours, along with daily activities and during sleep, thus being highly useful in cases where the need of antihypertensive medication should be evaluated, in patients with suspected white coat hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, hypertension resistant to combined therapy, and those with borderline hypertension. ABPM helps in the evaluation of the prescribed therapy effects, hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, hypertension in pregnancy, in the elderly and type 1 diabetics, as well as in elucidation of syncopal states and "accidental" hypertension. With appropriate use of ABPM the optimal therapeutic effect can be achieved and the risk of arterial hypertension sequels assessed.

AB  - Purpose: The use of phytotherapy is growing worldwide, but the popular perception is that this kind of approach is natural and therefore safer than traditional medicine; for this reason the use is frequently not communicated to the doctor. Instead, even if many herbal remedies are benign in nature, some of these therapies have potentially harmful side effects or adverse interactions with other medications. So, the purpose of our study was to analyze the behavior patterns and decision-making modalities about herbal remedy use among a sample of Italian women. Methods: During a 5-month period, interviews to women attending the outpatient ambulatory of an urban university general hospital were made on the basis of a pre-structured 25-item questionnaire. Results: Among a random study population of 1044 subsequent patients, 491 women (47.03%) reported to have been taking one or more herbal products in the last year, sometimes used during pregnancy or given to their children (35.23%). The 10 most frequently used herbal products reported were propolis, aloe, valerian root, blueberry, fennel, dandelion, mallow, arnica, thyme, and Echinacea. The major purposes for using these products were to stimulate the immune system and to cure respiratory problems. 47/491 (9.57%) women reported side effects, but only 36% referred to the doctor. In most of the cases, herbal products were taken in combination with drugs (44.61%) or homeopathic treatments (11.81%). The majority of our women did not obtain information about this kind of therapy from a health care provider (72.71%). Conclusions: The present survey highlights the general use of phytomedicines by a sample of Italian women, the potential risk of their confidence with the 'natural world,' and the lack of discussion on this argument with doctors and pharmacists. This suggests the importance of training for health care providers and the need of informational programs for consumers. Copyright ©2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is an effective treatment for smoking cessation, but as with all such pharmacotherapies, the majority of smokers who use NRT products do not stop smoking or remain abstinent long term. Treatment outcome is affected by a range of individual-specific factors, as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of each NRT formulation. This has led to speculation that abstinence rates could be improved if NRT treatments were individually tailored to best match each individual's needs and preferences. There are also populations for whom special product and dosage considerations are warranted to maximise treatment safety. This paper reviews the rationale for NRT treatment, standard dose recommendations and recommendations for how to best match NRT treatment to the specific needs of individual smokers. We also review emerging evidence that genetic profiling may one day be a useful consideration for tailoring NRT treatment. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a case of restless legs syndrome that improved after intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. A 34-year-old gravida 1 para 0 woman, with a 13-year history of restless legs syndrome, was prescribed bed rest due to pre-term labor at 26 weeks. While at rest, the subject experienced severe restless legs syndrome. The subject was later admitted to the hospital for pre-term labor. Treatment for pre-term labor included intravenous magnesium sulfate. RLS symptoms completely resolved during treatment, beginning the first day of administration. Studies involving intravenous magnesium treatment for restless legs syndrome have not included pregnant women. The authors propose that intravenous magnesium sulfate may alleviate restless legs syndrome in some pregnant women.

AB  - This review summarizes studies of sleep and other biological rhythms during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the postpartum period, focusing, where feasible, on studies in women who met DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th edition) criteria for a depressive disorder compared with healthy controls. The aim was to review supporting evidence for the hypothesis that disruption of the normal temporal relationship between sleep and other biological rhythms such as melatonin, core body temperature, cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or prolactin occurring during times of reproductive hormonal change precipitates depressive disorders in predisposed women. Treatment strategies, designed to correct these altered phase (timing) or amplitude abnormalities, thereby improve mood. Although there may be some common features to premenstrual, pregnancy and postpartum depressive disorders (e.g. elevated prolactin levels), a specific profile of sleep and biological rhythms distinguishes healthy from depressed women during each reproductive epoch. Further work is needed to characterize more fully the particular abnormalities associated with each reproductive state to identify common versus distinctive features for each diagnostic group. This information could serve as the basis for developing more targeted treatment strategies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Duration and intensity of lordosis is mediated by actions of the progesterone (P) metabolite, 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (3α,5α-THP) at GABA A receptors in the midbrain ventral tegmental area. Because rats selectively bred for infantile vocalizations may differ in endogenous 3α,5α-THP secretion, their sexual behavior, midbrain, and plasma 3α,5α-THP levels as adult rats in behavioral estrus was examined. Rats bred for high rates of infantile vocalizations had shorter latencies and intervals between intromissions and ejaculation, higher lordosis quotients and ratings, more pacing of their sexual contacts, and had higher P and 3α,5α-THP levels in plasma and midbrain than did rats bred for low rats of infantile vocalizations. Thus, levels of 3α,5α-THP in the midbrain are associated with differences in sexual behavior of these rats. Copyright 2006 by the American Psychological Association.

AB  - Heartbeat fluctuations show fractal-like correlations that are associated with highly adaptive cardiovascular regulatory systems. Moreover, the short-range fractal or scaling exponent α1 extracted from these correlations has been found to be a predictor of mortality for subjects with an impaired left ventricular function. In general, the RR-interval data required for this analysis are derived from long-term ECG recordings during free-running conditions. Yet short-term recordings are more likely to be obtained in some practical circumstances, so becoming relevant to assess the possibility of obtaining representative α1 exponents from these recordings. Here, we compare the α1 exponents extracted from the RR-interval series (9:00 am-6:00 pm) of 51 healthy adults in normal sinus rhythm and the α1 calculated from three shorted segments of only 700 beats obtained from the same series at 9:00 am, 1:30 pm and 5:00 pm. We found no significant differences between the scaling exponents derived from the whole 9 h series and the short segments at 9:00 am and 5:00 pm, but did find significant differences when comparing the whole series with the short segment at 1:30 pm. Thus, only if the time of day is taken into consideration can short segments of heartbeat fluctuation data be used to obtain representative α1 exponents. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Previous work has demonstrated that two synthetic peptides can prevent prenatal alcohol-induced damage as assessed by prevention of learning abnormalities in adult offspring as well as improve outcome from traumatic brain damage. The current studies were undertaken to evaluate whether these peptides could enhance performance in a learning and memory paradigm when administered either prenatally or to aged mice. Study design: For prenatal treatment, C57Bl6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with 1 oral administration of D-NAP or D-SAL alone or D-NAP+D-SAL or a double dose of D-SAL. Control groups were same-regimen treated with vehicle alone. Learning was assessed in adult male offspring (35-50 days) by using the Morris water maze. To evaluate aged animals, 12-month-old mice were treated with D-NAP and D-SAL or vehicle alone daily and tested on the Morris water maze. Results: Offspring exposed prenatally to D-NAP+D-SAL learned significantly faster than controls, with an earlier onset of learning and an overall decreased latency to find the hidden platform (P < .05). Animals exposed prenatally to either D-NAP or D-SAL alone learned similar to control, with a trend toward faster latencies. Aged animals who received D-NAP+D-SAL learned significantly faster than age-matched controls, with an earlier onset of learning (P < .05). Conclusion: Combined D-NAP+D-SAL enhanced learning in healthy young mice and aged mice. These findings suggest potential therapeutic interventions not only during a critical developmental period, but also in aged animals. © 2006 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. - To investigate the frequency of main symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrom (OSAS) and their relationship with Pregnancy Induced-Hypertension (PIH) as well as Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IGR) as suggested by recent studies. Methodology. - Four hundred (and) thirty-eight enquiry forms completed during post-partum period were analysed, after exclusion of multiple pregnancies. Collected data were demographic characteristics, obstetrical events, sleep disorders during last trimester, screening of snoring and vigilance troubles with an Epworth score. Results. - Forty-five percentages of the patients reported to have habitual snoring during pregnancy. Among these, 85% were non-snorers before pregnancy. Daytime somnolence concerned 84,5% of the population with an Epworth score significatively increased (P < 0,0001). The prevalence of PIH was found to be 4,5%, with two apparently independent risk factors: the body mass index (OR = 1,1) and an association between snoring and increased vigilance trouble (OR = 2,6). No statistical difference was found concerning IGR. Conclusions. - SAS symptoms are frequent during pregnancy and snoring appears to be linked with PIH. However, polysomnographic data are not yet sufficient to explain pathophysiological mechanisms and find relevant diagnostic markers during pregnancy. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 20 weeks). They were designated depressed (N = 172) or nondepressed (N = 258) on the Structured Clinical Interview of Depression (SCID) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). They were given a second assessment when they were approximately 32 weeks gestational age. At both assessments they were given self-report measures (CES-D, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the State Anger Inventory) and provided urine samples for assays of cortisol, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) and serotonin. They were also given the VITAS scale for lower back pain and leg pain and a sleep disturbance scale. The stability of mood states and biochemistry across pregnancy (20 and 32 weeks) were assessed inasmuch as mood states, and biochemistry have been noted to predict prematurity and low birthweight. Significant correlations were noted for all variables except serotonin. Relationships between mood states and biochemistry were also noted but only between cortisol and depression, cortisol and anxiety, and epinephrine and anxiety. Significant stability was noted between the 20-week measures and the 32-week measures including depression, anxiety, anger, and cortisol. These were, in turn, correlated with each other and with, low back pain, leg pain, and sleep disturbance. These data suggest the stability of mood states and cortisol across pregnancy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A novel bioanalysis system based on immunochromatography was developed in connection with a nitrocellulose resin-modified micropipette tip, namely as ZipTip®. The sandwich-type immunoassay was applied to our bioananalysis system. The first antibodies that were aspirated by the micropipette were immobilized on the immunochromatographic resin at the edge of micropipette tip. The blocking solution was also aspirated in the same fashion. The measurement operation was performed by aspirating the sample solution, and then the gold colloidal nanoparticles (Au naps) conjugated secondary antibody solution. Since this bioanalysis system utilizes a micropipette, it is possible to increase the sample volume, which would enable the detection of antigen at low concentrations. In addition, the washing procedure can also be performed easily to reduce the background level. After the antigen-antibody reaction, the color intensity of Au naps could be observed by the naked eye. For analytical evaluation, the color intensity was captured by a scanner, and processed by analysis software. We have achieved the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) and total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA), which are well-known as fundamental indicators of pregnancy and cancer. The limit of detection (LOD) for hCG was 8 ng/ml (0.8 ng/tip), which is comparable to that of other conventional systems based on immunochromatography. Moreover, the LOD for TPSA was improved over the existing systems with the application of different sample volumes, such as 5 ng/ml (1 ng/tip) in 200 μl sample volume, and 2 ng/ml (0.6 ng/tip) in 300 μl sample volume. Since our bioanalysis system requires a small amount of immobilized antigen, it would be greatly useful in basic research for screening the antigen-antibody reactions. Besides, our bioanalysis system can be applied to on-field screening, since its operation is simple, and the visual results can be obtained rapidly. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: It is unclear if it is safe for babies to bed share with adults. In Ireland 49% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases occur when the infant is bed-sharing with an adult. Objective: To evaluate the effect of bed-sharing during the last sleep period on risk factors for SIDS in Irish infants. Design: An 8 year (1994-2001) population based case control study of 287 SIDS cases and 831 controls matched for date, place of birth, and sleep period. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Results: The risk associated with bed-sharing was three times greater for infants with low birth weight for gestation (UOR 16.28 v 4.90) and increased fourfold if the combined tog value of clothing and bedding was ≥10 (UOR 9.68 v 2.34). The unadjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 13.87 (95% CI 9.58 to 20.09) for infants whose mothers smoked and 2.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 4.39) for non-smokers. Age of death for bed-sharing and sofa-sharing infants (12.8 and 8.3 weeks, respectively) was less than for infants not sharing a sleep surface (21.0 weeks, p<0.001) and fewer bed-sharing cases were found prone (5% v 32%; p = 0.001). Conclusion: Risk factors for SIDS vary according to the infant's sleeping environment. The increased risk associated with maternal smoking, high tog value of clothing and bedding, and low z scores of weight for gestation at birth is augmented further by bed-sharing. These factors should be taken into account when considering sleeping arrangements for young infants.

AB  - Late preterm infants (34-37 weeks postmenstrual age at birth) are intermediate between less mature preterm infants and infants born at 38 weeks or more in regard to autonomic brain stem maturation. Ventilatory responses to CO2 in preterm infants born at 33 to 36 week are significantly higher than in infants born at 29 to 32 weeks both at 3 to 4 and 10 to 14 days postnatal age, but do not differ from full-term reference levels. The ventilatory response to hypoxia in preterm infants is biphasic; initial transient hyperventilation is followed by a return to baseline and then a decrease below baseline. In infants born at 32 to 37 weeks, parasympathetic maturation appears significantly less than in full-term infants based on diminished increases in high frequency heart rate variability in quiet sleep, suggesting that late preterm infants are still more susceptible to bradycardia than full-term infants. Both the presence and severity of apnea of prematurity progressively decrease the higher the postmenstrual age. Late preterm infants, however, are still at risk, with prevalence rates as high as 10% compared with about 60% in infants born at &lt;1500 g. The incidence of apparent life-threatening events is more common in preterm infants (8-10%) than full-term infants (1% or less). In the Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation studies, the frequency of conventional and extreme events in near term infants is intermediate between preterm infants &lt;34 weeks at birth and full-term infants. The relative risk for at least one extreme event in late preterm infants is increased (5.6 and 7.6, respectively, P &lt; 0.008) compared with full-term infants and remains higher until 43 weeks postmenstrual age. The rate for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in preterm infants born at 33 to 36 weeks is 1.37/1000 live births compared with 0.69 in infants born full term. Affected late preterm infants die at a older mean postmenstrual age compared with less mature infants (48 and 46 weeks, respectively), but die at a younger postmenstrual age than full-term infants (53 weeks, P &lt; 0.05). © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A postal survey of all UK members of the Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association was carried out to ascertain their preferred method for identifying the epidural space in obstetric and non-obstetric patients. Over 1200 questionnaires were returned (79.3% response rate). In obstetric patients, the single most common technique (used by 58% of anaesthetists) was continuous advancement of the epidural needle and loss of resistance with saline, followed by intermittent needle advancement with air (21%). A minority of respondents used other variants, including intermittent advancement with saline (16%) and continuous advancement with air (4%). Consultant anaesthetists showed greater variety in techniques used than did trainees (p < 0.001). Less than 5% of respondents used a paramedian approach, and these were almost exclusively senior staff. Only 48% of anaesthetists said they would try an alternative if they experienced difficulty with their preferred technique. A similar pattern was seen for lumbar epidurals in non-obstetric surgical patients (89% used the same technique as in obstetrics), although for thoracic epidurals, 23% used a different technique to that which they would use for obstetrics, and the paramedian approach was more popular (21%). When inserting lumbar epidurals to supplement general anaesthesia in surgical patients, 18% of anaesthetists said they usually performed the block with the patient asleep, whereas for thoracic epidurals, this figure fell to 14%. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation 2006 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - The physiological stress of different dental procedures (dental examination, dental prophylaxise, endodontics, restoration and tooth extraction) were determined in 62 healthy, non-smoking, non-pregnant kermanian patients with normal sleep pattern, age between 18 and 55 years (mean 32) with a salivary cortisol assay using radioimmunoassay technique. Expectorated saliva was collected at 4 time points: 10 min before the start of the procedure (stage A), 10 min after the patient was seated (stage B), at the end of the procedure (stage C) and 15 min after the completion of the procedure (stage D). Mean cortisol value for 248 samples at four different time points ranged between 12.62 to 24.56 nmol. L-1. The differences among the mean cortisol levels within each treatment group, was not significant but they were apparent. Only in the restoration group, the mean cortisol level during treatment was increased in comparison to stage A (20.51±10.88 vs. 16.02±9.46 nmol L-1). [During stage B, in restorative group the mean cortisol level was significantly higher than that of the Endodontics (22.25±12.17 vs. 12.62±6.66 nmol L-1, p&lt;0.006). After the completion of therapy the cortisol level in examination group was higher than the prophylaxis (21.76±6.32 vs. 13.86±8.81 nmol L-1 p&lt;0.015). These data suggest that the adrenal response associated with restorative procedures was higher than the other dental procedures in Kerman.

AB  - For the first 10 days of pregnancy and the first 12 days of pseudopregnancy, the secretion of prolactin (PRL) from pituitary lactotrophs is rhythmic, with two surges/day. This rhythm can also be triggered by bolus injection of oxytocin (OT). We describe a mathematical model for the initiation, maintenance, and termination of the OT-induced PRL rhythm. In our model, the mechanism for this circadian rhythm is mutual interaction between lactotrophs and neuroendocrine dopamine (DA) neurons. This rhythm is, under normal lighting conditions, entrained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but persists in the absence of input from the SCN. We postulate that OT injection triggers the rhythm by activating a population of bistable hypothalamic neurons that innervate and inhibit DA neurons. The bistable nature of these neurons allows them to act as a memory device, maintaining the rhythm long after OT has been cleared from the blood. The mechanism for this memory device and the arguments supporting it are detailed with computer simulations. Finally, we consider potential targets for a rhythm-terminating factor and make predictions that may be used to determine which mechanism is operational in terminating the OT- or mating-induced PRL rhythm.

AB  - We previously showed that prenatal choline supplementation could increase the precision of timing and temporal memory and facilitate simultaneous temporal processing in mature and aged rats. In the present study, we investigated the ability of adult rats to selectively control the reinforcement-induced resetting of an internal clock as a function of prenatal drug treatments designed to affect the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to prenatal choline (CHO), nicotine (NIC), methyllycaconitine (MLA), choline + nicotine (CHO + NIC), choline + nicotine + methyllycaconitine (CHO + NIC + MLA), or a control treatment (CON). Beginning at 4-mo-of-age, rats were trained on a peak-interval timing procedure in which food was available at 10-, 30-, and 90-sec criterion durations. At steady-state performance there were no differences in timing accuracy, precision, or resetting among the CON, MLA, and CHO + NIC + MLA treatments. It was observed that the CHO and NIC treatments produced a small, but significant increase in timing precision, but no change in accuracy or resetting. In contrast, the CHO + NIC prenatal treatment produced a dramatic increase in timing precision and selective control of the resetting mechanism with no change in overall timing accuracy. The synergistic effect of combining prenatal CHO and NIC treatments suggests an organizational change in α7 nAChR function that is dependent upon a combination of selective and nonselective nAChR stimulation during early development. ©2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB  - Objective: Preeclampsia, characterized by changes in the placenta and uteroplacental vasculature, is the most frequent complication of pregnancy. It is argued that an overproduction of placental cytokines may be associated with the pathophysiological changes found in preeclampsia. In this study, it is aimed to determine the levels of both pro-inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-α) and immunoregulatory (interleukin-6) cytokines and their relationships with von Willebrand factor and anti-thrombin III from both preeclamptic and healthy pregnant women. Material and Methods: Twenty-five pregnant women with preeclampsia and 25 healthy pregnant women were included in the study. The fasting blood samples were obtained at eight o'clock in the morning from the both groups and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, von Willebrand factor and anti-thrombin III levels were measured. From the preeclamptic patients blood samples were obtained at twelve o'clock midnight to determine the diurnal variation in these two cytokine levels. Results: As compared to healthy pregnant group, levels of interleukin-6 and anti-thrombin III were significantly lower and von Willebrand factor level was significantly higher in the preeclamptic group (p<0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-α level did not differ significantly between the two groups. Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α levels did not show significant diurnal variation in preeclamptic group. A significant positive correlation was found between the tumor necrosis factor-α levels measured in the morning and night samples in the preeclamptic group (p<0.01, r=0.701). Also, a significant positive correlation was found between the tumor necrosis factor-α and von Willebrand factor levels in healthy pregnant group (p<0.05, r=0.648). Conclusions: These findings suggest that preeclampsia is associated with decreased interleukin-6, and anti-thrombin III, and with increased von Willebrand factor levels.

AB  - Purpose. To determine the urinary Levels of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), 2-naphthol (2-NAP) and cotinine in pregnant women exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Methods. One-hundred twenty-four pregnant women from four hospitals were interviewed using a questionnaire. Data obtained included demographic information and life styles. The levels of 1-OHP and 2-NAP in urine specimens from all participants were analyzed by HPLC-Fluorescence; urinary cotinine levels were measured by HPLC-photodiol instrumentation. Results. Urinary levels of 1-OHP, 2-NAP and cotinine in the ETS exposure group were higher than the non-exposure group; only urinary cotinine levels differed significantly between the two groups. Urinary levels of 1-OHP were positively correlated with 2-NAP (r = 0.14) and cotinine (r = 0.09), and 2-NAP and cotinine (r = 0.12); however, no significant correlation was found. Conclusions. Urinary cotinine and 2-NAP levels can be used as biomarkers to measure the exposure to poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) emitted from burning cigarettes.

AB  - Mating or vaginocervical stimulation [copulatory stimulus (CS)] induces two daily surges of the hormone prolactin (PRL) in rats. This unique secretory pattern of PRL surges is characteristic for the first half of pregnancy and is also present in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Studies have shown that CS additionally provokes an acute release of the hormone oxytocin (OT). In this study, we tested whether a single injection of OT (iv) is sufficient to initiate the PRL secretion pattern of OVX/CS rats. Furthermore, we measured the 24-h profile of dopamine (DA) content in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, because DA is the major inhibitory factor of PRL secretion. The results indicated that a single injection of OT induces a PRL secretory rhythm and a DA release pattern similar to that initiated by CS. Immunocytochemical investigation showed that particular OTergic neurons in the hypothalamus express receptors for PRL, as well as for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, which indicates an involvement in generating the PRL rhythm and entraining it to the ambient photoperiod. On the basis of this study, we suggest that the PRL-DA inhibitory feedback loop between lactotrophs and DAergic neurons plays a crucial role in generating the oscillatory PRL secretion pattern in CS rats. A timing signal, likely provided by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, entrains the autonomous PRL oscillation to a particular time of day. Mathematical modeling was used to illustrate the proposed network function. The experimental results further suggest an additional feedback mechanism in which certain hypothalamic OTergic neurons are influenced by PRL. Copyright © 2006 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - This longitudinal, year-long study compared sleep-wake state organization in two groups of infants-infants whose mothers abused substances during their pregnancies and nonexposed, typically developing, age-matched comparison infants-to determine whether differences in sleep-wake state organization existed between the two groups. Seventeen infants of mothers who were participating in a parent-infant residential treatment program for substance abuse were enrolled. Their sleep-wake state organization over the first year of life was compared to that of 17 age-matched comparison infants. The intent was to follow each infant on five occasions over the first year of life using established methods of time-lapse videosomnography to record sleep-wake state organization; however, attrition in the substance-abusing group was problematic. Some sleep-wake variables (i.e., Active Sleep%, Quiet Sleep%, Awake%, number of nighttime awakenings) were similar for both groups of infants at comparable ages across the first year. Total sleep time and the longest sustained sleep period (sleep continuity variables) differed significantly at some of the ages measured. Although overall sleep architecture appears highly resilient and well organized, some indications of sleep fragmentation and shortened nighttime sleep periods were observed in the substance-exposed infants. More research is needed to explain why sleep-continuity variables and not sleep-state proportion variables differed between the two groups. © 2006 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of age, gender and perinatal risk factors on the risks for sleep problems, and investigate the relation between childhood sleep problems and children's behavioral syndromes and parental mental distress in early and middle childhood. We recruited a representative sample of 1391 children, ages 4-9, from nine kindergartens and three elementary schools by using a multistage sampling method. Parents of child participants completed a questionnaire including perinatal risk factors, sleep habits and problems, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ). A mixed model was used for data analysis to address cluster effect from the same classes and schools. Results showed that boys suffered from more sleep problems than girls. Early insomnia, sleep terrors and enuresis decreased with ages, but sleepwalking increased with ages. Perinatal exposure to alcohol, coffee and non-prescribed medication, vaginal bleeding, artificial delivery, first-born order and higher parental CHQ score (≥4) were significantly associated with several childhood sleep problems. In addition, children with sleep problems had higher T-scores of the eight behavioral syndromes derived from the CBCL. Our findings indicated that the childhood sleep problems were associated with perinatal risk factors, parental psychopathology and children's behavioral problems. © 2006 European Sleep Research Society.

AB  - Objective: To follow the development of MEG sleep patterns and auditory evoked responses (AERs) during the first six months of life. Methods: The subjects were 18 neonates, born at conceptional age (CA) 36-42 weeks, following uncomplicated pregnancies. During each session, several 10-min MEG recordings were acquired in the presence of auditory stimulation. The recordings were classified into three distinct MEG patterns - low amplitude irregular; high-amplitude slow; and mixed - based largely on MEG amplitude and frequency. Averaged AERs were computed for the entire recording and for each MEG pattern within the recording. The results were based on analysis of 61 recording sessions of the 10 subjects who yielded three or more sessions of usable data. Results: Developmental changes in the MEG sleep patterns were most pronounced at the earliest ages. By CA 48 weeks the patterns had progressed to a more mature form, characterized by the prevalence of delta wave sleep, absence of discontinuity, and development of spindling and higher amplitude delta rhythms. In contrast to the MEG patterns, the AERs did not change markedly during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) and showed a simple morphology, consisting of a prominent deflection at 250 ms (P250m) and a more diffuse one at around 750 ms (N750m). During the period CA 48-54 weeks, however, a relatively abrupt transition occurred to a more complex morphology, characterized by a double peak with peak latencies 150 ms (P150m) and 350 ms (P350m). Beyond this period the AERs continued to evolve, showing biphasic complexes and the emergence of late components arising from outside the auditory cortex. Conclusions: Over the age range of this study the MEG sleep patterns and AER developed in succession, rather than concurrently; i.e. development of the sleep patterns was most rapid during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) while major development of the AERs commenced after this time. Significance: This finding suggests that the brain must achieve a certain level of overall maturity, reflected in the character of the MEG sleep patterns at CA 48 weeks, before the cortex enters a phase of significant functional development, reflected in the more rapid evolution of the AER after CA 48 weeks. The results of this study affirm the efficacy of MEG for spatiotemporal characterization of neonatal brain activity. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL. Seventy-eight women scoring ≥10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form SF-36), sleep quality, life stress, and social support. All women underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, especially at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 350 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, 3 times per day, from day E14 until birth, and the pups allowed to mature. Intracellularly recorded PPN neurons in 12-21 day rat brainstem slices were tested for intrinsic membrane properties, including the hyperpolarization- activated cation current Ih, which is known to drive oscillatory activity. Type II (A-current) PPN cells from 12-16 day old offspring of treated animals had a 1 / 2max Ih amplitude of (mean ± SE) 4.1 ± 0.9 mV, while 17-21 day cells had a higher 1 / 2max Ih of 9.9 ± 1.1 mV (p &lt; 0.0001). Cells from 12-16 day old control brainstems had a 1 / 2max Ih of 1.3 ± 0.1 mV, which was lower (p &lt; 0.05) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring; while 17-21 day old cells from controls had a 1 / 2max Ih of 3.3 ± 0.3 mV, which was also lower (p &lt; 0.01) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring. In addition, changes in resting membrane potential [control - 65. ± 0.9 mV (n = 32); exposed - 55.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p &lt; 0.0001)], and action potential (AP) threshold [control - 56.5 ± 0.7 mV (n = 32), exposed - 47.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p &lt; 0.0001)], suggest that prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke induced marked changes in cells in the cholinergic arm of the RAS, rendering them more excitable. Such data could partially explain the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Depression is common during pregnancy and the postpartum period and may require pharmacotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be the safest choice if pharmacotherapy is required, but are not without adverse effects on the infant both during pregnancy and lactation. While congenital malformations seem to be absent with treatment with most SSRIs, adverse events may occur in neonates exposed to SSRIs during the third trimester. There is little evidence that exposure to SSRIs in utero may have a negative impact on neurodevelopment outcomes in infants. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for postnatal depressive symptoms in a cohort of mothers of Pacific Island infants in Auckland, New Zealand. Method: The data were gathered as part of the Pacific Island Families Study, in which 1376 mothers were interviewed when their babies were 6 weeks old. The interview included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: 16.4% of mothers were assessed as probably experiencing depression. Prevalence rates varied from 7.6% for Samoans to 30.9% for Tongans. In addition to ethnicity, risk factors identified by stepwisemultiple logistic regression included low Pacific Island acculturation, first birth, stress due to insufficient food, household income less than $40 000, difficulty with transport, dissatisfaction with pregnancy, birth experience, baby's sleep patterns, partner relationship and home. A large prevalence difference between Tongans and other groups remained when the effects of other risk factors were controlled statistically. Conclusions: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Pacific mothers is at the upper end of the range typically reported. Focus on the overall rate, however, obscures substantial variation between groups. Risk factors are generally similar to those identified in previous research. Implications: The findings have implications for prevention and treatment and caution against assuming homogeneity within ethnic categories. Further research is required to explain differences in prevalence between Tongan and other Pacific Island groups. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

AB  - The recognition of prone sleeping and maternal smoking as modifiable risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), has drastically decreased SIDS incidence. However, during the last years other factors have become necessary to consider to further reduce the risk of SIDS. Side sleeping implies a greater risk than supine sleeping but is still common. Bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, while use of a pacifier seems to be protective. Replacement of maternal smoking with nicotine substitutes is not harmless. Conclusion: To further reduce the risk of SIDS, exclusive supine sleeping should be encouraged and side sleeping discouraged. When the breast-feeding is established, a pacifier can very well be used at bedtime. Bed sharing can increase the risk of SIDS if the infant is below 2-3 months of age, especially if the mother is a smoker. Any nicotine use should be avoided during pregnancy and breast-feeding. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence on faster growth in preterm infants with higher heart rate as opposed to the classical approach calls for further research. Aims: to test whether (1) high or low heart rate and (2) heart rate during the first days of life predict greater weight gain in preterm infants. Methods: A retrospective study analyzing two daily measures of heart rate obtained during restful sleep, total daily calorie intake and daily weight gain measured always in the morning before meal were collected from the medical files. Results: Analysis of 90 healthy preterm infants born at 32-36 weeks of gestation revealed that increased mean heart rate during hospitalization predicted greater weight gain even when controlling for calorie intake, birth weight, gestational age, appropriateness of birth weight for gestational age, and length of hospitalization. Mean heart rate during the first three days of life yielded the same pattern of results. Post-hoc analysis of variance between infants with mean daily heart rate ≤ 139 bpm vs. ≥ 140 bpm showed that infants with higher heart rate achieved a significantly higher weight gain. Conclusions: It is suggested that, contrary to adults, in neonates an anabolic activity is represented by increased sympathetic functioning within the normal range. The implications of a slower growth rate for additional developmental care and individual considerations of appropriate stimulation in preterm infants are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective. - To evaluate the frequency of menorrhagia and endometriosis in female migraineurs compared to age-matched women without headache. Background. - Migraine predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of migraine and menstrual disorders. Methods. - Women diagnosed with migraine, using International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular event history, and vascular risk factors. Results. - Fifty female migraineurs between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P= .77) and hormone replacement therapy (12% vs. 8%, P= .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64 % vs. 80%, P= .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P= .84). Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P= .009), with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P= .003), and significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert scale) with work/school participation (P= .02), family activities (P < .0001), sleep (P= .003), life enjoyment (P= .001), mood (P= .02), and overall quality of life (P= .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P= .001). The migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P= .017) but not more serious bleeding problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine group (28% vs. 12%, P= .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia, endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4). There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P= .05), transient ischemic attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P= .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P= .08) in the migraineurs. Conclusion. - Women with migraine have a higher frequency of menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet function, in migraineurs. © 2006 by American Headache Society Published by Blackwell Publishing.

AB  - From earliest times, psychiatrists have described biological rhythm disturbances as characteristic of mood disorders. The present flourishing of circadian biology has revealed the molecular basis of 24-h rhythmicity driven by 'clock' genes, as well as the importance of zeitgebers (synchronisers). Winter depression was first modelled on regulation of animal behaviour by seasonal changes in daylength, and led to application of light as the first successful chronobiological treatment in psychiatry. Light therapy has great promise for many other disorders (e.g. sleep-wake cycle disturbances in Alzheimer's dementia, bulimia, premenstrual disorder, depression during pregnancy) and, importantly, as an adjuvant to antidepressant medication in major non-seasonal depression. The pineal hormone melatonin is also a zeitgeber for the human circadian system, in addition to possessing direct sleep-promoting effects. Chronobiology has provided efficacious non-pharmaceutical treatments for mood disorders (such as sleep deprivation or light therapy) as well as novel approaches to new drugs (e.g. agomelatine). © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective. To determine if there is a diurnal pattern in the clinical symptoms of HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) syndrome. Study design. A retrospective study was performed in 134 pregnancies complicated by HELLP syndrome. The medical records were reviewed to describe each HELLP episode. Time of day was divided into three periods, day, evening, and night. The following parameters were categorized according to the time of day: onset of symptoms, consultation by the doctor, initial blood sampling, diagnosis and decrease of symptoms. Biochemical parameters at clinical presentation and consecutive changes within 24 h were recorded. Results. In 65 pregnancies 77 HELLP episodes were well documented. Times of onset of symptoms and consultation by the doctor were significantly higher during the evening and night (p &lt; 0.001), whereas times of diagnosis and decrease of symptoms occurred significantly more during the day (p &lt; 0.001). In only 49.3% of the cases were diagnostic laboratory criteria met at clinical presentation. This was mainly due to platelet values in excess of 100 × 109/l. Several hours later (median 8 h, range 2-23) the decrease in platelets occurred. Conclusions. A diurnal pattern exists in the clinical symptoms of HELLP syndrome that is characterized by an exacerbation during the night and recovery during the day. There is a considerable delay between the onset of symptoms and the fulfilment of diagnostic laboratory criteria. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - Objective: Despite modern methods of treatment and near-normal HbA 1c levels, women with type 1 diabetes mellitus are still at risk of having an infant with a congenital malformation (CM). We hypothesised that HbA1c levels are too gross a measure of glycaemic control and used a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) to determine the diurnal glucose profiles during the first trimester of pregnancy. We present three cases of infants with a CM. Methods: Fifty-three women with type 1 diabetes used the CGMS for 48 h in the first trimester of pregnancy. Three of them gave birth to infants with a CM. HbA1c levels were determined at the time of the CGMS measurement and 6 to 8 weeks later. Results: The HbA1c levels at the time of the CGMS measurement were 6.0, 6.5 and 7.8% (normal range 4.0-6.0%) in the three women. The 48-h diurnal glucose profiles of these women showed a large variability with frequent hyperglycaemic episodes. Conclusions: HbA 1c levels are too gross a measure of glycaemic control to identify women at risk of giving birth to an infant with a CM. Even in women with normal or near-normal HbA1c levels, the diurnal glucose profiles reveal intermittent hyperglycaemic episodes that may cause the CM. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring offers a reliable method for determining blood pressure (BP) in children. The aim of this cohort study was to examine whether maternal preeclampsia is associated with elevated BP in an offspring. The study population consisted of 57 children born to preeclamptic mothers (PRE) and their 57 age- and sex-matched control subjects born to normotensive mothers (non-PRE). We examined the 24-h ABP at 12 y of age in the PRE and non-PRE children. Within the two groups, the association of anthropometric measures, plasma catecholamine (epinephrine [E], norepinephrine [NE]) concentrations, and ABP was examined. The PRE children had significantly higher mean 24-h systolic and diastolic ABPs than the non-PRE children. The same was true for the mean daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic ABPs. The PRE boys had higher 24-h systolic ABP than the PRE girls. In the PRE children, high plasma E concentration and being born small for gestational age (SGA) predicted high systolic 24-h ABP in logistic regression analysis. In the non-PRE children, high current body mass index (BMI) and high plasma E concentration was associated with high systolic 24-h ABP. In conclusion, systolic and diastolic ABP values were elevated in the PRE children. High plasma E concentration and being born SGA were associated with high systolic 24-h ABP in the PRE children. Presumably maternal preeclampsia affects offspring via several mechanisms, including genetic ones and metabolic consequences of restricted intrauterine growth.

AB  - Human pregnancy is associated with increased requirements for dietary energy and this increase may be partly offset by reductions in physical activity during gestation. Studies in well-nourished women have shown that the physical activity level (PAL), obtained as the total energy expenditure (TEE) divided by the BMR, decreases in late pregnancy. However, it is not known if this decrease is really caused by reductions in physical activity or if it is the result of decreases in energy expenditure/BMR (the so-called metabolic equivalent, MET) for many activities in late pregnancy. In the present study activity pattern, TEE and BMR were assessed in twenty-three healthy Swedish women before pregnancy as well as in gestational weeks 14 and 32. Activity pattern was assessed using a questionnaire and heart rate recording. TEE was assessed using the doubly labelled water method and BMR was measured by means of indirect calorimetry. When compared to the pre-pregnant value, there was little change in the PAL in gestational week 14 but it was significantly reduced in gestational week 32. Results obtained by means of the questionnaire and by heart rate recording showed that the activity pattern was largely unaffected by pregnancy. The findings support the following conclusion: in a population of well-nourished women where the activity pattern is maintained during pregnancy, the increase in BMR represents approximately the main part of the pregnancy-induced increase in TEE, at least until gestational week 32. © The Authors 2006.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing and snoring are common in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to determine whether pregnancy was associated with upper airway narrowing. One-hundred females in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited and 50 agreed to be restudied 3 months after delivery. One-hundred nonpregnant females were also recruited. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Snoring was less common in nonpregnant (17%) than pregnant females (41%; odds ratio (OR) 3.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-6.74) and returned to nonpregnant levels after delivery (18%; OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40). Pregnant females had significantly smaller upper airways than nonpregnant females at the oropharyngeal junction when seated (mean difference 0.12; 95% CI 0.008-0.25), and smaller mean pharyngeal areas in the seated (mean difference 0.14; 95% CI 0.001-0.28), supine (mean difference 0.11; 95% CI 0.01-0.22) and lateral postures (mean difference 0.13; 95% CI 0.02-0.24) compared with the nonpregnant females. Pregnant females had smaller mean pharyngeal areas compared with post-partum in the seated (mean difference 0.18; 95% CI 0.02-0.32), supine (mean difference 0.20; 95% CI 0.06-0.35) and lateral postures (mean difference 0.26; 95% CI 0.12-0.39). In conclusion, this study confirmed increased snoring and showed narrower upper airways during the third trimester of pregnancy. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2006.

AB  - Pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) may be associated with both endothelial dysfunction (ED) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). It was hypothesised that females with PET would demonstrate both SDB and ED, and that a correlation between these two would suggest a potential causative association. A total of 17 females with PET and 25 matched females with uncomplicated pregnancy were studied. They underwent a nocturnal ambulatory sleep study (using Watch_PAT100) and noninvasive evaluation of endothelial function utilising the reactive hyperaemia test (using Endo_PAT 2000). A higher ratio of post- to pre-occlusion pulse-wave amplitude (endothelial function index (EFI)) indicated better endothelial function. Females with PET had a significantly higher respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and lower EFI than controls (18.4±8.4 versus 8.3±1.3·h-1, and 1.5±0.1 versus 1.8±0.1, respectively). Blood pressure significantly correlated with RDI and with EFI. EFI tended to correlate with RDI. In conclusion, these results suggest that both sleep-disordered breathing and endothelial dysfunction are more likely to occur in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia than in females with uncomplicated pregnancies. The current authors speculate that respiratory disturbances contribute to the functional abnormality of the blood vessels seen in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia, although causality cannot be determined based on this study.

AB  - In summary, the major physiologic changes that occur in pregnancy are the increased minute ventilation, which is caused by increased respiratory center sensitivity and drive; a compensated respiratory alkalosis; and a low expiratory reserve volume. The vital capacity and measures of forced expiration are well preserved. Patients who have many lung diseases tolerate pregnancy well, with the exception of those who have pulmonary hypertension or chronic respiratory insufficiency from parenchymal or neuromuscular disease. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Marginal intake of iron and ω-3 long-chain fatty acids (DHA) is prevalent among pregnant women. It is not clear to what extent poor iron or DHA status during pregnancy impacts on an infant's functional outcomes. A few studies suggest that inadequate maternal iron or DHA status may be associated with suboptimal functional outcomes in infants. In addition, there is a lack of prospective studies using randomized, double-blind design or experimental studies with appropriate animal models. Although both nutrients are involved in early brain development and their metabolism is interrelated, no study has examined the interaction between iron and ω-3 fatty acids during pregnancy. Conclusion: Long-term studies on large cohorts of pregnant women and their infants are needed to determine whether inadequate iron or DHA status during pregnancy is detrimental to infant neurodevelopment. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background . The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of self-reported pelvic girdle pain in pregnancy and study the impact on function, the use of crutches, and waking up at night, according to location of pain. Methods . A population-based questionnaire study was performed among all women 18-40 years in two communities in Norway in 1998-99. A total of 1,817 women with a prior delivery constituted the study sample. Pelvic girdle pain was grouped into five categories: pain in anterior pelvis, in posterior pelvis, in anterior and unilateral posterior pelvis, in anterior and bilateral posterior pelvis (a complete pelvic girdle syndrome), and pelvic pain with no information on location. Results . A total of 46% (843/1,817) reported pelvic girdle pain in pregnancy at one location or more. Nineteen percent reported pain in anterior pelvis only, 14% in posterior pelvis only, 4% in anterior and unilateral posterior pelvis, and 5% reported a complete pelvic girdle syndrome. A total of 7% of all pregnant women used crutches during pregnancy and 15% reported waking up at night frequently due to pelvic girdle pain. A complete pelvic girdle syndrome, as compared to pain in the anterior pelvis only, was strongly associated with the use of crutches (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-7.4) and with waking up at night due to pain (OR 4.6; 95% CI 2.7-7.2). Conclusion . Pain related to the pelvic joints is common among pregnant women in Norway and may cause serious functional problems. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We present a case of intensified therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of citalopram in mother and newborn infant after clinically observed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated symptoms 2 weeks until 2 months after delivery. The SSRI-associated symptoms observed in the infant (up to 3 weeks after delivery) were irregular breathing, sleep disorders, hypotonia, and hypertonia. We conclude that the SSRI-associated symptoms in the infant represent citalopram withdrawal effects rather than side effects caused by breastfeeding. This case illustrates the importance of a flexible TDM program and a multidisciplinary approach in a hospital setting to deal with cases of drug-associated adverse effects, such as SSRI withdrawal effects.

AB  - Background: Mortality from SIDS has declined since the recommendation that infants are not placed prone to sleep. SIDS mortality is higher in infants born preterm than those born at term. Aim: To determine if risk factors for SIDS are any different for preterm and term infants. Methods: Mortality data over time were used to determine whether the reduction in SIDS mortality rates had occurred equally in term and preterm infants. Data from two New Zealand studies (a case-control study and a case-cohort study) were used to determine if any differences existed in risk factors for SIDS between term and preterm infants before and after the SIDS prevention campaign. Results: SIDS mortality appears to have decreased by similar proportions in term and preterm infants. Risk factors for SIDS were similar in preterm and term infants, except for parity where there was a significant interaction. Increasing parity was a risk factor for SIDS in term infants but not preterm infants. Conclusion: SIDS rates have decreased at comparable rates in term and preterm infants, but preterm birth still remains a risk factor for SIDS. The magnitude of the odds ratios associated with modifiable risk factors were similar for both groups. There may however be a difference in risk associated with parity between term and preterm infants. The messages for risk factors for SIDS are applicable to mothers of preterm as well as term infants.

AB  - Objective: To compare the prevalence and clinical characteristics of neonatal abstinence syndrome in neonates exposed and not exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in utero. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care center. Patients: One hundred twenty term infants, of whom 60 had prolonged in utero exposure to SSRIs, including paroxetine hydrochloride, fluoxetine, citalopram hydrobromide, sertraline hydrochloride, and venlafaxine hydrochloride. Main Outcome Measures: Neonatal abstinence syndrome was assessed with the Finnegan score as follows: score of 8 or above, severe; score of 4 to 7, mild; and score of 0 to 3, normal. All infants were followed up with a standardized protocol that included repeated Finnegan score assessments and cardiorespiratory monitoring until normalization of the Finnegan score. Results: Of the 60 neonates exposed to SSRIs in utero, 8 showed severe and 10 showed mild symptoms of a neonatal abstinence syndrome. All nonexposed neonates had a normal Finnegan score. In neonates who developed severe symptoms, the maximum mean daily Finnegan scores were recorded within 2 days after birth, although maximum individual scores were recorded as long as 4 days after birth. Conclusions: Neonatal abstinence syndrome occurs in 30% of neonates exposed to SSRIs in utero. These neonates should be monitored for at least 48 hours after birth. The long-term effects of prolonged exposure to SSRIs, particularly in neonates who develop severe symptoms, have yet to be determined. ©2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zonisamide (Zonegran®), a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) approved in Europe for the adjunctive treatment of refractory partial seizures in adults, has undergone extensive evaluation in pre- and post-marketing double-blind and open-label studies in Japan (where zonisamide is used widely to treat partial and generalised seizures in adults and children). These data indicate that the clinical benefit of zonisamide extends across a range of seizure types and patient ages. In an analysis based on a mixture of controlled and open studies in adults and children with partial seizures, 51-57% responded to zonisamide treatment (achieving ≥50% reduction in baseline seizure frequency). Efficacy extends across a range of generalised seizures and 22-66% of adults and children experiencing tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic or absence seizures responded to treatment. Even greater responder rates have been reported when zonisamide was used as monotherapy for partial seizures and generalised seizures in patients refractory to other AEDs or with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Zonisamide is also efficacious in paediatric epilepsy syndromes, including Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, West Syndrome and Ohtahara Syndrome. Across the spectrum of epilepsy syndromes studied, zonisamide is well-tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events, which are generally mild and CNS-related. These data indicate that zonisamide represents a valuable broad-spectrum option for the treatment of epilepsy. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alcohol abuse and dependence are among the most common psychiatric disorders occurring in adolescents. This article will examine clinically relevant research on the development, diagnosis, course, treatment, and adult outcomes of adolescent alcohol use disorders (AUDs). A developmental history of childhood mental disorders reflecting psychological dysregulation predicts adolescent AUDs. The DSM-IV AUD definitions developed for adults are generally valid for adolescents, although some adolescents with significant alcohol problems are not identified by this diagnostic system. Adolescents with AUDs typically have other substance involvements, comorbid mental disorders, and problematic family relationships. While biomedical complications seen in chronic alcoholic adults are typically absent, acute biomedical complications of intoxication, such as alcohol poisoning or traumatic injury, may contribute to excess mortality in adolescents. Psychosocial interventions promoting abstinence are the most common treatments for AUDs, with credible empirical support available for family-based approaches. While few drug trials have been completed for adolescents with AUDs, pharmacological interventions are available for alcohol withdrawal, craving, and comorbid mental disorders. Some adolescents with AUDs manifest chronic alcoholism in adulthood; many others transition to abstinence or normative drinking. Alcohol abstinence is the primary treatment focus, although other complications need to be addressed and treated to foster optimal clinical outcomes. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Diarrhea in patients with AIDS is a worldwide problem that can have a devastating impact on quality of life for the patient. Chronic diarrhea, usually defined as at least 4 weeks' duration, is more common in patients with low CD4-positive T-lymphocyte counts, signaling advanced immunosuppression. Some organisms, such as Microsporidia, usually cause diarrhea only in the immunosuppressed; others, such as Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter, which are capable of causing diarrhea in the immunocompetent population, produce more severe or prolonged infections in people living with AIDS. Familiarity with the most common pathogens in the clinician's region will help with diagnosis and treatment. Because treatment options vary widely depending upon the infectious agent, thorough microbiologic evaluation is warranted. A stepped diagnostic approach of stool cultures and specialized microscopy and stains for protozoa, followed by sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and duodenoscopy with biopsies for histopathological examination is recommended in all patients with persistent, disabling diarrhea who have a CD4 count of Less than 200/mm3, and should be considered for those with higher counts on an individual basis. Treatment, tailored to the specific pathogen, may need to be prolonged in the most severely immunocompromised patients to prevent relapse or recrudescence. For patients taking antiretroviral therapy (especially protease inhibitors) in whom no infectious agent can be found, diarrhea may be due to the medications. Nonspecific antidiarrheal agents should be tried until one that suits the patient is found. The most essential component of any therapeutic strategy for a patient with AIDS-associated diarrhea is restoration of the underlying immunologic defect using highly active antiretroviral therapy.

AB  - Significance. There are 2.2 million breast cancer survivors, and approximately 25%-30% of newly diagnosed women each year are >50 years of age. Adjuvant therapy has prolonged survival, but the quality of that survival is influenced by persistent and late effects of therapy. Knowledge of treatment outcomes will assist in the design of interventions to prevent or manage persistent and late effects in survivors. Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to review the incidence of gonadal toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy, side effects of endocrine therapy, quality of life outcomes, fertility concerns, and options to preserve fertility in young (>35 years) and young midlife (35-50 years) breast cancer survivors. Results. Alkylating agent-based chemotherapy causes destruction of primordial follicles and impairment of follicular maturation resulting in temporary preservation of menses, reversible amenorrhea,irregular menses (perimenopause), or irreversible amenorrhea (ovarian failure - menopause). Younger women have a lower risk for amenorrhea with chemotherapy because of sufficient follicular stores, although the gonadal toxicity will result in an earlier than expected menopause. Premature menopause is associated with poorer quality of life, decreased sexual functioning, menopausal symptom distress, psychosocial distress related to fertility concerns, infertility, and uncertainty about late effects of premature menopause. Routine discussion about the menopausal experience, risks for infertility, and fertility preservation options is recommended. Implications for Practice. This review identified adverse treatment outcomes for young and young midlife breast cancer survivors that can be minimized or prevented with targeted interventions. ©AlphaMed Press.

AB  - Background: Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes. Methods: Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have been used for comparison. Findings: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone - rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed. Interpretation: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.

AB  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipú Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p = 0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Inc.

AB  - Compared to Bos taurus breeds, Bos indicus breeds of cattle present several differences in reproductive physiology. Follicular diameter at deviation and at the time of ovulatory capability are smaller in B. indicus breeds. Furthermore, B. indicus breeds have a greater sensitivity to gonadotropins, a shorter duration of estrus, and more often express estrus during the night. These differences must be considered when setting up embryo transfer programs for B. indicus cattle. In recent studies, we evaluated follicular dynamics and superovulatory responses in B. indicus donors with the objective of implementing fixed-time AI protocols in superstimulated donors. Protocols using estradiol and progesterone/progestrogen releasing devices to control follicular wave emergence were as efficacious as in B. taurus cattle, allowing the initiation of superstimulatory treatments (with lower dosages of FSH than in B. taurus donors) at a self-appointed time. Furthermore, results presented herein indicate that delaying the removal of progesterone/progestogen-releasing devices, combined with the administration of GnRH or pLH 12 h after the last FSH injection, results in synchronous ovulations, permitting the application of fixed-time AI of donors without the necessity of estrus detection and without compromising the results. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Genes underlying circadian rhythm generation are expressed in many tissues. We explore a role for circadian rhythms in the timing and efficacy of mouse reproduction and development using a genetic approach. Methods: We compare fecundity in ClockΔ19 mutant mice (a dominant-negative protein essential for circadian rhythm activity) and in Vipr2-/- null mutant mice (affecting the generation and output of the circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus) with wild type (WT) litter mates under both a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle and continuous darkness. Results: Uteri from ClockΔ19 mice show no circadian rhythm and Vipr2-/- mice show a phase-advanced rhythm compared to WT uteri. In neither mutant line were homozygous or heterozygous fetuses lethal. Sexually mature adults of both mutant lines showed mildly reduced male in vivo (but not in vitro) fertility and irregular estrous cycles exacerbated by continuous darkness. However, pregnancy rates and neonatal litter sizes were not affected. The ClockΔ19 mutant line was distinguishable from the Vipr2-/- null mutant line in showing more peri-natal delivery problems and very poor survival of offspring to weaning. Conclusions: A fully functional central and peripheral circadian clock is not essential for reproduction and development to term, but has critical roles peri-natally and post-partum. © The Author 2005.

AB  - Links between neonatal biological rhythms and the emergence of interaction rhythms were examined in 3 groups (N = 71): high-risk preterms (HR; birth weight < 1,000 g), low-risk preterms (LR; birth weight = 1,700-1,850 g), and full-term (FT) infants. Once a week for premature infants and on the 2nd day for FT infants, sleep-wake cyclicity was extracted from 4-hr observations and cardiac vagal tone was measured. At term age, infant orientation was tested with the Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale. At 3 months, arousal modulation and emotion regulation were assessed, and mother-infant synchrony was computed from microanalysis of face-to-face interactions using time-series analysis. Sleep-wake amplitudes showed a developmental leap at 31 weeks gestation, followed by a shift in vagal tone at 34 weeks gestation. At term, differences among FT, LR, and HR infants were observed for biological rhythms in a linear-decline pattern. Sleep-wake cyclicity, vagal tone, newborn orientation, and arousal modulation were each uniquely predictive of mother-infant synchrony. The organization of physiological oscillators appears to lay the foundation for the infant's capacity to partake in a temporally matched social dialogue.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with a period length of about 24-hrs. Evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that the circadian timing system develops prenatally and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a circadian clock, is present by mid-gestation in primates. Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is responsive to light at very premature stages and that low intensity lighting can regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms in sleep-wake and hormone secretion generally developing after two months of age. Showing the importance of photic regulation of circadian phase in infants, exposure of premature infants to low-intensity cycled lighting results in the early establishment of rest-activity patterns that are in phase with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. With the continued elucidation of circadian system development and influences on human physiology and illness, it is anticipated that consideration of circadian biology will become an increasingly important component of neonatal care © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Recent advances in oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation technology have brought hope not only to women facing premature loss of ovarian function, but also to healthy women seeking delayed motherhood. This is a major issue of contention in healthcare ethics. Proponents of this new technology argue that this enables women to pursue educational and career goals in their youth, so that they have greater financial security for children in later life. Nevertheless, this argument may be flawed by the reality that even if the cryopreservation of oocytes and ovarian tissue were optimized in the future, this would in no way be a guaranteed route for women to have biological children later in life. Moreover, because only a limited amount of autologous reproductive material can be cryopreserved and stored for a single healthy woman, there is a risk of material depletion before reproductive success is attained. Another prime consideration is the increased morbidity and mortality associated with clinical assisted reproduction in older women. Hence, it is imperative that delayed motherhood through the cryopreservation of oocytes and ovarian tissues be viewed with extreme caution, and mandatory counselling should be given to all patients if such a medical procedure ultimately finds approval for widespread application.

AB  - Sex hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers at least of the humoral immunity and androgens and progesterone (and glucocorticoids) as natural immune-suppressors. Several physiological, pathological, and therapeutic conditions may change the serum estrogen milieu and/or peripheral conversion rate, including the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, being elderly, chronic stress, altered circadian rhythms, inflammatory cytokines, and use of corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, and steroid hormonal replacements, inducing altered androgen/estrogen ratios and related effects. In particular, cortisol and melatonin circadian rhythms are altered, at least in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and partially involve sex hormone circadian synthesis and levels as well. Abnormal regulation of aromatase activity (i.e., increased activity) by inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6) may partially explain the abnormalities of peripheral estrogen synthesis in RA (i.e., increased availability of 17-beta estradiol and possible metabolites in synovial fluids) and in systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as the altered serum sex-hormone levels and ratio (i.e., decreased androgens and DHEAS). In the synovial fluids of RA patients, the increased estrogen concentration is observed in both sexes and is more specifically characterized by the hydroxylated forms, in particular 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a mitogenic and cell proliferative endogenous hormone. Local effects of sex hormones in autoimmune rheumatic diseases seems to consist mainly in modulation of cell proliferation and cytokine production (i.e., TNFalpha, Il-1, IL-12). In this respect, it is interesting that male patients with RA seem to profit more from anti-TNFalpha strategies than do female patients. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The paper summarizes research linking long work hours to a wide range of risks to workers, families, employers, and the community. The risks are theorized to stem from less time to recover from work, longer exposure to workplace hazards, and less time to attend to non-work responsibilities. Risks to workers include sleep deprivation, poor recovery from work, decrements in neuro-cognitive and physiological functioning, illnesses, adverse reproductive outcomes, and injuries. Risks to families include delayed marriages and child bearing, and obesity in children. Risks to employers include reduced productivity and increases in workers errors. Mistakes by fatigued workers have broad reaching impacts to the community: medical errors, automobile crashes with other drivers on the road, and industrial disasters that damage the environment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine which months are unfavourable for conception in the region with the severe continental climate. DESIGN: Retrospective population based study. METHODS: Monthly data on incidence rate for gestose, maternal anaemia, pyelonephritis, threat to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, perinatal death and infant death at age under one year were extracted from medical records of obstetric, delivery, and paediatric hospitals in Novosibirsk (1976-1980), Norilsk (Taimir peninsula), and Mirny (western Yakutia). Two latter towns were considered together as a northern setting. Edwards' method was applied to test seasonality. RESULTS: In Novosibirsk as well as in northern towns, the monthly distribution of time of conception for preterm births, maternal pyelonephritis, and infant deaths displays significant seasonal pattern with maximum in summer. Additionally in the North, stillbirths' conceptions also tended to be concentrated in June. CONCLUSION: In Siberia, the polar day and summer months are an unfavourable time for conceiving in respect to obstetric complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy is a rare and difficult to diagnose disorder. We describe the case of a 30-yr-old woman presenting with symptoms and signs of mild hypercortisolism, in which ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome was diagnosed. Urinary cortisol excretion was elevated and circadian rhythm of cortisol was absent. ACTH levels were low. In addition, plasma cortisol failed to suppress after a high dexamethasone dose. An abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed a left adrenal mass. While diagnosis work-up was still in progress, the patient became pregnant and wanted to carry her pregnancy to full-term. Hypercortisolism was successfully controlled with metyrapone, which was started at 8 weeks of gestation. At 16 weeks of gestation, a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the gland showed a benign adrenocortical adenoma. The patient developed secondary adrenal insufficiency and was discharged on 20 mg hydrocortisone daily dose. At 30 weeks of gestation, the patient had a pre-term rupture of membranes and underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery. The newborn was a normal virilized male who weighed 1280 g. No apparent metyrapone-induced teratogenic effects were observed and there was no clinical or biochemical suppression of adrenocortical function. In conclusion, in adrenal Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy, medical treatment with metyrapone as soon as the diagnosis is made, in combination with laparoscopic surgery during the second trimester, are useful in preventing complications secondary to hypercortisolism and safe both for the mother and infant. ©2006, Editrice Kurtis.
Indications:1 patient with Cushing's syndrome presenting with hypercortisolism secondary to an adrenocortical adenoma.
Patients:One 30-year-old female pregnant patient.
TypeofStudy:This study described the successful outcome of Metopirone and laparoscopic adrenalectomy in a 16-week pregnant patient with Cushing's syndrome secondary to an adrenocortical adenoma. Case report.
DosageDuration:Initially 750 g [sic] daily and titrated to 1.5 and 2 g daily, at 12 and 14 weeks of gestation, respectively, to achieve urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels within the normal range. Duration: at least 8 weeks.
Results:Following the initiation of Metopirone 2 and 1.5 g/day treatment, UFC levels decreased to 273 nmol/24 hours at 12 weeks of gestation and 458/24 hours at 14 weeks of gestation, respectively. At 14 weeks, morning plasma cortisol level decreased to 207 nmol/l. The features of Cushing's syndrome improved with reduction of plethora and facial and abdominal swelling. The 50-gram morning oral glucose tolerance test was normal at 12 weeks of gestation. At 16 weeks of gestation, laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed under iv replacement of hydrocortisone. One month following surgery, plasma cortisol and ACTH levels after discontinuation of hydrocortisone were 69 nmol/l and 0.88 pmol/l, respectively. Six months following surgery, cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was still poor, although ACTH levels normalized. At 30 weeks of gestation, she had a pre-term rupture of membranes. Her baby was had no physical malformations and did not require glucocorticoids during the neonatal period, and had a low-grade respiratory distress syndrome in spite of antenatal use of corticosteroids. Her son continues to thrive properly.
AdverseEffects:No adverse effects occurred. A healthy, normal, virilized infant was delivered without any adverse effects (physical malformation) or biochemical suppression of adrenocortical function.
AuthorsConclusions:We conclude that medical treatment metyrapone as soon as the diagnosis is made, in combination with laparoscopic surgery during the second trimester, is useful in preventing complications secondary to hypercortisolism in adrenal Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy, and is safe for mother and infant.
FreeText:Patient presented with cushingoid features such as swelling of the face and abdomen and worsening of facial acne. She suffered a spontaneous abortion three months before presentation. Her 24-hour UFC level was elevated from 1995 to 3669 nmol/24 hours, morning and evening plasma cortisol levels were 709 and 651 nmol/l, respectively, plasma cortisol failed to suppress with overnight high dose of dexamethasone (922 nmol/l), and serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level was low at 0.22 to 0.66 pmol/l. Abdominal computed tomography showed left adrenal mass with a normal right adrenal gland. During hormonal work-up, she became pregnant and wanted to carry her pregnancy to full term.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate the benefits and to advocate the safety and efficacy of using an insulin pump with U-500 insulin in comparison with U-100 insulin for a pregnant patient with diabetes requiring massive doses of insulin. Methods: We present a detailed case report about the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with U-500 insulin during pregnancy. Dose calculation is reviewed, and the benefits of insulin pump therapy in patients with diabetes are discussed. Results: A 34-year-old white woman, with a history of type 2 diabetes for 7 years, was seen at 17 weeks of gestation because of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia accompanied by a very high insulin requirement. At the time of initial assessment, the patient was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis and was being treated with 400 U/day of intravenously administered insulin. She responded well to intravenous therapy, but when switched to a regimen of NPH and regular insulin, she continued to have high blood glucose levels (despite 4 to 5 insulin injections a day, with a total daily dose up to 400 to 450 U). Use of an insulin pump was instituted, which presented another challenge because of the limited reservoir capacity and the need to change sites at least once or twice a day. We decided to initiate U-500 insulin therapy with a total basal rate of 40 U/day. Her meal carbohydrate insulin ratio and correction bolus were calculated on a U-100 scale. Then each estimated dose for meal coverage, depending on her carbohydrate intake, as well as the appropriate corrections were totaled and divided by 5 to convert to U-500. Throughout the rest of her pregnancy, the patient was able to maintain tight glycemic control, with no further hospitalizations for stabilization of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful management of difficult to control diabetes by means of an insulin pump with use of U-500 insulin in a pregnant patient who required massive doses of insulin. © 2006 AACE.

AB  - Long-standing behavioral abnormalities emerge after puberty in rats following neonatal hippocampal lesion, providing a developmental model of abnormal rat behavior that may have predictive validity in identifying compounds effective in treating symptoms of schizophrenia. We sought to test the predictive validity of the neonatal hippocampal lesion model in identifying preventive treatment for first-episode psychosis. We determined the effect of risperidone, recently studied for prevention of first-episode psychosis, on the development of elevated locomotor activity following neonatal hippocampal lesions. Rat pups received hippocampal or sham lesions on postnatal day 7, followed by treatment with risperidone or vehicle from postnatal days 35 to 56. Locomotor activity in response to novelty, amphetamine, and nocturnal locomotion were determined on postnatal day 57. Low-dose risperidone (45 μg/kg) pretreatment prevented elevated locomotor activity in some, but not all, of the behavioral tasks following neonatal hippocampal lesions. In contrast, higher risperidone pretreatment was less effective in preventing elevated locomotor activity following neonatal hippocampal lesions. Because low risperidone dosages were also found to be effective in preventing first-episode psychosis in human studies, these data support the predictive validity of the hippocampal lesion model in identifying medications for prevention of first-episode psychosis. Additionally, these data support the use of low-dose risperidone in psychosis prevention, and suggest the possibility that higher risperidone doses could be less effective in this application. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined variation in plasma glucocorticoid concentrations of free-living Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) and captive golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) housed in constant environmental conditions. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were not significantly correlated with time held captive in traps prior to collection of blood samples in males or non-breeding females, but these variables were significantly correlated in breeding females during the pre-mating, lactation, and post-lactation periods. Among male S. beldingi, plasma corticosterone concentrations increased over the course of the active season, and were significantly higher in non-breeding than breeding individuals. Corticosterone concentrations also increased in non-breeding females throughout the active period. In breeding females, baseline (non-stress) corticosterone concentrations, determined from blood samples collected within 3 min of capture, increased during gestation and declined during lactation, whereas stress values of corticosterone, determined from blood samples collected within 4-11 min of capture, increased during gestation and then again during the period after young emerged from the natal burrow. Changes in plasma corticosterone concentrations of S. beldingi paralleled changes in body mass. Among S. lateralis, plasma concentrations of cortisol were elevated when males and females were in reproductive condition and lower in reproductively quiescent squirrels. The annual peak in plasma cortisol concentrations occurred just prior to increases in body mass associated with pre-hibernation fattening. Collectively, these results suggest that concentrations of circulating glucocorticoids fluctuate with circannual rhythmicity in conjunction with annual cycles of change in body mass and activity; within these circannual cycles glucocorticoid concentrations are influenced by stress and breeding status. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Well over 80 years ago Philip Smith described the beneficial clinical effects of adrenocortical extracts in animal models of adrenal insufficiency. In the ensuing years, scientists across the globe have sought to understand the mechanisms by which adrenal hormones and their synthetic analogues produce their complex and varied actions. Particular attention has focused on the glucocorticoids, partly because they have a vital place in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders but also because dysregulation of the secretion and/or activity of endogenous glucocorticoids is increasingly implicated in a number of common disorders that pose a growing clinical burden, such as obesity, type II diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and depression. This review considers some of the key advances that have been made in our understanding of the physiology, pathology and pharmacology of the glucocorticoids. Emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and the complex mechanisms that regulate the access of steroids in the systemic circulation to their receptors in their various target cells and tissues. In addition, consideration is given to the irreversible 'organisational' actions of glucocorticoids in perinatal life and to the potential role of the steroids in the aetiology of disease. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

AB  - Sleep disorders are linked with mood disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824 women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances following an induced abortion compared to a birth. The difference was most pronounced in the first 180 days after pregnancy resolution and was not significant after the third year.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the characteristics of fetal behavioral states in pregestational and gestational diabetic pregnancies. Material and method. We compared the results obtained in a control group consisting of 20 physiological pregnancies with 20 type 1 diabetic pregnancies and 20 gestational diabetic pregnancies. Ocular activity, body movements and patterns of fetal cardiac frequency on ultrasound and kinetocardiotocography were simultaneously recorded. The time spent by the fetuses in behavioral or coincident states, ability to establish stable behavioral states and behavioral stability were evaluated at weeks 36-37, 38 and 39 of pregnancy. Results. Fetuses in the type 1 diabetic group spent less time in quiet sleeping rate (significant at 38 weeks), more time in states of behavioral incoordination, and showed a greater number of changes in state (significant at 39 weeks) than control group fetuses. Fetuses in the type 1 diabetic group also showed an overall inability to establish stable behavioral states (significant at weeks 36-37 and 38). Fetuses in the gestational diabetes group showed similar alterations, but differences with the control group were not statistically significant. Conclusions. Type 1 diabetes is associated with a lesser fetal ability to establish stable behavioral states.

AB  - Psychological (e.g., stress), physiological (e.g., pregnancy), pharmacological (e.g., caffeine and SSRIs) and pathological (e.g., renal failure and Parkinson's disease) factors all play a role in RLS and PLMD. Sleep specialists debate whether continuous long-term treatment for an undulating (but at times very disruptive condition) is merited. In quiet times, there may be the unnecessary ingestion of regularly prescribed medication. However, the disruption of sleep is unpredictable for most patients and an overall improvement of symptoms and quality of life may be achieved with continuous treatment. We generally favor the latter approach but have observed (especially with patients on Seligiline) that there may be several months of symptom free respite after inadvertently stopping the medication. This implies that some patients may be well on published regimens. © 2006 Springer-Verlag US.

AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Certain modifiable maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy are associated with adverse health outcomes for the mother and her infant (e.g., physical abuse, insufficient folic acid consumption, smoking during pregnancy, and improper infant sleep position). Information about these behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends in maternal and infant health, enhance understanding of the relation between maternal behaviors and infant health outcomes, plan and evaluate maternal and infant health programs, direct policy decisions, and monitor progress toward achieving the national Healthy People 2010 [HP 2010] objectives (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy people 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services; 2000). REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2000-2003. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers; nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants. This report summarizes data for 2000-2003 from 19 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia) that measured progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives for eight perinatal indicators: 1) pregnancy intention, 2) multivitamin use, 3) physical abuse, 4) cigarette smoking during pregnancy, 5) cigarette smoking cessation, 6) drinking alcohol during pregnancy, 7) breastfeeding initiation, and 8) infant sleep position. RESULTS: In 2003, prevalence of intended pregnancy among women having a live birth ranged from 48.1% in Louisiana to 66.5% in Maine; during 2000-2003, no state experienced a statistically significant (p< or =0.05) increase in prevalence of intended pregnancy, and one state experienced a significant decrease. In 2003, prevalence of multivitamin use at least four times per week during the month before pregnancy ranged from 23.0% in Arkansas to 45.2% in Maine; during 2000-2003, multivitamin use increased significantly in three states (Illinois, North Carolina, and Utah). In 2003, prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during the 12 months before pregnancy ranged from 2.2% in Maine to 7.6% in New Mexico; during 2000-2003, significant decreases were recorded in three states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Nebraska). In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from cigarette smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 72.5% in West Virginia to 96.1% in Utah; during 2000-2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of smoking cessation during pregnancy ranged from 30.2% in West Virginia to 65.8% in Utah; during 2000-2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 91.3% in Colorado to 98.0% in Utah; during 2000-2003, abstinence increased significantly in Louisiana and Utah but decreased significantly in Florida and Nebraska. In 2003, prevalence of mothers who breastfed their babies in the early postpartum period ranged from 51.2% in Louisiana to 90.3% in Alaska; during 2000-2003, significant increases were recorded in six states (Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, and South Carolina). In 2003, prevalence of healthy full-term infants who were placed to sleep on their backs ranged from 50.0% in Arkansas to 78.7% in Washington; during 2000-2003, significant increases were recorded in eight states (Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, and West Virginia). In 2003, all 19 states achieved or exceeded the HP 2010 objective for smoking cessation during pregnancy, and 16 states achieved the HP 2010 objective for abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy. In addition, nearly half of the states achieved the objectives for breastfeeding in the early postpartum period and infant back sleep position. However, no state achieved the HP 2010 objectives for intended pregnancy, multivitamin use before pregnancy, absence of physical abuse before pregnancy, or abstinence from smoking during pregnancy. INTERPRETATION: PRAMS data indicate variability among states regarding progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives in the area of maternal and child health. More progress has been made in achieving objectives focused on the period during and after pregnancy (e.g., smoking cessation and proper infant sleep position); less progress has been made in achieving objectives related to behaviors and experiences in the preconception period (e.g., pregnancy intention and multivitamin use). PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: State maternal and child health programs can use these state- and population-based data to monitor progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives, identify indicators to target for intervention, and plan and evaluate programs that promote positive maternal and infant health behaviors, experiences, and outcomes. These data also can be used to guide policy decisions that could affect the health of mothers and infants.

AB  - This study examined the association between maternal smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during pregnancy and infant heart rate. Participants were 62 mother-infant dyads where mother smoked during pregnancy, 47 dyads where mother did not smoke during pregnancy but was exposed to ETS and 47 dyads where mother did not smoke and was not exposed to ETS. Average heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed at 2-4 weeks of age during sleep. Infants in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than nonexposed infants. Furthermore, boys in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than girls. These results highlight the importance of considering prenatal ETS exposure and infant gender when assessing infant outcomes. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Approximately one in four women will experience depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Untreated depression is associated with diminished prenatal care and can adversely affect the course of pregnancy, the developing fetus and birth outcomes. There is a pressing need therefore for safe, well tolerated, efficacious treatments. Risk-benefit decisions are best made on an individual case basis by an informed patient in consultation with her family and healthcare provider(s). Illness severity, course of illness, stage of pregnancy and patient preferences shape the decision-making process. This review summarizes recent literature on the course and impact of major depression and dysthymia during pregnancy, as well as providing an update on treatment strategies including complementary/alternative medicine, psychoeducation, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.

AB  - Women are at higher risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men, leading to significant psychosocial burden and healthcare-related costs. Research has shown an association between the negative impact of traumatic experiences and the reproductive life cycle in women. Pregnant women with a history of abuse/trauma frequently report intrusive reemergence of symptoms. Women who experience miscarriage may present with even higher prevalence rates of PTSD symptoms. Both psychologic and physiologic factors are believed to be relevant to the development of peripartum posttraumatic stress symptoms. Much less is known, however, about treatment. A case series of patients who presented with PTSD symptoms in the context of reproductive-related traumatic events (e.g., miscarriage, stillbirth) or who experienced reemergence of symptoms during pregnancy is presented, including treatment strategies. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In pregnant patients with myasthenia gravis and respiratory compromise, neuraxial anesthesia for lower abdominal surgery can risk further respiratory depression. We report the use of epidural anesthesia for dilation and curettage and tubal ligation in a 26-yr-old woman with a 12-wk intrauterine pregnancy with severe myasthenia gravis and respiratory insufficiency in whom ventilatory support during anesthesia was provided successfully using bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. This report demonstrates how the use of bilevel positive airway pressure for ventilatory support may improve the safety of regional anesthesia in patients with severe respiratory compromise. ©2006 by the International Anesthesia Research Society.

AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized in the Western world as a public health burden, but there has been no community-based study performed to assess the prevalence of the condition in India. The study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of OSA in a semi-urban Indian population. Design: A two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study. Setting: A semi-urban community in Delhi. Duration: Two years (2003 to 2005). Patients and participants: All citizens residing in the community who were 30 to 60 years of age. Exclusion criteria included those patients with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV congestive heart failure, pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, systemic steroid treatment, and hormone replacement therapy. Intervention: An OSA assessment was performed in 2,400 subjects who were screened in stage 1 of the study by means of a sleep questionnaire. Subjects were then divided into habitual and nonhabitual snorers. Eighty-three randomly selected habitual snorers and 80 nonhabitual snorers were invited to participate in stage 2 of the study, which consisted of in-hospital polysomnography studies. Observations and results: A total of 2,150 subjects returned questionnaires (response rate, 90%). Of 550 habitual snorers and 1,596 nonhabitual snorers, 77 habitual snorers and 73 nonhabitual snorers underwent polysomnography. A total of 36 habitual snorers (46.75%) and 2 nonhabitual snorers (2.73%) were found to have OSA, giving prevalence rates of 13.74% and 3.57%, respectively, for OSA and OSA syndrome (OSAS) on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age, obesity (defined by a high body mass index), and waist/hip ratio as significant risk factors for OSAS. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the risk factors and prevalence for OSA in India are similar to those in the West, which is contrary to the findings of some previous reports, which had a strong inclusion bias.

AB  - The influence of pregnancy in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been a matter of controversy for a long time. Women with MS were often discouraged to envisage pregnancy. The Pregnancy in Multiple Sclerosis (PRIMS) study was the first large-scale prospective study aimed at assessing the possible influence of pregnancy and delivery on the clinical course of MS. Two hundred and fifty-four women with a diagnosis of MS were included during pregnancy and followed-up till the end of the second year post partum. The results were a reduction in the relapse rate during pregnancy, in comparison to the year before pregnancy, especially marked in the third trimester, and a significant increase in the relapse rate in the first trimester post partum. From the second trimester post partum on however, the relapse rate did not significantly differ from the pre-pregnancy rate. About one third of the women experienced a post partum relapse. Pregnancy did not influence disability progression. The clinical factors likely to predict a relapse in the three months after delivery were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Women with a greater disease activity in the year before pregnancy and during pregnancy had a higher risk of relapse in the post partum three months. Neither breast-feeding, nor epidural analgesia correlated with presence of a post partum relapse. When comparing the predicted and observed status however, only 72 percent of the women were correctly classified by the multivariate model. It seems unwise therefore to use this kind of model to select women that would benefit from a putative preventive therapy. The PRIMS study had other major consequences: it fostered the development of specific therapeutic strategies to prevent post partum relapses (IV immunoglobulins, IV methylprednisolone), and suggested a potential role of sexual hormones in the natural history of MS during pregnancy and the post partum, therefore identifying them as a preferential target for prevention. The preventive effect of progesterone combined with estradiol on post partum relapses will be tested in a large-scale randomized and placebo-controlled European trial, the POPART'MUS study. © Masson.

AB  - Objective: To examine the association between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and physiological measures of regulation, which included heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Methods: Potential mediators and moderators of this association were explored. Participants were 141 mother-infant dyads (77 cocaine exposed and 64 nonexposed) recruited at birth. Average infant HR and RSA was assessed at 4-8 weeks of age during a 15 minute period of sleep. Results: Results indicated a dose-dependent effect of prenatal exposure to cocaine on RSA. There was no evidence that fetal growth or other prenatal exposure to substances mediated this association or that fetal growth or maternal age moderated this association. Regression analyses also indicated that birth weight (BW), but not birthlength (BL), head circumference (HC) or other substance use, mediated the association between prenatal exposure to cocaine and heart rate. Conclusions: These results suggest that cocaine exposure is associated with physiological regulation at 4-8 weeks of age and highlight the importance of considering level of exposure when assessing infant outcomes. © The Author 2005.

AB  - Sleep disturbances and insomnia are more commonly observed in adult females than in adult males. It has been speculated that comorbid depression and anxiety among females may contribute to a higher incidence of insomnia. In addition, periods of intense hormonal variability (e.g.; pregnancy/postpartum, menopause transition) appear to be associated with higher incidence of sleep disturbances in females. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the menopausal transition constitutes a period of heightened risk for the occurrence of depressive symptoms and vasomotor complaints, as well as insomnia. This article reviews the clinical and hormone factors that may play a role for the development of insomnia during the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Treatment options are critically reviewed, including cognitive-behavioral techniques, hormonal treatments, hypnotics, antidepressants, and complimentary/alternative medicine.

AB  - Supplementation during pregnancy forms a vital part of the well-being and development of the unborn child as well as the mother. Very often different brands of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals are taken, without considering the possibility of exceeding the maximum daily allowance, particularly where it concerns fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A. Although many people are aware of the consequences of taking too little vitamin A, this fat-soluble vitamin is stored in the body and over-dosage may occur when taking high doses. In this paper we investigate the effects of hypo- and hypervitaminosis A on craniofacial structures, lungs, hearts, limbs and the kidneys as well as the involvement in foetal nervous system development and post-natal sensorimotor functioning. Furthermore, we discuss how hypo- and hypervitaminosis A may affect the midline and lateral parts of the cerebellum, vermis, flocculi, ganglionic cell layer as well as the suprachiasmatic nucleas of the brain. Changes in the functioning of these areas due to hypo- and hypervitaminosis A, may lead to developmental and learning disabilities involving all forms of motor learning, vestibular functioning, eye and visual system deficits, disrupted sleep rhythms as well as altered mood and emotional processes.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess the non-inferiority of an oral contraceptive (OC)-pretreated cetrorelix regimen and a buserelin regimen in IVF/ICSI patients treated with r-hFSH in terms of total number of oocytes retrieved. Methods: Multicentre, randomized study. One hundred and eighty two patients were randomized to receive cetrorelix with OC pretreatment (n = 91) or to receive buserelin (n = 91). The cetrorelix group started with daily OCs on cycle day 5 and continued for 21-28 days. Cetrorelix (0.25 mg) was given daily from stimulation day 6 up to and including the day of r-hCG administration. The buserelin group started with buserelin (500 μg/day) for at least 10 days until down-regulation was achieved, after which the dose was reduced to daily 200 μg up to and including the day of r-hCG administration. r-hFSH was started in both groups on a Friday, in the cetrorelix group 5 days after the last OC pill intake. Both regimens were followed by a standard IVF or ICSI procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of oocytes retrieved per patient. Results: Number of oocytes, cancellation rates, r-hFSH requirements, number of oocyte retrievals during the weekend or public holiday and number of pregnancies were similar in both groups. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Conclusions: Cetrorelix pretreated with OCs resulted in similar number of oocytes retrieved compared with a long buserelin protocol. Both regimens were well tolerated and allowed scheduling of the oocyte retrieval, with only small number of retrievals falling on a weekend or public holiday. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine first-time mothers' postpartum stress and its correlates following discharge from the hospital or clinic after vaginal delivery. One hundred and eighty-three first-time mothers were enrolled from hospitals and clinics in Kaohsiung City. All first-time mothers reported normal pregnancies and vaginal deliveries, delivered healthy infants at term, and were surveyed during their postpartum periods after discharge from hospitals or clinics. The Hung Postpartum Stress Scale was used to examine first-time mothers' postpartum stress and stressors during their postpartum periods. The top ten postpartum stressors perceived by the women were: "the baby getting sick suddenly", "the flabby flesh of my belly", "the unpredictability of the baby's schedule", "interrupted sleep", "the shape of the baby's head due to the sleeping position", "not sleeping enough", "lack of information regarding infant's growth and development", "the baby's crying", "my life is restricted", and "the baby choking during feeding". There were no significant differences between the first-time mothers' demographic characteristics and their postpartum stress and its three components (negative body changes, maternal role attainment, lack of social support), respectively. Insight into the study results of first-time mothers' postpartum stress and stressors provides a reference for health professionals that the development of programs and resources addressing primiparous women's unique needs are required. © 2006 Elsevier.

AB  - After Specific Serotonine Reuptake Inhibitors arrived on the market, two new type of drugs appeared in antidepressant therapy, the Noradrenaline and Serotonine Reuptake Inhibitors (NaSRI) and the Noradrenergic and Serotonine Specific Antidepressants (NaSSA). Thanks to a specific activity on serotonine and/or noradrenaline systems, those three groups of medication appear to be easier to use and with less side effects than the older tricyclic drugs or the Mono Amine Oxydase Inhibitors. Nevertheless, each molecule has its own specificities which require precise usage recommendations. The purpose of this article is to go over the pharmacology of those three families of antidepressants, their pharmacokinetics, their specific characteristics and the precautions to observe while used with specific patients such as elderly people, pregnant women, drug users or teenagers. © Masson, Paris, 2006.

AB  - The aims of this review are (a) to critically examine the epidemiologic evidence for a possible association between smoking and the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), (b) to review the pathology and postulated physiological mechanism(s) by which smoking might be causally related to SIDS, and (c) to provide recommendations for SIDS prevention in relation to tobacco smoking. Over 60 studies have examined the relation between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of SIDS. With regard to prone-sleep-position intervention programs, the pooled relative risk associated with maternal smoking was RR = 2.86 (95% CI = 2.77, 2.95) before and RR = 3.93 (95% CI = 3.78, 4.08) after. Epidemiologically, to distinguish the effect of active maternal smoking during pregnancy from involuntary tobacco smoking by the infants of smoking mothers is difficult. Clear evidence for environmental tobacco smoke exposure can be obtained by examining the risk of SIDS from paternal smoking when the mother is a non-smoker. Seven such studies have been carried out. The pooled unadjusted RR was 1.49 (95% CI = 1.25, 1.77). Consideration of the pathological and physiological effects of tobacco suggests that the predominant effect from maternal smoking comes from the in utero exposure of the fetus to tobacco smoke. Assuming a causal association between smoking and SIDS, about one-third of SIDS deaths might have been prevented if all fetuses had not been exposed to maternal smoking in utero. © 2006 Freund Publishing House Limited.

AB  - Background: The molecular basis of changes underlying the altered sensitivity of the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) to the embryo over the peri-implantation period is not fully understood. Methods: Microarray analysis was performed on purified LE isolated from the pseudo-pregnant mouse uterus at 12-h intervals from pre-receptivity through the implantation window to refractoriness. The aim was to identify genes whose expression changes in the LE during this period. Results: A total of 447 transcripts were identified whose abundance changed more than 2-fold in the LE but which did not change in the underlying stroma (S) and glands. Six major patterns of changing expression were noted. Of the 447 genes, 140 were expressed in LE at least 15-fold higher than in S and glandular epithelium (GE) (101 of these more than 20-fold). Detailed spatiotemporal expression profiles were derived for several genes previously implicated in implantation (including Edg 7, Ptgs 1, Pla2g4a and Alox15). Conclusions: Functional changes in LE receptivity are characterized by changing constellations of gene expression. Pre-receptivity has a different molecular footprint to refractoriness. Because we have used the pseudo-pregnant mouse model, these changes are driven solely by endocrine signals rather than events downstream of embryo attachment. Some of these genes have been described in previous microarray studies on endometrium, but for the majority, this is the first time they have been implicated in implantation. The 140 genes enriched in the LE greatly expand the list of epithelial markers and provide many novel candidates for further studies to identify genes playing important roles in receptivity and embryo attachment. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of the focal epilepsy is possible even based on the clinical history. More precise identification of bioelectrical focus, type of epileptic attack and type of epilepsy requires EEG or videoEEG analysis. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess clinical value of electro-encephalography and videoelectro-encephalography in diagnostics of partial epilepsy in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 140 children with partial epilepsy hospitalized between 1998 and 2004 in Department of Pediatric Neurology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow. The group included 70 girls and 70 boys, aged from 2 months to 17 years. 38 of the children were older than 5 years, with mean age 8 years and 4 months. The mean time of the epilepsy course was 2 years and 4 months. Children with symptomatic partial epilepsy were the biggest group and children with idiopathic partial epilepsy were in minority. More than 50% of children suffered from complex partial seizures. Statistical correlation of the EEG results and pregnancy and birth period factors, results of neurological and psychological examination was performed. All children underwent MRI and 15 HMRS neuroimaging as well. All children underwent EEG examinations and 55 children videoEEG, recording time 60 minutes for each patient. Sleep recording in 40 children, awake EEG in 93 children and both type recordings in 8 children were performed. Stroboscope, hyperventilation and sleep deprivation stimulation tests were used. All EEG recordings were assessed by 2 physicians with the EEG license and final result was a mean of their assessment. T-student test, Mann-Whitney and bilateral Fisher test were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: EEG pattern was abnormal in 139/140 children, and videoEEG in all 55 children. In the vast majority of the patients with partial epilepsy focal EEG changes were recorded (in 111/140), with a significant prevalence of unilateral changes observed in 48/111 patients. 34 children had focal EEG changes with one-site prevalence and 27/140 children had focal EEG changes in both hemispheres without any prevalence. Generalized EEG changes were revealed in 16/140 children. Hyperventilation revealed in 8 children paroxysmal bioelectric activity and in 43 enhanced abnormal EEG pattern. In all children with normal MRI imaging EEG/videoEEG methods revealed changes significant for localization of seizures onset and origin. CONCLUSIONS: (1) EEG patterns in children with partial epilepsy were dominated by localized and lateralized changes. EEG was crucial for localization of bioelectric foci especially in children with normal MRI. (2) Focal EEG changes were significantly more often in children with hippocampal sclerosis. (3) In terms of localization HMRS were more compatible with EEG than with MRI findings. HMRS examination is strongly indicated especially in children with EEG localized discharges and with normal brain MRI.

AB  - Many new mothers who need antidepressant or mood-stabilising drug treatment may wish to breastfeed their infants, but are hesitant to do so because of possible harmful effects of the medication on the infant. This article reviews current data on drug excretion into breast milk and the effects on the breast-fed child, and provides recommendations for the use of the different psychotropic drugs in lactating women. Relevant literature was identified through systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Science Citation Index Expanded (ISI) from 1966 to February 2005. The present knowledge is based on the accumulation of case studies. No randomised controlled trials in breast-fed infants have been performed and there is a lack of long-term follow-up studies. Use of SSRIs and TCAs (except doxepin) is compatible with breastfeeding. However, if treatment with an SSRI is started in the postpartum period, fluoxetine and citalopram may not be drugs of first choice. With regard to other antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, trazodone, mirtazapine, reboxetine, moclobemide and other MAOIs, very little knowledge exists. Breastfeeding should be avoided while using lithium. Carbamazepine and sodium valproate (valproic acid) are generally better tolerated by the breast-fed infant than lithium. Data on lamotrigine are still sparse. Knowledge is also scarce on the novel antipsychotics and thus recommendations in lactating women cannot be made for these agents. It is unwise to expose infants unnecessarily to drugs that may have severe adverse effects. As such, clozapine should probably be avoided because of the risk of agranulocytosis. Our knowledge of the impact of drug exposure through breast milk is still limited. Infant drug exposure is, however, generally higher during pregnancy through placental passage than through breast milk. Despite the low dosage transfered to the infant through breast milk, premature infantsand infants with neonatal diseases or inherited disturbances in metabolism may be vulnerable to such exposure. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - The past two decades have contributed a large body of preclinical work that has assisted in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that cause chronic pain. In this context, it has been recognized that effective treatment of pain is a priority and that treatment often involves the use of one or a combination of agents with analgesic action. The current review presents an evidence-based approach to the pharmacotherapy of chronic pain. Medline searches were done for all agents used as conventional treatment in chronic pain. Published papers up to June 2005 were included. The search strategy included randomized, controlled trials, and where available, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Further references were found in reference sections of papers located using the above search strategy. Agents for which there were no controlled trials supporting efficacy in treatment of chronic pain were not included in the present review, except in cases where preclinical science was compelling, or where initial human work has been positive and where it was thought the reader would be interested in the scientific evidence to date. © 2006 Pulsus Group Inc.

AB  - The postpartum period is a high-risk period for occurrence of mood disorders (depression, mania) particularly for women with a history of bipolar disorder. We report the case of a woman with a postpartum mania episode with psychotic features induced by bromocriptine. This case report highlights the need to systematically explore the personal history of pregnant women in search of mood disorder which may proscribe use of bromocriptine. © Masson, 2006.
Indications:Lactation inhibition in 1 patient.
Patients:One 33-year-old female (dropout).
TypeofStudy:Case report presenting the occurrence of postpartum mania in a patient treated with Parlodel for lactation inhibition.
Results:Since the childbirth, the patient had shown major insomnia, increasing anxiety, psychomotor agitation with acceleration of thought and escape of ideas. She has an unstable mood, ranging from joy to anger in a few moments, where the dominant mood being mania. She describes suicidal ideas and presents with hyperesthesia. Clinical examination does not show anything in particular apart from light abdominal pains. The diagnosis based on the criteria of the DSM IV is mania with psychotic features. It is learned that the patient was treated with Parlodel with the aim of weaning. The treatment was initiated on the evening of the childbirth and was stopped after one week. Patient history revealed previous episodes of mania that resolved upon treatment with amisulpride. The patient was hospitalized and treated with lithium salts and clonazepam (8 mg daily), which resulted in improvements in symptoms. One month after hospitalization, the patient is discharged under maintenance therapy with lithium salts (750 mg daily).
AdverseEffects:The patient developed postpartum mania with psychotic features (major insomnia, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, hallucinations, suicidal ideation and hyperesthesia).
AuthorsConclusions:The puerperal period is one period where the risk of a manic episode particularly for women with a history of bipolar disorder is high. The use of bromocriptine in these women must be regarded as increasing the risk of relapse. This observation underlines the need to identify the women who are at risk to prevent this type of complication. The examination should include the search for personal or family history of psychiatric pathologies (bipolar disorders, puerperal psychosis) and variations of mood, treated or not, (depression, mania with hyperactivity and reduction of the need for sleep, suicide attempts) to detect the women among whom the prescription of bromocriptine should be contraindicated.
FreeText:Laboratory test: blood analysis, liver assessment, renal function, coagulation and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
DosageDuration:5 mg. The treatment was initiated on the evening of childbirth (1.25 mg the first day) then 1.25 mg morning and evening the second day and 2.5 mg morning and evening the third day. Duration: 1 week.

AB  - Obesity is a worldwide growing epidemic. The negative influence of obesity is huge and considered to be one of the major contributors to health problems in the western world. There is a significant association between obesity and diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, some cancers and syndromes of sleep apnea. Furthermore, obesity was described to have a negative influence on fertility, pregnancy, labor and pregnancy outcomes. It was also discovered that obesity was significantly associated with gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus and complications in cesarean delivery and anesthesia. This review aims to present updates on the relationship between obesity and pregnancy and labor outcomes, emphasizing the significance of obesity as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome.

AB  - The understanding of sleep disturbances in childhood requires a good knowledge of the development of state organisation and sleep-wake cycle, since the problem is often age-specific. Sleep states are present in utero from the beginning of the third trimester of gestation. Differentiated active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) are observed starting at 27 weeks of gestational age. Near term sleep is characterized by stable periods of QS, a very high percentage of AS. Beyond the first month of life, AS/REM sleep decreases significantly at the same time QS/NREM sleep increases and differentiates into stages 1, 2, and 3-4. Sleep onset no longer occurs in REM sleep after 9 months. Sleep changes occur at an earlier age during the diurnal than the nocturnal part of the 24-hr cycle. For both SWS and REM sleep the nycthemeral organisation is established by the age of 1 year. The disappearance of naps between 2 and 6 years is associated with substantial reorganisation of nocturnal sleep. It is likely that fetuses have functional circadian pacemakers entrained by maternal circadian rhythms. Circadian cycles are clearly present in human heart rate, movements and respiration in the last trimester of gestation. These circadian rhythms are lost at birth. In the neonate sleep and wakefulness follow an ultradian rhythm. Sleep/wake and biologic circadian rhythmicity reappears during the first weeks of life and is dependent on time cues. Emergence of circadian rythmicity probably plays a key role in the consolidation of nocturnal sleep. © 2005 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Cholelithiasis is a common disease worldwide and many epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of cholelithiasis is rapidly increasing in the last decade. Aims: To provide reference evidence for decision-making in cholelithiasis prevention through analyzing the risk factors related to the increasing incidence of cholelithiasis in China. Methods: The results of case-control studies on risk factors of cholelithiasis in China published domestically and abroad from January 1978 to February 2004 were analyzed by meta-analysis method. The pooled odds ratio(OR)and 95% confidence interval(CI)of the risk factors were calculated. Results: The cumulative cases and controls were 3 145 and 3 812, respectively. Greasy food (2.49), meat diet (2.19), favoring of animal edible oil (2.19), favoring of animal viscera (2.20), having no breakfast (2.03), body mass index ≥25 (1.95), hyperlipidemia (1.67), multigravidity (1.47), menopause (2.02), history of biliary ascariasis (6.25), history of cholecystitis (28.42), family history of cholelithiasis (3.36), alcohol drinking (1.54), lack of exercise (2.39), taking contraceptive orally (2.50) were the main risk factors for cholelithiasis in China. Vegetable diet (0.42), milk drinking (0.43), deep-well water drinking (in the countryside) (0.51), sleep after 22 p.m. (0.55) were the protective factors for prevention of cholelithiasis. Conclusions: Improving the dietary habit, breakfast eating, milk drinking, deep-well water drinking (in the countryside), body weight control, decreasing gravidity among women, decreasing of wine or liquor drinking, more exercises, and sleep after 22 p.m. are factors useful in prevention of cholelithiasis.

AB  - A few cases of death worldwide during GH treatment in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been recently described. The evaluation of further cases is needed to better identify possible causal mechanism(s), as well as to suggest some additional guidelines for prevention. We report the death of 2 additional children with genetically confirmed PWS in the first months of GH therapy. Case 1: This 3.9-yr-old girl was born at 39 weeks gestation. Low GH response to two stimulation tests was observed. GH administration was started at the age of 3.5 yr (0.33 mg/kg per week), when the patient was at 130% of her ideal body weight (ibw). Hypertrophy of adenoids was previously demonstrated. Snoring and sleep apnea were present before GH treatment, and did not increase during therapy. Four months later she died at home suddenly in the morning. Case 2: This patient was a 6.3-yr-old boy. He was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. At the age of 6 yr, his weight was at 144% of his ibw. He showed reduced GH secretion during provocation tests, and GH therapy was started (0.20 mg/kg per week). The previously reported nocturnal respiratory impairment had worsened after beginning GH administration. Tonsils and adenoids hypertrophy were noted. At the age of 6.3 yr he died at home in the morning following an acute crisis of apnea. These additional cases seem to confirm that some children with PWS may be at risk of sudden death at the beginning of GH therapy. © 2005, Editrice Kurtis.

AB  - This paper presents and analyses ideas about creation and conception among the Dongria Kond in Orissa, India. Its main aim is to understand a complex cultural system in which women are ascribed all creative power while men are expected to be active in order to facilitate and uphold creation. Using analytical concepts as redefined by Carol Delaney (1986, 2001) I argue that Dongria Kond do not have a concept of "paternity", but of "maternity" since they ascribe all creative powers to women. Women are seen as the sole creators, yet their role in Dongria Kond society changes markedly with marriage. Before this event, young girls sleep in dormitories where they are visited by boys from other clans. Sexual encounters between boys and girls are controlled by the girls, who should avoid becoming pregnant. With marriage, women leave their parent's village and join the village of their husbands, where they have sexual intercourse that should result in procreation. Marriage can be seen as the culturally legitimate form for men to gain control over the creative powers resting in women and it takes two forms: either through exchange of one form of "life" against the other in marriages involving bridewealth prestations, or through violence involved in cases of bride-capture. Similar ideas about men's active role and the need to appropriate fertility associated with the female earth goddess are further identified in the buffalo sacrifices regularly performed by Dongria Kond. © 2005 Dietrich Reimer Verlag.

AB  - Objective. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the number 1 cause of postneonatal infant death. Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare. Methods. Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon's population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant "always," "almost always," "sometimes," or "never." Frequent bedsharing was defined as "always" or "almost always"; infrequent was defined as "sometimes" or "never." Results. Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse. Conclusions. Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death "suffocation" or "overlay asphyxiation" simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This "diagnostic drift" may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.

AB  - Objective. To assess the urine protein/creatinine ratio in urine samples of pregnant women with hypertension in regard to: 1) the presence of significant variation at different periods of the day; 2) the differences if they exist, to identify the most reliable period of the day for sampling; and 3) whether the first sample, obtained when the patient arrives at the clinic, correlates with the same accuracy, with the 24-hour proteinuria. Design. Cross-sectional study. Place. Obstetrics Emergency Department, Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, a teaching hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Population. Seventy-five women with hypertension with 20-week gestation or over. Methods. Urine samples for determination of the protein/creatinine ratio were obtained on arrival (first specimen) and every 6 hours thereafter, totaling four samples in 24 hours. Four sampling periods were established: 1) from 8 am to 2 pm, 2) from 2 pm to 8 pm, 3) from 8 pm to 2 am, and 4) from 2 am to 8 am. The protein/creatinine ratio in the four different day periods were compared with the 24-hour proteinuria obtained simultaneously. The results were analyzed by the Spearman correlation and the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Results. The urine protein/creatinine ratio is strongly correlated (Spearman correlation equal to 0.8 or greater) with the 24-hour proteinuria at all four periods of the day (p < 0.001), as well as the first sample obtained on arrival (p = 0.003). These findings were corroborated by the ROC curve in which the values of four day periods and that of the first sample were equal to or greater than 0.930. Conclusion. In hypertensive pregnant women, the single voided urine sample protein/creatinine ratio, irrespective of sampling time, is strongly correlated with the 24-hour proteinuria, as is the sample obtained on arrival.

AB  - The survival of neonatal mammals requires a correct function of the respiratory rhythm generator (RRG), and therefore, the processes that control its prenatal maturation are of vital importance. In humans, lambs and rodents, foetal breathing movements (FBMs) occur early during gestation, are episodic, sensitive to bioamines, central hypoxia and inputs from CNS upper structures, and evolve with developmental age. In vitro, the foetal rodent RRG studied in preparations where the upper CNS structures are lacking continuously produces a rhythmic command, which is sensitive to hypoxia and bioaminergic inputs. The rhythm is slow with variable periods 4 days before birth. It becomes faster 2 days before birth, similar to the postnatal rhythm. Compelling evidence suggests that a region of the RRG called the preBötzinger complex (PBC) contains respiratory pacemaker neurones which play a primary role in perinatal rhythmogenesis. Although the RRG functions during early gestation, no pacemakers are found in the putative PBC area and its electrical stimulation and lesion do not affect the early foetal rhythm. To know whether the early foetal and perinatal rhythms originate from either pacemaker neurones or network connection properties, and to know which maturational processes might explain the appearance of PBC pacemakers and the rhythm increase during perinatal development, we computationally modelled maturing RRG. Our model shows that both network noise and persistent sodium conductance are crucial for rhythmogenesis and that a slight increase in the persistent sodium conductance can solve the pacemaker versus network dilemma in a noisy network. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome relevant in Lithuania. Methods: A nationwide case-control study surveying parents of 35 infants who died from sudden infant death syndrome during the period of 1997-2000 and parents of 145 control infants matched with SIDS infants for date of birth and for region of birth was carried out. Results: Deaths incidence was greater in the warm period (60%) vs. cold period (40%). Prone and side sleeping positions both carried no increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome compared with supine because of a rare prone sleeping (4.1% of controls vs. 0% of dead infants) and more prevalent side than supine sleeping (84.8% of controls vs. 94.3% of dead infants) in the controls as well as the cases. Bed sharing for the whole night as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome has not been confirmed, either, as bed sharing was common only for the controls (13.8% of controls vs. 0% of dead infants). Routine sleeping environment factors such as heavy wrapping (≥4 togs) of an infant (odds ratio 8.49; 95% confidence interval 2.38 to 30.32), sleeping in a bassinet (4.22; 1.16 to 15.38) and maternal factors such as maternal education ≤12 years (4.48; 1.34 to 14.94), unplanned pregnancy (5.22; 1.49 to 18.18) and ≥2 previous live births (3.90; 1.00 to 15.10) were significantly associated with sudden infant death syndrome on multivariate analysis. Conclusions: The results of this first population-based case-control study have shed some light on the epidemiology of the syndrome in Lithuania. Although the mortality of sudden infant death syndrome in Lithuania is not high, it might be lowered moreover by public informing about sudden infant death syndrome and related risk factors. Special attention must be paid to mothers with low education on potentially modifiable risk factors such as routine heavy wrapping of an infant during sleep, routine sleeping in a bassinet and unplanned pregnancy. © 2005 Bubnaitiene et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to test whether serum concentrations of leptin in ewes vary with a daily rhythm. For this purpose, we examined 24 h serum leptin profiles of ewes exposed to natural photoperiodic conditions and subjected to two different feeding schedules (regular feeding and fasting). The results show for the first time the existence of daily rhythm of plasma leptin in regularly fed ewes, with a minimum during the light phase and a peak during the dark phase. Daily rhythms of serum leptin persisted after 50 h of fasting, although fasting shifted the peak of the rhythm to the beginning of the light phase and significantly reduced daily leptin production. To gain a better understanding of the role of leptin in the temporal organization of physiological events related to pregnancy and lactation, we measured serum leptin profiles throughout 24 h in ewes either during pregnancy or lactation. Daily leptin rhythms were found to persist during pregnancy and lactation, but both physiological conditions altered leptin concentrations. Maternal serum leptin concentration rose between early and mid pregnancy, then decreased in the late pregnancy and during lactation. Daily serum leptin concentration was significantly lower in nonpregnant, nonlactating ewes, compared either to lactating or to early pregnant ewes. Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate levels of 24-hour urine insulin excretion before the onset of pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension. Design: Nested case-control study within the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention (CPEP) study cohort. Setting: Five university medical centres in the United States. Sample: Cases had developed pre-eclampsia (n= 70) or gestational hypertension (n= 142) in the absence of gestational diabetes. Controls (n= 429) had remained normotensive without gestational diabetes. Methods: Subjects were required to have had an adequate baseline 24-hour urine collection prior to CPEP enrolment at 13-21 weeks. Controls were matched to cases by enrolment site and specimen storage time, without regard to gestational age or CPEP treatment. Adjusted mean 24-hour urine insulin excretion was, however, calculated using analysis of covariance, with adjustment models for pre-eclampsia considering body mass index, race and smoking status; and for gestational hypertension, gestational age at specimen collection, height, body mass index and smoking. Urine insulin was measured by radio-immunoassay. Main outcome measures: Twenty-four-hour urine insulin excretion. Results: Adjusted 24-hour urine insulin excretion at baseline (mean 17 weeks of gestation) was greater in women who developed pre-eclampsia than in normotensive controls (mean [SE]: 15.6 [1.5] vs 13.1 [1.2] × 103μIU/24 hour, P= 0.06), but not in women who developed gestational hypertension (14.7 [0.9] vs 15.0 [0.6] × 10 3μIU/24 hour, P= 0.79, in cases vs controls). Among women who developed pre-eclampsia, adjusted urine insulin excretion was greater than controls only in women with mild pre-eclampsia and not in severe pre-eclampsia (mild pre-eclampsia vs controls: 17.3 [2.0] vs 13.7 [1.6] × 10 3μIU/24 hour, P= 0.04; severe pre-eclampsia vs controls: 12.3 [2.2] vs 11.5 [1.2], P= 0.69). Conclusion: The data suggest that early hyperinsulinaemia, a marker of insulin resistance, may predispose to mild pre-eclampsia. © RCOG.

AB  - All endocrinologists would like to make glucocorticoid replacement therapy for their hypoadrenal patients as physiological as possible. Many would like the reassurance of a method of monitoring such treatment to confirm that they are achieving this aim. Advances in our knowledge of the normal physiology are relevant to our attempts to do this. The cortisol production rate in normal subjects is lower than was previously believed. The normal pattern of glucocorticoid secretion includes both a diurnal rhythm and a pulsatile ultradian rhythm. Glucocorticoid access to nuclear receptors is 'gated' by the 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes, which interconvert active cortisol and inactive cortisone. Such complexities make the target of physiological glucocorticoid replacement therapy hard to achieve. The available evidence suggests that conventional treatment of hypoadrenal patients may result in adverse effects on some surrogate markers of disease risk, such as a lower bone mineral density than age-sex matched controls, and increases in postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Although the quality of life of hypoadrenal patients maybe impaired, there is no evidence of an improvement on higher doses of steroids, although quality of life is better if the hydrocortisone dose is split up, with the highest dose taken in the morning. Thus the evidence suggests that most patients may safely be treated with a low dose of glucocorticoid (e.g. 15 mg hydrocortisone daily) in two or three divided doses, with education about the appropriate action to take in the event of intercurrent illnesses. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background. Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by smoking and/or drinking. We investigate here the joint effect of smoking and drinking with respect to sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Methods. Survey of about 16,000 pregnant women in Japan, conducted in 2002 using a self-administered questionnaire. Results. Both smoking and drinking increased the odds of sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome. The joint odds ratios for smoking and drinking corresponded more or less to the products of the odds ratio for smoking or drinking. Conclusion. Smoking and drinking are independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy, in addition to their other well-known side-effects. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a prospective study of 247 pregnant Chinese women, the prevalence of sleep disturbances across pregnancy has been assessed using a set of validated questionnaires including the Sleep and Health Questionnaire (SHQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The frequency of self-reported snoring increased from 29.7% in the first trimester to 40.5% and 46.2% in the second and third trimesters, respectively, with an increase in the prevalence of moderate or severe snoring from 1% in the first trimester to 7.2% in the third trimester (P < 0.01). There was a higher frequency of moderate to severe snoring intensity among subjects with BMI ≥25 compared with those with BMI <25 kg/m2 in the third trimester (20.8%vs 5.3%, P < 0.01). Subjective sleepiness, as determined by the ESS, increased significantly from 8.6 to 9.4 and 9.6 in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. © RCOG 2005.

AB  - Our understanding of when the fetus can experience pain has been largely shaped by neuroanatomy. However, completion of the cortical nociceptive connections just after mid-gestation is only one part of the story. In addition to critically reviewing evidence for whether the fetus is ever awake or aware, and thus able to truly experience pain, we examine the role of endogenous neuroinhibitors, such as adenosine and pregnanolone, produced within the feto-placental unit that contribute to fetal sleep states, and thus mediate suppression of fetal awareness. The uncritical view that the nature of presumed fetal pain perception can be assessed by reference to the prematurely born infant is challenged. Rigorously controlled studies of invasive procedures and analgesia in the fetus are required to clarify the impact of fetal nociception on postnatal pain sensitivity and neural development, and the potential benefits or harm of using analgesia in this unique setting. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This descriptive research aimed to analyze the Nursing Diagnoses identified in low-risk pregnant patients. Eleven pregnant women received prenatal care in a safe maternity in the state of Goiás. The data were classified under the NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) taxonomy II and analyzed according to the referrals in obstetrics. Twenty-five different Nursing Diagnoses were identified. All pregnant women presented: insufficient knowledge (different levels and subjects), disturbed sleep pattern, activity intolerance, self-care deficit (bathing and hygiene), stress urinary incontinence, and some risk diagnoses. Identifying NANDA's Nursing Diagnoses allows the identification of the risk level, early detection of complications, and individualization in nursing assistance.

AB  - The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP; 6 cmH2O) or intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nIPPV; 10/4 cmH2O) on nonnutritive swallowing (NNS) and on the coordination between NNS and phases of the respiratory cycle, while taking into account the potential effects of states of alertness. Twelve full-term lambs were chronically instrumented at 48 h after birth for polysomnographic recordings, including NNS, diaphragm electromyographic activity, respiratory movements, pulse oximetry, and states of alertness. Studies in control conditions, with nCPAP and nIPPV, were performed in random order in nonsedated lambs at 4, 5, and 6 days of life. Results demonstrate that nCPAP significantly decreased overall NNS frequency, more specifically isolated NNS during quiet sleep and bursts of NNS in active sleep. In comparison, the effects of nIPPV on NNS frequency were more variable, with an inhibition of NNS only in wakefulness and an increase in isolated NNS frequency in active sleep. In addition, neither nCPAP nor nIPPV disrupted the coordination between NNS and phases of the respiratory cycle. In conclusion, nCPAP inhibits NNS occurrence in newborn lambs. Clinical relevance of this novel finding is related to the importance of NNS for clearing the upper airways from secretions and gastric content frequently regurgitated in the neonatal period.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined as an urge to move the legs with or without paresthesia, worsening of symptoms with rest and transient improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening and night. This is often genetic but may also occur in the setting of iron deficiency, uremia, pregnancy, neuropathy, and possibly other conditions. The pathology is probably related to central nervous system iron dysregulation. Effective treatments include dopaminergics and narcotics. Recent advances in our understanding of RLS clinical presentation, epidemiology, etiology, and treatment will be discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To describe developmentally appropriate, specific body movements and other biobehavioral responses of preterm infants to a group of routine care giving tasks (Clustered Care), and to compare responses to acute pain with those of Clustered Care. Methods: In a randomized design, 54 preterm infants were assessed at 32 weeks gestational age during 3 phases of blood collection (Baseline, Lance/squeeze, Recovery) and of diaper changing, measuring abdominal girth and axillary temperature, and mouth care (Baseline, Clustered Care, Recovery) in a neonatal intensive care unit. The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program and 1 facial action from the Neonatal Facial Coding System, Brow Bulge, were coded from separate continuous bedside video recordings. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were also acquired continuously. Results: Brow Bulge, heart rate, and a subset of 9 Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program movements increased and oxygen saturation decreased significantly to Lance/squeeze compared to Baseline. Similar facial and physiological changes occurred during Clustered Care, but with less intensity. However, infants showed greater frequencies and variety of Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program stress cues during Clustered Care than during Lance/squeeze. Stress cues persisted after Clustered Care, whereas the infants returned to Baseline following Lance/squeeze. Discussion: Changes in facial activity and heart rate remain the most sensitive markers of pain in preterm infants. Tactile procedures, such as diaper changing, produce lower intensity facial and physiological responses than pain procedures, but greater body reactions. Also, the effects from tactile procedures appear to last longer. Adding observations of a small number of specific body movements to the assessment of pain and stress provides complementary information particularly for those infants who may show dampened facial reactivity as a result of repeated pain exposure.

AB  - Women are at greatest risk of suffering from depression during the childbearing years and thus may either become pregnant while taking an antidepressant or may require a prescription for one during pregnancy. The antidepressant fluoxetine (FX) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which increases serotonin neurotransmission. Serotonin is involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological systems, including the sleep-wake cycle, circadian rhythms and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Each of these systems also plays an important role in fetal development. Compared with other antidepressant drugs, the SSRIs, such as FX, have fewer side effects. Because of this, they are now frequently prescribed, especially during pregnancy. Clinical studies suggest poor neonatal outcome after exposure to FX in utero. Recent studies in the sheep fetus describe the physiological effects of in utero exposure to FX with an 8 day infusion during late gestation in the sheep. This is a useful model for determining the effects of FX on fetal physiology. The fetus can be studied for weeks in its normal intrauterine environment with serial sampling of blood, thus permitting detailed studies of drug disposition in both mother and fetus combined with monitoring of fetal behavioural state and cardiovascular function. Fluoxetine causes an acute increase in plasma serotonin levels, leading to a transient reduction in uterine blood flow. This, in turn, reduces the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, thereby presenting a mechanism for reducing growth and/or eliciting preterm delivery. Moreover, because FX crosses the placenta, the fetus is exposed directly to FX, as well as to the effects of the drug on the mother. Fluoxetine increases high-voltage/non-rapid eye movement behavioural state in the fetus after both acute and chronic exposure and, thus, may interfere with normal fetal neurodevelopment. Fluoxetine also alters hypothalamic function in the adult and increases the magnitude of the prepartum rise in fetal cortisol concentrations in sheep. Fetal FX exposure does not alter fetal circadian rhythms in melatonin or prolactin. Studies of the effects of FX exposure on fetal development in the sheep are important in defining possible physiological mechanisms that explain human clinical studies of birth outcomes after FX exposure. To date, there have been insufficient longer-term follow-up studies in any precocial species of offspring exposed to SSRIs in utero. Thus, further investigation of the long-term consequences of in utero exposure to FX and other SSRIs, as well as the mechanisms involved, are required for a complete understanding of the impact of these agents on development. This should involve studies in both humans and appropriate animal models. © CSIRO 2005.

AB  - We report a rare case of type 1 diabetes in a woman associated with acromegaly who was treated with surgery after pregnancy. An 18-year-old woman came to our hospital in April, 1998, complaining of thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, appetite loss, body weight loss of 8 kg in a month, and amenorrhea beginning 2 months earlier. Based on laboratory data, she was diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although we suspected her of having acromegaly because of high growth hormone (GH) levels (6.9 or 8.5 ng/ml), blood levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were within normal range and the circadian rhythm of her blood GH levels was normally maintained. Her blood GH level was elevated to 12.6 ng/ml 15 minutes after a TRH administration. Blood GH levels were suppressed from 49 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml 4 hours after an oral administration of 2.5 mg of bromocriptine. A magnetic resonance images (MRIs) showed pituitary swelling, but no nodules were found in the pituitary. Therefore, we diagnosed her as having acromegaly and observed her without surgery, while prescribing diet therapy and intensive insulin therapy for diabetes. We started a treatment of oral administration of 7.5 mg of bromocriptine per day for the acromegaly from April 28, 2000, because her elevated GH was suspected of causing her diabetes to be poorly controlled. During a pregnancy from October, 2000 to September, 2001, diabetic control was improved with increased administration of insulin under a constant dose of bromocriptine. She delivered a normal full-term infant. After the bromocriptine therapy was stopped as she hoped to breastfeed, blood levels of GH and IGF-1 became elevated and her diabetic control deteriorated. As her pituitary tumor observed in pituitary MRIs became larger during the course, a transsphenoidal surgery was performed on March 8, 2002. After the surgery, blood levels of GH and IGF-1 lowered and diabetic control improved again. We concluded as follows: to rule out acromegaly in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, 1) measurements of serum GH and IGF-1 should be performed, and 2) pituitary MRIs should be performed if blood levels of GH or IGF-1 are high.

AB  - The study estimates the unpredictable disorder (chaos) within the 24 h pattern of sinus R-R intervals (SRRI) in clinically healthy pregnant women (CHPW) and clinically healthy non-pregnant women (CHNPW), in order to evaluate the early gestational changes in neurovegetative cardiac pacing. SRRI were provided by the 24-h Holler ECG of 10 CHPW and 10 CHNPW. SRRI were investigated by descriptive conventional statistics by means of the Time and Frequency Domain Analysis, and subsequently, in their chaotic component by means of entropy analysis. Both the SRRI and entropy were tested via the Cosinor method to better decipher whether or not the periodic disorder in heart rate variability is modified in pregnancy as a result of a gestational tonic resetting of the cardiac sympatho-vagal regulation. Cosinor analysis documented that the arcadian rhythm of both the SRRI and entropy were preserved in CHNPW and CHPW. However, the circadian rhythm of SRRI and entropy in CHPW exhibited a significantly decreased 24 h mean. Via the analysis of the rhythmicity of entropy, this study has documented that the chaos in the 24 h pattern of SRRI is less prominent in CHPW than in CHNPW. Such a reduction of level in the deterministic periodic chaos of heart rate variability provides evidence that, in early pregnancy, a tonic elevation of the sympathetic activity regulates cardiac pacing.

AB  - In rats, neonatal alcohol (EtOH) exposure coinciding with the period of rapid brain growth produces structural damage in some brain regions that often persists into adulthood and thus may have long-term consequences in the neural regulation of behavior. Because recent findings indicate that the circadian clock located in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus is vulnerable to alcohol-induced insults during development, the present study examined the long-term effects of neonatal alcohol exposure on the photic regulation of circadian behavior in adult rats. Rat pups were exposed to alcohol (3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 g·kg-1·day-1) or isocaloric milk formula on postnatal days 4-9 using artificial-rearing methods. At 2 months of age, animals were housed individually and circadian wheel-running behavior was continuously analyzed to determine the effects of neonatal alcohol treatment on the rate of reentrainment to a 6-h advance in the 12-h light:12-h dark photoperiod and the phase-shifting properties of free-running rhythms in response to discrete light pulses on a background of constant darkness. For all doses, neonatal alcohol exposure had a significant effect in reducing the time for reentrainment such that EtOH-treated rats required four to five fewer days than control animals for stable realignment of the activity rhythm to the shifted light-dark cycle. Coupled with the accelerated rate of reentrainment, the amplitude of light-evoked phase delays at circadian time 14 and advances at circadian time 22 in the 4.5 and 6.0 g·kg-1·day-1 EtOH groups was almost twofold greater than that observed in control animals. The present observations indicate that the mechanisms by which photic signals regulate circadian behavior are permanently altered following alcohol exposure during the period of rapid brain development. These long-term alterations in the photic regulation of circadian rhythms may account, at least partially, for some neurobehavioral consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure in humans such as depression. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aimed at examining any relation between the circadian variation in blood pressure (BP) in human pregnancy and fetal growth. A prospective study included 52 pregnant women monitored during the third trimester of pregnancy. There were 33 uncomplicated pregnancies with normal fetal growth (Group 1) and 19 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), confirmed at birth (Group 2). Ten women (five in each group) had pregnancy-induced hypertension. All women were hospitalized and followed a similar daily routine. BP was recorded with an automatic wearable device. Measurements were obtained every 20 min for 24 ± 1 h. BP profiles were analyzed by conventional statistical methods and by cosinor, involving the least squares fit of cosine curves with an anticipated period (24 h) to the data. BP parameters, fetal outcome, demographic and obstetric characteristics were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression and multivariate analyses were used to assess factors putatively associated with fetal outcome. The circadian amplitude of diastolic BP was found to be larger in normotensive women with IUGR. As gauged by odds ratios (OR), the circadian amplitude of diastolic BP (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8; P = 0.03) and hematocrit (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.9; P = 0.04) were the only variables positively and independently associated with IUGR. In the presence of maternal hypertension, the circadian amplitude of systolic BP was negatively associated with IUGR (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-1.0; P = 0.03). A larger circadian variation in diastolic BP, rather than a difference in the mean value of systolic or diastolic BP, was found to be statistically significantly associated with IUGR. This study adds another condition in which the circadian BP amplitude constitutes a harbinger of elevated risk, apart from an association with a shortened lifespan in the absence or presence of malignant hypertension and with an increased risk of stroke and nephropathy reported earlier. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

AB  - In this study, basal saliva cortisol was determined in women at 32 weeks of pregnancy and again at 9 months post-partum. During pregnancy, the cortisol levels of the 119 subjects were found to be elevated, with noon and evening levels more than twice as high as during the non-pregnant state. Despite the hypercortisolism, the cortisol awakening response was still present during pregnancy. Although the absolute mean increase in cortisol at 30 min post-awakening was larger during pregnancy, the relative mean increase was around 40% of the awakening level in both cases. The cortisol awakening response was not correlated between pregnancy and the post-partum, showing a lack of stability over the 11-month period. Finally, both in the pregnant and non-pregnant states, the magnitude of the cortisol awakening response was not related to time of awakening, nor to anticipation of a working vs. non-working day. In conclusion, the free cortisol awakening response is present during pregnancy, and is potentially a useful marker to study the association between prenatal psychosocial stress and offspring development. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is one of the commonest neurological sensorimotor disorders at least in the Western countries and is often associated with periodic limb movements (PLM) during sleep leading to severe insomnia. However, it remains largely underdiagnosed and its underlying pathogenesis is presently unknown. Women are more affected than men and early-onset disease is associated with familial cases. A genetic origin has been suggested but the mode of inheritance is unknown. Secondary causes of RLS may share a common underlying pathophysiology implicating iron deficiency or misuse. The excellent response to dopaminegic drugs points to a central role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of RLS. Iron may also represent a primary factor in the development of RLS, as suggested by recent pathological and brain imaging studies. However, the way dopamine and iron, and probably other compounds, interact to generate the circadian pattern in the occurrence of RLS and PLM symptoms remains unknown. The same is also the case for the level of interaction of the two compounds within the central nervous system (CNS). Recent electrophysiological and animals studies suggest that complex spinal mechanisms are involved in the generation of RLS and PLM symptomatology. Dopamine modulation of spinal reflexes through dopamine D3 receptors was recently highlighted in animal models. The present review suggests that RLS is a complex disorder that may result from a complex dysfunction of interacting neuronal networks at one or several levels of the CNS and involving numerous neurotransmitter systems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In fluctuating environmental temperature, homeotherms are able to maintain stable their body temperature, which however reveals a rhythmic daily pattern as described in literature. Because of the importance of body temperature rhythmicity in the knowledge of thermal homeostasis and as a means to facilitate the study of biological rhythmicity in general, the aim of our study was to assess the influence of two different ambient temperature on the daily rhythmicity of body and auricle temperature in goat (Capra hircus). For our study 6 female adult Maltese goats (18 month old), not pregnant and clinically healthy were used. On each subject body and auricle temperature was recorded during two different periods, of 7 days each, every 3 hours for 24 hours from 07.00 to 04.00, at different environmental temperature (1st period 18.25 ± 1.48°C, 2nd period 28.25 ± 2.05°C). The analysis of the obtained result under two ambient temperature indicates the existence of a daily periodicity, with small differences in amplitude and acrophase between the two studied period, both in body and auricle temperature in Maltese breed goat so we can assume that environmental temperature can influence in a significant way the daily pattern of body and auricle temperature. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - Leptin insufficiency at crucial target sites in the hypothalamic circuitries that integrate energy intake and expenditure underlies abnormal rates of fat accumulation. The payload of this 'fat burden' is metabolic syndrome, a cluster of life-threatening metabolic afflictions, and a shorter lifespan. Currently available therapies employed to combat obesity have disadvantages such as poor compliance for lifestyle modification or transient effectiveness and undesirable side-effects of pharmacological interventions. Recent studies suggest that neurotherapy comprising a single central administration of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding the leptin gene severely depletes fat and ameliorates the major symptoms of metabolic syndrome for extended periods in rodents. These persistent benefits avert the deleterious impact of the 'fat burden' and extend life expectancy. Thus, the novel approach of central gene-transfer technology has distinct advantages over current therapies and has the potential to correct or slow the progression of inherited or acquired hypothalamic diseases. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background/Methods: Nighttime salivary cortisol (NSC) has been suggested to be a useful diagnostic test for Cushing's syndrome (CS). In the absence of published data on its day-to-day variability, we assessed the reproducibility of NSC by repeated measurements in healthy volunteers. Its diagnostic performance was compared with 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC) and 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test in 12 patients with CS, 20 healthy volunteers, 14 referred patients in which CS was excluded or not firmly established, 16 obese patients, and 20 women in late pregnancy. Results: NSC showed a superior reproducibility in healthy volunteers with a low day-to-day variability as reflected by an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.78. The receiver operating characteristic curve-estimated cutoff of 6.1 nmol/liter (0.22 μg/dl) demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.0) in the diagnosis of CS. NSC, 24-h UFC [after adjusting the local laboratory cutoff to 504 nmol/d (183 μg/d)], and the urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio showed a tendency to be superior to 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test in correctly identifying CS. In late pregnancy, the preserved diurnal variation at a higher level of salivary cortisol reduced the specificity of NSC to 75%. Conclusion: Based on its remarkable reproducibility, easy noninvasive nature, and at least similar diagnostic performance, NSC appears to be a preferable alternative to 24-h UFC as a first-line screening test for CS. The cutoff values of NSC, 24-h UFC, and urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio have to be carefully adjusted using assay and center-specific reference ranges of sufficiently large populations.

AB  - Background: Although incident snoring is common in pregnant women and has been proposed as a potential risk factor for adverse maternal-fetal outcomes, the development of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy has not been prospectively described. Methods: Using the Apnea Symptom Score from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, we prospectively assessed symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime somnolence in 155 women to determine whether symptoms increased during pregnancy and the characteristics associated with increasing symptoms. Results: We found that sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (Apnea Symptom Score, 0.44 (SEM 0.58) vs 0.95 (0.09, P < .001) and the degree of daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 8.6 (0.3) vs 10.2 (0.4), P = .0003) increased significantly during pregnancy. Women with higher baseline body mass indexes and greater increases in neck circumference during pregnancy reported higher apnea symptom scores. Of the 155 subjects, 11.4% reported an increase in Apnea Symptom Score of 2 units or more, consistent with a clinically significant increase in symptoms; these women experienced a significantly greater increase in subjective sleepiness than other subjects (P = .03). Excessive daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) was prevalent throughout pregnancy (31.0%-45.5%). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing increase during pregnancy and that more than 10% of our subjects may be at risk for developing sleep apnea during pregnancy. Excessive daytime somnolence was highly prevalent even early in pregnancy and became increasingly common as pregnancy progressed.

AB  - Few studies exist that identify a useful self-report measure of physical activity for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 y ears. The women wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring, the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r = 49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day. © 2005 Sage Publications.

AB  - The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and (b) to determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant (≤ 31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards- Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had no apparent effect on lactation. © 2005 Sage Publications.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the relationship between the onset of eye movement periods and micturition in human fetuses and in neonates with the intention of clarifying the transition in relationship during the perinatal period. Methods: Data were acquired during 1-4 days and/or 1 month (29-33 days) from 6 normal neonates born at term. Eye movements, crying, and eye open periods were observed with a video recorder until micturition occurred. In 29 term fetuses, the time lag between the onset of an eye movement period and micturition was measured by real-time ultrasound instruments. Results: The time lag between the onset of an eye movement period and micturition in neonates (2 minutes; range, 0-57 minutes) was significantly (P=0.027) different from the time lag for fetuses (14 minutes; range, 2-32 minutes) and the frequency of micturition occurring within 8 minutes (33%) was significantly lower (P = 0.017) than that seen for term fetuses (72%). Conclusion: The relationship between the onset of an eye movement period and micturition is different in term human fetuses and neonates of less than 1 month of age. This suggests that the neuronal relationship among brain centers for micturition, rapid-eye-movement sleep, and awakening is dramatically altered perinatally.

AB  - We performed a cross-sectional study in human infants to determine if indices of R-R interval variability, systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability, and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity change with postmenstrual age (PMA: gestational age + postnatal age). The electrocardiogram, arterial SBP and respiration were recorded in clinically stable infants (PMA, 28-42 weeks) in the quiet sleep state in the first days after birth. (Cross-)spectral analyses of R-R interval series and SBP series were performed to calculate the power of low-frequency (LF, indicating baroreceptor reflex activity, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, indicating parasympathetic activity, individualized between the p-10 and p-90 values of respiratory frequency) fluctuations, and transfer function phase and gain. The mean R-R interval, and LF and HF spectral powers of R-R interval series increased with PMA. The mean SBP increased with PMA, but not the LF and HF spectral powers of SBP series. In the LF range, cross-spectral analysis showed high coherence values (&gt; 0.5) with a consistent negative phase shift between R-R interval and SBP, indicating a ∼3 s lag in R-R interval changes in relation to SBP. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, calculated from LF transfer gain, increased significantly with PMA, from 5 (preterm) to 15 ms mmHg-1 (term). Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity correlated significantly with the (LF and) HF spectral powers of R-R interval series, but not with the LF and HF spectral powers of SBP series. The principal conclusions are that baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and spectral power in R-R interval series increase in parallel with PMA, suggesting a progressive vagal maturation with PMA. © The Physiological Society 2005.

AB  - Excess bodyweight is the sixth most important risk factor contributing to the overall burden of disease worldwide. 1.1 billion adults and 10% of children are now classified as overweight or obese. Average life expectancy is already diminished; the main adverse consequences are cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and several cancers. The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake. Effective long-term weight loss depends on permanent changes in dietary quality, energy intake, and activity. Neither the medical management nor the societal preventive challenges are currently being met.

AB  - Somatic complaints of children in primary care settings often go unexplained despite attempts to determine a cause. Recent research has linked violence exposure to stress symptomatology and associated somatic problems. Unknown, however, is whether specific physical symptom complaints can be attributed, at least in part, to violence exposure. Urban African-American 6- and 7-year-old children (N = 268), residing with their biological mothers, recruited before birth, and without prenatal exposure to hard illicit drugs participated. Children and mothers were evaluated in our hospital-based research laboratory, with teacher data collected by mail. Community violence exposure (Things I Have Seen and Heard), stress symptomatology (Levonn), and somatic complaints (teacher-and self-report items) were assessed. Additional data collected included prenatal alcohol exposure, socioeconomic status, domestic violence, maternal age, stress, somatic complaints and psychopathology, and child depression, abuse, and gender. Community violence witnessing and victimization were associated with stress symptoms (r= .26 and .25, respectively, p < .001); violence victimization was related to decreased appetite (r = .16, p < .01), difficulty sleeping (r = .21, p < .001), and stomachache complaints (r = .13, p < .05); witnessed violence was associated with difficulty sleeping (r = .13, p < .05) and headaches (r = .12, p < .05). All associations remained significant after control for confounding. Community violence exposure accounted for 10% of the variance in child stress symptoms, and children who had experienced community violence victimization had a 28% increased risk of appetite problems, a 94% increased risk of sleeping problems, a 57% increased risk of headaches, and a 174% increased risk of stomachaches. Results provide yet another possibility for clinicians to explore when treating these physical symptoms in children. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Coffee has become an essential accompaniment to daily life, so much so that the aromatic cup has become a pleasant ritual that helps equilibrate and tones the nervous system. Coffee is an aqueous solution containing numerous substances that are present in varying degree according to the type of plant (Arabica, Robusta), the toasting process, and method of preparation used to make the coffee. Besides the aromatic composts present, coffee contains trigonelline (which during toasting is transformed into nicotinic acid or vitamin PP), chlorogenicacid, caffeic acid, potassium, essential oil of coffee and of course caffeine, a trimetyl xantine which attracts most of the attention of coffee advocates and detractors. Caffeine produces its main effects on the nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems through its inhibitory activity on adenosine receptors, thus enhancing attention and learning capacities, besides increasing coronary perfusion and diuresis. As for the negative effects, they can appear only after a high intake of coffee, usually more than 650 mg. a day. All studies indicate in fact that these effects aren't produced with moderate intakes. In particular no risks have been seen for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pregnancy, and neoplastic disease (in fact, in this last case coffee is considered a protective agent against colon cancer). It must be however pointed out that the quantity of caffeine present in "espresso coffee" is not high (40-70 mg.), quite inferior to that in a homemade cup of coffee usually drunk by Italians (80-100 mg.) and to the standard cup consumed by Americans (100-150 mg.). this is due both to the toasting process used and to the time of contact between coffee and water extraction preparation. Of utmost importance is the presence of two phenol composts, cholorogenic acid and caffeic acid that perform an antioxidant action against free radicals preventing those negative effects of aging and chronic-degenerative diseases. In particular chlorogenic acid has been singled out as the anti-neoplastic factor in coffee. In conclusion, even if there are some contraindications for some patients with neuropsychological disorders, we can state that coffee taken in quantities of 4-5 cups a day, in particular that processed in the Italia toasting method, can produce only positive effects. These being in the morning a better passage from the sleep to the walking state, and during the day, an increased ability to overcome tiredness with an improved work performance, besides offering a pleasant moment of relaxation between friends and relatives.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to investigate in untreated hypertensive patients the effects on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) of aspirin (ASA) administered at different times of the day. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that ASA produces an administration time-dependent inhibition of angiotensin II. Low-dose ASA has also been shown to reduce BP when administered before bedtime, as opposed to upon awakening, in normotensive and hypertensive volunteers, and in pregnant women at high risk for preeclampsia. METHODS: We studied 328 untreated patients with grade 1 hypertension, 44.0 ± 12.6 years of age, randomly divided into three groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary recommendations, the same recommendations and ASA (100 mg/day) on awakening, or the same recommendations and ASA before bedtime. Blood pressure was measured every 20 min during the day and every 30 min at night for 48 consecutive h before and after 3 months of intervention. RESULTS: After three months of nonpharmacological intervention, there was a small and nonsignificant reduction of BP (<0.2 mm Hg; p = 0.648). Blood pressure was slightly elevated after aspirin on awakening (2.6/1.6 mm Hg in the 24-h mean of systolic/diastolic BP; p = 0.002). A significant BP reduction, however, was observed in the patients who received aspirin before bedtime (6.8/4.6 mm Hg in systolic/diastolic BP; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective trial documents a significant administration time-dependent effect of low-dose ASA on BP in untreated hypertensive patients. The timed administration of low-dose ASA could provide a valuable approach, beyond the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, in the added BP control of patients with mild essential hypertension. © 2005 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB  - Background/Aims: Knowledge of the presence or absence of cortisol (F) circadian rhythm in preterm infants is important for the interpretation of F measurements made in samples taken for both clinical and research purposes. Little is known about its emergence in very preterm infants. This study examines circadian rhythm in F secretion in hospitalized infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. Methods: Design: Prospective longitudinal observational study. Subjects: 11 infants admitted consecutively and born before 30 completed weeks of gestation. Measurements: F was measured by highly specific radioimmunoassay on morning and evening saliva samples gathered at weekly intervals until discharged home. Circadian rhythm was defined as ≥40% reduction from morning to evening level. Results: For all data, the median salivary F was 10.3 nmol/l (range <0.5-372.8). F levels were highest in the first 3 weeks of life. No infants displayed classical circadian rhythm for 4 weeks or more prior to being discharged from hospital. The other infants showed randomly distributed morning and evening F values with a trend in 4 infants towards periods of consistently higher evening than morning values. Conclusion: Adult-type F circadian rhythm is rarely evident in hospitalized preterm infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Objective: To assess the relationship between blood pressure pattern and intrauterine growth restriction in normotensive pregnant women. Study design: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was consecutively performed between 32 and 34 weeks in 139 normotensive, non-proteinuric, primigravidae with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and in 140 primigravidae, matched for age and gestation, who were and remained normotensive throughout pregnancy and whose fetuses had regular fetal growth, who served as controls. Results: Although all measures were within the normotensive range, blood pressure of mothers with IUGR were significantly higher than controls. Twenty-four-hour mean, daytime, and nighttime systolic were 119.9 ± 11.9, 122.6 ± 11.7, 114.4 ± 13.3 mmHg, in women with IUGR and 108.0 ± 7.4, 109.2 ± 7.3, 102.1 ± 8.5 mmHg, in controls. Twenty-four-hour diastolic average, daytime, and nighttime diastolic (mean ± S.D.) 78.1 ± 9.3, 69.2 ± 10.6, 67.2 ± 9.0 mmHg, in women with IUGR and 64.1 ± 5.7, 66.0 ± 5.7, 58.2 ± 6.3 mmHg, in normal pregnant women. All differences p < 0.0001. Conclusions: Pregnant women with idiopathic IUGR have blood pressure higher than normal. Although within clinic normotensive range, slightly higher levels of blood pressure can alter uterine and placental perfusion and determine fetal growth restriction. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The present study tested the hypothesis that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure causes long-lasting changes in glucocorticoid signalling in postnatal offspring. Pregnant guinea pigs were treated with ethanol (4 g/kg maternal body weight/day), isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding or water throughout gestation, and maternal saliva cortisol concentration was determined 2 h after treatment at different stages of gestation. Electrically-stimulated release of glutamate and GABA, in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, as well as glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression, was determined in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of adult offspring of treated pregnant guinea pigs. Maternal saliva cortisol concentration increased throughout pregnancy, which was associated with increased foetal plasma and amniotic fluid cortisol concentration. Ethanol administration to pregnant guinea pigs increased maternal saliva cortisol concentration during early and mid-gestation. In late gestation, ethanol administration did not increase saliva cortisol concentration above that induced by pregnancy. Chronic prenatal ethanol exposure had no effect on stimulated glutamate or GABA release, but selectively prevented dexamethasone-mediated suppression of stimulated glutamate release, and decreased expression of mineralocorticoid, but not glucocorticoid, receptor mRNA in the hippocampus of adult offspring. These data indicate that maternal ethanol administration leads to excessively increased maternal cortisol concentration that can impact negatively the developing foetal brain, leading to persistent postnatal deficits in glucocorticoid regulation of glutamate signalling in the adult hippocampus. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Numerous markers continue to be studied as useful tools in the prevention of preterm delivery. Fetal fibronectin is the only assay widely used and consistently supported in recent studies. Although the predictive power of this marker is relatively low for preterm delivery, the specificity allows it to be used to exclude patients who would otherwise be aggressively treated for false preterm labor. It is possible that newer biochemical markers, either alone or in combination with existing markers, may be more sensitive in identifying patients truly at risk of preterm delivery. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Long-term alterations in prolactin (PRL) secretion following reproductive experience have been demonstrated in both women and female rats. In the rat, these changes include decreased PRL secretion in response to a dopamine antagonist challenge following ovariectomy, decreased post-coital diurnal and nocturnal prolactin surges in multigravid versus primigravid females, as well as decreased suckling-induced prolactin release in multiparous versus primiparous females. To date, there have been no studies examining PRL secretion following reproductive experience in cycling female rats. Studies in women, however, have demonstrated a reduction in basal PRL secretion during the menstrual cycle. The purpose of the present work was to determine whether similar changes occur in the rat during the estrous cycle and to what extent lactation is involved in these effects. In addition to examining PRL, potential parity-induced changes in estradiol secretion were also studied. The findings revealed a significant decrease in PRL levels during the afternoon of proestrus, which was only observed in primiparous females that had lactated. Significant differences in estradiol secretion were not detected following reproductive experience. Thus, a reduction in the PRL surge on the afternoon of proestrus is a consequence of reproductive experience that requires both pregnancy and lactation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The frustrating aspect of evidence-based medicine is that the evidence frequently generates more questions than it answers. The currently available basic and clinical data suggest that HUAM with or without perinatal nursing contact can reduce the risk of preterm birth and improve perinatal outcomes. Failures in the battle against preterm delivery probably arise from the more global failure to understand the complexities of prematurity and its treatment. There is a need to understand better the enigmatic and powerful forces that initiate the cascade of events leading to preterm labor and how to identify women experiencing that cascade. Better treatments are needed to interrupt the cascade, to arrest preterm labor, and prevent its recurrence. Finally, better measures of successful treatment are needed. The yardstick of delivery before or at term is too crude a parameter to measure successful obstetric interventions. In the meantime, however, credit should be given to HUAM where credit is due. It accurately identifies prelabor uterine activity that is present throughout the latter half of gestation, usually below the threshold of patient self-detection. HUAM has the capability of making the diagnosis of preterm labor earlier than does the patient left to her own perceptive capabilities. This seems to be a consequence of an increase in mild to moderate uterine contraction frequency that occurs 24 to 28 hours before the patient-identified diagnosis of preterm labor. HUAM has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth, improve the gestational age at delivery, increase birth weight, and improve perinatal outcome in virtually every prospective randomized trial where the comparison group received standard high-risk obstetric care typified by preterm birth prevention education and instruction in the self-palpation of uterine activity. In no study has a surveillance program inclusive of HUAM been associated with an overdiagnosis of preterm labor. The benefits of HUAM, however, cannot be differentiated from other components of the surveillance program, specifically frequent perinatal nursing contact, improved patient access, and the increased rest associated with monitoring. In those studies that have failed to show a benefit associated with HUAM, the control group almost always includes some or all of these added surveillance elements that move the control group beyond the current standard of care for patients at risk for preterm birth. The data are absolutely clear that HUAM and daily nursing contact are superior to routine care for the prevention of preterm birth. This was acknowledged by the ACOG committee opinion of more than a decade ago in 1992 [51]. Yet, despite global failure to reduce the rates of preterm birth in this country and the desperation to find an intervention that is effective in reducing this obstetric risk, very few practices have adopted increased prenatal surveillance using either frequent perinatal nursing contact or HUAM. It seems that preterm birth prevention is going to require a greater effort and cost than society has been willing to expend to date. It is possible that with improved techniques to identify those women at highest risk for preterm birth, with more successful therapies to interrupt the cascade of the preterm labor syndrome, or with better measures of tocolytic success, HUAM might be better recognized as a valuable adjunct to the obstetric management of this problem. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Factors contributing to maternal sleep when infants are 4 to 10 weeks of age were examined. Twenty-four-hour sleep-wake diaries collected from 37 mother-infant dyads in the home environment were summarized to describe total, longest, and mean sleep period; synchrony of maternal and infant sleep; and feeding frequency and duration. Regression and post hoc analysis of variance were used to examine factors contributing to maternal and infant sleep. Maternal sleep is driven by infant sleep and feeding pattern. The minimum and maximum numbers of infant sleep episodes per day were 6 and 15, respectively, and mean infant total sleep was 13.47 hours (SD 1.73). Mean maternal total sleep was 7.18 hours (SD 1.51), with half of the mothers reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Mean number of infant feedings was 11.14 (SD 3.27), with 11 infants (29.7%) receiving 13 or more feedings per 24 hours; minimum and maximum times per feeding were 15 and 41.7 minutes, respectively. Male infants had more sleep episodes, shorter sleep periods, and less sleep than females, and these gender differences resulted in shorter and more fragmented sleep for mothers. Findings suggest there is continued need for interventions to improve maternal sleep following childbearing. © 2005 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - Patients with obesity and those with sleep apnea syndrome are prone to gastroesophageal reflux. Likewise, both groups demonstrate an increased risk of difficult intubation. Rapid sequence induction remains important in obese and sleep apnea syndrome patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux or other predisposing condition such as diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, emergency surgery, and gastrointestinal conditions. In the case of elective surgery in a fasted patient with no risk factors other than obesity or sleep apnea syndrome, the requirement for rapid sequence induction is debatable. Cricoid pressure is probably efficacious but has not been proven in a randomized, controlled trial to prevent gastric aspiration. The clinician should be aware of the possibility that cricoid pressure will worsen mask ventilation and laryngoscopy and be prepared to loosen or release the pressure if mask ventilation or intubation is compromised. Regular training for the administration of cricoid pressure is indicated. If rapid sequence induction is required, succinylcholine remains the neuromuscular blocking agent of choice if there are no contraindications. Adequate anesthesia and muscle relaxation during induction are vital because coughing or straining during induction is a major risk for pulmonary aspiration. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Four behavioural states are recognised in the human fetus and are comparable to those of the neonate: 1F (quiet sleep), 2F (active state), 3F (quiet awake), and 4F (active awake). State 5, or crying, is not considered to have a fetal correlate. In a study assessing the effects of exposure to tobacco and cocaine during pregnancy on fetal response and habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation, what appears to be the fetal homologue of crying was observed. These behaviours were seen on ultrasound, and have been captured on video recordings and include: an initial exhalation movement associated with mouth opening and tongue depression, followed by a series of three augmented breaths, the last breath ending in an inspiratory pause followed by an expiration and settling. This is the first report/video documenting these behaviours and suggests the possibility of a state 5F.

AB  - Inconsistent use of oral contraceptives (OCs) exposes women to risks of unintended pregnancy. This study explored women's self-described reasons for missed OC pills. Data from diary cards completed by 141 women were studied to see how reasons for missing pills were related to patterns of pill use. The findings suggest that practitioners might improve OC use by focusing on the reasons that women miss pills, thus providing a more tailored approach that addresses individual risks based on women's personal experiences. © 2005 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and clinically significant motor disorder increasingly recognized by physicians and the general public, yet still underdiagnosed, underreported, and undertreated. Effective therapies are available, but a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis and start treatment quickly. We now have enough data to support the use of dopaminergic agents, benzodiazepines, antiepileptics, and opioids in these patients.

AB  - Exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), such as occurs in sleep-disordered breathing, is associated with increased apoptosis in vulnerable brain regions as well as with spatial reference memory deficits in adult and developing rats. The latter are more susceptible to IH, suggesting that early exposure to IH may have long-term consequences. Rats were exposed to 14 d of room air (RA) or IH starting at postnatal d 10. Working memory was then assessed in the water maze at 4 mo of age using a delayed matching to place task in which the rats were required to locate a submerged platform hidden in a novel location on the first trial (T1 or acquisition trial), and then remember that position after a delay (T2 or test trial). Mean escape latencies and swim distances were derived and the savings (T1-T2) were used as a measure of working memory. Male but not female rats exposed to IH showed working memory deficits at both a 10- and 120-min delay (for both latency and pathlength). Additionally, Sholl analysis of Golgi-stained neurons revealed decreased dendritic branching in the frontal cortex, but not the hippocampus, of male rats exposed to IH. Norepinephrine concentrations, dopamine turnover, and tyrosine hydroxylase activity were increased similarly in males and females. However, increased dopamine concentrations were present only in the frontal cortex of female rats. In conclusion, exposure to IH during a critical developmental period is associated with long-term alterations in frontal cortical dopaminergic pathways that may underlie gender differences in neurobehavioral deficits.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that local coherence in extra-dural EEG recordings, a direct measure of synchronous cortical network activity, oscillates with the same periodicity as EEG power cycling and follows a similar developmental trajectory. Methods: Local coherence was derived from continuous EEG recordings from closely spaced (1 cm) chronically implanted extra-dural electrodes over the right hemisphere in five fetal baboons (Papio sp.). A ratio of high to low frequency EEG band power (14-18 Hz to 4-7 Hz), was used to characterize EEG power cycling. Results: Data were obtained within a developmental window (137-151 days; term ∼175 days) during which fetal EEG power cycling becomes increasingly well-organized. During this period ultradian oscillations in local coherence with periods of ∼ 1 h developed in parallel with EEG power cycling of approximately the same periods. However, the cross-correlation and phase relationship between local coherence and power oscillations were variable. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cycles in cortical synchrony develop in parallel with fetal power cycles, but are not tightly coupled to them. Significance: Coherence provides a direct measure of cortical network dynamics not possible with univariate EEG measures such as spectral power. Reported here are the first measurements of local coherence in the developing fetal brain. Local coherence is studied with the long-term goal of monitoring the development of cortical network activity. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - The two principal challenges of neonatal physiologic monitoring device are: (1) the development of computational strategies that consider the rudimentary forms of neonatal sleep state especially for preterm infants and (2) any physiologic monitoring device for clinical applications in a neonatal intensive care setting must be small, portable, and user-friendly. Our multicenter neonatal sleep consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over 370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index: quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals, spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.

AB  - Up-regulation of the neuronal serotoninergic phenotype in relation to astrocytic population was studied in primary cultures of rat embryonic rostral raphe. Short treatments (18 hr at day in vitro 4) with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or dibutyryl-cAMP (dBcAMP) increased the number of serotoninergic neurons by ∼80% and ∼40%, respectively, and markedly enhanced the branching (by 11-fold and 5-fold, respectively) and total length (by 4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively) of their neurites. Concomitantly, under BDNF treatment, the astrocyte population was decreased by half and became mostly protoplasmic-like. In contrast, dBcAMP treatment also reduced the astrocytic cell density (by one-third) but induced a stellate morphology. Similar short treatment with the astrocyte-derived S100β factor induced no modification of the serotonin (5-HT) neuronal phenotype nor of astrocytes morphology. Both BDNF- and cAMP-induced effects were abolished by simultaneous treatment with the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, suggesting a role for the high-affinity BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase (TrkB). These data suggest that BDNF and cAMP, but not S100β, rapidly induce both an up-regulation of the 5-HT neuronal phenotype and modifications of the neighboring astrocytes in a TrkB-dependent manner. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Maternal care in the rabbit is restricted to a single 3- to 5-min period of nursing each day. One to three hours prior to the arrival of the mother, pups exhibit anticipatory behavioral arousal and elevation of core body temperature. In rodents, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is quiescent and levels of the adrenal hormone, corticosterone (CORT), are stable and extremely low during the first days of life, which are known collectively as the stress- hyporesponsive period (SHRP). It has been proposed that the rabbit also has an SHRP. However, we decided to examine CORT changes associated with the daily nursing bout, since behavioral arousal, core body temperature, and CORT are elevated prior to the onset of feeding in many other species. We scheduled the nursing bout at 1000 h and analyzed CORT concentration using RIA in pups sampled at various intervals after suckling. CORT levels showed a circadian variation that peaked at the time of the daily nursing bout. After nursing, values steadily decreased to a nadir at 2200 h and then rose again in advance of the next scheduled nursing. The three-fold difference between the highest (1000 h) and the lowest (2200 h) CORT values suggests that either the SHRP does not exist in rabbit pups or else it has properties that differ from those described for rodents. Unlike rodents, rabbit pups show a circadian secretion of CORT synchronized to the scheduled nursing bout. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Understanding of local knowledge and practices relating to the newborn period, as locally defined, is needed in the development of interventions to reduce neonatal mortality. We describe the organisation of the neonatal period in Sylhet District, Bangladesh, the perceived threats to the well-being of neonates, and the ways in which families seek to protect them. Methods: We did 39 in-depth, unstructured, qualitative interviews with mothers, fathers, and grandmothers of neonates, and traditional birth attendants. Data on neonatal knowledge and practices were also obtained from a household survey of 6050 women who had recently given birth. Findings: Interviewees defined the neonatal period as the first 40 days of life (chollish din). Confinement of the mother and baby is most strongly observed before the noai ceremony on day 7 or 9, and involves restriction of movement outside the home, sleeping where the birth took place rather than in the mother's bedroom, and sleeping on a mat on the floor. Newborns are seen as vulnerable to cold air, cold food or drinks (either directly or indirectly through the mother), and to malevolent spirits or evil eye. Bathing, skin care, confinement, and dietary practices all aim to reduce exposure to cold, but some of these practices might increase the risk of hypothermia. Interpretation: Although fatalism and cultural acceptance of high mortality have been cited as reasons for high levels of neonatal mortality, Sylheti families seek to protect newborns in several ways. These actions reflect a set of assumptions about the newborn period that differ from those of neonatal health specialists, and have implications for the design of interventions for neonatal care.

AB  - Herbs are often administered in combination with therapeutic drugs, raising the potential of herb-drug interactions. An extensive review of the literature identified reported herb-drug interactions with clinical significance, many of which are from case reports and limited clinical observations. Cases have been published reporting enhanced anticoagulation and bleeding when patients on long-term warfarin therapy also took Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen). Allium sativum (garlic) decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration of saquinavir, but not ritonavir and paracetamol (acetaminophen), in volunteers. A. sativum increased the clotting time and international normalised ratio of warfarin and caused hypoglycaemia when taken with chlorpropamide. Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo) caused bleeding when combined with warfarin or aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), raised blood pressure when combined with a thiazide diuretic and even caused coma when combined with trazodone in patients. Panax ginseng (ginseng) reduced the blood concentrations of alcohol (ethanol) and warfarin, and induced mania when used concomitantly with phenelzine, but ginseng increased the efficacy of influenza vaccination. Scutellaria baicalensis (huangqin) ameliorated irinotecan-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in cancer patients. Piper methysticum (kava) increased the 'off' periods in patients with parkinsonism taking levodopa and induced a semicomatose state when given concomitantly with alprazolam. Kava enhanced the hypnotic effect of alcohol in mice, but this was not observed in humans. Silybum marianum (milk thistle) decreased the trough concentrations of indinavir in humans. Piperine from black (Piper nigrum Linn) and long (P. longum Linn) peppers increased the AUC of phenytoin, propranolol and theophylline in healthy volunteers and plasma concentrations of rifamipicin (rifampin) in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Eleutheroccus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) increased the serum concentration of digoxin, but did not alter the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan and alprazolam in humans. Hypericum perforatum (hypericum; St John's wort) decreased the blood concentrations of ciclosporin (cyclosporin), midazolam, tacrolimus, amitriptyline, digoxin, indinavir, warfarin, phenprocoumon and theophylline, but did not alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, pravastatin, mycophenolate mofetil and dextromethorphan. Cases have been reported where decreased ciclosporin concentrations led to organ rejection. Hypericum also caused breakthrough bleeding and unplanned pregnancies when used concomitantly with oral contraceptives. It also caused serotonin syndrome when used in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. sertraline and paroxetine). In conclusion, interactions between herbal medicines and prescribed drugs can occur and may lead to serious clinical consequences. There are other theoretical interactions indicated by preclinical data. Both pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic mechanisms have been considered to play a role in these interactions, although the underlying mechanisms for the altered drug effects and/or concentrations by concomitant herbal medicines are yet to be determined. The clinical importance of herb-drug interactions depends on many factors associated with the particular herb, drug and patient. Herbs should be appropriately labeled to alert consumers to potential interactions when concomitantly used with drugs, and to recommend a consultation with their general practitioners and other medical carers. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - To gain insight into the relationship between thymus and pineal gland during rat development, the melatonin content as well as the activity and expression of the two key enzymes for melatonin biosynthesis, i.e. N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), were studied in the thymus at fetal and postnatal stages. Moreover, melatonin-membrane receptor (MT1) expression was also analyzed. We found both the expression and activity of thymic NAT and HIOMT at 18 days of fetal life. Additionally, there is production of melatonin in the thymus as well as MT1 expression at this fetal age. These results show values higher in day-time than at night-time. The pineal gland begins to produce significant levels of melatonin around postnatal day 16, and this synthesis shows a circadian rhythm with high values during the dark period; therefore the nocturnal serum melatonin may inhibit thymic melatonin production. To document this, we report an increased melatonin content of the thymus in pinealectomized rats compared with shampinealectomized. In conclusion, these results show, for the first time, the presence of the biosynthetic machinery of melatonin and melatonin production in developing rat thymus and that the pineal gland may regulate this process.

AB  - We assessed the influence of perinatal melatonin on reproductive development and adult responsiveness to melatonin. Testicular growth in an intermediate day length (14: 10 h light/dark cycle) was substantially reduced in Siberian hamsters gestated by pinealectomised compared to pineal-intact females; gonadal development was normalised in offspring of pinealectomised dams that were pinealectomised at 3-4 days of age. Hamsters deprived of melatonin only during gestation, or both pre- and postnatally, underwent testicular involution during treatment with melatonin in adulthood. Photoperiodic histories acquired prenatally did not endure as long as those acquired by adult hamsters. Hamsters first exposed to melatonin in adulthood were not more proficient in acquiring photoperiodic histories than were normal males. These findings indicate that pre- versus postnatal differences in melatonin signal duration determine rates of testicular development. Exposure to melatonin perinatally does not appear to organise the neuroendocrine substrate that mediates effects of day length and melatonin on the gonads of adult hamsters. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Animal studies suggest that prenatal stress is associated with long-term disturbance in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, but evidence in humans is lacking. This study examined the long-term association between prenatal anxiety and measures of diurnal cortisol at age 10 years. Methods: Measures of cortisol were collected at awakening, 30 min after awakening, and at 4 pm and 9 pm on 3 consecutive days in a sample of 10-year-olds (n = 74) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective longitudinal cohort study of mothers and children on whom measures of anxiety and depression were collected in pregnancy and the postpartum period. Analyses examined the links between symptoms of prenatal anxiety and multiple indicators of cortisol, an index of HPA axis functioning. Results: Prenatal anxiety was significantly associated with individual differences in awakening and afternoon cortisol after accounting for obstetric and sociodemographic risk (partial correlations were .32 and .25, p < .05). The effect for awakening cortisol remained significant after controlling for multiple postnatal assessments of maternal anxiety and depression. Conclusions: This study provides the first human evidence that prenatal anxiety might have lasting effects on HPA axis functioning in the child and that prenatal anxiety might constitute a mechanism for an increased vulnerability to psychopathology in children and adolescents. © 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - The restless legs syndrome is a common disorder that encompasses an idiopathic form of genetic or unknown origin and symptomatic forms associated with many causes. Symptomatic forms occur during pregnancy and are coincident with uraemia, iron depletion, polyneuropathy, spinal disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis. For the hereditary forms, at least three gene loci, located on chromosomes 12, 14, and 9, have been traced so far. Prevalence in the general population is between 3% and 9%, increases with age, and is higher in women than in men. Treatment is needed only in the moderate to severe forms of the disorder and mostly in elderly people. Pathophysiology and treatment may be closely linked to the dopaminergic system and iron metabolism. Dopaminergic treatment with levodopa and dopamine agonists is the first choice in idiopathic restless legs syndrome, but augmentation and rebound should be monitored in long-term treatment. Various other drugs, such as opioids, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines, provide alternative treatment possibilities.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal smoking, sleeping position, sleep state and postnatal age on heart rate changes following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation in infants. Subjects: We studied healthy term infants, 13 of whom were born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Each infant was studied using daytime polysomnography on 3 occasions: (a) 2-3 weeks, (b) 2-3 months and (c) 5-6 months after birth. Nasal air-jet stimulation was presented in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. Results: We found no difference between infants of smoking and non-smoking mothers in any of the parameters measured. Minimum HR (MinHR) following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation was significantly lower in the supine compared to the prone sleeping position at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months of age (p < 0.05) in AS, and at all 3 ages in QS (p < 0.01). MinHR was significantly lower in QS compared to AS at 2-3 months when infants slept prone and at 5-6 months when sleeping supine (p < 0.01). In QS, MinHR became lower with increasing postnatal age in both sleep positions (p < 0.01). In AS, there was no maturational effect. The normalized bradycardia (ΔHR%) was significantly greater in AS than in QS at 2-3 weeks of age (p < 0.05) when infants slept supine. Conclusion: Our study has shown that there was a decrease in heart rate (MinHR) following trigeminal stimulation in infants up to 6 months of age and this was affected by sleep position and sleep state, being larger in the supine sleeping position and the QS state. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether assisted conception is associated with an increased risk of admission to a residential early parenting program for treatment of maternal mood disorder or infant feeding or sleeping disorders in the postpartum year. Design: Systematic audit of consecutive medical records. Setting: Masada Private Hospital Mother Baby Unit (MPHMBU), Melbourne, Australia. Patient(s): Medical records of all mother-infant dyads admitted to MPHMBU between July 2000 and August 2002. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Modes of conception and delivery of index infant, maternal and infant age on admission, multiplicity of birth, infant birth weight, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores. Result(s): A total of 745 records were audited, and mode of conception was recorded in 526 (70.6%) of records. Overall 6% (45/745) of the admitted infants had been conceived through assisted reproductive technologies compared with 1.52% in the general population (relative risk 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-5.4). Mothers who had conceived with assisted reproductive technologies were older and more likely to have had cesarean and multiple births than those who conceived spontaneously. Conclusions: Assisted conception appears to be associated with a significantly increased rate of early parenting difficulties. Women who experience assisted conception may require additional support before and after their babies are born. ©2005 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the sleeping condition of pregnant women for the first time, and compare the sleep quality between pregnant women with and without the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: Seventy-five first-time pregnant women (pregnant group), who delivered in the sickroom of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University and Kaifeng Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology between May 2000 and May 2004, were investigated with the scales and questionnaires voluntarily. Another 75 healthy physical examinees (control group) in the hospital at the same period were selected matched according to the one-to-one ratio. All the subjects were assessed with sleep quality inventory, self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) at 1 week after admission. The t test was used for the intergroup comparison. Results: All the 75 pregnant women and 75 healthy people were involved in the analysis of results. There were 33 and 42 pregnant women with and without the symptom of anxiety, 29 and 46 pregnant women with and without the symptom of depression. 1 The scores of time to fall sleeping, sleeping maintenance, self-rating sleeping and total sleeping time and the total score of sleep quality were obviously higher in the pregnant group than in the control group (1.09±0.35, 0.41±0.04, 0.92±0.13, 0.96±0.24, 4.75±0.97; 0.81±0.40, 0.29±0.04, 0.50±0.08, 0.72±0.16, 3.92±0.72, t=2.166-3.165, P < 0.05-0.01). 2 The scores of time to fall sleeping, sleeping maintenance, self-rating sleeping, time of mid-day rest, total sleeping time and dream memory and the total score of sleep quality were obviously higher in the pregnant women with anxiety than in those without anxiety (1.22±0.40, 0.47±0.07, 0.92±0.16, 1.29±0.43, 0.99±0.25, 0.74±0.13, 4.95±1.05; 0.96±0.38, 0.36±0.08, 0.63±0.15, 1.06±0.32, 0.78±0.20, 0.60±0.06, 4.25±0.95, t=2.231-3.127, P < 0.05-0.01). 3 The scores of time to fall sleeping, self-rating sleeping, total sleeping time and the total score of sleep quality were obviously higher in the pregnant women with depression than in those without depression (1.14±0.38, 0.87±0.15, 1.26±0.31, 0.95±0.27, 4.84±1.01; 0.89±0.40, 0.69±0.13, 1.04±0.52, 0.80±0.32, 4.19±0.83, t=2.245-2.407, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The sleep quality of the first-time pregnant women is obviously decreased, and the sleep quality is worse in those with the symptoms of anxiety and depression.

AB  - Pharmacotherapy in pregnant women is often necessary to treat chronic or relapsing depression or anxiety disorders. Studies that have evaluated the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in early pregnancy have not shown an enhanced risk of major congenital malformations and these results may have contributed to the increasing use of these agents during pregnancy. Fewer studies have assessed the safety of SSRIs in the third trimester of pregnancy. This article reviews available human data on the safety of SSRI treatment in the third trimester. The main purpose is to present and discuss the existing literature on the risks to the infant and to suggest treatment guidelines for the use of SSRIs in late pregnancy. The use of SSRIs in the third trimester has shown various perinatal complications, most frequently respiratory distress, irritability and feeding problems. Further studies are needed to evaluate the frequency of these complications and to elucidate whether the symptoms represent a direct serotonergic effect or are a drug withdrawal effect. Studies have shown conflicting results with respect to whether SSRI exposure decreases birthweight and increases the risk of premature delivery. A few case reports have described intracerebral haemorrhage in neonates after maternal SSRI treatment, but it is not known whether the frequency of such complications is higher than in unexposed neonates. Data on possible long-term effects of prenatal SSRI exposure on psychomotor and behavioural development are very sparse. Our interpretation of the current literature suggests that the risk of not receiving adequate antidepressant treatment in the third trimester when indicated outweighs the risks of adverse events in the infant. Thus, adequate pharmacological treatment should not be withheld from a depressed pregnant woman in late pregnancy. However, the neonate should be monitored for possible adverse effects after maternal use of an SSRI in the third trimester. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies based on conventional office blood pressure (BP) measurements concluded that both maternal age and parity have significant effects on BP during pregnancy. Previous results have also indicated predictable trends of BP variability with gestational age. Accordingly, we have evaluated possible differences in the Orcadian pattern of ambulatory BP as a function of parity, maternal age, and stage of gestation in normotensive women who were systematically studied by ambulatory BP monitoring during their pregnancies. We analyzed 1408 BP profiles obtained from 126 nulliparous and 109 multiparous pregnant women sampled for 48 consecutive h every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery. Data were divided for comparative analysis according to parity (nulliparous versus multiparous), age (≤25, 26-30, 31-35, and ≥36 yrs), and trimester of gestation. Circadian BP parameters established by population multiple-components analysis were compared between groups using a nonparametric test. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern described by a model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 h is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic BP for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (always p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the 24 h mean among groups divided by parity at any age or stage of pregnancy. A trend of increasing BP with age was found for diastolic but not for systolic BP. Although statistically significant, differences in the 24 h mean of diastolic BP among groups divided by age were always less than 2 mm Hg. Data obtained from systematic ambulatory monitoring in normotensive pregnant women indicate the lack of differences in BP according to parity. The small, although significant, increase in diastolic BP with age may have scarce influence in the proper identification of women with gestational hypertension. Reference thresholds for BP to be used in the early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy could thus be developed as a function of the rest-activity cycle and gestational age only, and independently of parity or maternal age.

AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that affects 8-12% of children worldwide. Although the rate of ADHD falls with age, at least half of children with the disorder will have impairing symptoms in adulthood. Twin, adoption, and molecular genetic studies show ADHD to be highly heritable, and other findings have recorded obstetric complications and psychosocial adversity as predisposing risk factors. Converging evidence from animal and human studies implicates the dysregulation of frontal-subcortical-cerebellar catecholaminergic circuits in the pathophysiology of ADHD, and molecular imaging studies suggest that abnormalities of the dopamine transporter lead to impaired neurotransmission. Studies during the past decade have shown the safety and effectiveness of new non-stimulant drugs and long-acting formulations of methylphenidate and amfetamine. Other investigations have also clarified the appropriate role of targeted psychosocial treatments in the context of ongoing pharmacotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression during pregnancy is frequently treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (FX), commonly known as Prozac (Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN). FX potentiates serotoninergic neurotransmission and serotonin has been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms. We have therefore investigated the effect of chronic administration of FX on maternal and fetal circadian rhythms in sheep. METHODS: Following an initial bolus dose of 70 mg FX, an 8-day continuous infusion of FX (n = 11, 98.5 μg/kg·d) was performed. Controls (n = 13) were treated with sterile water vehicle only. Maternal and fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations were determined every 3 hours for 24 hours and then every 6 hours for 24 hours beginning on the fourth day of infusion. RESULTS: FX treatment did not alter either the basal or circadian rhythms of either maternal or fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations. Fetal cardiovascular and behavioral state parameters were measured continuously. While the incidence of low-voltage (LV) electrocortical (ECOG) activity was significantly reduced in fetuses in the FX group, there was no effect of FX on the diurnal rhythms in fetal arterial pressure, heart rate, breathing movements, or behavioral state. CONCLUSION: These results show that maternal FX treatment does not result in significant alterations in maternal and fetal hormonal and behavioral circadian rhythms.

AB  - Pregnancy specific rhinitis, a long lasting nasal congestion without signs of infection, allergy or tumor occurs in about 25% of pregnancies. It can start at any time during gestation and disappears completely within 2 weeks of delivery. Besides smoking and sensitisation to house dust mites, chronic sinusitis is one of its major risk factors. The consequences of pregnancy rhinitis include dryness of the mouth, headaches, sleeping disorders and the induction of sinusitis. Hormonal influences are most likely, however, a definitive pathophysiological concept does not exist. Besides its symptoms and pathogenesis, various treatment options for pregnancy rhinitis are presented and a stepwise pharmacotherapeutic strategy is developed. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2005.

AB  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum "blues," depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders. © 2005 CMA Media Inc.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe factors associated with actigraphic and subjective sleep quality in young women. Methods: Participants were 73 regularly menstruating women, 20-40 years old, who were not taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, or shift workers. Women contributed an average of 7 nights of actigraphy data during the luteal menstrual cycle phase, resulting in a total of 595 nights of data. Results: One night of actigraphy data was unreliable for measuring total sleep time, sleep onset, and time in bed (intraclass correlation ≤.15) but was acceptable for measuring sleep efficiency and total wake time (intraclass correlation [ICC]=.52). Going to bed late, medication use, employment, increased daylight hours, longer menstrual cycle length, and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with poorer actigraphic sleep measures. Employment, age, and perceived stress were associated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusion: Multiple factors were associated with sleep quality in these young women who were sleeping at home. However, the associations differed for subjectively versus actigraphically assessed sleep quality. Actigraphy is feasible for measuring sleep, but multiple recording nights may be needed to obtain reliable estimates. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The characteristic symptoms of SAD, including hypersomnia and weight gain, might reflect a genetically programmed attempt to conserve energy during historically predictable periods of dwindling food supply. While this basic hypothesis has obvious conceptual appeal, few authors have considered the specific positive selection pressures that might have contributed to such a process. The goal of the current paper is to further develop an evolutionary model of SAD with a focus on energy conservation in the context of seasonal reproductive cycles. To accomplish this, seasonal data on birth rates are considered from an evolutionary viewpoint. There is considerable indirect evidence that in temperate climates, the symptoms of SAD reflect a predisposition for conception to occur in late spring/early summer to ensure a peak of births in the late winter/early spring. The adaptive value of such a pattern, and its putative role in natural selection in humans, is also discussed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. This review describes factors contributing to the variable nature of asthma and the versatile treatment strategies required for the clinical management of the disease. Data Sources. A comprehensive review of the literature using MEDLINE was conducted. Study Selection. Included articles were selected for their relevance to variability or severity of asthma. Bibliographies of selected articles served as additional sources of considered publications. Results. Asthma severity can vary substantially among patients and within individual patients because of physiologic, environmental, or behavioral factors. Inhaled corticosteroids are an effective and versatile treatment option for special populations with asthma and for patients with varying degrees of asthma severity. Inhaled corticosteroids are now the preferred treatment for all three severity levels of persistent asthma, especially in young children and pregnant women. Treatment regimens may be adjusted up or adjusted down when appropriate to maintain optimal symptom control and limit potential adverse systemic effects. Conclusions. The clinical management of asthma is challenging given the day-to-day variability of the disease. Variability in pulmonary function and asthma symptoms may be minimized through increased awareness of the factors contributing to asthma variability as well as the effective use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Flexible treatment strategies that consider the different severities of asthma and account for variability within individual patients may be particularly useful in improving adherence and patient outcomes.

AB  - To examine whether lighting conditions during the development of the rat circadian system affect the morphology of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), three groups of rats were born and maintained until they were 24 days old under constant light (LL), constant darkness (DD) or 24-h light-dark cycles (LD, 12-h light and 12-h darkness). We applied a stereological method to study whether these conditions lead to alterations in the volume of the SCN and changes in the total number of neurons and glial cells. While lighting conditions did not induce differences in the SCN volume, the number of both neurons and glial cells did differ between groups. The DD rats showed the lowest number of neurons. Glial cells were also lower in this group than in the other two groups; however the number of glial cells in LL rats was lower than in LD rats. Moreover, females had more glial cells than males but males and females showed a similar number of neurons. These findings indicate the plasticity of the SCN in response to lighting conditions during the developmental stage. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is anatomically and functionally heterogeneous. A group of cells in the SCN shell, delineated by vasopressin-ergic neurons, are rhythmic with respect to Period gene expression and electrical activity but do not receive direct retinal input. In contrast, some cells in the SCN core, marked by neurons containing calbindin-D28k, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), substance P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), are not rhythmic with respect to Period gene expression and electrical activity but do receive direct retinal input. Examination of the timing of neurogenesis using bromodeoxyuridine indicates that SCN cells are born between embryonic day 9.5 and 12.5. Calbindin, GRP, substance P, and VIP cells are born only during early SCN neurogenesis, between embryonic days 9.5-11.0. Vasopressin cells are born over the whole period of SCN neurogenesis, appearing as late as embryonic day 12.5. Examination of the ontogeny of peptide expression in these cell types reveals transient expression of calbindin in a cluster of dorsolateral SCN cells on postnatal days 1-2. The adult pattern of calbindin expression is detected in a different ventrolateral cell cluster starting on postnatal day 2. GRP and SP expression appear on postnatal day 8 and 10, respectively, after the retinohypothalamic tract has innervated the SCN. In summary, the present study describes the ontogeny-specific peptidergic phenotypes in the SCN and compares these developmental patterns to previously identified patterns in the appearance of circadian functions. These comparisons suggest the possibility that these coincident appearances may be causally related, with the direction of causation to be determined. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating for significant structural and functional changes within the central nervous system (CNS) following prenatal protein malnutrition. Included among the structures that are likely to be affected are the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) involved in the regulation of locomotor activity, sleep-wake cycle, and drinking behavior. To determine the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on the spontaneous activity rhythm, 24 h radiotelemetric measurements were recorded over an 8-day period. Male offspring of rats provided with protein-deficient (6% casein) or adequate (25% casein) diets for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were studied. Well nourished rats displayed a rise in activity level during the first hour of the 12 h light phase, whereas prenatally malnourished rats displayed this increase during the 12 h dark phase, approximately 50 min before lights on, reflecting a significant phase advance in this group. In addition, cosinor analysis revealed that the alpha/rho relationship was affected in the previously malnourished group, the activity phase being shorter than in the well-nourished animals. These findings suggest changes in the regulatory systems controlling the locomotor activity rhythm as a consequence of prenatal protein malnutrition. Alterations in entrainment to the light-dark cycle, and/or in the coupling force of the circadian oscillators are all candidate mechanisms. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - Most studies on sleep and sleep disorders have been performed selectively in men or male animals. This is because females are more heavily influenced by cyclic sex hormones that may affect sleep- wake structures. Indeed, women often develop sleep disturbances in association with reproductive events. During the menstrual cycle, some women feel sleepier during the luteal phase than the follicular phase. Rodents are significantly most active during the night of ovulation but sleep the most after successful mating. Sleep dynamics change in human pregnancy as well; most women experience excessive sleepiness during the first trimester. Although the roles of female hormones in sleep regulation have not been fully understood, sex hormones provide a drive to sleep more so as to protect breeding. By contrast, when ovarian function declines, sleep problems significantly increase. In aged female rats, as similarly seen with ovariectomized young rats, circadian rhythms of sleep-wake distribution are disturbed. Such deteriorated sleep patterns are restored with continuous injection of estrogen. Hormonal replacement therapy for humans can be expected to exert a similar effect, but at this moment care needs to be given to the risks involved. Women are reported to suffer more than men from sleep disorders. A possible explanation may implicate the more active hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis in females. Growth-hormone releasing hormone (CHRH) usually promotes sleep in healthy males, but not in females. Gender differences in somnogenic effects of CHRH could be explained by gender-specificity of the HPA system. It is necessary to investigate the sexual dimorphisms of sleep-wake activities to generate strategies for gender-specific treatments. © 2005 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

AB  - Objective: It had been suggested that programming of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis may underlie the associations of reduced size at birth with raised blood pressure in later life. We investigated whether morning salivary cortisol mediates the inverse association of birthweight with systolic blood pressure in children. Design Subjects and measurements - A historical cohort study involving 1152 Swedish children aged 5-14 years, who took part in a family study comprised of mother, father, and two full-sibs delivered in 1987-1995 after 38-41 weeks gestation within 36 months of each other. Birthweight and gestational age were available from obstetric records. Blood pressure, weight, height and puberty stage were measured at a clinic. Cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay in morning salivary samples taken at home, within 30 min of waking. Results: Morning cortisol showed a weak negative association with length of gestation in siblings, was not related to birthweight or to systolic or diastolic blood pressure. There was no change in the strength of the negative association between birthweight and systolic blood pressure on adjustment for cortisol (-1.4 mmHg/kg, 95% CI -2.7, -0.2; adjusted for age, sex, puberty stage, weight and height, and cortisol). Conclusions: Morning cortisol was not associated with size at birth, and did not mediate the birthweight-blood pressure association in children born from full-term pregnancies. It is possible that basal cortisol levels are of more importance in explaining associations of size at birth with later blood pressure in older subjects, or in populations with more varied length of gestation. Alternatively, our results maybe caused by misclassification of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Study Objective: Changes in sleep-disordered breathing associated with late pregnancy have not previously been systematically investigated; however, a number of case reports indicate exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea in late pregnancy, often in association with maternal hypertension. We aimed to compare the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state. Design: Case-controlled, longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and postpartum. Study Patients: Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 ± 15 per hour antenatally to 18 ± 4 per hour postnatally (P = .03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 ± 11 per hour to 22 ± 4 per hour (P = .002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was increased from 86% ± 2% antenatally to 91% ± 1% postnatally (P = .01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally. Conclusion: This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.

AB  - Evaluation of risk factors and short-term outcomes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are essential to identify infants in need of developmental intervention after discharge. This study examined risk factors with the potential to affect short-term neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes in preterm infants born at <31 weeks gestation. Data were obtained in a larger longitudinal randomized study of the effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness on health. Severity of neurological insults and caffeine use predicted poorer neurobehavioral outcomes; and severity of neurological insults, caffeine use, length of hospitalization and ventilator days were associated with altered sleep-wake state organization. There were no significant effects of environmental lighting on the short-term developmental outcomes of preterm infants. Early knowledge of an infant's neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes can provide families and health care providers with important information to target the utilization of early intervention services. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Methods: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). Results: Overall, 9.2% of all women "usually" chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%). Compared to health department prenatal clinic patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep position, adjusted odds ratio = 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92). Conclusions: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs. Providers:Especially private providers"should continue to stress the importance of supine sleep position for infants. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.

AB  - Background: The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been falling in Germany over the last decade. However, little is known about the prevalence and the importance of well-known risk factors in Germany since a local prevention campaign in 1992. Design: A 3-y, population-based, case-control study was conducted in half of Germany, consisting of 333 cases. All sudden and unexpected deaths in infancy, if they fitted the inclusion criteria, were included in the study. Parental interview was carried out soon after the death, and three living control infants, matched for age, gender, region and sleep time, were recruited. Results: The prevalence of placing infants prone to sleep was only 4% in the control group, but this was associated with a markedly increased risk of SIDS (adjusted odds ration, aOR = 6.08). Other modifiable risk factors for SIDS were: maternal smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding for less than 2 wk (aOR = 1.71) and co-sleeping (aOR = 2.71), while using a pacifier during the last sleep reduced the risk (aOR = 0.39). Conclusions: Previously recognized risk factors for SIDS also occur in Germany. Despite knowledge about the major modifiable risk factors for SIDS, these factors are still present in Germany. To reduce the incidence of SIDS in Germany, a continued effort is needed to inform all parents about preventable risk factors for SIDS. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Mechanisms inducing continuous spike-wave during slow sleep (CSWS) in encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus during sleep are still unclear. Recently, some sporadic cases with early thalamic injury associated with CSWS have been reported. The aim of the study was to investigate in a population of patients with an early thalamic injury the presence of an activation of paroxysmal activities during sleep, their characteristics, and possible relations to neuroimaging and neuropsychological features. Methods: Thirty-two patients with prenatal or perinatal thalamic injuries, mostly due to a vascular mechanisms, were fully examined, including neuroimaging, EEG monitoring, and cognitive follow-up. Results and Conclusions: Twenty-nine of 32 patients showed major sleep EEG activation. Among these 29 patients, two different groups were distinguished: the first included the more or less typical CSWS (12 cases), generally with symmetry of spike and waves (SWs) and often with no spindle at all. The other cases had an usual asymmetry of SWs and presence or reduction of spindles, plus other atypical features concerning synchronism and morphology of SWs. Behavioral disorders were significantly more present in patients with a true CSWS; their improvement (and in one case of the three thoroughly followed the improvement of cognitive competence) paralleled the disappearance of CSWS. The generally predominant injury of the lateral aspect of the thalamus included reticular nucleus and ventral nuclei. An imbalance of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B- versus GABA A-mediated receptors may be evoked as a cofactor predisposing to CSWS. © 2005 International League Against Epilepsy.

AB  - The experience of pregnancy and motherhood is a complex event in which individual, social, and cultural factors interact to produce different levels of adaptation to the new role as a parent. In this study, we analyzed the narratives of 52 mothers with infants aged 2 months to identify the main sources of stress across the period of pregnancy, delivery, andpost-partum, and the emotional states remembered by the mothers in relation to these periods. A thematic analysis revealed that during pregnancy, mothers were especially concerned about prenatal screening, whereas delivery was considered as a relatively stressful, but natural event marked by mixed feelings, ranging from anxiety and fear to positive excitement and joy. For these mothers, the most critical phase was the post-partum period at home, during which they faced a number of adaptation tasks mainly related to the assumption of the parental role and the restructuring of daily routines. More specifically, reported problems included breast-feeding, painful aftereffects of delivery, lack of sleep, emotional instability, difficulties in managing the household and the family, and inexperience with babies, especially in primiparous mothers who could not rely on an effective social support. These results are discussed in terms of their clinical implications.

AB  - Introduction. Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare dermatitis that occurs during pregnancy and may be life threatening for both mother and child. In this case report, we present an Ondine curse involving the baby, and the good response to isotretinoine. Case report. A first pregnancy, 26 year-old woman developed at 8 months a widespread skin lesion involving the medial side of the thighs, abdomen and intertriginous areas, with a severe systemic toxic condition and fever. Diagnosis of impetigo herpetiformis was made and corticosteroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine were unsuccessful. Isotretinoine rapidly improved the patient with good control of the disease. The full term baby had an Ondine curse. Discussion. Our case is typical of impetigo herpetiformis. Maternal and infant complication may be life threatening and we report a real Ondine curse the etiology of which remains unknown. Moreover, this observation is unusual because the lesions did not clear despite delivery and good treatment. In our opinion, the great improvement with isotretinoine would suggest it could be used as first line treatment.

AB  - Eighty pregnant women were assessed for depression during mid-pregnancy (Mean gestational age = 25.9 weeks) and shortly after delivery in order to assess the effects of the onset and chronicity of maternal depression on neonatal behavior. The women were classified as reporting depressive symptoms: (1) only during the prepartum assessment; (2) only during the postpartum assessment; (3) during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments; or (4) reporting no depressive symptoms at either the prepartum or the postpartum assessment. Neonates born to mothers reporting symptoms of depression at any time point exhibited greater indeterminate sleep than neonates of non-depressed mothers. Neonates born to mothers reporting prenatal depression spent more time fussing and crying and exhibited more stress behaviors than neonates born to non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression only during the postpartum assessment. Finally, neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments exhibited less optimal Brazelton neurobehavioral assessment scores than neonates of non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers who exhibited symptoms of depression during only the prepartum or only during the postpartum assessments. Taken together these findings suggest that neonatal behavior is influenced not just by the presence but also by the timing and duration of maternal depression symptoms. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A proportion of headache patients should be evaluated by a neurologist. These guidelines are developed to help physicians in making appropriate choice in the work-up and treatment of headache patients. Most migraine sufferers have not been diagnosed by a physician and are not receiving medical guidance to effectively address their migraine attacks. In the past 15 years new therapies (acute and preventive) have been introduced. In migraine patients nonresponders to analgesics, especially in patients with moderate to severe migraine, triptans should be introduced. In migraine with frequent attacks or long lasting attacks, preventive treatment according to comorbid diseases should be recommended. In tension type headache, an underlying pathology should be excluded; management includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. Although rare, patients with cluster headache experience major pain and disability; in acute management oxygen inhalation or triptans are recommended, in certain cases prophylaxis is indicated. These guidelines contain classification, diagnostic criteria, and principles of management of all primary headaches. These recommendations for headache treatment are based on a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of scientific literature with regard to treatment possibilities in Croatia.

AB  - Ethanol inhibition of L1-mediated cell adhesion may contribute to the spectrum of neurological, behavioral and morphological abnormalities associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. We showed previously that the neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) antagonize ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion and prevent ethanol-induced growth retardation in mouse whole embryo culture. Here we ask whether NAP and SAL also prevent ethanol-induced major malformations of the nervous system. Gestational day 8.0 (3-5 somites) C57BL/6J mouse embryos were grown for 6 h in control medium, 100 mM ethanol and 10 -10 M peptides and then maintained for an additional 20 h in control medium. At the end of the culture period, only embryos having 18-19 somite pairs were examined and compared for the degree of neural tube closure. Ethanol exposure resulted in neural tube defects (NTDs) consistent with total dysraphia and anencephaly. Co-incubation with ethanol and L-NAP (all L-amino acids), D-NAP (all D-amino acids) or SAL significantly increased the percentage of embryos that had begun to close their neural folds at the level of the forebrain/midbrain junction or that had progressed beyond this stage of closure. P7A-NAP (NAPVSIAQ), which lacks neuroprotective activity, but retains activity as an antagonist of ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, was effective in preventing ethanol-induced NTDs. In contrast, I6A-NAP (NAPVSAPQ), which shows reduced efficacy as an ethanol antagonist but retains its neuroprotective efficacy, did not significantly diminish the induction of NTDs by ethanol. These findings demonstrate the ability of NAP and SAL to prevent ethanol-induced NTDs and support the hypothesis that ethanol teratogenesis is caused in part by ethanol inhibition of Li-mediated cell adhesion.

AB  - Vitex agnus castus L. (VAC) [Verbenaceae] is a deciduous shrub that is native to Mediterranean Europe and Central Asia. Traditionally, VAC fruit extract has been used in the treatment of many female conditions, including menstrual disorders (amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea), premenstrual syndrome (PMS), corpus luteum insufficiency, hyperprolactinaemia, infertility, acne, menopause and disrupted lactation. The German Commission E has approved the use of VAC for irregularities of the menstrual cycle, premenstrual disturbances and mastodynia. Clinical reviews are available for the efficacy of VAC in PMS, cycle disorders, hyperprolactinaemia and mastalgia, but so far no systematic review has been published on adverse events or drug interactions associated with VAC. Therefore, this review was conducted to evaluate all the available human safety data of VAC monopreparations. Literature searches were conducted in six electronic databases, in references lists of all identified papers and in departmental files. Data from spontaneous reporting schemes of the WHO and national drug safety bodies were also included. Twelve manufacturers of VAC-containing preparations and five herbalist organisations were contacted for additional information. No language restrictions were imposed. Combination preparations including VAC or homeopathic preparations of VAC were excluded. Data extraction of key data from all articles reporting adverse events or interactions was performed independently by at least two reviewers, regardless of study design. Data from clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance studies, surveys, spontaneous reporting schemes, manufacturers and herbalist organisations indicate that the adverse events following VAC treatment are mild and reversible. The most frequent adverse events are nausea, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, menstrual disorders, acne, pruritus and erythematous rash. No drug interactions were reported. Use of VAC should be avoided during pregnancy or lactation. Theoretically, VAC might also interfere with dopaminergic antagonists. Although further rigorous studies are needed to assess the safety of VAC, the data available seem to indicate that VAC is a safe herbal medicine. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective - To design a treatment that increases plasma corticosteroid concentrations to mimic prenatal stress in pregnant sows. Animals - 24 pregnant sows. Procedure - Sows were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups; treatment consisted of twice-daily oral administration of a placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg of hydrocortisone acetate (HCA)/sow from 7 to 11 weeks of gestation. Blood and saliva samples for determination of cortisol concentrations were obtained hourly on treatment days 3 and 25 and twice weekly for the remainder of the treatment period. The WBC, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 were determined on 4 days during treatment. Litter characteristics were recorded. Results - Plasma and salivary cortisol concentrations were significantly increased in sows that received 60 or 180 mg of HCA (0.30 to 0.37 mg/kg and 0.95 to 1.15 mg/kg, respectively), compared with control sows. Except for the second day of treatment, the number of WBCs and the IL-2:IL-4 ratio did not differ among treatment groups. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher in sows that received 180 mg of HCA. Gestation duration was significantly shorter in sows that received 180 mg of HCA. Conclusions and clinical relevance - Oral administration of 60 mg of HCA is suitable to increase plasma and salivary cortisol concentrations in pregnant sows in a controlled manner to concentrations comparable to concentrations detected after psychologic stressors. This model seems to be suitable to study the effects of increased maternal corticosteroid concentrations on young pig behavior, physiologic variables, and development.

AB  - Cushing's syndrome (CS) occurs rarely during pregnancy. We investigated and treated four patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy over a 15-yr period at the National Institutes of Health. Except for preservation of menses before conception, our patients presented with typical clinical features, increased urinary free cortisol, and loss of diurnal variation of cortisol. The diagnosis was facilitated, without complications, by the use of CRH testing and inferior petrosal sinus sampling in three women. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery achieved remission in three women, but there were two fetal/neonatal deaths. This experience and review of 136 previous reports suggest that: 1) urinary free cortisol in CS patients overlaps the normal pregnant range; 2) ACTH levels are not suppressed in adrenal causes of CS, which may be identified by the 8-mg dexamethasone test; 3) inferior petrosal sinus sampling and transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, the optimal diagnostic test and treatment for nonpregnant patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, can safely facilitate the management of pregnant patients; and 4) surgery may achieve remission during pregnancy, but the prognosis for the fetus remains guarded. It is likely that earlier recognition and treatment would improve outcome. There is a need for development of criteria for interpretation of diagnostic tests and increased consideration of CS in pregnancy. Copyright © 2005 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Antenatal betamethasone administration to enhance fetal lung maturation is associated with transient reductions in fetal heart rate (FHR) variation, breathing, and body movements 2 d after the first dose (d 2). This study examines whether steroid administration affects the natural diurnal rhythms of fetal variables. Sixteen women at 27-32 wk of gestation received two doses of betamethasone 24 h apart. One-hour recordings of FHR, breathing, and body movements were made in the morning, afternoon, and evening of d 2, and again in the morning of d 3. Repeat recordings were obtained at 4-6 d later from 9/16 women. Maternal blood samples were obtained with each recording to determine ACTH and cortisol. No diurnal rhythm was present for FHR, FHR variation, breathing, and body movements on d 2. This resulted from suppression of the expected natural rise in body and breathing movements, and heart rate variation in the course of the day. Suppression of the diurnal rhythm of body movements depended on gestation (R = -0.89; p < 0.01). All variables showed diurnal rhythms 4-6 d later. Maternal ACTH and cortisol diurnal rhythms were completely suppressed on d 2. Four to six days later, the normal diurnal pattern was resumed, although absolute levels of ACTH and cortisol were still suppressed. We conclude that maternal betamethasone administration transiently abolishes the fetal diurnal rhythms of heart rate and its variation, breathing, and body movements.

AB  - The activity budgets and daily activity rhythms of Varecia rubra were examined over an annual cycle according to season and reproductive stage. Given the relatively high reproductive costs and patchy food resources of this species, I predicted that V. rubra would 1) travel less and feed more during seasonal resource scarcity in an attempt to maintain energy balance, and 2) show sex differences in activity budgets due to differing reproductive investment. Contrary to the first prediction, V. rubra does not increase feeding time during seasonal food scarcity; rather, females feed for a consistent amount of time in every season, whereas males feed most during the resource-rich, hot dry season. The results are consistent with other predictions: V. rubra travels less in the resource-scarce cold rainy season, and there are some pronounced sex differences, with females feeding more and resting less than males in every season and in every reproductive stage except gestation. However, there are also some provocative similarities between the sexes when activity budgets are examined by reproductive stage. During gestation, female and male activity budgets do not differ and appear geared toward energy accumulation: both sexes feed and rest extensively and travel least during this stage. During lactation, activity budgets are geared toward high energy expenditure: both sexes travel most and in equal measure, and rest least, although it remains the case that females feed more and rest less than males. These similarities between female and male activity budgets appear related to cooperative infant care. The high energetic costs of reproduction in V. rubra females may require that they allot more time to feeding year round, and that their overall activity budget be more directly responsive to seasonal climate change, seasonal food distribution, and reproductive schedules. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: High intakes of vitamin A cause congenital malformations in experimental animals with elevated generation of retinoic acids (RA). Results in humans are conflicting. Objective: To evaluate plasma concentration-time curves of retinyl esters, retinol and their metabolites at increasing doses of vitamin A. Methods: An open-label dose-response study. Non-pregnant females (3 groups with n = 12; 18-40 years) received once daily oral doses of vitamin A palmitate up to 30,000 IU/day over 21 days. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC24h) served as indicator for exposure. Results: AUC 24h of retinyl esters increased linearly with dose. Retinol concentrations were unaffected. All-trans RA exhibited a diurnal-like concentration-time profile (Cmax at 3 h; Cmin at 8 h), concentrations decreasing below pre-dose levels at 5 h and regaining pre-dose levels at 16h. The maximum temporary increase in exposure was 33% (single dose) and 19% (repeated doses) above baseline, but AUC24h remained unaltered. AUC24h increased linearly with dose for 13-cis RA and 13-cis-4-oxo RA. Repeated doses caused a 25% increase in exposure with the highest vitamin A intake. Accumulation of 13-cis-4-oxo RA at 30,000 IU/day doubled compared to the 4,000 IU/day intake. Conclusion: Repeated oral doses of up to 30,000 IU of vitamin A in addition to dietary vitamin A were without safety concern. Safe doses are probably higher, since plasma concentrations and exposure to RA remained at levels earlier shown to be without increased risk of teratogenicity in pregnant women. Copyright © 2005 S.

AB  - Nausea and vomiting in late pregnancy is a little-studied phenomenon. In this study of 116 midwestern women, 32% of the women had nausea and vomiting after 20 weeks gestation. The purpose of this study was to examine demographic, anthropometric, maternal health factors, and pregnancy outcomes in women who had late nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and those that did not. Women who experienced late NVP had significantly higher parity, were older, gained less weight in pregnancy, and slept fewer hours per night than women who did not experience late NVP. By being aware of prenatal factors that may affect nausea and vomiting in late pregnancy, health care providers will be better able to maximize the quality of life for these women.

AB  - A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine the associations of sleep quality and stage of illness with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected African-American women. Participants were recruited from 12 health clinics and AIDS service organizations (ASO) in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The sample consisted of 144 African-American women who ranged in age from 20 to 48 years (m=34.8, SD=6.8). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. Participants were categorized as good sleepers (PSQI global score <7) or poor sleepers (PSQI global score ≥ 7) using the median global sleep quality score. Differences in HRQOL between good and poor sleepers, as measured by the SF-36, were tested using MANOVA. Good sleepers scored significantly higher (p < 0.0001) for each SF-36 quality of life dimension and the mental and physical health summary scores. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep quality is associated with HRQOL, independent of the individual's stage of illness, more so with mental HRQOL than with physical HRQOL. The results suggest that treatment for poor sleep quality should be a primary concern for the treatment of HIV infection and a means for improving HRQOL. © Springer 2005.

AB  - The management of psychotropic medications during pregnancy and lactation involves a difficult and complex decision for both patient and provider, particularly due to the many unknown effects medication may have on the infant. Available studies concerning use of psychotropic medications in pregnant and lactating women are limited and there are no universal guidelines. This article reviews the literature on the use of psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines, in pregnant and breast-feeding women and presents relevant data on teratogenic effects, neonatal toxicity, perinatal syndromes, and neurobehavioral sequelae.

AB  - Objective: Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is known to be elevated in serum of patients with preeclampsia, but there are no data available on the significance of urinary VCAM-1 excretion in preeclampsia. The aim of our study was to uncover possible circadian rhythms of VCAM-1 plasma levels and urinary VCAM-1 excretion in uncomplicated and hypertensive pregnancies and to ascertain their relation to blood pressure. Study design: A total of 10 normotensive and 10 preeclamptic pregnant women were included in this study. Venous blood was collected hourly, and urine samples were taken every 2 h over a period of 24 h. VCAM-1 levels were determined by ELISA. We compared these results with the circadian blood pressure rhythm. Results: The median VCAM-1 plasma levels were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in preeclamptic patients (851.5 ng/mL) in comparison to normotensive pregnant women (659.3 ng/mL) without any circadian rhythm being apparent; however, the urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed a typical circadian rhythm, with a higher excretion rate during daytime. Conclusion: For the first time we have demonstrated that urinary VCAM-1 excretion in pregnancy shows a circadian rhythm without correlation to plasma levels or the circadian blood pressure rhythm. In contrast, VCAM-1 serum levels did not show a diurnal rhythm. We assume that VCAM-1 serum levels do not correlate with systemic blood pressure or urinary excretion.

AB  - The perinatal period presents a special problem to health care providers treating psychiatric disorders in women. Many pregnant women and new mothers who need antidepressant medications are hesitant to take such drugs for fear of possible harmful effects on their fetuses and nursing infants. Research on the short-term effects of antidepressant medications, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, suggests they can be used by pregnant and breastfeeding women for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Research also suggests that not treating these disorders can have a negative impact on motherinfant bonding.

AB  - A review of the literature shows that maternal or paternal smoking during pregnancy has many effects on the newborn, the infant, and even the adult exposed during intrauterine life. In the newborn, measurements at birth are lower than those observed in non-exposed newborns and the risk of preterm birth is increased. There is also a slightly increased risk of cleft lip or palate. Newborns exposed to smoking also suffer from altered vascular and pulmonary function and have a different neurological behavior. They react less well to stress. The risk of sudden infant death is significantly increased among exposed infants, especially if they sleep with their parents. The overall mortality of exposed infants is higher. Mid- and long-term consequences are more difficult to evaluate due to the very large number of confounding factors. There is however an association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and a slightly decreased cognitive level in childhood and adulthood. The risks of hyperactivity disorder with attentional deficit, behavioral disorders, delinquency, and childhood and adolescence smoking are increased as are the risks of obesity, respiratory disorders and infection. Conversely, there is no demonstrated link with childhood cancer. © MASSON, 2005.

AB  - Research into postnatal mood disorders to date has concentrated on depressive syndromes of varying severity and full-blown acute puerperal mania. However, clinical experience, backed up by a review of the literature, indicates that milder hypomanic symptoms also occur in the early puerperium. Although these symptoms may often be regarded as clinically insignificant, there is evidence that the experience of minor puerperal elation may be a predictor of later postpartum depression. In addition, studying mild puerperal high mood may provide insights into the pathophysiology of more severe puerperal mania and psychosis. This paper critically reviews the literature on milder forms of high mood occurring in the puerperium and discusses the potential clinical and research significance of 'the highs'. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005.

AB  - Background: Very little is known about the perinatal genesis of circadian rhythmicity in the human fetus. Some researchers have found evidence of rhythmicity early on in fetal development, whereas others have observed a slow development of rhythmicity during several years after birth. Method: Rhythms of fetal heartbeat and locomotor activity were studied in women with physiological course of pregnancy at 16 to 40 gestational weeks. Observations were conducted continuously for 24 h using the method of external electrocardiography, which provided simultaneous detection of the changes in maternal and fetal heartbeat as well as assessment of daily locomotor activity of the fetus. During the night-time, electroencephalogram, myogram, oculogram and respiration of the mother were registered in parallel with fetal external electrocardiography. Results: Although we found no significant daily rhythmicity in heart rate per se in the human fetus, we developed a new method for the assessment of 24-h fetal cardiotachogram that allowed us to identify daily rhythmicity in the short-term pattern of heart beating. We found that daily rhythmicity of fetal electrocardiogram resembles that of the mother; however, the phase of the rhythm is opposite to that of the mother. "Active" (from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m.) and "quiet" (from 4 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m.) periods of activity were identified. Conclusion: A healthy fetus at gestational age of 16 to 20 weeks reveals pronounced rhythms of activity and locomotion. Absence of distinct rhythmicity within the term of 20 to 24 weeks points to developmental retardation. The "Z"-type fetal reaction, recorded during the "quiet" hours, does not indicate unsatisfactory state, but rather is suggestive of definite reduction of functional levels of the fetal physiological systems necessary for vital activity. © 2005 Kintraia et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: The aim of the current study was to identify a possible locus of dysfunction in the visual system of depressed patients. Materials and Methods: Fifty Major Depressive patients aged 21-60 years and 15 age-matched controls took part in the study The diagnosis was obtained with the SCAN v 2.0. The psychometric assessment included the HDRS, the HAS, the Newcastle Scales, the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale and the GAF scale. Flash Electroretinogram and Electrooculogram were performed in all subjects. The statistical analysis included ANCOVA, Student's t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient were used. Results: The Electro-oculographic findings suggested that all subtypes of depressed patients had lower dark trough and light peak values in comparison to controls (p < 0.001), while Arden ratios were within normal range. Electroretinographic recordings did not reveal any differences between patients and controls or between subtypes of depression. Discussion: The findings of the current study provide empirical data in order to assist in the understanding of the international literature and to explain the mechanism of action of therapies like sleep deprivation and light therapy. © 2005 Fountoulakis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Withdrawal symptoms are encountered with both the classical antidepressants, i.e. the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamineoxidase inhibitors, the modern antidepressants, i.e. the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and the new antidepressants such as venlafaxine and mirtazapine. The symptoms that are reported following the withdrawal of these drugs can be classified into 8 groups: influenza-like symptoms, psychic symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disorders, equilibrium disorders, sensory disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms and other symptoms. It is characteristic of these symptoms that they appear 1-4 days after reduction of the dose or the last administration of the drug. They may also appear in the infants of mothers who used an antidepressant during the last phase of the pregnancy. It is important that the patient be informed accurately and carefully at the start and termination of any treatment with an antidepressant. In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, it is advisable to reduce the dosage slowly if possible when the treatment is to be terminated.

AB  - The pregnancy and postpartum periods are considered to be relatively high risk times for depressive episodes in women, particularly for those with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses. Therefore, it may be necessary to start or continue the pharmacological treatment of depression during these two timeframes. Hence, the aim of this review is to examine the effects on the fetus and infant of exposure, through the placenta and maternal milk, to the following drugs: fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, reboxetine and bupropion. The teratogenic risks, perinatal toxicity and effects on the neurobehavioural development of newborns associated with exposure through the placenta or maternal milk to these medications need to be carefully assessed before starting psychopharmacological treatment in pregnant or lactating women. In spite of the limitations of some of the studies reviewed, the older selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [as we await further data regarding escitalopram] and venlafaxine seem to be devoid of teratogenic risks. By contrast, the data concerning possible consequences related to exposure to SSRIs via the placenta and breastmilk on neonatal adaptation and long-term neurocognitive infant's development are still controversial. Nevertheless, a number of reports have shown that an association between placental exposure to SSRIs and adverse but self-limiting effects on neonatal adaptation may exist. In addition, the information on both teratogenic and functional teratogenic risks associated with exposure to bupropion, mirtazapine and reboxetine is incomplete or absent; at present, these compounds should not be used as first-line agents in the pharmacological treatment of depression in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Untreated depression is not without its own risks since mothers affected by depression have a negative impact on the emotional development of their children and major depression, especially when complicated by a delusional component, may lead to the mother attempting suicide and infanticide. Consequently, clini-cians need to help mothers weigh the risks of prenatal exposure to drugs for their babies against the potential risks of untreated depression and abrupt discontinuation of pharmacological treatment. Given these situations, we suggest that choosing to administer psychopharmacological treatment in pregnant or breastfeeding women with depression will result primarily from a careful evaluation of their psychopathological condition; currently, the degree of severity of maternal disease appears to represent the most relevant parameter to take this clinical decision. © 2005 Adls Data Information BV.

AB  - Background and purpose: To examine whether snoring and sleepiness are linked in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Patients and methods: We recruit ed 167 healthy and 82 pre-eclamptic women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 160 non-pregnant women. Subjects and their partners completed a sleep questionnaire. Height, weight, neck circumferences and blood pressure were recorded for all. Results: Pregnant and pre-eclamptic women were (mean ±SD) 36±3.6 and 36±3 weeks pregnant, respectively. Age and height did not differ significantly between groups (P>0.2), but pre-eclamptic women were heavier than pregnant and non-pregnant women and had higher BMI than pregnant women before pregnancy (all P<0.05). Thirty-two percent of control, 55% of pregnant and 85% of pre-eclamptic women snored (P<0.001), but pre-pregnancy snoring rates (pre-eclamptic=36%, healthy pregnant women=27%) were similar to those in non-pregnant women (32%) (P>0.7). Sleepiness was reported by 12% of non-pregnant, 23% of pregnant and 15% of pre-eclamptic women (P<0.04), but non-pregnant women had lower mean Epworth Sleepiness scores than both pregnant and pre-eclamptic groups (P<0.001). Snoring was correlated with (P=0.002), but explained only <2%, of the variance in sleepiness. Conclusion: Snoring and sleepiness increased in the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly in patients with pre-eclampsia. However, the study suggests that sleepiness in pregnancy is largely due to factors other than snoring or breathing pauses. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) is a novel, femtomolar-acting, glial-derived polypeptide (14 kDa) known to protect neurons from a variety of toxic insults. The active site for ADNF function is localized to a 9-amino-acid stretch (SALLRSIPA; ADNF-9). A few years later, a novel ADNF-9-like active peptide (NAPVSIPQ or NAP) was identified and shown to be expressed in the CNS and exhibit an activity profile similar to ADNF-9. Such studies suggest that ADNF-9 and NAP might function like other known neurotrophins and play a role in neural development and maintenance. The purpose of the present studies was to determine if ADNF-9 or NAP affects neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal and cortical cultures. Using MAP2-FITC immunofluorescent labeling, we found that ADNF-9 and NAP promoted neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximal activity observed at femtomolar concentrations. Both peptides stimulated robust outgrowth in hippocampal cells (∼150% of control; p < 0.01) with a modest effect on cortical cells (∼20% of control; p < 0.05) - similar to other known growth factors. However, the outgrowth-promoting effect was abolished in the absence of serum, suggesting that soluble factors might be necessary for the neurotrophic activity. Finally, we found that ADNF-9 and NAP increased synaptophysin expression in both rat hippocampal and cortical cultures. These results suggest that ADNF-9 and NAP might contribute to neuronal plasticity associated with development and repair after injury. Copyright © 2005 Humana Press Inc.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the epidemiology and risk factors of apparent life threatening events (ALTE). Methods: A prospective study enrolled all live-born infants in the Tyrol (1993-2001). Information on pregnancy, sociodemographic characteristics, child care practices, and infant's behaviour in the first four to six weeks of life was collected with a standardised questionnaire, and was available for 44 184 infants. ALTE was identified from hospital admission records. Results: During the study period 164 ALTE cases were identified, corresponding to an incidence of 2.46/ 1000 live births. In 73 of these infants no cause for the event and no comorbidity could be found (idiopathic ALTE). On average ALTE manifested ten weeks earlier than SIDS. Of various SIDS risk factors in the survey area, the prone sleeping position, smoking during pregnancy, low gestational age, profuse night sweating, and family history of infant death showed a moderate relation to the risk of overall ALTE, but only smoking maintained significance in the multivariate risk model. None of these variables was associated with idiopathic ALTE. In contrast to SIDS the frequency of ALTE did not change during the study period. None of the ALTE infants experienced SIDS later in life. Behavioural abnormalities such as feeding difficulties, episodes of pallor, cyanotic episodes, and repeated apnoea episodes were strongly associated with an increased risk of overall and idiopathic ALTE. Conclusions: Although there are some similarities in the clinical presentation and epidemiology of SIDS and ALTE, differences clearly predominate. Accordingly, ALTE and SIDS should not be considered different manifestations of the same disease process.

AB  - In March 2004 a group of 65 physicians and other health professionals representing nine countries on four continents convened in Israel to discuss the widespread public health crisis in childhood obesity. Their aim was to explore the available evidence and develop a consensus on the way forward. The process was rigorous, although time and resources did not permit the development of formal evidence-based guidelines. In the months before meeting, participants were allocated to seven groups covering prevalence, causes, risks, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and psychology. Through electronic communication each group selected the key issues for their area, searched the literature, and developed a draft document. Over the 3-d meeting, these papers were debated and finalized by each group before presenting to the full group for further discussion and agreement. In developing a consensus statement, this international group has presented the evidence, developed recommendations, and provided a platform aimed toward future corrective action and ongoing debate in the international community.

AB  - Background: It is always the key issue of rheumatoid arthritis(RA) to treat articular gall. A kind of medicine with favorable therapeutic effects and safety is urgently needed in the clinics. 99Tc-methylene diphosphonate (99Tc-MDP) receives generalized attentions on its therapeutic effects and safety since its application into RA therapy. Objective: To explore the characters of 99Tc-MDP in the amelioration of articular dysfunction in RA patients. Design: A before-and-after controlled study by employing patients as subjects. Setting: Department of rheumatism and immunology of an affiliated hospital of a university. Participants: Totally 67 patients with RA at active phase including 11 males and 56 females aged between 29 and 71 years old with the course of disease between 9 and 78 months and admitted by the Department of Rheumatism of Huaxi Hospital Affiliated to Sichuan University were in accordance with the RA diagnostic criteria established by American Rheumatism Association(ARA) in 1987. Serious heart, liver or kidney dysfunction, active gastrointestinal pathological changes, hematology and endocrinology diseases, allergic complexion, and women during pregnancy or breast-feeding period were eliminated. Methods: Clinical indicators including articular edema index, articular pain, grip, morning stiffness duration, rest pain, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein(CRP) were compared before and after therapy in 67 cases received 99Tc-MDP treatment. Integrated evaluation was performed after the completion of therapy. Effective meant 30% of improvement in symptoms and physical signs, and reduction in ESR and CRP. Side effects were observed and recorded simultaneously. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: After 99Tc-MDP treatment, RA condition significantly improved, as well as each clinical indicator including articular edema index, articular pain index, morning stiffness duration, rest pain, ESR and CRP(P &lt; 0.05). The total clinical effective rate of this medicine was 81% and the incidence of side effects was small and mild. Conclusion: 99Tc-MDP can ameliorate the articular dysfunction of RA patients, which is a safe medicine with strong effect.

AB  - Glycoproteins display carbohydrate facets that serve as adhesion receptors for cells including leukocytes and bacterial cells. Our aim was to understand the role of the specialized carbohydrate motifs carried by highly glycosylated human salivary proteins in regulating the oral ecology. To date, our structural studies suggest that these molecules display a wide array of oligosaccharide structures, including many species with highly charged and/or fucosylated termini. Here, we used an immunoblot approach to gain additional information about the nature of these oligosaccharides. The results showed that MG1 and the salivary agglutinin express the MECA-79 epitope, an unusual sulfated carbohydrate structure that belongs to an important class of high-affinity (endothelial) L-selectin ligands. Unexpectedly, we discovered that in many women the expression of this epitope is hormonally regulated. Additional experiments revealed that MG1, MG2, and the salivary agglutinin also present Lewis blood group antigens, the exact repertoire varying on an individual basis. In parallel, we explored the functions of these carbohydrate motifs. Using an assay that detects L-selectin ligands, we found that the subset of MECA-79-reactive oligosaccharides displayed on salivary molecules specifically bind an L-selectin/Fc chimera. In contrast, the Lewis blood group structures are receptors for many strains of Helicobacter pylori, an organism that is implicated in the development of gastric ulcers and cancer. Together, these results suggest that MG1, MG2, and the salivary agglutinin play important roles in governing leukocyte and bacterial adhesion. Our findings suggest novel strategies, based on the relevant carbohydrate structures, for promoting or inhibiting these processes.

AB  - Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to classify individuals, to ascertain blood pressure-related risk, and to guide management. The auscultatory technique with a trained observer and mercury sphygmomanometer continues to be the method of choice for measurement in the office, using the first and fifth phases of the Korotkoff sounds, including in pregnant women. The use of mercury is declining, and alternatives are needed. Aneroid devices are suitable, but they require frequent calibration. Hybrid devices that use electronic transducers instead of mercury have promise. The oscillometric method can be used for office measurement, but only devices independently validated according to standard protocols should be used, and individual calibration is recommended. They have the advantage of being able to take multiple measurements. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are all essential. It is increasingly recognized that office measurements correlate poorly with blood pressure measured in other settings, and that they can be supplemented by self-measured readings taken with validated devices at home. There is increasing evidence that home readings predict cardiovascular events and are particularly useful for monitoring the effects of treatment. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring gives a better prediction of risk than office measurements and is useful for diagnosing white-coat hypertension. There is increasing evidence that a failure of blood pressure to fall during the night may be associated with increased risk. In obese patients and children, the use of an appropriate cuff size is of paramount importance.

AB  - Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated with withdrawal symptoms. We investigated whether use of these drugs in pregnant women might cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Methods: An association between paroxetine and neonatal convulsions was identified in December, 2001, by the data mining method routinely used to screen the WHO database of adverse drug reactions. An information component (IC) measure was used to screen for unexpected adverse reactions relative to the information in the database. We then assessed cases of neonatal convulsions and neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with drugs included in the anatomical therapeutic chemical groups N06AB and N06AX. Findings: By November, 2003, a total of 93 suspected cases of SSRI-induced neonatal withdrawal syndrome had been reported, and were regarded as enough information to confirm a possible causal relation. 64 of the cases were associated with paroxetine, 14 with fluoxetine, nine with sertraline, and seven with citalopram. The IC-2 SD for the group became greater than 0 in the first quarter of 1991, and the IC increased to 2.68 (IC-2 SD 0.32) by the second quarter of 2003. For each individual compound, the IC-2 SD was greater than 0. Interpretation: SSRIs, especially paroxetine, should be cautiously managed in the treatment of pregnant women with a psychiatric disorder.

AB  - Men and women differ in temperament and personality traits, such as aggression and sensation seeking. The sex hormone testosterone could play a role in the origin of these differences, but it remains unclear how and when testosterone could have these effects. One way to investigate the prenatal exposure effect of testosterone is to compare opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) female twins. It has been suggested that OS twin girls are exposed prenatally to elevated testosterone levels and that this may result in some masculinization of their personality and behavior. We measured sexually dimorphic traits and circulating testosterone levels in 13-year-old OS (n = 74) and SS (n = 55) twins. Testosterone levels showed a clear circadian rhythm, with higher levels in the morning than in the afternoon. Testosterone was higher in boys than girls, but similar in OS and SS twin girls. Testosterone was not in any way systematically related to the different personality traits. However, a sex difference in aggression proneness was observed, and OS girls showed a more masculine pattern of aggression proneness than the SS girls. It is argued that it is unlikely that this difference is due to social factors, such as a gender-specific upbringing. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Several studies have indicated that the use of the 24-h mean of blood pressure, mainly using reference thresholds derived from the general non-pregnancy practice, does not provide a proper test for diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy. This prospective study examines previously derived reference thresholds for the 24-h, diurnal, and nocturnal mean of blood pressure as potential screening tests for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy. Methods: We studied 235 normotensive and 168 hypertensive pregnant women, who provided 2430 blood pressure series sampled every 20 min during the day and every 30 min at night for 48 consecutive hours once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit until delivery. Sensitivity and specificity for each parameter are based on the comparison of the distributions of mean blood pressure values with reference thresholds previously established from an independent population of 113 pregnant women also evaluated monthly by 48-h ambulatory monitoring throughout gestation. Results: Sensitivity of mean blood pressure values, above 70% at all stages of pregnancy, was higher than that obtained from clinic blood pressure measurements, which were always below 14%. The poorest results were consistently obtained for the nocturnal mean. Sensitivity was similar for the 24-h and the diurnal mean, with values ranging from 71% for diastolic blood pressure in the first trimester of pregnancy to 93% for systolic blood pressure in the third trimester. Systolic blood pressure consistently provided better sensitivity than diastolic blood pressure at all gestational ages. Conclusions: This prospective study on women systematically studied by 48-h ambulatory monitoring throughout gestation indicates that mean ambulatory blood pressure values provide higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional measurements. Moreover, results indicate that diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy based on ambulatory blood pressure should be established from thresholds much lower than those currently used in clinical practice. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effects of a single course of maternally administered dexamethasone on preterm fetal sheep in utero. Design: Prospective randomised controlled trial. Setting: University laboratory. Sample: Pregnant sheep at 0.7 of gestation. Methods: Pregnant ewes at 103 days of pregnancy (term =147 days) were given two intramuscular injections of vehicle (n = 7) or 12 mg of dexamethasone (DEX; n = 8) 24 hours apart. Fetuses were continuously monitored for five days. Main outcome measures: Fetal mean arterial blood pressure, carotid and femoral arterial blood flow and vascular resistance, heart rate, heart rate variability, fetal plasma cortisol and ACTH and fetal body movements. Results: DEX injections led to an acute increase in mean arterial blood pressure with a rise in carotid and femoral vascular resistance, a fall in femoral arterial blood flow, and a brief fall in fetal heart rate followed by significant tachycardia. From 24 hours after the injections, mean arterial blood pressure and vascular resistance returned to control values, however, a mild tachycardia [200 (3) vs 184 (4) bpm, P < 0.05] and loss of the circadian pattern of fetal heart rate variability persisted until the end of recording. Plasma ACTH and cortisol were markedly suppressed by DEX (P < 0.05), with values returning to control levels 32 and 72 hours after the first injection, respectively. There was no effect on basal fetal heart rate variability, body movements, carotid arterial blood flow, or the circadian pattern of fetal heart rate. Conclusion: In contrast to previous experiments utilising direct fetal infusion of steroids, maternal administration of DEX was associated with only transient hypertension.

AB  - The mechanism underlying spontaneous pacemaker potential in the uterus is not clearly understood. Several spontaneously active smooth muscles have interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or ICC-like cells. We therefore examined cells from freshly dispersed uterine muscle strips (from pregnant human and rat myometrium) and in situ uterine preparations to determine the cell types present. Both preparations revealed numerous ICC-like cells; they were multipolar, with spider-like projections and enlarged central regions. These cells were readily distinguished from uterine myocytes by their morphology and ultrastructure, i.e., no myofilaments, numerous mitochondria, caveolae, and filaments. In addition, the ICC-like cells were noncontractile. These cells were negative to c-kit, a classic marker for ICCs. They stained positive for the intermediate filament, vimentin, a marker for cells of mesenchymal origin but not differentiated myocytes. The ICC-like cells had a more or less stable resting membrane potential of -58 ± 7 mV compared with smooth-muscle cells, -65 ± 13 mV, and produced outward current in response to voltage clamp pulses. However, in contrast with uterine myocytes, inward currents were not observed. This is the first description of ICC-like cells in myometrium and their role in the uterus is discussed, as possible inhibitors of intrinsic smooth-muscle activity.

AB  - Mood and anxiety disorders are common in women during their childbearing years. The prevalence of depression has been reported to be between 10% and 16% during pregnancy. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy or lactation is, to date, not promoted because of lack of safety documentation. However, the off-label use of these drugs has been common for several years. In the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often preferred over tricyclic antidepressants because of their relatively few adverse effects and safety in overdose. This has created concern among women planning pregnancies and pregnant women, as well as among their families and physicians. Several studies and reports of the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors during both pregnancy and lactation have been published and advanced our knowledge. We here review and discuss those studies which have been published so far on this subject.

AB  - Pregnant women may sleep in the streets or find refuge in places not suited to their condition. These women often attend prenatal visits late, and rarely voluntarily. Appropriate maternity beds are not always available. After giving birth, these women must bring up their children in difficult conditions. There is a shortage of shelter structures. Clandestines are in an inextricable situation.

AB  - The aim of this article is to study the psychological effects of antenatal diagnosis on increased nuchal translucency on a woman's pregnancy experience and early mother-child relationship. The study group was composed of pregnant women whose fetus presented increased nuchal translucency at first trimester ultrasound examinations. These women consulted a pedopsychiatrist during their pregnancy and, for some, during the first years of the life of the child. One of the main risks was disinterest in the fetus, with the possible corollary of therapeutic abortion or a difficult mother-child relationship. We observed cases of attachment disorders, significant separation distress, excessive fear about dealing with the baby's health, sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Postnatal depression was more frequent in these situations. Multidisciplinary work associating psychiatric, obstetric and pediatric units can help in dealing with such uncertainty.

AB  - In mammals, the vast majority of dietary tryptophan is metabolized via the kynurenine pathway (KP), which is initiated by the oxidative opening of the indole ring and eventually produces the ubiquitous enzyme cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Several neuroactive intermediates are yielded with the degradation of triptophan by this pathway, including the free radical generator 3-hydroxykynurenine, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid, and the NMDA and α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. The kynurenine pathway may play a role in certain physiological functions such as behaviour, sleep, thermoregulation and pregnancy. Furthermore, the kynurenine pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of cerebral diseases including the AIDS dementia complex, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer, epilepsy, Down syndrome, septicemia-related encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, malaria, and certain inflammatory brain diseases, as well as in traumatic brain injury. New pharmacological agents designed to manipulate concentrations of kynurenine pathway intermediates may prove to be new therapeutic vectors in the treatment of these disorders.

AB  - Background: Major depression is a subtype of depression. Application of thymoleptics alone has bad effect. It has shown from relevant studies abroad that application of fluoxetine combined with atypical antipsychotic drugs maybe an effective treating strategy. Objective: To observe the curative effects of fluoxetine combined with olanzapine and the time of its taking effect. Design: Comparative study of open clinical test with completely random sampling for the first visit outpatients. Setting: A psychological consulting clinic in a hospital of a Military Medical College of Chinese PLA. Participants: Totally 140 patients visiting, psychological counseling outpatient clinic in the hospital were collected from January 2004 to August 2004. Inclusion criteria: According to the diagnostic criterion of depression of CCMD-3, patients with total scores of 17 items in Hamilton depression rating scale ≥ 28 and age ≥ 18 years old. Exclusion criteria: 1 slight to middle degree of depression (HAMD ≤ 27); 2 secondary depression; 3 convalescent period of schizophrenia and other affective disorder caused by psychosis; 4 severe or unstable body diseases, including diseases of liver, kidney, cardiac vessel, respiration, gastro-intestine, endocrine, nervous system, immune system or hematological system, etc. 5 drug or alcohol addict; 6 women in pregnancy and lactation. Totally 110 patients accorded with the inclusive criteria. Among them, there were 40 males and 70 females with the course of disease for 4 months to 5 years, aged 18 to 63 with the average (37 ± 12) years old. They all took part in the trial voluntarily. According to the date of admittance, they were divided into odd-numbered date alprazolam group in which there were 55 patients with 21 males and 34 females and double date olanzapine group in which there were 55 patients with 19 males and 36 females. Methods: The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the date of admittance. Odd-numbered date group was alprazolam group. 0.4 mg alprazolam was given every noon and before sleep and 20 mg fluoxetine was given at a draught after breakfast every day. Even-numbered date group was olanzapine group. 2.5 mg olanzapine was given before sleep every day and 20 mg fluoxetine was given at a draught after breakfast every day. The course of treatment was 6 weeks. HAMD and HAMA scores of taken were evaluated respectively before and at the end of 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th week. Reducing score rate was used to decide effective time. Lost rate was presented as percentage. And improvement of sleep factor and somatization factor in HAMD were observed before therapy and at every observing time period after therapy. Main outcome measures: Terminus index: Comparison of HAMD, HAMA score in the two groups before therapy and at the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th weekend after therapy. Scores of sleep factor and anxiety somatization factor of HAMD at every observing time period in the two groups. Substitution index: lost rate in the two groups. Reducing score rate at every observing time period in the two groups. Results: Lost rate in olanzapine group was significantly lower than that in alprazolam group(P < 0.05) and the effect was taken at 1 week after therapy (excellence rate 67%). But, scores of HAMD and HAMA at every observing time period in olanzapine group were significant lower than those in alprazolam group(P < 0.01) and sleep factor and somatization factor at every observing time period improved more significantly than those of alprazolam group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Small amount of olanzapine combined with fluoxetine used to treat major depression of the patients can improve sleep and anxiety body symptoms rapidly and then elevate their living quality significantly.

AB  - Obesity continues to plague our society in epidemic proportions. Surgery for morbid obesity is considered by many as the most effective therapy for this complex disorder. Today, multiple surgical procedures for the treatment of obesity are available. As with most procedures, there are benefits and risks associated with open and laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery, as well as with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and partial biliopancreatic bypass with a duodenal switch. The risks and complications associated with bariatric surgery may be serious and in some cases life threatening. However, surgery for obesity has shown remarkable results in helping patients to achieve significant long-term weight control. In addition, it is associated with improvement and often resolution of co-morbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, obesity hypoventilation, sleep apnea, venous stasis disease, pseudotumor cerebri, polycystic ovary syndrome, complications of pregnancy and delivery, gastroesophageal reflux disease, stress urinary incontinence, degenerative joint disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

AB  - Hormonal therapy forms part of the treatment of every intersex condition. For some conditions, such as salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hormonal replacement therapy is life saving because hormones necessary for survival (cortisol and aldosterone) are replaced. In contrast, other hormones such as androgens or mineralocorticoids are secreted in excessive amounts in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to an enzyme imbalance, and the role of hormonal therapy is to suppress the unwanted hormone excess by exerting negative feedback. For patients with one of the many causes of hypogonadism, sex hormone replacement therapy may be prescribed to stimulate sexual development: growth of a hypoplastic penis in a young boy, pubertal changes (male or female), psychosexual development, and adult sexual behavior. It has equally important and highly beneficial effects on bone mineral density. Hormonal therapy is also used to treat the unborn child. For the last 20 years, prenatal dexamethasone treatment administered to the pregnant woman has been used to prevent the development of ambiguous genitalia in females with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Outcome studies show this treatment to be well tolerated and, in general, efficacious. Intersex conditions are, however, difficult to treat because they may intrinsically perturb complex aspects of the person's gender identity, gender-role behavior, sexual orientation, sexual functioning, and psychologic adjustment. Furthermore, decisions made about the sex of an infant by doctors and parents do not always turn out to be correct; the person may grow up feeling uncertain about his or her gender identity, or worse still, harbor a sense of outrage about their life and treatment experiences. Such a person will have definite views about hormonal therapy when the time comes and skilful counseling will be needed. A vigorous debate about ethical aspects of current medical practices relating to intersex conditions has been waged for the last 7 years between certain patient advocacy organizations and the medical profession, and is expected to continue for some time. The quality of the debate will be improved by evidence. The results of a number of long-term follow-up studies have been published, and more are expected. The published studies show mixed, but mainly encouraging, results.

AB  - Early life adversity can lead to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disease including depression, with symptoms of depressed mood, impaired coping with negative events, anhedonia, reduced appetite, and elevated stress hormone activity. In rats, postnatal manipulation studies have focused on behavioural and endocrine anxiety effects, and have demonstrated that mild pup stimulation in the form of early handling (EH) is chronically anxiolytic relative to no stimulation in the form of non-handling (NH). Furthermore, apparently severe manipulations in the form of 3-4 h daily litter-dam separation (maternal separation) or pup-litter-dam separation (early deprivation, ED) are either without effect or even EH-like, relative to NH. In this Wistar rat study, we investigated the effects of ED under different circadian and thermal conditions on adulthood behavioural and endocrine responsiveness to environmental challenge, relative to NH. ED was performed on days 1-14, during either the Light or Dark phase and at either 21°C (cold) or 32°C (warm). Dark-cold ED adults exhibited reduced motivation to obtain sucrose in a progressive ratio schedule, tended to be less mobile in a forced swim test, but did not exhibit an escape deficit in a foot-shock pre-exposure/shuttle box test, or altered basal or stress endocrine activity. Light ED was completely without effect on adult phenotype. Even relative to stringent NH comparison, dark-cold ED leads to a long-term trait of mild gustatory anhedonia in Wistar rats. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated in young rats the effects of malnutrition on the main structures of the circadian timing system: retina, hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), thalamic intergeniculate leaflet, retinohypothalamic- and geniculohypothalamic tracts. Control rats were born from mothers fed a commercial diet since gestation, and malnourished rats from mothers fed a multideficient diet since gestation (GLA group) or lactation (LA group). After weaning, pups received the same diet as their mothers, and were analysed at postnatal days 27, 30-33 and 60-63. Brain sections were processed to visualise in the SCN neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity and terminal labeling after intraocular tracer injections. Nissl staining was used to assess cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the SCN and cell features in retinal whole mounts. Cell counts, morphometric and densitometric analysis were performed. Compared with controls, the total retinal surface was reduced and the topographical distribution of retinal ganglion cells was altered in malnourished rats, with changes in their density. Alterations were also detected in the SCN dimensions in the GLA and LA groups at one and two postnatal months, as well as in the SCN portion occupied by the retinal input in the GLA group at days 30-33, but not in the NPY-containing geniculohypothalamic tract. The present data point to subtle changes, with a low and differential vulnerability to early malnutrition, of structures involved in circadian timing regulation. Furthermore, the present findings suggest that the altered circadian rhythmicity previously documented in malnourished rats cannot be ascribed to impaired development of the retino- and geniculohypothalamic projections to the SCN. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Parental smoking and prone sleep positioning are recognized causal features of Sudden Infant Death. This study quantifies the relationship between prenatal smoking and infant death over the time period of the Back to Sleep campaign in the United States, which encouraged parents to use a supine sleeping position for infants. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized the Colorado Birth Registry. All singleton, normal birth weight infants born from 1989 to 1998 were identified and linked to the Colorado Infant Death registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between outcomes of interest and prenatal maternal cigarette use. Potential confounders analyzed included infant gender, gestational age, and birth year as well as maternal marital status, ethnicity, pregnancy interval, age, education, and alcohol use. Results: We analyzed 488,918 birth records after excluding 5835 records with missing smoking status. Smokers were more likely to be single, non-Hispanic, less educated, and to report alcohol use while pregnant (p <0.001). The study included 598 SIDS cases of which 172 occurred in smoke-exposed infants. Smoke exposed infants were 1.9 times (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) more likely to die of SIDS. The attributed risk associating smoking and SIDS increased during the study period from approximately 50% to 80%. During the entire study period 59% (101/172) of SIDS deaths in smoke-exposed infants were attributed to maternal smoking. Conclusions: Due to a decreased overall rate of SIDS likely due to changing infant sleep position, the attributed risk associating maternal smoking and SIDS has increased following the Back to Sleep campaign. Mothers should be informed of the 2-fold increased rate of SIDS associated with maternal cigarette consumption. © 2005 Anderson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Biological processes and functions in women are well organized in time, as evidenced by the expression of ultradian (high frequency), circadian (∼24-hour), circamensual (∼monthly), and circannual (∼yearly) rhythms and by the changes that occur with menarche, reproduction, and menopause. Attributes of women's circamensual structure have been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease, and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse effects of prescription and non-prescription medications widely used by women can vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for their use. Medication trials must be comprehensive and representative of women and men of different life stages, ethnicities, and likely times (morning vs. evening) of drug use. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - A huge amount of knowledge about sleep has accumulated during the last 5 decades following the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nevertheless, there are numerous areas of considerable ignorance. One of these concerns the particularities of sleep in women. Most basic and clinical studies have been performed in male subjects, and only very recently research groups around the world have addressed women's sleep in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge on the influence of oestrogens on the brain and on the distinctive changes of sleep across the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and menopause. In addition, studies in female rodents are reviewed as well as the knowledge on female peculiarities regarding the interactions between sleep regulation and age-related changes in circadian rhythms. We also address specific aspects of sleep loss and sleep disorders in women. Finally, very recent studies on the sociology of sleep are summarized and future directions in the field are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To examine how sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms of Japanese parents are related to their sleeping arrangements before and after the birth of their first child. Design: Prospective longitudinal, time-series methods. Setting: Participants' homes in four geographical areas of Japan. Participants: Convenience sample of 101 Japanese first-time parent couples who completed antepartum and postpartum questionnaires. Main outcome measures: 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm from 7-day logs at 32 to 36 weeks gestation and 4 to 5 weeks postpartum and daily social rhythm from Monk's Social Rhythm Metric. Results: Mothers' total sleep time and activity level decreased after birth. Social rhythms became less regular for mothers and more consistent and regular for fathers. Although sleeping arrangement had no effect on parents' daily social rhythms, it had a Significant effect on the 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm. Regularity of sleep-wake rhythms was more prominent for fathers sleeping with mother and baby than for fathers sleeping alone. Conclusions: Couples having their first child face great changes in their sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms. Nurses can counsel expectant parents to think about their sleeping habits and social activities and assist them in making informed decisions about the best sleeping arrangement during transition to parenthood.

AB  - Maternal prenatal stress has been found to be related to over-activity and/or dysregulation of the HPA-system in the offspring. These effects are more readily apparent in response to novel situations. The aim of the present report was to examine whether pregnancy stress predicted HPA-axis reactions of children to the first day of school after the summer break. Children of mothers with more prenatal stress were compared to those of mothers with less stress. Habituation was studied by comparisons between the first school day and a second school day a week later. Finally, cortisol levels at school were compared to those of a weekend day. The participants were 29 mother-child pairs (20 girls and nine boys, mean age 5.31 years, SD=0.50). The children's cortisol levels were determined in saliva. Multilevel analysis (hierarchical linear modelling) was used to analyze the data. Both prenatal cortisol and pregnancy anxiety were related to the children's cortisol levels as a reaction to the first school day. Children whose mothers had higher levels of morning cortisol during pregnancy, and more fear of bearing a handicapped child showed higher levels of cortisol on school days. In addition, the circadian rhythm of cortisol on school days appeared to have a steeper slope as compared to that of the circadian curve on a weekend day. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In a new preparation of prenatal multivitamins, PregVit®, two tablets a day (a.m. and p.m.) are given. Folic acid is separated from iron and zinc and is given in the p.m. tablet to overcome problems due to folic acid interactions with iron or zinc, and frequent presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in the morning. The circadian variation of folate in humans has not been investigated. This is the first study attempting to determine whether circadian variation of folate pharmacokinetics exists in humans. Objectives: To determine whether circadian rhythm of folate pharmacokinetics exists in humans. Methods: In a crossover design, six healthy, non-pregnant women were randomized to receive 1 tablet of PregVit® p.m., containing 1.1 mg of folic acid, in the morning or evening. Serum folate levels were measured over 10 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was used to compare the extent of absorption between the two time periods. Results: The mean AUC values for serum folate after administration of PregVit® p.m. were 334.5 ± 119.6 nM*h and 283.1 ± 64.3 nM*h for morning and evening, respectively (P = 0.17). The morning and evening peak serum folate concentrations were also similar (135.3 ± 41.7 nM and 130.3 ± 14.2 nM, respectively) (P = 0.75). Similarly, the time to peak for the morning arm (1 ± 0.5 hour) was similar to evening administration (1 ± 0.4 hour). Conclusions: There is no evidence of circadian variation in folate pharmacokinetics. Thus, the introduction of folate in PregVit® p.m. will not affect its effectiveness as compared to its routine administration in the morning. © 2005 Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate and analyse daily profiles of plasma arginine-vasopressin concentration (AVP), sodium, potassium, chloride concentrations and the plasma osmolality (PO) in pregnant (n = 9) and non-pregnant (n = 17) goats. The influence of late pregnancy on AVP diurnal changes and correlation between PO and electrolyte concentrations were determined. Plasma AVP in both groups of goats changed during 24 h, with the highest values in the dark phase and lowest values during the light phase. AVP in pregnant goats ranged from 0.66 fmol·ml-1 to 1.14 fmol·ml-1 and was higher than that in non-pregnant goats (0.48-0.83 fmol·ml-1), especially during the dark phase. Relatively stabilised concentration of osmotic active electrolytes in plasma in both groups of goats suggests the efficiency of the processes protecting the water-electrolyte homeostasis, which is especially significant in pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: To compare the results of the nonstress test (NST) performed at 9:00 PM and 9:00 AM on women with high-risk pregnancies. Method: The NST was performed 2 h after a meal, at 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM, in a quiet room exposed to daylight, on 80 women with high-risk singleton pregnancies. Each session lasted 20 min. If the NST was nonreactive, the entire biophysical profile was immediately performed. The women's blood pressure was measured before, 10 min within, and at the end of the NST. Women who smoked or had uterine contractions were excluded from the study. Results: Diurnal nonstress test variations were manifested by a higher incidence of reactive NSTs and an increased number of fetal heart accelerations after 9:00 PM (82.5%) than at 9:00 AM (68.8%) (p < 0.027 P < 0.001). Conclusions: Evening appointments for fetal assessments, except in emergency conditions, may eliminate the need for additional tests such as the entire biophysical profile because of the decreased incidence of nonreactive NSTs. Evening NSTs would save time and decrease maternal anxiety. © 2005 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Circadian rhythmicity is evident in a wide range of physiological systems including the reproductive axis. The recent discoveries of rhythmic clock gene expression in peripheral tissues, including reproductive tissue, suggests that they may play an important role in optimizing fertility. The evidence for rhythmic control of reproduction from studies in laboratory animals is reviewed and where possible this includes evidence from human studies. Clock genes are highly conserved across species including humans and there is no reason to suggest that they are functionless in humans. The challenge issued here is for researchers to probe their function and the consequences of their disruption in both animal and human reproduction. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.

During the few minutes following injection of Humulin U, the local wheal-flare reactions accompanied by itching has been occurred. These symptoms have been disappeared after a few hours. Insulin Humulin U was discontinued (18 j). Glycemia were monitored every 1-2 hours between 8 pm-6 am. Glycemia were in normal range between 8 pm. till 5 am. We have observed increase of glycemia to 6.34 mmol/l between 5 am.-6 am. The therapy was converted to Humalog injected at 5 30 am with glycemic control one hour later. The glycemic control was very good till next dose of Humalog before breakfast. The doses of Humalog were systematically increased at 5.30 am depend on glycemia at 6.30 with highest doses in 37 week of pregnancy (30 j with 180 j a day). The good glycemic control was maintained till delivery (38 week of pregnancy). That method of therapy was good tolerated and was not strenuous in spite of necessity of early awakening. We suggest that in obese gestational diabetics ultra-short insulin preparation, analog of short acting human insulin (Humalog), injected at 5.30 am might be considered as a therapeutic alteration for long acting insulin injected at evening. This observation may be interesting especially in situations in which long acting insulin injected at evening must be discontinued.

AB  - Data from literature report that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism affects the recurrence of preeclampsia and that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) prevents adverse outcomes in thrombophilic women. We investigated the effect of LMWH on the pregnancy outcome, on maternal blood pressure values, and on uteroplacental flow in ACE DD nonthrombophilic women with history of preeclampsia. Eighty nonthrombophilic ACE DD women were randomized in 2 groups: 41 treated with dalteparin 5000 IU/day and 39 untreated (control group). Women underwent 24-hour automated blood pressure monitoring in the preconceptional period and every 2 weeks from weeks 8 to 36 and transabdominal color flow/pulsed Doppler examination at weeks 16, 20, and 24. LMWH reduced the risk of clinical negative outcomes (74.1% reduction of preeclampsia and 77.5% reduction of fetal growth restriction) and the severity (88.3% reduction of early onset of preeclampsia and 86.4% reduction of early onset of fetal growth restriction). In treated women, the relative risk for preeclampsia was 0.26 (P=0.02), and the relative risk for fetal growth restriction was 0.14 (P<0.001). Systolic (P=0.002) and diastolic (P=0.002) blood pressures, as well as awake (P=0.04) and asleep (P=0.01) period values, and the resistance indexes of both uterine arteries (P=0.002) were lower in the treated group. LMWH reduces the recurrence of preeclampsia, of negative outcomes, and the resistance of uteroplacental flow, and also prevents maternal blood pressure increase in ACE DD homozygote women with a previous history of preeclampsia.

AB  - Animal liver is a rich source of vitamin A. Due to retinoic acid (RA) metabolites, vitamin A has a teratogenic potential and women are generally advised to avoid or to limit the consumption of liver during pregnancy. In a recent study in non-pregnant female volunteers following single and repeated doses of up to 30,000 IU/day of vitamin A as a supplement, the plasma concentration time curve of all-trans RA acid showed a diurnal-like profile. But, the overall exposure (AUC24h) remained essentially unaltered whereas AUC24h increased linearly with dose for 13-cis and 13-cis-4-oxo RA. The current study in non-pregnant female volunteers showed that a single high vitamin A intake with a liver meal (up to 120,000 IU) exhibited a similar diurnal-like plasma concentration time curve for all-trans RA and its overall exposure remained also unaltered, despite a temporary two-fold increase in peak plasma concentration. Concentrations of 13-cis and 13-cis-4-oxo RA increased several-fold after a liver meal, and exposure (AUC24h) increased three- to five-fold. Pooling our results with data in the literature revealed a linear relation between the mean AUC24h of 13-cis and 13-cis-4-oxo RA and vitamin A intake with liver. Metabolism to all-trans RA of vitamin A with liver seems not to be of safety concern. However, the observed increase of plasma concentrations and the dose-dependent increase in exposure to 13-cis and 13-cis-4-oxo RA support the current safety recommendations on vitamin A intake and suggest that women should be cautious regarding their consumption of liver-containing meals during pregnancy. © Hogrefe &amp; Huber Publishers.

AB  - Background: Levonorgestrel (0.75 mg given for two doses 12 h apart) has been proven to be an effective regimen for emergency contraception when the first dose is given within 72 h of unprotected coitus. However, the dosing interval is inconvenient for those taking the first dose in the afternoon. We conducted a randomized study to evaluate two levonorgestrel dosing regimens for emergency contraception. Two doses of levonorgestrel 0.75 mg were administered with the first dose given up to 120 h after unprotected intercourse. The second dose was given 12 h later in the first regimen and 24 h later in the second regimen. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial between 1997 and 2003 at five centres in China. A total of 2071 women requesting emergency contraception within 120 h of unprotected intercourse were recruited. They were randomized to receive two doses of 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel, given either 24 h apart or 12 h apart. Results: Outcome was unknown for 53 women (24 in the 24 h group and 29 in the 12 h group). Among the remaining 2018 women, the crude pregnancy rate was 1.9% in the 24 h group [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-2.94] and 2.0% in the 12 h group (95% CI 1.19-2.99). The proportion of pregnancies prevented was estimated to be 72% in the 24 h group and 75% in the 12 h group. Side-effects were mild in both groups. The efficacy of the 12 h regimen declined significantly when there were further acts of intercourse after treatment (5.0 versus 1.0%, P < 0.01). This was not observed in the 24 h group. Conclusions: Two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel given either 24 or 12 h apart are effective for emergency contraception up to 120 h after unprotected intercourse. Further research to investigative more effective methods of emergency contraception is warranted. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to classify individuals, to ascertain blood pressure-related risk, and to guide management. The auscultatory technique with a trained observer and mercury sphygmomanometer continues to be the method of choice for measurement in the office, using the first and fifth phases of the Korotkoff sounds, including in pregnant women. The use of mercury is declining, and alternatives are needed. Aneroid devices are suitable, but they require frequent calibration. Hybrid devices that use electronic transducers instead of mercury have promise. The oscillometric method can be used for office measurement, but only devices independently validated according to standard protocols should be used, and individual calibration is recommended. They have the advantage of being able to take multiple measurements. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are all essential. It is increasingly recognized that office measurements correlate poorly with blood pressure measured in other settings, and that they can be supplemented by self-measured readings taken with validated devices at home. There is increasing evidence that home readings predict cardiovascular events and are particularly useful for monitoring the effects of treatment. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring gives a better prediction of risk than office measurements and is useful for diagnosing white-coat hypertension. There is increasing evidence that a failure of blood pressure to fall during the night may be associated with increased risk. In obese patients and children, the use of an appropriate cuff size is of paramount importance.

AB  - The acute phase response is a nonspecific inflammatory reaction of the host that occurs shortly after any tissue injury. The response includes changes in the concentration of plasma proteins called acute phase proteins (APPs), some of which decrease in concentration (negative APPs), such as albumin or transferrin, and others of which increase in concentration (positive APPs), such as C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and ceruloplasmin. Most positive APPs are glycoproteins synthesized mainly by hepatocytes upon stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines and released into the bloodstream. The acute phase response and clinical application of monitoring APPs in dogs and cats are reviewed in this article, including biochemical characteristics, assays developed for each individual APP, and preanalytic and analytic factors influencing APP results that should be taken into account for proper and adequate clinical interpretation. In addition, the diagnostic use of APPs and their possible application in monitoring treatment, which can be considered one of the most interesting and promising practical applications of these proteins, will be discussed. Finally, challenges and future developments of APPs in dogs and cats will be considered, because it is expected that new and cheaper automated assays for determination of the main APPs in small animals will contribute to a wider use of these proteins as biomarkers of infection and inflammatory lesions. ©2005 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.

AB  - The subjective recording in diary cards of symptoms of itch, sneeze, nose running, and blockage, with the use of a rating scale to indicate the level of severity, is usual for clinical trials in allergic rhinitis. The primary outcome measure is usually a composite score that enables a single total symptoms score endpoint. It is appreciated, however, that rhinitis has a greater effect on the individual than is reflected purely by the recording of anterior nasal symptoms. Nasal obstruction is troublesome and may lead to sleep disturbance in addition to impaired daytime concentration and daytime sleepiness. These impairments affect school and work performance. Individuals with rhinitis find it socially embarrassing to be seen sneezing, sniffing, or blowing their nose. To capture these and other aspects of the disease-specific health-related quality of life, questionnaires such as the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire have been developed and validated for clinical trial use. The adoption of health-related quality of life questionnaires into clinical trials broadens the information obtained regarding the effect of the therapeutic intervention and helps focus on issues relevant to the individual patient. It must be appreciated that it is not only the disease that may adversely affect health-related quality of life; administered therapy, although intended to be beneficial, may also cause health impairment. Adverse-event monitoring is thus essential in clinical trials. The first-generation H1-histamines, because of their effect on central H1-receptors, are classically associated with central nervous system (CNS) effects such as sedation. Although this is not always perceived by the patient, it is clearly evident with objective performance testing, and positron emission tomography scanning has directly demonstrated the central H1-receptor occupancy. The second-generation H1-antihistamines have reduced central H 1-receptor occupancy and considerably reduced or absent CNS sedative effects. Therefore, the CNS effects are entirely avoidable, and the first-generation H1-antihistamines should no longer be used in the management of allergic rhinitis. The considerably rarer but potentially very serious cardiac arrhythmogenic effects of H1-antihistamines are appreciated to be molecule-specific rather than class-specific. The in vitro screening of new compounds to eliminate the further development of those with cardiotoxicity ideally will lead to this adverse effect being historic. The incorporation of electrocardiogram recording in clinical trials provides direct information relating to prolongation of QT interval corrected for heart rate. Although administered at low doses, intranasal steroids still have the potential for systemic absorption and adverse consequences. However, it is appreciated that meaningful differences exist in the bioavailability of different steroid molecules, and although a small but statistically significant effect on growth in children has been identified with the long-term use of intranasal beclomethasone when administered twice daily for 1 year, this is not evident with all intranasal steroids. In addition, twice-daily intranasal steroid administration may have more effect - from the endocrinologic perspective - than once-daily administration in the morning, which coincides better with the natural diurnal variation in cortisol. Thus, once-daily intranasal steroid administration is preferable, and when used in studies in children, measurement of height change during the study period is an important outcome variable together with other indices of systemic steroid bioavailability (eg, tests of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function). These considerations have even greater relevance if children are concurrently also receiving inhaled steroids for asthma, because the total steroid load will be greater. © 2005 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of domestic violence (DV) against women during pregnancy and to identify risk factors for DV and effects on women's mental health. METHODS: Pregnant women from an OB-GYN outpatient clinic at a hospital in an urban area were recruited consecutively from February to May 2003. Women who agreed to participate in the research answered three self-administered questionnaires: the GHQ30, the Rosenberg Self Esteem, and one for demographic characteristics at 14 gestational weeks. In order to determine DV prevalence rate during pregnancy, the Japanese version of the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) for measuring severity of DV was provided to those women over 35 gestational weeks. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy nine women answered all questionnaires. 15 of the 279 respondents (5.4%) were DV positive during pregnancy based on the Japanese version of the ISA. Nine had experienced physical violence, and twelve had non-physical violence Compared with women who had not experienced DV during pregnancy, DV positive pregnant women were more likely to be multipara (OR = 3.9) and to have experienced physical violence in the past from a different partner (OR = 9.1). Moreover, general illness (OR = 3.8), sleep disturbance (OR = 5.8), anxiety (OR = 6.3), depression (OR = 11.5) and low self-esteem (P = 0.02) were identified as effects of DV on women's mental health. CONCLUSION: Some 5.4% of women in Japan, approximately 1 in every 20, may experience DV during pregnancy. This is associated with parity and a past history of DV as demographic characteristics, and has an adverse impact on mental health, especially depression. Development of a support system for screening, intervention and referral for DV sufferers is urgently needed.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease which means these patients could suffer sudden death from these cardiovascular diseases, but it is a rare case that common OSAS itself causes sudden death directly. On the other hand, we never wrongly diagnose serious sleep-related breathing disorders (SBDs) such as sleep hypoventilation syndrome, OSAS patients with cardiovascular disease (i.e. ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac failure) and bilateral vocal cord paralysis caused by multiple system atrophy as common OSAS. This section describes how to distinguish these SBDs from common OSAS.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to test the effects of acupuncture on insomnia in a group of pregnant women under real life conditions, and to compare the results with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone (sleep hygiene). Methods: A total of 30 conventionally treated pregnant women were allocated at random into groups with or without acupuncture. Seventeen patients formed the study group and 13 the control group. The pregnant women scored the severity of insomnia using a Numerical Rating Scale from 0 to 10. Women were followed up for eight weeks and interviewed five times, at two-week intervals. Results: Eight women dropped out, five in the study group and three in the control group. The study group reported a larger reduction on insomnia rating (5.1) than the control group (0.0), a difference which was statistically significant (P=0.0028). Average insomnia scores decreased by at least 50% over time in nine (75%) patients in the study group and in three (30%) of the control group. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that acupuncture alleviates insomnia during pregnancy and further research is justified.

AB  - Objective: Approximately 30% of women experience some type of anxiety disorder during their lifetime. In addition, some evidence exists that anxiety disorders can affect pregnancy outcomes. This article reviews the literature on the course of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period and presents guidelines for management. Data Sources and Study Selection: An English language electronic search of relevant studies using PubMed (January 1, 1985-January 2004) was performed using the search terms anxiety and pregnancy, maternal mental illness, panic and pregnancy, psychotropic medications in pregnancy, and treatment options in pregnancy. Review articles and primary pharmacologic treatment articles were selected for discussion. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Despite the extensive use of psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants during pregnancy, there is a scarcity of information regarding the effect of such exposure on the developing fetus. Review articles and primary pharmacologic treatment trials were analyzed and incorporated into the review based on adequate methodology, completeness of data, and information on pregnancy outcome. Conclusion: It is important that physicians understand the course of these disorders during pregnancy and available treatments so they appropriately counsel women who are or intend to become pregnant. The goal of treatment during pregnancy and lactation is sufficient treatment for syndrome remission. To minimize the potential for neonatal withdrawal and maternal toxicity after delivery, vigilant monitoring of side effects is indicated. Also, if possible, nonpharmacologic treatment, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, should be first-line treatment in pregnant women with GAD or panic disorder. © Copyright 2005 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - The initial diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the United States was made because of the facial features common to the first cohort of patients. This article reviews the development of an FAS mouse model whose craniofacial features are remarkably similar to those of affected humans. The model is based on short-term maternal treatment with a high dosage of ethanol at stages of pregnancy that are equivalent to Weeks 3 and 4 of human gestation. At these early stages of development, alcohol's insult to the developing face is concurrent with that to the brain, eyes, and inner ear. That facial and central nervous system defects consistent with FAS can be induced by more "realistic" alcohol dosages as illustrated with data from an oral alcohol intake mouse model in which maternal blood alcohol levels do not exceed 200 mg/dl. The ethanol-induced pathogenesis involves apoptosis that occurs within 12 hrs of alcohol exposure in selected cell populations of Day 7, 8, and 9 mouse embryos. Experimental evidence from other species also shows that apoptosis underlies ethanol-induced malformations. With knowledge of sensitive and resistant cell populations at specific developmental stages, studies designed to identify the basis for these differing cellular responses and, therefore, to determine the primary mechanisms of ethanol's teratogenesis are possible. For example, microarray comparisons of sensitive and resistant embryonic cell populations have been made, as have in situ studies of gene expression patterns in the populations of interest. Studies that illustrate agents that are effective in diminishing or exacerbating ethanol's teratogenesis have also been helpful in determining mechanisms. Among these agents are antioxidants, sonic hedgehog protein, retinoids, and the peptides SAL and NAP. Copyright © 2005 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

AB  - Objective: Fetal heart rate (FHR) variability indicates autonomic nervous system response. Absence of variability may be due to various causes, including fetal metabolic acidosis, neurologic abnormality, marked prematurity, cardiac arrhythmia, effects of drugs, fetal sleep or inactivity. We present the case of a pregnant woman with acute appendicitis whose fetus demonstrated poor variability in heart rate, and we explore the possible reasons that caused poor variability in FHR in this patient. Case Report: A pregnant woman at 40+1 weeks of gestation was admitted because of acute right lateral subcostal tenderness and rebounding pain. Under the impression of acute appendicitis, emergency appendectomy was arranged. Epidural combined with general anesthesia were offered to the patient. Absent variability of FHR on fetal monitoring was noted immediately after laparotomy, and did not reappear until 5 hours after the operation. Emergency cesarean section with spinal anesthesia was arranged due to prolonged active phase in cervical dilatation. The fetus was born with Apgar scores of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Abdominal sepsis due to acute appendicitis that subsequently caused chorioamnionitis and fetal infection was the most probable reason for the poor FHR variability. Conclusion: When sources of infection are eradicated from a pregnant patient, whether by surgical or medical methods, FHR variability will gradually return. Seldom is cesarean section indicated at the time of appendectomy. We suggest that the choice of delivery should depend on the obstetric indications, and not on the event of acute appendicitis.

AB  - It has recently become obvious that the prevalence of obesity has been rapidly increasing in the United States, as well as other countries, over the past two decades. This change has involved both sexes, all age ranges and various ethnic groups. The rising prevalence in children and adolescents is of particular concern because of the implications for negative effects on their morbidity and mortality in young adulthood. Obesity is definitely associated with a relative increase in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, various cancers, respiratory disorders in sleep, gallbladder disease and osteoarthritis. It also has negative effects on a variety of other conditions such as pregnancy complications, menstrual disorders, psychological disorders, and urinary stress incontinence. It is an integral component of the metabolic syndrome, which is emerging as a key constellation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Dealing with this epidemic will require the mobilization of multiple constituencies and allocation of adequate resources. These approaches should be instituted with urgency.

AB  - In this article we summarize the clinical features, epidemiology, differential diagnosis and treatment of the restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements disorder (PLMD), two frequently associated conditions. RLS and PLMD are common causes of disturbed sleep. The RLS prevalence in the general population is estimated to range from 5 to 15 %. The RLS is characterized by unpleasant sensations felt deep in the legs, usually between the ankle and the knee, but occasionally involving also the upper limbs, and occurring at rest, especially at bedtime. The paresthesias or dysesthesias are accompanied by motor restlessness and by an urge to move the limb, which results in a temporary relief of the symptoms. PLMD are characterized by stereotyped, periodic jerking movements of a non-epileptic origin consisting in an extension of the big toe and dorsiflexion of the ankle with an occasional flexion of the knee and hip. PLMS can be accompanied by short awakenings or transient arousals resulting in sleep disruption. In establishing the diagnosis of RLS/PLMS idiopathic and secondary forms should be distinguished, and in particular, a number of other conditions (iron-deficiency, uremia, pregnancy or polyneuropathy) need to be considered. The dopaminergic agents are the best studied and the most successful agents for treatment of RLS and PLMD. © 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits réservés.

AB  - Objective: To determine the type and frequency of postpartum symptoms during recovery from antepartum bed rest treatment across 6 weeks postpartum. Design: Longitudinal repeated measures study. Setting: Three perinatal tertiary care hospitals in two cities in the Midwest. Participants: One hundred six postpartum women who had a singleton high-risk pregnancy and were treated with antepartum bed rest. Main outcome measures: A Postpartum Symptom Checklist assessed physiologic and psychological symptoms. Results: Women reported 12.5 symptoms at 2 days postpartum, but symptoms rapidly declined at 1 week. Ninety-three percent reported a mean of 6.6 symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. Symptoms that continued to be reported at 6 weeks by at least 40% of women were fatigue, mood changes, tenseness, difficulty concentrating, back muscle soreness, dry skin, and headache. Women who had a cesarean delivery reported significantly more symptoms than those who had a vaginal delivery (p = .006). Length of maternal bed rest was significantly correlated with the number of symptoms at postpartum weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Conclusion: Postpartum symptoms decreased across time but reveal an underlying morbidity that is not resolved by 6 weeks postpartum.

AB  - Recent campaigns on having infants sleep on their back has decreased the rate of sudden infant death. Other risk factors have also been identified, including maternal smoking during pregnancy. While many studies have methodological biases, most demonstrate a two to three-fold increase in the risk of sudden infant death among mothers who smoked during pregnancy. The effect of smoking is basically caused by nicotine which is toxic for the brain. This compound has specific trophicity for the respiratory centers rich in nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Deficiencies which could result could lead to greater vulnerability of the infant to episodes of hypoxia. The risk would be dose dependent and more marked in women smoking more than nine cigarettes per day. After birth, certain factors would increase the risk, including passive smoking and sleeping in the mother's bed. © MASSON, 2005.

AB  - Hirschsprung's disease (HD), also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon, is a relatively common cause of congenital obstruction of the colon. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's curse, is a rare condition involving failed autonomic respiration in the absence of cardiorespiratory disease resulting in inadequate alveolar ventilation. Both conditions typically present in the newborn period and belong to a group of disorders referred to as neurocristopathies. HD and CCHS most commonly exist as discrete entities, but the coexistence of them is now called Haddad syndrome. Although few documented cases of Haddad syndrome exist in the literature, the association of CCHS and HD suggests a common etiology involving neural crest development.

AB  - Migraine as a chronic condition is complex. Health care providers effective medication, but migraineurs also need to know how to live with their sensitive nervous system between attacks, not only during a migraine. The cause-and-effect is not linear but multi-faceted. Compared with the effective treatment of acute infections or injuries, medicine knows less about chronic disorders. The patient with a chronic condition, such as migraine, needs to learn to live successfully with the disorder, ideally without becoming disabled. Medicines help the acute attack, but prevention is much less successful. In fact, success with a migraine prophylactic medication is defined as reducing the frequency of acute attacks by 50%, whereas patients believe that success means eliminating migraines completely. For these reasons, self-management techniques need to be a part of every migraine patient's treatment plan. Usually, migraine first strikes during adolescence or early adulthood. By encouraging patients to train their physiology with biofeedback and relaxation, the physician is giving patients a tool for health that will last a lifetime. In fact, pregnant migraineurs need to rely on self-management methods, such as biofeedback and relaxation, because most medications are contraindicated during pregnancy. These methods are also a solid introduction to Lamaze, which many women find helpful during labor and delivery. Because a large segment of Americans are turning to self-management for health through complementary rather than traditional medical methods [32], physicians need to understand and value patients' desire to become responsible and accountable. In this changing atmosphere, the physician becomes a consultant and a monitor of treatment progress and an expert on the pharmacologic treatment of disorders. Self-management works as an adjunct to medical interventions. Because the individual is a complex of layers of influences, factors, and precursors, a disorder is the final physical manifestation of the entire human process. The patient's choice is selfmanagement working in concert with medicine. Patients' top priority for migraine management is a highly efficacious medicine [12], but after the acute attack is over, they have to learn to live without fear until the next attack occurs. That is where self-management takes over.

AB  - Respiratory vagal activity is expressed by heart rate variability (HRV) at approximately 1 month of age in premature low-birth-weight infants (PLBWI). However, the autonomic inputs into the sinus node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) in PLBWI are unclear. We evaluated the variability in PP and PR intervals at day zero (day 0) and 1 month (1 month) after birth in 16 PLBWI (gestation 32.3 ± 1.3 weeks, birth weight 1.578 ± 257 g). The polygraph was recorded during sleep on day 0 and at 1 month. PP and PR intervals and the number of respiratory cycles were measured, and frequency analysis was performed by auto-correlation fast Fourier transforms. Power spectral density (PSD: ms2) was calculated for the low frequency domain (LF: 0.036-0.146 Hz), high frequency domain (HF: 0.146-0.390 Hz), total frequency (TF: 0.036-2.000 Hz), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA: frequency bandwidth of 0.3 Hz with peak respiratory frequency as median), and the PSD ratio in the PP and PR intervals (LF/HF, RSA/TF) were compared. Compared with day 0, a decrease in the LF/HF ratio and an increase in the RSA/TF ratio in PP intervals were observed at 1 month, consistent with expression of respiratory vagal activity. For PR intervals, on the other hand, the LF/HF ratio increased, indicative of accentuated sympathetic activity. However, the respiratory vagal input was weak, and the RSA/TF ratio remained unchanged. These observations suggest that, in PLBWI at 1 month, AVN conduction was not predominatly influenced by respiratory-related vagal activity, but was controlled by autonomic regulation, independent of the SAN.

AB  - Background & Aims: Standard therapy of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected with HCV genotype-2 or -3 is the combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin for 24 weeks. Whether shorter treatment durations are possible for these patients without compromising sustained virologic response rates is unknown. Methods: Patients chronically infected with HCV-2 (n = 39), HCV-2/3 (n = 1), or HCV-3 (n = 113) were treated with peginterferon-α-2a (180 μg/wk) plus ribavirin 800-1200 mg/day. HCV RNA was quantitatively assessed after 4 weeks. Patients with a rapid virologic response (HCV RNA below 600 IU/mL) were randomized for a total treatment duration of 16 (group A) or 24 weeks (group B). All patients with HCV RNA ≥600 IU/mL at week 4 (group C) were treated for 24 weeks. End-of-treatment and sustained virologic response were assessed by qualitative RT-PCR (sensitivity 50 IU/mL). Results: Only 11 of 153 patients (7%) were allocated to group C. End-of-treatment and sustained virologic response rates were 94% and 82%, (group A), 85% and 80% (group B), and 73% and 36% (group C), respectively. In patients infected with genotype HCV-3 and high viral load (>800,000 IU/mL), a significant lower sustained virologic response rate was found than in patients infected with HCV-3 and a viral load lower or equal to 800,000 IU/mL (59% vs 85%, respectively; P = .003). Conclusions: In HCV-2 and -3 (low viral load)-infected patients who have a rapid virologic response, treatment for 16 weeks with peginterferon-α-2a and ribavirin is sufficient. In patients infected by HCV-3 (high viral load), longer treatment may be necessary. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opiates. SEARCH STRATEGY: The previous review was updated with additional searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966-December 2004) and EMBASE (1980-December 2004) supplemented by searches of conference abstracts and citation lists of published articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to opiate or control. Control could include an opiate, sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included control of symptoms, seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies enrolling a total of 585 infants met inclusion criteria (Carin 1983; Finnegan 1984; Jackson 2004; Kaltenbach 1986; Kandall 1983; Khoo 1995; Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984; Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies; sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four studies; and imbalances in group characteristics after randomisation in one study.Opiate (morphine) vs supportive care only: One study (Khoo 1995) found no significant effect on treatment failure (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a significant increase in hospital stay (MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and significant reductions in time to regain birthweight (MD -2.8 days, 95% -5.3, -0.3) and duration of supportive care (MD -197.2 minutes/day, 95% CI -274.2, -120.3).Opiate vs phenobarbitone: Meta-analysis of four studies found no significant difference in treatment failure (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51, 1.11). One of these studies (Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used only opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be interpreted with caution. One study (Jackson 2004) reported a significant reduction in duration of treatment and admission to the nursery for infants receiving morphine compared to phenobarbitone. One study (Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate.Opiate vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of opiate.No study reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbitone, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery admission for infants on morphine. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.
