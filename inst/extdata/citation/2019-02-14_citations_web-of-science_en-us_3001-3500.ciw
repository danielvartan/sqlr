AB Background: Progress in perinatal medicine has made it possible to increase the survival of very or extremely low birthweight infants. Developmental outcomes of surviving preterm infants have been analysed at the paediatric, neurological, cognitive, and behavioural levels, and a series of perinatal and environmental risk factors have been identified. The threat to the child's survival and invasive medical procedures can be very traumatic for the parents. Few empirical reports have considered post-traumatic stress reactions of the parents as a possible variable affecting a child's outcome. Some studies have described sleeping and eating problems as related to prematurity; these problems are especially critical for the parents.
   Objective: To examine the effects of post-traumatic reactions of the parents on sleeping and eating problems of the children.
   Design: Fifty families with a premature infant (25-33 gestation weeks) and a control group of 25 families with a full term infant participated in the study. Perinatal risks were evaluated during the hospital stay. Mothers and fathers were interviewed when their children were 18 months old about the child's problems and filled in a perinatal post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire (PPQ).
   Results: The severity of the perinatal risks only partly predicts a child's problems. Independently of the perinatal risks, the intensity of the post-traumatic reactions of the parents is an important predictor of these problems.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the parental response to premature birth mediates the risks of later adverse outcomes. Preventive intervention should be promoted.

AB Studies of the life history parameters of slender lorises in captivity have led to conflicting results regarding gestation length, birth seasonality, interspecies variation in litter size and the degree of parental care given to offspring. During the course of field studies of Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus, L. /. nordicus and L. tardigradus tardigradus, data were collected on these life history variables, as well as on behaviours relating to mating. All 3 taxa displayed courtship behaviour involving the pursuit of a female by multiple males. Mating corresponded closely with captive observations, with a period of prolonged single intromissions lasting 3-11 min. One gestation period of 163 days was calculated for L. /. lydekkerianus. Births for all 3 taxa were distributed throughout the year, and males were seen mating throughout the year. All 3 taxa gave birth to singletons and twins; no subspecific pattern in litter size was evident. Females carried infants for the first 4 weeks of life and were regularly attended by males, which groomed both the mother and her offspring. After infants had been parked, female L. /. lydekkerianus and L. /. nordicus rarely returned before dawn, though males visited and played with infants. Female L. t. tardigradus maintained proximity with their infants, whilst males were not observed in proximity to infants during the night. All 3 taxa slept in social groups. High-energy milk, in combination with male care, may aid in the potentially high reproductive output of 4 infants per year. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

   NEUROSTEROIDS
AB Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) influence central nervous system (CNS) excitability by increasing GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) inhibitory activity. Allopregnanolone concentrations are higher in the fetal compared to the adult ovine brain, suggesting that this neurosteroid may have a role in regulating fetal CNS activity during gestation. We examined the localisation of allopregnanolone-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in the fetal brain to determine if their sensitivity to allopregnanolone changed during late gestation. The binding of [S-35] tert-butylbicyclophosothionate (TBPS) was used to identify the GABA-chloride ion receptor complex in fetal sheep brains at 90-95, 115-120 and 140-145 days gestational age (GA; term similar to147 days), by autoradiography. Allopregnanolone (200 nM) reduced [S-35]TBPS binding by 70-100% throughout the brain at all fetal ages examined. The levels of [S-35]TBPS binding increased with advancing gestation in all regions examined except some areas of the medulla. Functionally related nuclei and brain areas associated with regulating somato/viscerosensory functions displayed high levels of [S-35]TBPS binding from mid-gestation. These results indicate that allopregnanolone may interact with GABA(A) receptors to inhibit fetal CNS activity from mid-gestation. This inhibition may contribute to maintaining the sleep-like behaviour and low incidence of arousal-type activity typical of fetal life, and may be neuroprotective by limiting excitatory neurotransmission.

AB Pregnancy is associated with significant alterations in respiratory function. Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV), increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen (A-alphaPO(2)) and in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related apneas or hypopneas, these could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because of the conflicting data from sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 11 pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the PaO2, every 2 h. The frequency of apneas and hypopneas was significantly lower during pregnancy compared with that on the postpartum control night. PaO2 levels in the supine position, during sleep, were also significantly lower during pregnancy compared to the postpartum period. No correlation was observed between PaO2 levels and apneas or hypopneas or percent of REM sleep, (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB lntroduction: Little is known about sex differences in human fetal heart and behaviour. Patients and methods: One hundred twenty-three nulliparous healthy women carrying a male (n = 56) or female (n = 67) fetus participated in this study. All pregnancies remained uncomplicated and delivery was uneventful. Ultrasound observation of fetal general movements (GM) was performed for 1 h at 15 - 17 (T1) and 27 - 28 (T2) weeks of gestation and for 2 h at 37 - 39 weeks (T3). Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring occurred simultaneously with fetal ultrasound observations at T2 and T3. The incidence of GM (percentage of time), FHR and its variability, and the incidences of fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) A-D and behavioural states 1F - 4F were compared between boys and girls. Results: There were no significant differences between males and females in the distribution of HRP A-D, overall behavioural state distribution, and basal FHR, FHR variability or the presence of GM during quiet and active sleep (or during HRPA and HRP B, respectively). A Time x Sex interaction effect for GM assessed for total record length and a higher %GM in male fetuses at term age were the only significant findings. However, these observations lost statistical significance after adjustment for the effects of fetal wakefulness, which occurred to a higher extent in male than in female fetuses. Conclusion: Our data do not provide evidence for a difference in fetal functional development or maturation between the two sexes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The origin of sleep and circadian rhythms development is found during the fetal period. Both quiet (NREM) and active (REM) sleep are distinguishable during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Comparable to fetuses, low risk preterm infants recorded at 30-40 weeks postconceptional age, had a similar development of sleep i.e. an increase in quiet sleep and a decrease in indeterminate sleep. A further development in sleep organization characterized by increased slow wave and spindle activity during quiet sleep and coupling with circadian rhythm takes place during the first 6 months of life in both term and preterm infants.
   Circadian rhythm of fetal heart rate synchronized with maternal rest-activity, heart rate, cortisol, melatonin, and body temperature rhythms is present during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Although maternally influenced, circadian rhythm antenatally becomes ultradian at birth. Both preterm and term infants show a significant increase in circadian body temperature rhythm amplitude during the first 3 months of life. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This longitudinal study investigated sleep-wake behavior patterns during and after pregnancy, using an actimeter worn on the non-dominant wrist and a sleep log. Records were obtained from ten mothers, from the 34th week of gestation until the 15th week postpartum. Ten non-pregnant women were used as a control group, data being collected from them for 2 weeks. The sleep-wake behavior after delivery, obtained from wrist actigraphy, was greater in the postpartum period. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and circadian amplitude decreased in the weeks immediately following parturition, but wake after sleep onset increased. Subsequently, all the sleep and circadian variables improved slightly, but they had not returned to the levels of the non-pregnant control group even by the 15th postpartum week. The length of daytime naps increased, in order to make up for nocturnal sleep deprivation when the number of awakenings during nighttime had increased. There were significant positive correlations between total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and the length of daytime naps, but the numbers of awakenings at night and daytime naps did not show this correlation. The total sleep time indicated by sleep logs tended to be greater than that indicated by actigraphy, but wake after sleep onset tended to be underestimated by the sleep logs. The implications of these results are discussed.

AB Until present, fundamental studies on cortisol secretory patterns have not been conducted in cetaceans. The objectives of this study were: (1) to examine diurnal changes in serum cortisol concentrations in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins Tursiops aduncus and killer whales Orcinus orca, (2) to investigate annual cortisol changes in killer whales, and (3) to investigate the relationship between cortisol and sex steroids (testosterone and progesterone) concentrations in killer whales. Diurnal changes in serum cortisol concentrations were investigated at various intervals in the two species. In Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, serum cortisol levels exhibited the same episodic fluctuations for 24h as did diurnal terrestrial mammals: cortisol levels were lower at 18:00 h and higher in the early morning. In killer whales, cortisol concentrations continued to decrease until 18:00 h, after which they fluctuated, and then increased in the next morning. Annual changes in cortisol levels were investigated by collecting blood samples every two weeks from two male killer whales and a pregnant female one twice per day (during 09:00-10:00 and 16:00-17:00 h) throughout a one-year period. Regarding sera collected during 09:00-10:00 h from the female, cortisol concentrations showed cyclic changes having about 4-month intervals. In males, cortisol showed higher concentrations in winter and lower concentrations during the summer season. There was a negative correlation between cortisol and progesterone levels in the female and a negative correlation was also observed between cortisol and testosterone in male no. 2. In the female and male no. 1, cortisol levels during 09:00-10:00 h were significantly higher than those during 16:0017:00 h, and their data are considered to support observations regarding diurnal changes in cortisol levels in the two cetacean species.

   Design: Pilot study, using a prospective, two-group design with repeated measures.
   Setting: Ambulatory maternity clinic in a tertiary care teaching hospital.
   Participants: Women of at least 20 weeks gestation with low back pain, but no preexisting back or disc disease. Thirty women assigned to the intervention group and 10 to a comparison group.
   Interventions: Participants completed a pain assessment at pretest. Intervention participants received a maternity support binder to wear while awake for 2 weeks. At an appointment 2 weeks later, a posttest questionnaire and a taped interview were administered. The comparison group participants received the support binder after the second appointment.
   Main Outcome Measures: Back pain intensity duration, and effect on daily activities were assessed using a pain in pregnancy questionnaire.
   Results: The intervention group had significant reduction in mean pain scores and effect of pain on daily activities, including family, house and yard, recreational, exercise, and sleep. Interaction of group by time was significant for change in pain and effect on family, house and yard, and exercise activities.
   Conclusion: The use of a support binder for pregnancy-related low back pain is a promising intervention and was well-accepted by the participants.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate prenatal to postnatal changes in first-time parents' physical and mental health, and to describe social and health predictors of parents' postpartum health.
   Methods: This prospective study surveyed 261 expectant fathers and mothers during pregnancy and again at 6 months' postpartum regarding their health, partner, and work characteristics. Postpartum changes in health were evaluated by paired t tests, and predictors of postpartum health were determined using multiple regression analyses.
   Results: Both fathers and mothers experienced significant postpartum declines in perceived quality of life. In addition, fathers reported an increase in the number of days ill and a decrease in general health and vitality after childbirth. Mothers perceived an increase in vitality despite their diminishing sleep. Parents' postpartum health was associated with mothers' partner satisfaction, fewer illness days, and certain work characteristics, such as total work time and the balance of work between mothers and fathers.
   Conclusions: Both mothers and fathers experienced declines in health that persisted at least 6 months after the birth of their first child. Notably, postpartum health was associated with partner satisfaction and work characteristics. This information might be used to develop interventions for improving parents' health during this vulnerable time.

   EPISODIC HYPOXIA
AB Intermittent hypoxia (IH), one of the hallmarks of obstructive sleep apnea, occurs more frequently during pregnancy. We hypothesized that IH may lead to persistent postnatal changes in respiratory responses to acute hypoxia and may also lead to adverse effects on spatial function learning as revealed by the Morris water maze. To examine this issue, time-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to IH and room air (IHRA; 21 and 10% O-2 alternations every 90 seconds) or to normoxia (RARA) until delivery. Ventilatory and metabolic responses to a 20-minute acute hypoxic challenge (10% 0(2)) were conducted at postnatal ages 5, 10, 15, and 30 days. In addition, spatial task learning was assessed in the water maze at 1 and 4 months of age. Normoxic ventilation was higher at all time points in IHRA rats than in RARA rats (p < 0.01). Peak hypoxic ventilatory responses were attenuated in IHRA rats at 5 days of age and hypoxic ventilatory depression was accentuated at this age as well. However, ventilatory equivalents (minute ventilation/oxygen consumption) revealed significant reductions in peak hypoxic ventilatory responses of IHRA rats and hypoxic ventilatory depression at all postnatal ages (p < 0.01). Acquisition and retention of a spatial task were similar in the IHRA and RARA groups at both 1 and 4 months of age. We conclude that gestational intermittent hypoxia elicits long-lasting alterations in the control of breathing. We postulate that such IH-induced respiratory plasticity may create selective vulnerability to hypoxia during development.

AB The interest in studying the brain electrical activity as a function of the development of intelligence has been spurred by the need to understand how the brain responds to environmental information. The description of sleep in mentally retarded children reveals deviant patterns of the EEG-spindles and of the eye movement activity (REM sleep) when compared to normal children. The patterns may be considered as a valuable index of mental function. According to experimental evidence, the distribution of the eye movements of sleep appears either as random or ordered. The latter are altered in the mentally handicapped in whom the appearance out of chaos, of the order which is needed for intelligence and memory to function, is altered.
   The sleep signs are redundant as from birth. Their pattern is also related to the psychomotor development of the infant. If their distribution remains random, or appears in long uninterrupted sequences of waves as in epilepsy, intelligence does not develop. A similar strategy appears to function in the foetus when nature organizes the structures that will lead to the development of intelligence. The eye movement patterns of sleep change in the pregnant women as a function of term and resemble those of premature babies of a similar gestational age. They also change as a function of the menstrual cycle and more generally as a function of age. The hypothesis that attention is the diurnal equivalent of REM sleep is discussed. Attempts at modelling the eye movement patterns of REM sleep as a function of near zero gravity environments have been made.
   1) By means of a Montecarlo simulation using the semi Markov model during the Spacelab 1 flight.
   2) With the method of the single and multiple g-phase transition analysis of the strange attractor dimension (d) during parabolic flights. The implication of the latter for the neural processes involved in learning is that the central nervous system can preserve intact, from input to output, over a period of several days, all the information it receives
   3) The relation between spindles and eye movements has also been viewed by a quantum approach which is another medium between the information and the way of describing it.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies on the potential influence of aspirin (AAS) on blood pressure have not taken in consideration the chronopharmacologic effects of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. This pilot study investigated the effects of AAS on blood pressure in hypertensive patients under no anti hypertensive treatment who received AAS at different day times according to their rest-activity cycle.
   PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied 64 untreated patients with mild hypertension (24 men), 43.5 (12.0) (mean [SDI) years of age, randomly divided in 3 groups: group 1, non-pharmacological hygienic-dietetic recommendations; group 2, the same recommendations plus AAS (100 mg/day) on awakening, and group 3, the same recommendations plus AAS (100 mg/day) before bedtime. Blood pressure was measured every 20 min during the day and every 30 min at night for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention. The circadian pattern of blood pressure in each group was established by population multiple-component analysis. Circadian parameters obtained for each group of patients before and after the intervention were compared with a nonparametric paired test.
   RESULTS: After 3 months of non-pharmacological intervention, there was a small and non-significant reduction of blood pressure (< 1.5 mmHg; p = 0.28). There was no change in blood pressure when AAS was given on awakening (p = 0.21). A highly significant blood pressure reduction was, however, observed in patients who received AAS before bedtime (decrease of 7 and 5 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; p = 0.006).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a statistically significant time-dependent administration effect of low-dose AAS on blood pressure in untreated patients with mild hypertension. This effect reinforces the need to quantify and control AAS effects in patients using this agent in combination with antihypertensive agents.

AB The physiological significance of spectral and fractal components of spontaneous heart rate (HR) variability in the fetus remains unclear. To examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different measures of HR variability, R-R interval time series obtained by fetal ECGs were recorded continuously over 24 h in five pregnant sheep at 116-125 days gestation. Conventional measures of short-term (STV) and long-term variability (LTV), low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15 cycles/beat) and high-frequency (HF; 0.2-0.5 cycles/beat) spectral powers, the LF-to-HF ratio, and fractal dimension values were calculated from 24-h ECG recordings and quantified every 60 min. STV, LTV, and LF and HF spectral powers were minimal during the day but increased significantly to their highest values at night. We found a significant positive correlation between these measures, whereas the cosinor method showed significant similarity between their circadian rhythm patterns. Fetal R-R intervals also exhibited fractal structures. Fetal HR variability had a fractal structure, which was similar between day and night. These results suggested that the circadian rhythms exhibited by STV and LTV during the day were mainly due to changes in frequency components rather than to fractal components of fetal HR fluctuation.

AB Aim: To determine any variation in the respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia of infants born small for gestational age (SGA) to smoking and to non-smoking mothers.
   Methods: A total of 70 average for gestational age (AGA) infants (>36 weeks gestation, >2500 g, >25th centile for gestational age, and no maternal smoking), and 47 SGA infants (<10th centile for gestational age) were studied at 1 and 3 months of age, in quiet and active sleep. Respiratory test gases were delivered through a Perspex hood to simulate face down rebreathing by slowly allowing the inspired air to be altered to a CO2 maximum of 5% and O-2 minimum of 13.5%. The change in ventilation with inspired CO2 was measured over 5-6 minutes of the test. The slope of a linear curve fit relating inspired CO2 to the logarithm of ventilation was taken as a quantitative measure of ventilatory asphyxial sensitivity (VAS).
   Results: There was no significant difference in VAS between the AGA and SGA infants (0.25 v 0.24). However within the SGA group, VAS was significantly higher (p = 0.048) in the infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (0.26 (0.01); n = 24) than in those that did not (0.23 (0.01); n = 23). The change in minute ventilation was significantly higher in the smokers than the non-smokers group (141% v 119%; p = 0.03) as the result of a significantly larger change in respiratory rate (8 v 4 breaths/min; p = 0.047) but not tidal volume.
   Conclusions: Maternal smoking appears to be the key factor in enhancing infants' respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia, irrespective of gestational age.

AB With the aim of evaluating the effect of interaction between physical training or exercise only during pregnancy and thermal stress on oxidative stress, and antioxidant mechanism sedentary pregnant rats (PS), exercised pregnant rats only during pregnancy (PE) and trained rats submitted to also exercise during pregnancy (PT) were compared (N=63). Exercise sessions consisted of swimming at 80% of maximal work load supported into water at 28 degreesC (hypothermia, PS 28, PE28, PT28) or 35 degreesC (thermal neutrality, PS35, PE35, PT35) or 39 degreesC (hyperthermia, PS39, PE39, PT39), for 30 min. The initial body weight in all groups of rats was from 177 to 207 g. On the 20th day of pregnancy, 24 h after the last immersion or swimming session venous blood was collected to determine oxidative stress. Plasma concentrations of means malondialdehyde (MDA) values measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); total glutathione (GSH) and vitamin E were determined. The oxidative stress index was calculated from the ratio TBARS/GSH and TBARS/Vitamin E. TBARS did not change on the group PE at different temperatures of water; TBARS were higher for PS28 than PS35 and PS39; PT35 had higher values than PT28 and PT39. For GSH, PS39 was lower than PS35; PE28 was higher than PE35 and PE39 and PT35 were lower than PT28 and PT39. Plasma concentration of vitamin E did not present any difference for sedentary rats at different water temperatures, but for PE28, the values were lower than for PE35 and PE39, whereas PT39 was lower than PT35 and PT28. In relation to TBARS/GSH, it was verified an increase in oxidative stress for PS28 (in relation to PS35 and PS39), PE35, and PT35 (in relation to PE28 and PE39 or PT28 and PT39); regarding the ratio TBARS/vitamin E, the highest values were obtained at 35 degreesC for PS and PT groups and at 39 for PE group. These results have shown the great complexity of the interaction between physical training, thermal stress and pregnancy. Apparently, hypothermia produces large index of oxidative stress only in sedentary rats, but this index was greater at 35 degreesC in relation to extreme temperatures for trained rats. These results have suggested that physical training allows a more efficient activation of antioxidant mechanisms under thermal stress. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To compare the physiological stability and behavioral effects of co-bedding with those of single-bedding premature multiple-gestation infants in incubators as well as the psychological effects on their parents.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, repeated measure.
   Participants: Convenience sample of 16 infants and 8 parents in the co-bedded group, and 21 infants and I I parents in the control group.
   Interventions: Infants in the study group were co-bedded in incubators.
   Main Outcome Measures: Baseline and posttesting for parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction measures; infant sleep-wake synchronicity; physiological measures; and stress cue measures during baseline and activity.
   Main Results: Repeated measures 5 (time) x 2 (group) analysis of variance found significant differences in infant daily weight, feeding amount, and high-activity heart rate. There was no difference in parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction scores by group, except for higher baseline parental satisfaction scores in the co-bedded group.
   Conclusions: This research demonstrated the safety of co-bedding multiple-gestation infants in incubators but did not find any significant clinical improvement in infant or parental outcomes with co-bedding. Neonatal intensive-care unit providers should educate staff and parents about the potential benefits of co-bedding and consider developing policies and procedures for co-bedding in both incubators and cribs. Co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants may be provided as an adjunctive developmental care strategy if parents desire this intervention.

ID EXPIRATORY FLOW; HARMONIC DISTORTION; HEALTHY; RESISTANCE; ELASTANCE;

AB We compared the harmonic content of tidal flows measured simultaneously at the mouth and chest wall in spontaneously breathing very low birth weight infants (n = 16, 1,114 +/- 230 g, gestation age: 28 +/- 2 wk). Airway opening flows were measured via face mask-pneumotachograph (P-tach), whereas chest wall flows were derived from respiratory inductance plethysmography ( RIP) excursions. Next, for each, we computed two spectral shape indexes: 1) harmonic distortion (k(d); k(d,P-tach) and k(d,RIP), respectively) defines the extent to which flows deviated from a single sine wave, and 2) the exponent of the power law (s; s(P-tach) and s(RIP), respectively), describing the spectral energy vs. frequency. P-tach and RIP flow spectra exhibited similar power law functional forms consistently in all infants. Also, mouth [s(P-tach) = 3.73 +/- 0.23% (95% confidence interval), k(d,P-tach) = 38.8 +/- 4.6%] and chest wall (s(RIP) = 3.51 +/- 0.30%, k(d,RIP) = 42.8 +/- 4.8%) indexes were similar and highly correlated (s(RIP) = 1.17 x s(P-tach) + 0.85; r(2) = 0.81; k(d,RIP) = 0.90 x k(d,P-tach) + 8.0; r(2) = 0.76). The corresponding time to peak tidal expiratory flow-to-expiratory time ratio (0.62 +/- 0.08) was higher than reported in older infants. The obtained s and k(d) values are similar to those reported in older and/or larger chronic lung disease infants, yet appreciably lower than for 1-mo-old healthy infants of closer age and/or size; this indicated increased complexity of tidal flows in very low birth weight babies. Importantly, we found equivalent flow spectral data from mouth and chest wall tidal flows. The latter are desirable because they avoid face mask artificial effects, including leaks around it, they do not interfere with ventilatory support delivery, and they may facilitate longer measurements that are useful in control of breathing assessment.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether stress, sleep disturbance, or fatigue at 22 to 26 weeks of gestation is related to the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Data were collected prospectively by questionnaires measuring factors contributing to preterm labor and birth. Hours worked per week were ascertained by telephone until the participants delivered. Postpartum medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. There was a trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity, low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events. Officer rank was related to both preterm labor and delivery. Findings indicate that the perception of fatigue may be protective against preterm birth and that military officer rank is a risk factor for preterm labor and birth.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Changes in circadian variation of blood pressure could be used either to predict preeclampsia or to assess its severity. With the objective of identifying potential differences in blood pressure at the early stages of pregnancy, we examined and compared the characteristics of circadian variability in blood pressure in healthy and complicated pregnant women who were systematically monitored throughout gestation.
   SUBJECTS AND METHOD: We analyzed 2,014 blood pressure series sampled through ambulatory monitoring for 48 hours once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit until delivery. The study included 205 women with uncomplicated pregnancy, 92 with gestational hypertension and 31 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group and trimester of gestation was established by means of a population multiple-components analysis.
   RESULTS: Differences in the 24-hour mean between healthy and complicated pregnancies were highly significant in all trimesters (p < 0.001), with values of 15.1 and 9.1 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood presure, respectively, in the third trimester of pregnancy. The 24-hour mean of systolic/diastolic blood pressure for complicated pregnancies was always below 120/72 mmHg. Results further indicated similar circadian characteristics between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these two groups in the 24-hour mean was significant in the second trimester for systolic Q mmHg; p = 0.002) but not diastolic blood pressure (0.9 mmHg; p = 0.230). In the third trimester, the difference between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia was significant for both variables (5.4 and 3.7 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies, which are observed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, are detected when both systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements in women with a late diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia fall within accepted ranges of normotension. These differences offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic interventions.

AB THE epidemic of obesity requires an intervention that is both effective and broadly acceptable. Conventional medical programs have been ineffective. Traditional surgical approaches, such as gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion, are accepted by less than 1% of the severely obese each year. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has been in clinical use for 8 years and it is timely to look at the developments in technique and to look at the outcomes for safety, effectiveness, and acceptability. Data are based on our clinical experiences and research reports derived from 1145 patients treated to date by laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. We have also drawn on the published literature and on a systematic review of the literature about LAGB published by the Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures-Surgical. Generally reports that have included more than 100 patients and 3 or more years of follow-up have been selected. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has proved to be a safe procedure, 7 to 10 times safer than gastric bypass in terms of mortality, and associated with few perioperative complications. Late events have been more frequent with prolapse of the stomach through the band occurring in 15% of our initial patients and erosion of the band into the stomach in 3.2% of our initial patients. Both complications are treatable laparoscopically and have become less common with modifications of technique. Weight loss is gradual but progressive over the first 2 years and has stabilized at about 50% of excess weight lost for the next 4 years. There are major associated improvements in the multiple comorbidities of obesity including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sleep disordered breathing, comorbidities of pregnancy, and the quality of life (QOL). Laparoscopic adjustable, gastric banding has several attributes that potentially will enable it to overcome the community's resistance to bariatric surgery. It has proved to be safe. It is highly effective in achieving good weight loss, major improvements in health; and improved QOL. Because of the laparoscopic placement, adjustablity, and the easy reversibility, LAGB can provide these benefits in a gentle and safe way.

AB Previous studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction may be involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The major risk factors for SIDS are the prone sleeping position and maternal smoking. Our aim was to examine the effects of sleeping position and maternal smoking on the postnatal maturation of autonomic function by examining heart rate responses following arousal in healthy term infants. Twenty-four infants (11 born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and 13 to mother who did not smoke) were studied using daytime polysomnography and multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cm H2O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep QS).
   We demonstrated no difference between smoking and non-smoking groups of infants in any of our measurements, and thus combined data from the groups. Baseline (BHR) was elevated in the prone compared to the supine position in quiet sleep (QS) at 2-3 weeks (p < 0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.001), and in active sleep (AS) at 2-3 and 5-6 months (p<0.05). BHR was significantly elevated in AS compared to QS in the supine position at all ages (p < 0.01) and in the prone position at 2-3 (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). Increases in heart rate (DeltaHR%) following arousal were significantly greater in the supine compared to the prone position in QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and in AS at both 2-3 (p<0.01) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). &UDelta;HR% was significantly greater in AS compared to QS in both supine (p<0.05) and prone (p<0.001) positions at 2-3 weeks and in the supine position at 2-3 months (p<0.001). We conclude that sleep state, sleep position and postnatal age affect the cardiac responses following arousal from sleep in healthy term infants. Impairment of heart rate control in the prone position may be important in understanding the increased risk for SIDS in this position. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The interactions of 3-month-old infants and their depressed mothers were classified as intrusive, withdrawn or good interactions. Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had similarly elevated cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine during pregnancy. The depressed mothers and their newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation. Despite these group similarities, the infants of the "good interaction" mothers did not show high amounts of indeterminate sleep and they received better scores on the Brazelton scale. The more organized behaviors of these newborns may have contributed to the better interaction ratings of the "good interaction" depressed mothers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

   FACTORS; HOSPITAL NURSES; SLEEP PROBLEMS; CASE-REFERENT
AB Aims: To identify the work factors that predict sickness absence in nurses' aides.
   Methods: The sample comprised 5563 Norwegian nurses' aides, not on leave because of illness or pregnancy when they completed a mailed questionnaire in 1999. Of these, 4931 (88.6%) completed a second questionnaire three months later. The outcome measure was the three month incidence proportion of certified sickness absence (>3 days), as assessed by self reports at follow up.
   Results: Perceived lack of encouraging and supportive culture in the work unit (odds ratio (OR) 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 2.34), working in psychiatric and paediatric wards, having injured the neck in an accident, and health complaints were associated with higher risk of sickness absence, after adjustments for a series of physical, psychological, and organisational work factors, personal engagement in the work unit, demographic characteristics, and daily consumption of cigarettes. Having untraditional jobs (for nurses' aides) (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.77), and engaging in aerobics or gym were associated with a lower risk of sickness absence.
   Conclusions: The study suggests that the three month effects of work factors on rates of certified sickness absence are modest in nurses' aides. The most important work factor, in terms of predicting sickness absence, seems to be perceived lack of encouraging and supportive culture in the work unit.

AB Studies of sleep across the life cycle in women have utilized both survey and polysomnographic techniques, but have tended to be of small sample size with diverse methodology. As a result, definitive conclusions about the impact of the menstrual cycle and use of oral contraceptives on sleep parameters cannot yet be made. Sleep disruption during pregnancy and postpartum is nearly universal, but effective and practical countermeasures are still needed. Longitudinal studies of sleep in the postpartum period are also lacking. Menopause is associated with insomnia due to several factors including hot flashes, mood disorders and increased sleep-disordered breathing. The use of hormone replacement therapy to treat sleep and other variables is an active area of investigation. In summary, much research is required to fully elucidate the impact of the life cycle on sleep parameters in women. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB beta-lonone (111) is a degraded (C 13) sesquiterpene found in plant essential oils. It has been used in the synthesis of perfume chemicals and vitamin A. Recently, it was reported that BI is a rather potent in vitro inhibitor of CYP2B1-catalysed reactions in rat liver microsomes. The present study was performed to investigate whether inhibition of CYP2B1 reactions by BI could lead to an attenuation of cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced embryotoxicity in the rat. In a preliminary experiment, a dose-dependent prolongation of pentobarbital sleeping time in male and female Wistar rats suggested that BI inhibits CYP2B1 in vivo as well. In a second experiment, rats were treated by gavage with BI (0, 250, 500, 750 or 1000 mg/kg body wt) 45 min prior to a subcutaneous injection of either CP (7.5 mg/kg body wt) or its vehicle (saline) on day I I of pregnancy. BI alone, at the highest dose tested, caused a high proportion of resorptions. Lower doses of BI, however, clearly attenuated CP-induced embryolethality and teratogenicity. These results seem to support the view that, as far as rats are concerned, CYP2B1 plays an import-ant role in the conversion of CP into its embryolethal and teratogenic metabolites.

AB Muscle cramps are involuntary, painful, sudden contractions of the skeletal muscles. They are present in normal subjects under certain conditions (during a strong voluntary contraction, sleep, sports, pregnancy) and in several pathologies such as myopathies, neuropathies, motoneuron diseases, metabolic disorders, hydroelectrolyte imbalances or endocrine pathologies. There has been considerable uncertainty in the literature regarding the classification and nomenclature of muscle cramps, both because the term "cramp" is used to indicate a variety of clinical features of muscles, leading to its use as an imprecise "umbrella" term that includes stiffness, contractures and local pain, and because the spectrum of the diseases in which it appears is wide. The purpose of the present study is to propose a simple classification to provide a framework to better recognize the full spectrum of phenomenology of muscle cramps.

AB Background: Changes in circadian variation of blood pressure (BP) could be used either to predict preeclampsia or to assess its severity. We examined and compared characteristics of circadian variability in BP in women with both healthy and complicated pregnancies who were systematically monitored throughout gestation. Methods: We analyzed 2430 BP series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for 48 h once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit until delivery in 235 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 128 with gestational hypertension, and 40 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP variation for each group and trimester of gestation was established by population multiple-components analysis. Results: The differences in 24-h mean and amplitude between healthy and complicated pregnancies were highly significant in all trimesters (P < 0.001). Results further indicated similar circadian characteristics between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these two groups in 24-h mean was statistically significant for systolic (P = .002) and diastolic BP (P = .038) in the second trimester and, to a larger extent, in the third trimester (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The differences in BP between healthy and complicated pregnancies that can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy are found when both systolic and diastolic BP for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted range of normotension. These differences offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic intervention.

AB Both restricted feeding and barren housing have a negative influence on sow welfare. The aim of this study was to test whether sows that have to search for their feed in a substrate on the floor show less stereotyped (and other abnormal) behaviour and have a lower physiological stress response. In three batches, 96 gilts were housed individually in two rooms in 3.1 m(2) pens with 1.9 m(2) solid floor. In a 2 x 2 factorial design either wood shavings (S) or no substrate (NS) were provided on the floor, and 900 g of feed was provided twice daily (06:30 and 15:00 h) either in a trough (T) or on the floor (F). In weeks 8-12, behaviour was scan-sampled once in the periods 07:00-09:00 h (PI), 10:00-12:00 h (P2), and 13:00-15:00 h (P3). Data from the 5 weeks were pooled per animal. Video recordings (24 h) in week 12 or 13 were scan-sampled for 'standing'. Saliva samples were taken in week 11 at 2 h intervals during 24 h and measured for cortisol. Spontaneously voided morning-urine was sampled in weeks 2, 7 and 12 or 13 for determination of ratios of adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) with creatinine (CR). Most effects that were found were due to substrate presence. Main findings were that compared with S-animals, NS-animals stood more during the dark period (4.8% versus 3.0%: P < 0.05) and showed more (visible) oral behaviour in P1 (56.8% versus 47.6%; P < 0.05). P2 (35.8% versus 30.8% tendency) and P3 (44.1% versus 33.8%; P < 0.05). This included more sham chewing in PI (tendency). P2 and P3, more pen manipulation in P3, and more other oral behaviour (e.g. teeth grinding) in PI (tendency) and P2. They had higher cortisol levels before feeding (peaks) and in the early evening (24 h average: 1.49 ng/ml versus 1.02 ng/ml; P < 0.05) and higher NA/CR ratios in weeks 7 (tendency) and 12 (5.5 ng/mg versus M ng/mg: P < 0.05). No treatment effects were found on A/CR ratios, Substantial interactive effects of feeding method and substrate were only found in floor manipulation, In all three periods NS-T-animals manipulated the floor less than other animals. probably because they had no attraction to the floor and were not rewarded for searching. Results imply that the presence of a substrate on the floor improves welfare, whereas provision of feed in the substrate in order to stimulate foraging behaviour is of less importance.

AB The aim of this study was to estimate and analyse circadian variations of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteronc system (RAA) activity in blood of goats and the influence of late pregnancy on the circadian variations of RAA system. The study was carried out on a group of 17 non-pregnant and 9 pregnant goats. The animals were kept in uniform environmental conditions, (9 h light/15 h darkness). Blood samples were collected seven times over a period of 24 h, every 4 h. Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (PA), sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations were determined. PRA and PA of both groups changed during 24 h, with the highest values in the dark phase and with higher RAA system activity (especially during the night) in the pregnant goats. In the non-pregnant goats, no circadian changes in PRA and PA were observed. The cireadian changes in PRA and PA found in pregnant goats had acrophases at 06:27 h and 01:13 h, respectively. Plasma electrolyte concentrations in both groups of goats also changed during 24 h. These results suggest that circadian changes of potassium concentration in plasma of goats during late pregnancy may be one of the main factors affecting the RAA system.

AB The effects of shift work on physiological function through disruption of circadian rhythms are well described. However, shift work can also be associated with specific pathological disorders. This article reviews the evidence for a relationship between specific medical disorders and working at night or on shift systems. The strongest evidence exists for an association with peptic ulcer disease, coronary heart disease and compromised pregnancy outcome.

AB Combined exposure to stressors and chemicals may result in synergistic effects. The effects of prenatal exposure to the organic solvent toluene resemble those observed in offspring of gestationally stressed dams, a possible common mechanism being transfer of stress-/toluene-induced increments of corticosteroids from the maternal to the foetal compartment. Pregnant rats were subjected to either 1500 ppm toluene 6 hr/day and/or a schedule of "Chronic mild stress" during the last two weeks of gestation. Exposure to toluene was associated with reduced birth weight and lower maternal weight gain, the latter being enhanced by maternal stress. A depressant effect of toluene on maternal corticosterone was observed, hence the study does not provide immediate evidence that transfer of elevated levels of corticosterone from the maternal to the foetal compartment mediates the effects of prenatal exposure to toluene.

AB In the mammal, melatonin regulates the seasonal and/or circadian rhythm of PRL levels. Since several members of the PRL gene family are expressed during late pregnancy, we investigated the relationship between the expression of placental lactogen (PL)-II-one member of the PRL family- and melatonin, as well as the placental expression of one of the receptors for melatonin, melatonin receptor 1a (Mel(1a). Herein we provide the first demonstration that Mel(1a) is not only expressed in the rat placenta, but that it is spatially and temporally regulated throughout late pregnancy. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses show that Mel(1a) mRNA is localized in the rat placenta on gestational day 19, and is mainly restricted to the spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cells. Interestingly, the junctional zone of the placenta at this time showed the strongest gene expression when the tissue was obtained at 16:00 h (daytime) and showed the least expression when it was obtained at 04:00 h (night-time). In contrast, the labyrinth zone showed the strongest expression in tissue obtained at night and showed the least expression in tissue obtained during the day. PL-II gene expression also exhibited a circadian rhythm but the direction of the fluctuation was exactly opposite to that of the Mel(1a) gene, such that at night the junctional zone had the strongest expression, while the labyrinth zone had the weakest. In vitro treatment of placental tissue with an melatonin agonist, chloromelatonin, greatly decreased PL-II mRNA levels. That Mel(1a) plays a regulatory role in the expression of PL-II in the late-pregnancy rat placenta is strongly suggested by the pattern of its own spatial and temporal expression.

AB Snoring is common in pregnancy, and snoring pregnant women have increased rates of pre-eclampsia. Patients with pre-eclampsia show upper airway narrowing during sleep. The present study aimed to compare upper airway dimensions in pregnant and nonpregnant women and in patients with pre-eclampsia. A total of 50 women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 37 women with pre-eclampsia were recruited consecutively from the antenatal service and matched with 50 nonpregnant women. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Snoring was reported by 14% of nonpregnant women, 28% of pregnant women, and 75% of pre-eclamptic women (p < 0.001). When seated, pregnant women had wider upper airways than nonpregnant women (p < 0.02), but there was no difference when supine. Oropharyngeal junction area in the seated position was less (p < 0.01) in the women with pre-eclampsia (mean +/- SD: 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm(2)) than either nonpregnant (1.1 +/- 0.1 cm(2)) or pregnant women (1.3 +/- 0.1 cm(2)). Supine oropharyngeal junction area was less in the women with pre-eclampsia than in the nonpregnant women (0.8 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1 cm(2); p = 0.01) but similar in women with pre-eclampsia and pregnant women (0.9 +/- 0.1 cm(2); p > 0.3). The study showed that women with pre-eclampsia have upper airway narrowing in both upright and supine postures. These changes could contribute to the upper airway resistance episodes during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may further increase their blood pressure.

AB Development of neurotensin (NT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), vasopressin (AVP) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) expressing neurons was investigated in the human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus of nine subjects ranging from 20-40 weeks of gestation using immunocytochemistry and morphometry. Results obtained showed that NT expressing neurons developed earlier than VIP, AVP and NPY expressing neurons. Consistent with results obtained from animal studies, we also found VIP expressing neurons were born earlier than AVP expressing neurons. Whether the NT expressing neurons play a role in generating circadian rhythms in the early life of humans needs to be further investigated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to find out whether there is a daily rhythm in goat serum cortisol concentrations, whether the concentration profiles differ between normal light:dark and constant dark conditions, and whether any seasonal variations might be detected in daily cortisol secretion patterns. Seven Finnish landrace goats were kept at indoor temperature (18-23degreesC) under artficial lighting that approximately simulated the annual changes of daylength at 60degreesN. Blood samples were collected for cortisol measurements by radioimmunoassay at 2h intervals during six times of the year: winter (light:dark 6:18h), early spring (10:14h), late spring (14:10h), summer (18:6h), early fall (14:10h), and late fall (10:14h). Cortisol profiles were determined for two consecutive days, first in light:dark (LD) conditions and then in continuous darkness (DD). There was no significant daily rhythm in serum cortisol levels in any time of the year, nor did the profiles in LD and DD conditions show any differences. A significant seasonal variation was, however, detected among the overall cortisol levels. In winter, the concentrations were higher than in any other season, and from early spring to summer they were at their lowest. Under equal photoperiods, the cortisol levels were higher in fall than spring. The difference between winter and summer was confirmed in the following year in LD conditions. There was no correlation between the serum cortisol and progesterone levels. The results suggest that the possible circadian variation of cortisol secretion in goats is completely masked by external factors, and the lighting conditions do not have immediate effects on the daily secretion patterns. The seasonal variation in the overall cortisol levels is most probably related to the changes in photoperiod, because other conditions were relatively constant during the experiment.

AB Despite poor sensitivity and specificity, office blood pressure (BP) determinations are still the "gold standard" for diagnosing gestational hypertension. This prospective blind study evaluates the prognostic value of office values as compared with ambulatory monitoring in pregnancy. We analyzed 2175 BP series systematically sampled from 355 non-preeclamptic pregnant women for 48h every 4 wks from the first hospital visit until delivery, Women were divided for comparative purposes into three groups: "detected" gestational hypertension, defined on the basis of casual clinical BP > 140/90 mmHg after 20 wks of gestation and hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of a time-specified tolerance interval adjusted for the circadian pattern of the reference population) consistently above the threshold for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy; "undetected" gestational hypertension, women with office BP < 140/90 mmHg but hyperbaric index consistently above the threshold for diagnosis; and normotension, women with both office values and hyperbaric index below the respective thresholds for diagnosis. Small and insignificant differences in the 24 h mean BP between "detected" and "undetected" gestational hypertension is observed in all trimesters, in contrast with highly significant differences between these two groups and normotensive pregnancies. Normotensive women are characterized by highly significant lesser incidence by 60% in preterm delivery, 70% in intrauterine growth retardation, and 50% in delivery by cesarean section (p < 0.001) compared with women with "detected" and "undetected" gestational hypertension (p > 0.715). In pregnancy, the hyperbaric index is markedly superior to office BP measurements for diagnosis of what should be truly considered gestational hypertension, and for prediction of the outcome of pregnancy.

AB Thirty-four experts and a literature supervisor got together in order to reach a 'consensus' regarding the definition, diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of insomnia. Insomnia is a subjective perception of dissatisfaction with the amount and/or quality of sleep. It includes difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or early awakening with inability to fall asleep again. It is associated with complaints of non-restorative sleep and dysfunction of diurnal alertness, energy, cognitive function, behaviour or emotional state, with a decrease in quality of life. The diagnosis is based on clinical and sleep history, physical examination and additional tests, although polysomnography is not routinely indicated. Therapy should include treatment of the underlying causes, cognitive and behavioural measures and drug treatment. Hypnotic therapy can be prescribed from the onset of insomnia and non-benzodiazepine selective agonists of the GABA-A receptor complex are the drugs of first choice. It is recommended that hypnotic treatment be maintained in cases where withdrawal impairs the patient's quality of life and when all other therapeutic measures have failed. Experience suggests that intermittent treatment is better than continuous therapy. The available data do not confirm safety of hypnotics in pregnancy, lactation and childhood insomnia. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in decompensated chronic pulmonary disease but no significant adverse effects on respiratory function have been reported with zolpidem and zopiclone in stable mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in treated obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Data for zaleplon are inconclusive. If the patient recovers subjective control over the sleep process, gradual discontinuation of hypnotic treatment can be considered.

AB One hundred sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anxiety during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high anxiety women also had high scores on depression and anger scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high anxiety women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high anxiety mothers' high prenatal norepinephrine and low dopamine levels were followed by their neonates having low dopamine and serotonin levels. The high anxiety mothers' newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high anxiety mothers spent more time in deep sleep and less time in quiet and active alert states and showed more state changes and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (motor maturity, autonomic stability and withdrawal). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The effects of dietary nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) on behavior and heat production in group-housed sows were studied. Twelve groups of six nonpregnant sows were fed one of four experimental diets that were similar in composition except for starch and NSP contents. Exchanging sugar. beet pulp silage (SBPS) for tapioca created the difference in dietary starch and NSP ratio. On a dry matter (DM) basis, diets contained 0, 10, 20, or 30% SBPS. Sows were group-housed. Intake of fermentable NSP (fNSP) for diets containing 0, 10, 20, or 30% SBPS averaged 7.06, 9.18, 11.61, and 13.73 g.kg(-0.75).d(-1), respectively. Sows were fed once a day at 0800. Dry matter intake for diets containing 0, 10, 20, or 30% SBPS, averaged 38.05, 38.38, 38.53, and 38.35 g.kg(-0.75).d(-1), respectively, and ME intake averaged 523, 518, 514, and 493 kJ.kg(-0.75).d(-1), respectively. On average, sows spent 177 min/d on physical activity, of which 8.8% was spent on eating. Time spent in physical activity was affected by diet (P = 0.005). Sows fed 0 or 10% SBPS spent more time on physical activity than sows fed 20 or 30% SBPS (P = 0.002). Energy cost of physical activity averaged 464 kJ.kg(-0.75).d(-1) (standard estimated mean of 31) and was similar for diets (P = 0.679). Total heat production (HP) and activity-related heat production (AHP) were affected by diet (P < 0.05). Sows tended to be quieter when fNSP intake increased (P = 0.063). The effect of fNSP intake on HP and AHP was not constant during the day. During the night period, fNSP intake did not affect HP and AHP (P > 0.10). During the day period, increased fNSP intake decreased HP (P = 0.006) and tended to decrease AHP (P = 0.062). During eating, increased fNSP intake increased HP (P = 0.012) and tended to increase AHP (P = 0.074). Despite similar DMI, sows fed 0 or 10% SBPS spent less time eating than sows fed 20 or 30% SBPS (P = 0.009). Feed consumption rate was higher (P = 0.003) in groups fed 0 or 10% SBPS than in groups fed 20 or 30% SBPS. Feed consumption rate decreased by 0.19 g DM.kg(-0.75). min(-1) (P = 0.003) for each gram of fNSP intake. The energy saving effect of physical activity on the NE value of fNSP from SBPS ranged between 2.3 and 3.7 kJ/g of fNSP intake. In conclusion, intake of fNSP from SBPS affected energy expenditure for physical activity (P = 0.063); however, this effect was not constant during the day.

AB Purpose: To test whether nausea and vomiting or fatigue correlated with psychosocial variables.
   Design: Descriptive, using secondary data from a prenatal database of 113 women in prenatal care in Texas. Mean gestational duration was 59 days at the time of data collection.
   Methods: Psychosocial factors, frequency of nausea and vomiting and of fatigue were determined by use of questionnaires. Psychosocial measures bad reliability and validity and included the Personal Resources Questionnaire and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. A checklist was used for measuring nausea and vomiting and fatigue.
   Findings: Of 113 participants, 3 0 (26.5%) reported no, 43 (38.1%) occasional, and 40 (35.4%) frequent nausea and vomiting. Depressive symptoms bad the highest correlation with nausea and vomiting. Social support was negatively related to nausea and vomiting. Four (3.5%) women reported no fatigue, 49 (43.4%) reported occasional fatigue, and 60 (53.1%) reported frequent fatigue in the past month. Depressive symptoms bad the highest correlation with fatigue. The chi-square statistic showed that fatigue was significantly related to employment. Fatigue was not significantly associated with work hours or stressfulness of jobs.
   Conclusions: Only a limited number of psychosocial factors were associated with nausea and vomiting and fatigue in early pregnancy. Depression was related to physical symptoms, but unclear was whether depression preceded or resulted from the symptoms. Many women experienced symptoms, and better understanding of causality is needed to ameliorate the effects on women's well-being.

AB Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with a period length of about 24-hrs. Evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that the circadian timing system develops prenatally and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a circadian clock, is present by mid-gestation in human and non-human primates. Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is responsive to light at very premature stages and that low intensity lighting can regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms in sleep-wake and hormone secretion generally developing after two months of age. Showing the importance of photic regulation of circadian phase in infants, exposure of premature infants to low-intensity cycled lighting results in the early establishment of rest-activity patterns that are in phase with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. With the continued elucidation of circadian system development and influences on human physiology and illness, it is anticipated that consideration of circadian biology will become an increasingly important component of neonatal care.

AB Because smoking during pregnancy is a major risk factor for late fetal death and the sudden infant death syndrome, we investigated cardiorespiratory defense mechanisms to hypoxia in 7 prenatally nicotine-exposed (N) lambs (approximate maternal dose: 0.5 mg/kg/day) and 11 control (C) lambs all at an average age of 5 days. The ventilatory response to 10% oxygen (hyperpnea) was significantly attenuated during quiet sleep in N lambs compared with C lambs and in N lambs aroused from sleep later compared with C lambs (161 +/- 90 versus 75 +/- 66 seconds, p < 0.05). The ventilatory response to hypoxia was similar in the two groups during wakefulness (W), whereas the heart rate response (tachycardia) was significantly lower in N lambs compared with C lambs during both activity states. The ventilatory response to hyperoxia was significantly lower in N lambs compared with C lambs during both activity states. Transition from W to quiet sleep was associated with a significant decrease in ventilation in C lambs but not in N lambs. In conclusion, prenatal nicotine exposure, at a dose comparable with moderate smoking, blunts major elements of the cardiorespiratory defense to hypoxia, i.e., the heart rate and ventilatory and arousal responses, and abolishes the normal decrease in ventilation during sleep compared with W.

AB Objective: To assess the incidence and time course of new-onset restless legs syndrome (RLS) after spinal anesthesia. Methods: A total of 202 consecutive patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for various types of surgery were prospectively evaluated regarding the presence and severity of RLS symptoms 48 to 72 hours post surgery and after I week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. A diagnosis of RLS was made according to the criteria of the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG), and severity was assessed by the IRLSSG severity scale. Results: Of 161 patients without any history of RLS, 8.7% developed first-onset RLS after spinal anesthesia. Symptoms were transient, with a mean duration of 33 +/- 30 days. Low mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were associated with the occurrence of new-onset RLS after spinal anesthesia. Conclusions: Transient RLS can be induced by spinal anesthesia. The mechanisms by which spinal anesthesia can trigger RLS are unclear but may include deficits in spinal sensorimotor integration in susceptible individuals.

AB Context Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal mortality among American Indians, a group whose infant death rate is consistently above the US national average.
   Objective To determine Prenatal and postnatal risk factors for SIDS among American Indians.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living controls among American Indians in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa enrolled from December 1992 to November 1996 and investigated using standardized parental interview, medical record abstraction', autopsy protocol, and infant death review.
   Main Outcome Measures Association of SIDS with maternal socioeconomic and behavioral factors, health care utilization, and infant care practices.
   Results The proportions of case and control infants who were usually placed prone to sleep (15.2% and 13.6%, respectively), who shared a bed with parents (59.4% and 55.4%), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7% and 54.6%) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7% of case infants and 45.5% of control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of clothing on the infant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-26.5), any visits by a public health nurse (aOR, 0.2; 95% Cl, 0.1-0.8), periconceptional maternal alcohol use (aOR, 6.2; 95% Cl, 1.6-23.3), and maternal first-trimester binge drinking (aOR, 8.2; 95% Cl, 1.9-35.3).
   Conclusions Public health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and first trimester, and layers of clothing are important risk factors for SIDS among Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.

TI Autonomic alterations in cocaine-exposed infants
SO AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIAC VAGAL TONE; HEALTHY-CHILDREN;
   HABITUATION; OPERATION; DISEASE; ADULTS; SLEEP
AB Background Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects autonomic control of the heart. After intrauterine cocaine exposure, asymptomatic newborn infants within 72 hours of life have decreased HRV. It is unknown whether these alterations are transient (acute effect) or,persist in older infants and possibly reflect a teratogenic effect of cocaine.
   Methods This study prospectively evaluated HRV in 2- to 6-month-old infants who were exposed to cocaine in-utero (Group 1, n = 71). Their data were compared to normal controls (Group 3, n = 77) and to newborns exposed to drugs other than cocaine (Group 2, n = 89). Based on our previous study, heavy and light cocaine exposure was also defined a priori as the amount of cocaine used during the pregnancy that was more than or less than the 70th percentile, respectively.
   Results At the age of 2 to 6 months,infants with in-utero cocaine exposure had, higher vagal tone and higher HRV (total power) than normal controls (no exposure to drugs). Most of this increase in vagal tone occurred in the light-cocaine-exposure group. HRV and vagal tone in the heavy-cocaine-exposure group were similar to the noncocaine-exposed group.
   ConclusionS At 2 to 6 months of age, asymptornatic infants exposed to cocaine in-utero have recovered from lower HRV seen within 72 hours of age. Infants exposed to light cocaine recovered by a rebound by increasing their vagal tone to above-normal levels. A similar response was blunted in heavily-cocaine-exposed infants. These alterations noted at follow up suggest a possible teratogenic effect of-cocaine on the developing autonomic system.

AB The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. In the United States, in 1999, 27% of adults had a body mass, index >30 kg/m(2), almost double the prevalence of 20 years earlier. The estimated mortality from obesity-related diseases in the United States is approximately 300,000 annually and growing. In the future, mortality related to obesity is expected to exceed that of smoking. Numerous diseases are caused or made worse by obesity. These include type 2 diabetes; hypertension; dyslipidemia; ischemic heart disease; stroke; obstructive sleep apnea; asthma; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; gastroesophageal reflux disease; degenerative joint disease of the back, hips, knees, and feet; infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome; various malignancies; and depression. Type 2 diabetes is perhaps the most visible obesity-related problem. Present in at least 14 million Americans, it leads to serious complications and premature death. It is largely caused by obesity, and is generally cured by weight loss. The quality of life of the obese is markedly reduced, and the costs to health care systems are great. Preventive programs have yet to affect the rising prevalence. An effective solution is needed. (C) 2002 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Possibly the most important, outcomes of bariatric surgery involve changes in obesity-related illness, quality of life (QOL), and psychologic well-being. Dramatic improvement or resolution of serious medical comorbidity accompanies the weight loss following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with the LAP-BAND (INAMED Health, Santa Barbara, CA). There are major improvements in the conditions of the metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Improvement in insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta-cell function associated with weight loss induces remission in the majority of type 2 diabetics and reduces the risk of others developing type 2 diabetes. Improvement in dyslipidemia is characterized by raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride concentrations. Together with lower blood pressure, these changes provide a substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk. Other medical conditions caused or aggravated by obesity are also significantly improved, including sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux. Weight loss is associated with improved fertility and more favorable pregnancy outcomes. All aspects of QOL improve substantially, especially physical disability, and post-weight-loss QOL measures approximate those of the general population. There are also major improvements in body image and reduction in depressive illness. These changes provide perhaps the most compelling data regarding the value of LAP-BAND surgery and underlie the great satisfaction experienced by patients. (C) 2002 Excerpta Medica Inc.

AB When isolated from their dams and littermates, rat pups emit ultrasonic vocalizations to elicit attention and retrieval from their dams. This study examined the effects of perinatal alcohol exposure on ultrasonic vocalizations and maternal-infant interactions. Alcohol was administered throughout gestation to the dams and during the early postnatal period to the pups. Control groups consisted of a nontreated control and an intubated, pair fed control. Ultrasonic vocalizations were measured on postnatal day (PD) 5 under varying conditions of isolation. Maternal behaviors were examined on PD2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Maternal behaviors were not significantly affected by prior alcohol administration to either the dams or the pups. However, ethanol-exposed rat pups vocalized more on PD5 than controls regardless of condition. The heightened vocalization response of the ethanol-exposed pups might be an underlying factor in the persistent effects of perinatal ethanol exposure on social behavior.

AB Natural progesterone, a potent respiratory stimulant, stimulates leptin production in premenopausal females. Leptin and its counterpart neuropeptide Y (NPY) have recently been linked with respiration. The effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on arterial blood gases, serum leptin and NPY was evaluated in this study. Fourteen postmenopausal females with respiratory impairment, due mostly to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were recruited for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Arterial blood gases, serum leptin and NPY concentrations were measured at baseline and after 14 days of treatment with placebo and MPA, separated by a 6-week washout period.
   Thirteen patients completed the trial. The mean SD carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood (Pa,CO2) was 5.4 +/- 0.6 kPa at baseline, and decreased by 0.8 +/- 0.3 kPa during treatment with MPA. The oxygen tension in arterial blood (Pa,CO2) and pH did not change. At baseline, the mean base excess was 0.6 +/- 1.9 mmol(.)L(-1) and the mean bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration was 25.1 +/- 1.6 mmol(.)L(-1). With MPA, base excess decreased by 2.2 +/- 1.2 mmol(.)L(-1) and HCO3- by 1.9 +/- 1.0 mmol(.)L(-1) from baseline. The mean concentrations of serum leptin-19.8 +/- 9.9 mug(.)L(-1) at baseline, 19.7 +/- 9.8 mug(.)L(-1) with MPA) or NPY (94.0 +/- 18.3 pmol(.)L(-1) at baseline, 85.1 +/- 41.2 pmol(.)L(-1) with MPA) did not change. However, the reduction in Pa,CO2 correlated with the reduction of serum leptin concentration.
   Medroxyprogesterone acetate effectively decreased the carbon dioxide tension in postmenopausal females with chronic respiratory impairment. The results suggest that a decrease in the carbon dioxide tension of greater than or equal to0.9 kPa is necessary for a reduction in serum leptin concentration.

AB A time- and date-matched set of saliva samples (N = 229) from nine couples first expecting, and then caring for, their first child were used to test whether hormone changes in the father could be predicted by the hormonal status of the mother. Testosterone, cortisol, and estradiol were quantified from saliva. Neither testosterone nor estradiol concentration was correlated within couples before or after the birth, although there was a positive correlation for cortisol concentration in the mother and father before the birth. As the hormone that might be influenced by chemical signals, that already played a similar role in men and women, and that had been empirically linked to paternal behavior, cortisol concentration was also compared with sex steroid concentrations. The mother's cortisol concentration was positively correlated to the father's testosterone concentration, and the mother's testosterone concentration was positively correlated with the father's cortisol concentration. However, both effects were similar in magnitude to the cortisol to cortisol correlation, and all could parsimoniously be explained by similar responses to a shared environment. Thus, this analysis rejects parallels in peripheral hormone concentrations of estradiol, testosterone, and cortisol in mothers and fathers. However, the available data were not able to test or reject hypotheses about local neuroendocrine homology, nor to control for masking effects of other hormonal demands on men and women, nor to determine the relative importance of shared environment versus mother-father signaling.

AB Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) might be due to the fetal consequences of a Mg maternal deficiency, which might be prevented by simple atoxic nutritional Mg intake by the mother.
   Various stresses in the pregnant women or in the infant may transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion which may not be cured by nutritional Mg supplement, but requires a correction of its causal dysregulation. Beside the well established risk factors in baby care and in the environment, it is important to stress the possible role of a primary hypofunction of the biological clock. This may be treated by darkness therapy: total light deprivation at night for the infant and atoxic nutritional Mg supplement for the pregnant women. The place in the prevention of SIDS of Mg therapy for the infant and of the use of melatonin, L-tryptophan and taurine is now uncertain yet.

AB Sleep can be influenced by the cyclicity of reproductive hormones and by social and psychological stress. Sleep disruptions can be caused by many factors during the pre and postpartum stages of pregnancy, including hormonal alterations, discomfort due to enlargement of the fetus, various irritating symptoms, and ultimately erratic sleeping patterns by newborns, but for the most part, have been attributed to physical symptoms. Sleep problems specific to midlife women have been predominantly associated with hot flash activity but sleep changes associated with general aging and various social factors can play a role. In general, effective nursing interventions for sleep problems fall into the realms of behavioral coaching or education for self-care sleep improvement and screening for referral of serious sleep-related disorders.

AB Infection has been identified as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Synthesis of allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid with potent sedative proper-ties, is increased in response to stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) on brain and plasma allopregnanolone concentrations and behavior in newborn lambs. LPS was given intravenously (0.7 mug/kg) at 12 and 15 d of age (n = 7), and resulted in a biphasic febrile response (p < 0.001), hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia (p < 0.05), a reduction in the incidence of wakefulness, and increased nonrapid eye movement sleep and drowsiness (p < 0.05) compared with saline-treated lambs (n = 5). Plasma allopregnanolone and cortisol were significantly (p < 0.05) increased after LPS treatment. These responses to LPS lasted 6-8 h, and were similar at 12 and 15 d of age. Each lamb was then given LPS at 20 d of age and killed 3 h posttreatment to obtain samples of the brain. Allopregnanolone concentrations were increased (p < 0.05) in all brain areas except the cerebellum and diencephalon. We suggest that LPS-induced increase of allopregnanolone in the brain may contribute to somnolence in the newborn, and may be responsible for the reduced arousal thought to contribute to the risk of SIDS in human infants.

AB Objective. During recent years, coincident with the recommendation to position infants supine, the incidence of posterior deformational plagiocephaly has increased dramatically. The purpose of our study was to determine whether early signs of cranial flattening could be detected in healthy neonates and to document incidence and potential risk factors.
   Design. A cross-sectional study was performed in healthy newborns. Physical findings, anthropometric cranial measurements, and data on pregnancy and birth were recorded.
   Results. The incidence of localized cranial flattening in singletons was 13%; other anomalous head shapes were found in 11% of single-born neonates. In twins, localized flat areas were much more frequent with an incidence of 56%. The following risk factors for cranial deformation were identified: assisted vaginal delivery, prolonged labor, unusual birth position, primiparity, and male gender.
   Conclusion. We propose that localized lateral or occipital cranial flattening at birth is a precursor to posterior deformational plagiocephaly. The infant lies supine, with the head turned to the flattened area, and is unable to roll. Intrauterine risk factors for localized cranial flattening are the same as for deformational plagiocephaly. To avoid postnatal progression from a localized cranial flattening to posterior-lateral deformational plagiocephaly, we suggest amending the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics on sleep position: Alternate the head position and allow sleeping on the side and, when awake, supervise prone time.

AB The sleep EEGs and fatigue of 9 female family caregivers (age M = 65 yr.) and 9 female noncaregivers (age M = 67 yr.) were measured during two successive nights at their houses. Perceived quality of sleep was measured by the Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Fatigue was measured by a self-rated questionnaire, the Perceived Symptoms of Fatigue, and by critical flicker fusion (CFF) frequency. The caregivers had a significantly higher percentage of Stage 1 and a lower percentage of Stage 2 during the 2nd cycle and a higher percentage of Stages 3+4 during the 3rd cycle than those of the noncaregivers. Caregivers had significantly higher percentages of EEG waves of 7-9 Hz in the 1st cycle and 6-9 Hz in the 2nd cycle and significantly lower percentages of 2-3 Hz in the 1st cycle than those of the noncaregivers. The caregivers reported a lower quality of sleep and higher perceived fatigue symptoms and also lower CFF frequency (increased physiological fatigue) than noncaregivers. The caregivers' sleep EEGs were associated with their higher sleep needs and fatigue.

AB Down's syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation and although known for more than a hundred years, the underlying pathomechanisms for the phenotype and abnormal brain functions remain elusive. Performing protein hunting in fetal Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) brain we detected aberrant expression of several proteins. Fetal brain cortex from controls and Down's syndrome at the early second trimester of gestation was used for expressional analysis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis with subsequent in-gel digestion of spots and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization spectroscopical identification followed by quantification of spots with specific software was applied. The nuclear matrix protein matrin 3, cytoskeletal motor protein HMP, and the circadian clock protein hlark were significantly decreased in fetal DS brain. C8ORF2 protein was reduced but did not reach statistical significance. Prox1 and predicted protein Dj149A16.6 were comparable between groups. Reduction of brain proteins may represent or cause deficient cytoskeletal structure, transcription machinery and exocytosis, functions already known to be deteriorated in DS brain. Some of the described proteins were only predicted and we here show the existence of the corresponding proteins in fetal human brain.

   MOTHERS; INTERVENTIONS; CONTINUITIES; ADOLESCENCE
AB This article describes infant mental health from two perspectives: why it is relevant and how to implement interventions, including preventive ones. Topics covered are based on evidence available in scientific literature. The first section addresses areas that justify the importance assigned to infants and their emotional well-being. One of them deals with new information about brain development. Recent available information emphasizes the crucial role of sensory/experiential input for the development of the brain in terms of determining the formation of new synapses, influencing cell migration and the "pruning" of refined and dedicated neuronal pathways. Experiences (exposure to language, contingent responses by the caregiver, motion in space) influence the development of the brain. Also, negative and anxiety provoking events as well as psychological trauma cause a negative outcome through this effect. Prolonged and/or severe trauma has been shown to influence negatively the functioning of the limbic system and the capacity of the child to feel empathy and/or compassion, to regulate emotions and to learn new information.
   New evidence is reviewed from longitudinal research. Several studies have demonstrated that it is possible to "trace back" which elements are necessary during early childhood, to put a child at a high risk of becoming a criminal or severe offender. These include attributes in the child him or herself (restlessness, impulsiveness, lack of fear) together with a history of maltreatment and chronically adverse experiences. Excessive shyness is another fairly persistent trait from early infancy to adulthood. Since these "risk factors" are known, particular children could he targeted for early intervention programs.
   A follow up study conducted by some of the authors with infants seen in a mental health clinic and followed up to age four, indicates that the strongest predictor of the outcome and functioning of the child at age four is not the severity or type of problems for which the child was originally evaluated. The strongest predictor was the quality of parenting and parenting behaviors of the caregivers as assessed during infancy. This finding suggests the importance of helping parents as early as possible to cope with infant problems in a benign and sensitive way, before negative circles of interaction are entrenched and spiral into an ongoing negative relationship.
   Together with the studies of risk, those focusing on resilience are summarized. Knowing which traits or experiences are protective against psychopathology is crucial, in order to promote their flourishing in early childhood. Studies with children at high psychosocial risk from Kauai, Hawaii as well as with children from other groups in the world converge in describing resilient traits in early childhood: an easy temperament, a "social orientation", sense of humor, attractiveness and the ability to communicate with others, as well as intelligence. Several experiences are protective, such as having few separations from the mother and having had a sibling when the index child was at least three years old. This knowledge can be used to promote resilient features in children and to develop interventions for those at most risk.
   Epidemiological evidence suggests that infancy disturbances are not rare, but frequent (15 to 20% of the population). Studies of the prevalence of problems like feeding and sleeping disturbances, excessive crying and disruptive behavior in infancy point in this direction. This justifies the need for early recognition and identification, particularly when they are severe. Excessive crying increases the risk of the child being abused or shaken; likewise sleep disturbance is associated with irritability and hyperactive behavior in the infant. Parents who are deprived of sleep are prone to be more negative and to feel exhausted. Eating disturbances can be associated with failure to thrive. Early malnutrition has been associated with hypertension in middle age, as well as with a higher risk of coronary disease. Maternal depression and domestic violence are rampant in the perinatal period. Maternal depression is associated with more crying and sleeping problems in infancy, and hyperactivity and negative behavior in the school age child.
   The findings of a survey in a "well-baby clinic" (health surveillance clinic) conducted by some of the authors concur in the finding that parents are worried about their baby's behavior in all these areas and that they readily identify the problems, when asked. Furthermore, their worries are justified. This is in sharp contrast with the tendency in most pediatric settings to "wait and see" hoping that problems in the baby will be solved by themselves.
   The second part of the review focuses on two issues: techniques of clinical intervention and preventive strategies and their results. There is scant scientific evidence on the efficacy of parent infant psychotherapies. Techniques vary widely in their content and their focus or target population. Strategies like brief parent-infant psychotherapy and the therapeutic consultation are framed psychodynamically and focus on the transgenerational transmission of "fantasmatic" interactions and projections placed on the infant. These appear more suitable for families that are relatively healthier and lacking massive stressors. On the other side of the spectrum, techniques such as interactive guidance and infant-parent psychotherapy are designed for families under more stress, and when the parent child relationship is very negative.
   These strategies are used with "unreachable families".
   Interactive guidance attempts to focus on what the parents are doing well through a videotaped feedback given to them, and gradually expanding their repertoire of sensitive and empathic behaviors towards the baby. Infant-parent psychotherapy is long term and involves interventions that are non traditional, like psychotherapy at home, practical help to the parents, and the promotion of a long term relationship of trust between the caregivers and the therapist. The focus is to achieve a "corrective attachment experience" in the parents, which will in turn render them more sensitive and responsive towards their baby. Multimodal and flexible techniques are advocated in order to tailor the intervention to the particular needs and style of each family
   Finally, evidence on the effectiveness of various prevention programs is reviewed. These are grouped according to the timing of the intervention, from pregnancy to toddlerhood. Evidence suggests that improving marital communication and promoting conflict resolution before the baby is born may enhance maternal sensitivity and lead to a more secure attachment in the infant. There is research on interventions in the perinatal period. These include having psychosocial support during the delivery process. In addition, "bonding" between newborn and mother (without undue intrusion by health care personnel) has positive effects. This involves skin to skin contact and early breast-feeding. These simple interventions have been shown to promote maternal sensitivity, more patience and less behavioral difficulties several months later. The mere demonstration of the abilities of the newborn, his or her uniqueness and preferences as well as an observation of the baby's perceptual abilities, is associated with long term positive behavioral effects. All this points to the importance of conducting an intervention during a "sensitive period". Several meta-analytic studies on home visitation conclude that these programs are most effective if the intervention has a clear focus, is brief and practical help and advice are given to the parents on site. 13 7 contrast, with families having a high risk of abusing their child, home visitations are the only hopeful strategy so far. In this case, home visitation should be long-term and also focused on specific problem solving with parents and suggestion of alternative strategies of behavior management with the child. In families under considerable stress home visitation, together with the opportunity to have positive experiences for the infant, in the form of a good day care setting, also have a lasting and beneficial effect several years later, in terms of better academic performance, reduced psychopathology and better parent child relationships.

DE Arousal; Sleep; Sudden infant death syndrome; Infant; Prone position;
   Smoking; Prematurity; Infection
AB Background: Failure to arouse from sleep has been postulated as a mechanism to explain the final pathway of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Methods: We have reviewed the effects of the major risk factors for SIDS, prone sleep position, maternal smoking, prematurity and recent infection on arousability from sleep. In human infants it has been consistently demonstrated that arousal from sleep in response to a variety of stimuli is more difficult to induce from quiet sleep (QS) compared to active sleep (AS) over the first 6 months of life.
   Results: In the prone position both stimulus-induced and spontaneous arousability from both QS and AS were impaired at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months, but not at 5-6 months of age in both term and preterm infants. In term infants exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy both stimulus-induced and spontaneous arousability were impaired when infants slept supine in QS at 2-3 months of age. Healthy preterm infants showed no impairment in arousability compared with term infants at matched postconceptional ages. However, preterm infants with a history of apnoea and bradycardia of prematurity showed decreased arousal responses in both QS and AS and this impairment was positively correlated to their 'perinatal risk score'. Infants who had recently suffered an infection requiring hospitalization showed decreased arousability in QS on the day of discharge when compared to 2 weeks later when they were completely well.
   Conclusions: In summary it has been found that the major risk factors for SIDS identified from epidemiological studies also decrease arousability from sleep in infants. We propose that this decreased arousability from sleep may be involved in the final pathway of SIDS. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rare association of Cushing's syndrome and pregnancy is explained by the amenorrhea and sterility inherent to the syndrome. In the literature, 125 cases have been reported: 30 cases of early diagnosis and 95 others diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy.
   At the start of pregnancy When hypercorticism exists before pregnancy it is hardly secretory. Its diagnosis, at an early stage, is not hindered by the hormone modifications of pregnancy. Its aetiological treatment raises the problem of the compatibility in pursuing the latter.
   In the second half of pregnancy The positive and aetiological diagnoses of Cushing's syndrome are difficult and its prevalence may therefore be underestimated. The evocative clinical signs are unspecific: excessive weight gain, hypertension of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. The 24-hour free hypercortisoluria and the absence of dexamethasone inhibition are of little diagnostic value after the 14th week of amenorrhea. The positive diagnosis therefore relies essentially on the abolition of the circadian rhythm of cortisol. The biological hyperandrogenia commonly observed is not discriminating. Adrenal aetiologies are frequent. Imaging must be performed to eliminate an adrenocortical tumor.
   Prognosis The maternal prognosis depends on the hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes and the complications of Cushing's syndrome. It depends on the activity of the hypercorticism and its early aetiological treatment, which must not be delayed after pregnancy. The foetal prognosis depends on the maternal prognosis. It is represented by preterm delivery, hypotrophy and death of the foetus in utero. The therapeutic management must be symptomatic and aetiologic, maternal and obstetrical.

AB Background: The etiology of infant colic remains unknown, despite an abundance, of research on the topic.
   Objective: To determine whether breastfeeding has a protective effect in colic's development.
   Design: A prospective cohort study of 856 mother-infant dyads. Eligible participants included English-speaking adult residents of a region in Ontario, who gave birth, at term, to a live singleton whose birth weight was appropriate for gestational age. Self-administered questionnaires, mailed to mothers at 1 and 6 weeks post partum, requested information on several infant and maternal factors, including source of infant nutrition (exclusively breastfed, complementary fed, and exclusively formula fed). Cases of colic were identified by applying modified Wessel criteria to data recorded in the Barr Baby Day Diary or by interpreting responses to the Ames Cry Score.
   Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of colic among breastfed, formula-fed, and complementary-fed infants; and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) reflecting the prevalence of colic among formula- and complementary-fed infants relative to those who were breastfed.
   Results: Of 856 mothers, 733 (86%) completed the first questionnaire and 617 (72%) completed the second questionnaire. Overall, the prevalence of colic at 6 weeks was 24%. No association Was seen between the source of infant nutrition and colic's development. In multivariate analyses, higher levels of maternal trait anxiety (AOR, 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.54), maternal alcohol consumption at 6 weeks (AOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.03-2.40), and shift work during pregnancy (AOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.73-2.21) were associated with an increased likelihood of colic, after controlling for feeding method, maternal age, and parity. In these same analyses, being married or having a common-law partner (AOR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.87) and being employed full-time during pregnancy (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.32-1.14) were associated with a reduced likelihood of colic.
   Conclusions: Breastfeeding did not have a protective effect on the development of colic. Although colic was statistically associated with several variables, including preexisting maternal anxiety, much of colic's etiology remains unexplained.

TI The effect of hospitalisation on ambulatory blood pressure in pregnancy
SO AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HYPERTENSION; TERM
AB Methods
   Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed on 40 women (20 hypertensive, 20 normotensive) on a hospitalised and nonhospitalised day. Mean blood pressure differences were calculated for the awake, sleeping and 24-hour periods on both days.
   Results
   Mean heart rate was higher at home (1.79, p = 0.04) than in hospital, but there were no significant differences in mean systolic (1.30 mmHg, p = 0.06), diastolic (0.78 mmHg, p = 0.21) or mean arterial blood pressure (0.81 mmHg, p = 0.19) between the hospitalised and non hospitalised day for the group overall. Nevertheless, the range of individual responses was wide (8.5 mmHg to 15.4 mmHg mean arterial blood pressure). Hypertensive women receiving antihypertensive therapy had significantly greater differences in mean arterial blood pressure between the hospital and non-hospital day when compared to the rest of the group (5.8 mmHg, compared to 3.3 mm Hg, p = 0.02).
   Conclusions
   Although hospitalisation does not significantly lower blood pressure in pregnant women as a group, women receiving antihypertensive therapy demonstrate significant differences in blood pressure between hospital and home. Based on conventional blood pressure measurements alone, these women may be at risk of either under treatment, or over treatment, of blood pressure.

AB Adult female Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) spend 84% of their lifetime either sleeping underground at night during the active season or hibernating underground. To assess their use of subterranean sites, 46 females were radiocollared for periods ranging from a few days to 4.5 years. Adult females typically slept in 6-11 different chambers throughout the 15-week active season and used a single site for the 37-week hibernation season. For the 1st half of the active season, which encompassed mating, pregnancy, and lactation, squirrels usually slept in 5-6 different chambers, with each sleep site generally used once for a prolonged period of consecutive nights. In contrast, in the latter half of the active season, females moved back and forth between 5-6 sleep sites. For both females that did and did not wean a litter, this switch in sleep-site usage occurred abruptly, about 40 days before entry into hibernation. Females always slept in the future parturition chamber for some or all of gestation, and they always continued to sleep in the parturition site for some or all of lactation. In contrast, adult females never slept in the future hibernation site on any night during the preceding active season. Only 50% of the females used the hibernaculum for sleeping after hibernation, and then only for 1-5 nights. The marked contrast in prior usage of the parturition site and hibernation site indicates that the hiber-naculum chamber of adult female Richardson's ground squirrels is dedicated to the forthcoming hibernation period, whereas the parturition site is a multipurpose chamber used for sleeping during gestation, for parturition, and for sleeping and litter rearing during lactation.

AB This study, conducted on female black bears from 3 study areas in the Rocky Mountains, showed that pregnant females in a state of diapause during early winter had about 89% larger fat depots than did nonreproductive females going into hibernation. Fat provided 92% of the total energy for lactation and gestation. Rates of fat loss (g/day) were 37% greater and protein loss about 2.4 times higher for reproductive females than for nonreproductive females. The cost of winter reproduction, including gestation and lactation, was 1,432 kJ/day to produce 2 young. Although reproduction required elevated protein breakdown, rates of overall protein loss were relatively small, perhaps due to a short period of implantation and an extraordinary ability to hydrolyze urea.

AB The study aimed to assess potential relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and behavioural characteristics in 2 - 4-month-old infants. It covered period from 1999 to 2000 and comprised 250 randomly selected, apparently healthy singleton born infants from community setting (129 boys, 121 girls). The mothers were asked to complete the questionnaires addressing infant, maternal, demographic major characteristics with particular emphasis on maternal smoking during pregnancy. To objectively assess behavioural peculiarities of the infants, the mothers were requested to complete the Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire. Of 250 mothers, 64. women (25.6%) smoked during pregnancy. The infants of smoking mothers were more often born low birth weight and were also lighter at study; more frequently they were born at earlier gestational age, had lower Apgar score at 5th minute, were less frequently breast fed at birth and at the time of study. Mothers who smoked during pregnancy were younger, had lower educational level, and less frequently were married. The infants born to smoking mothers had more frequent fussy periods occurring at about the same time of the day, protesting behaviour at face washing and washing in bath, indifferent attitude to the mother when held by new person, extreme reactions (either indifference or much feeling) during diapering and bowel movement, less attention to the parents during parent-infant play activity, and more sensitivity to the wet diaper. They were also characterised by more intensive reactions (displayed more amount of energy regardless of positive or negative behaviour) compared with the babies from the non-smoking group. This association remained after adjustment has been made for major potential confounders, and had a significant "dose-response" effect. Maternal smoking during pregnancy may serve as a risk factor for infant's behavioural deviations.

AB Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) victims were regarded as normal as a matter of definition (Beckwith 1970) until 1952 when Kinney and colleagues argued for elimination of the clause, "unexpected by history." They argued that "not all SIDS victims were normal," and referred to their hypothesis that SIDS results from brain abnormalities, which they postulated "to originate in utero and lead to sudden death during a vulnerable postnatal period." Bergman (1970) argued that SIDS did not depend on any "single characteristic that ordains a infant for death," but on an interaction of risk factors with variable probabilities. Wedgwood (1972) agreed and grouped risk factors into the first "triple risk hypothesis" consisting of general vulnerability, age-specific risks, and precipitating factors. Raring (1975), based on a bell-shaped curve of age of death (log-transformed), concluded that SIDS was a random process with multifactorial causation. Rognum and Saugstad (1993) developed a "fatal triangle" in 1993, with groupings similar to those of Wedgwood, but included mucosal immunity under a vulnerable developmental stage of the infant. Filiano and Kinney (1994) presented the best known triple risk hypothesis and emphasized prenatal injury of the brainstem. They added a qualifier, "in at least a subset of SIDS," but, the National Institute of Child Health and Development SIDS Strategic Plan 2000, quoting Kinney's work, states unequivocally that "SIDS is a developmental disorder. Its origins are during fetal development." Except for the emphasis on prenatal origin, all 3 triple risk hypotheses are similar.
   Interest in the brainstem of SIDS victims began with Naeye's 1976 report of astrogliosis in 50% of all victims. He concluded that these changes were caused by hypoxia and were not the cause of SIDS. He noted an absence of astrogliosis in some older SIDS victims, compatible with a single, terminal episode of hypoxia without previous hypoxic episodes, prenatal or postnatal.
   Kinney and colleagues (1983) reported gliosis in 22% of their SIDS victims. Subsequently, they instituted studies of neurotransmitter systems in the brainstem, particularly the muscarinic (1995) and serotenergic systems (2001). The major issue is when did the brainstem abnormalities, astrogliosis, or neurotransmitter changes occur and whether either is specific to SIDS. There is no published method known to us of determining the time of origin of these markers except that the injury causing astrogliosis must have occurred at least 4 days before death (Del Bigio and Becker, 1994). Because the changes in neurotransmitter systems found in the arcuate nucleus in SIDS victims were also found in the chronic controls with known hypoxia, specificity of these markers for SIDS has not been established. It seems likely that the "acute control" group of Kinney et al (1995) died too quickly to develop gliosis or severe depletion of the neurotransmitter systems. We can conclude that the acute controls had no previous episodes of severe hypoxia, unlike SIDS or their "chronic controls." Although the average muscarinic cholinergic receptor level in the SIDS victim was significantly less than in the acute controls, the difference was only 27%, and only 21 of 41 SIDS victims had values below the mean of the acute controls. The study of the medullary serotonergic network by Kinney et al (2001) revealed greater reductions in the SIDS victims than in acute controls, but the questions of cause versus effect of the abnormalities, and whether they occurred prenatally or postnatally, remain unanswered.
   Hypoplasia of the arcuate nucleus was stated to occur in 5% of their SIDS cases by Kinney et al (2001), but this is a "primary developmental defect" according to Matturri et al (2002) with a larger series, many of whom were stillbirths. These cases should not be included under the rubric of SIDS, by definition.
   There are difficulties with Filiano and Kinney's (1994) explanation of the age at death distribution of SIDS. They postulate that the period between 1 and 6 months represents an unstable time for virtually all physiologic systems. However, this period demonstrates much less instability than does the neonatal period, when most deaths from congenital defects and severe maternal anemia occur. We present data for infants born to mothers who were likely to have suffered severe anemia as a consequence of placenta previa, abruptio placentae, and excessive bleeding during pregnancy; these infants presumably are at increased risk of hypoxia and brainstem injury. The total neonatal mortality rate in these 3 groups of infants is 4 times greater than the respective postneonatal mortality, and in the postneonatal period the non-SIDS mortality rate is between 14 and 22 times greater than the postneonatal SIDS rate in these 3 groups. A preponderance of deaths in the neonatal period is also found for congenital anomalies, a category that logically should include infants who experienced prenatal hypoxia or ischemia; this distribution of age of death is very different from that for SIDS, which mostly spares the first month and peaks between 2 and 3 months of age.
   Finally, evidence inconsistent with prenatal injury as a frequent cause of SIDS comes from prospective studies of ventilatory control in neonates who subsequently died of SIDS; no significant respiratory abnormalities in these infants have been found (Waggener et al 1990; Schectman et al 1991).
   We conclude that none of the triple risk hypotheses presented so far have significantly improved our understanding of the cause of SIDS. Bergman's and Raring's concepts of multifactorial causation with interaction of risk factors with variable probabilities is less restrictive and more in keeping with the large number of demonstrated risk factors and their varying prevalence. If prenatal hypoxic damage of the brainstem occurred, it seems likely that the infant so afflicted would be at risk for SIDS, but it is even more likely that their death would occur in the neonatal period, as we have demonstrated in infants who have known maternal risk factors that involve severe anemia. This is in contrast to the delay until the postneonatal period of most SIDS deaths. A categorical statement that the origin of SIDS is prenatal is unwarranted by the evidence. Brainstem abnormalities have not been shown to cause SIDS, but are more likely a nonspecific effect of hypoxia.

AB The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the generation and entrainment of circadian rhythms. Similar to other structures, it develops throughout gestation but is still immature for some time after. This suggests that the SCN could be vulnerable to maternal influences, such as poor nutrition, stress and drugs, all of which can affect neuronal development. Evidence is accumulating that suggests that this is the case, with body size at birth influencing melatonin production in adult humans and maternal malnutrition, and stress affecting sleep in rodents. Interestingly, the maternal environment affects the phase of rhythms and the response of the circadian timing system to light pulses. The nature of these changes in adult rhythmicity is similar to those commonly associated with depression in humans. Thus, abnormal fetal programming might predispose adults to depressive illness.

TI Position of the abomasum in dairy cows during the first six weeks after
   calving
SO VETERINARY RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; DISPLACEMENT; DIET
AB The position of the abomasum in six cows was examined by ultrasonography at regular intervals for six weeks after they had calved. Its position was established by determining the distance between the margin of the left side of the abomasum and the ventral midline at two sites. During the last weeks of pregnancy, the abomasum was positioned in a small region of the left ventral side of the abdominal cavity. At parturition it was positioned high on the left side and then descended. The abomasum was furthest from the midline immediately after parturition. Its position was related to the interval after calving, the cow's feed intake, and the pH and osmotic pressure of the rumen fluid. There was considerable variation between the cows in the position of the abomasum, which was in part due to analytical variation, and in individual cows it had a circadian rhythm.

AB Background/rationale. Preterm infants in mechanical ventilation are vulnerable and may manifest physiological instability and a disorganized behavioural state when responding to external stimuli. Adequate positioning strategies may play an important role in protecting infants from environmental stressor and assisting quality of sleep. However, no study has examined effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch responses for ventilated preterm infants during the critical first week postbirth.</x>
   Aim of the study. The purpose of this study was to compare effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress responses in mechanically ventilated preterm infants.
   Design/methods. The infants were aged 25-36 weeks of gestation, less than or equal to 7 days of age, and without sedation or congenital abnormalities. Using a crossover design, 28 infants were randomly assigned to supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. Behavioural state and frequencies of stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch were systemically recorded and analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance.
   Findings. Infants when prone compared with supine had (a) less crying, less active sleep, and more quiet sleep states, and (b) fewer stress responses of startle, tremor, and twitch.
   Conclusion. Results indicate that prone positioning improves the quality of sleep and decreases stress for ventilated preterm infants during the first week postbirth. These may conserve energy and assist infants' extrauterine adaptation.

AB The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has dropped significantly in most countries following the development of education campaigns on the avoidance of risk factors for SIDS. However, questions have been raised about the physiological mechanism responsible for the effects of these environmental risk factors. Since 1985, a series of prospective, multicentric studies have been developed to address these questions; over 20,000 infants were recorded during one night in a sleep laboratory and among these, 40 infants eventually died of SIDS. In this review, the following methods were employed: sleep recordings and analysis, monitoring procedure, data analysis of sleep stages, cardiorespiratory and oxygen saturation, scoring of arousals, spectral analysis of the heart rate and the determination of arousal thresholds, and statistical analysis and the results including sleep apneas, arousals and heart rate and autonomic controls in both future SIDS victims and normal infants were introduced separately. In addition, the physiological effect of prenatal risk factors (maternal smoking during gestation) and postnatal risk factors (administration of sedative drugs, prone sleeping position, ambient temperature, sleeping with the face covered by a bed sheet, pacifiers and breastfeeding) in normal infants were analyzed. In conclusion, the physiological studies undertaken on the basis of epidemiological findings provide some clues about the physiological mechanisms linked with SIDS. Although the description of the mechanisms responsible for SIDS is still far from complete, it appears to involve both arousal responses and cardiac autonomic controls during sleep-wake processes.

AB Background: The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the developing fetal central nervous system (CNS) and related functional outcomes in infancy remain unexplored. Sleep and wake states of newborns provide a tool for assessing the functional integrity of the CNS.
   Objective: We investigated whether CNS integrity in newborns, measured with sleep recordings, was associated with maternal concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA.
   Design: Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured in 17 women at parturition. On postpartum day 1 (PI) and day 2 (P2), a pressure-sensitive pad under the infants' bedding recorded body movements and respiratory patterns to measure sleep and wake states.
   Results: Maternal plasma phospholipid DHA ranged from 1.91% to 4.5% by wt of total fatty acids. On the basis of previously published data and the median DHA concentration, the women were divided into 2 groups: high DHA (> 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids) and low DHA (less than or equal to 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids). Infants of high-DHA mothers had a significantly lower ratio of active sleep (AS) to quiet sleep (QS) and less AS than did infants of low-DHA mothers. Furthermore, the former infants had less sleep-wake transition and more wakefulness on P2. Correlations of maternal DHA status with infant sleep states were consistent with these data. Also, the ratio of maternal n-6 to n-3 fatty acids on P I was inversely associated with OS and positively associated with arousals in QS. On P2, maternal n-6:n-3 was positively associated with AS, sleep-wake transition, and AS:QS.
   Conclusion: The sleep patterns of infants born to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether a history of maternal tobacco smoking affected the maturation of arousal responses and whether sleeping position and infant age alters these relations.
   Design: Healthy term infants (13 born to mothers who did not smoke and I I to mothers who smoked during pregnancy) were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) two to three weeks after birth, (b) two to three months after birth, and (c) five to six months after birth. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold in response to air jet stimulation were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine.
   Results: Maternal smoking significantly elevated arousal threshold in QS when infants slept supine at 2-3 months of age (p<0.05). Infants of smoking mothers also had fewer spontaneous arousals from QS at 2-3 months in both prone (p<0.05) and supine (p<0.001) sleeping positions. In infants of non-smoking mothers, arousal thresholds were elevated in the prone position in AS at 2-3 months (p<0.01) and QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and 2-3 months (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Maternal tobacco smoking significantly impairs both stimulus induced and spontaneous arousal from QS when infants sleep in the supine position, at the age when the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome is highest.

AB Although infants have been noted to have greater relative right or left frontal EEG as early as the neonatal period, other ways in which these newborns differ have not been reported. In this study, 48 newborns were divided on the basis of greater relative right versus greater relative left frontal EEG to determine whether these groups differed in other ways at the neonatal period including behavior physiology, and biochemistry. We also were interested in whether these EEG patterns were related to any prenatal maternal variables including mood states (depression, anxiety, anger) and biochemistry as well as fetal activity. The greater relative right frontal EEG newborns had mothers with lower prenatal and postnatal serotonin and higher postnatal cortisol levels. The mothers of the greater relative right frontal EEG newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. The greater relative right frontal EEG newborns themselves had elevated cortisol levels, showed a greater number of state changes during sleep/wake behavior observations, and performed less optimally on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment (T B. Brazelton, 1973) including the habituation, motor, range of state, excitability, and depressive symptoms scales. These data suggest that greater relative right frontal EEG newborns may be at greater risk for developmental problems than those with greater relative left frontal EEG activation. In addition, a discriminant function analysis correctly classified 67% of the newborns' EEGs by prenatal maternal variables, suggesting that these might be used to target pregnant women for prenatal intervention.

AB It is estimated that at least 1 in 10 women will experience postpartum depression, yet systematic screening for it in clinical practice is too often neglected. The foggy unreality of this affective disorder leads women to believe they are losing their minds, and their efforts to find help can be elusive. Women with postpartum depression who go undetected and untreated are at risk for immediate harm and potential lifelong sequelae for themselves and their families, and especially for their children. This article provides 1) an understanding of the woman's experience of postpartum depression, 2) a review of two instruments, developed through a focused program of research to screen for the disorder, 3) triage in clinical practice, and 4) an overview of the three dimensions of treatment: psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, and psychosocial care. Practical guidance and client information are provided to assist midwives and primary care providers to incorporate systematic screening into clinical practice, to identify effective interdisciplinary treatment teams, and to muster family and community resources to help with this commonly hidden childbearing crisis.

ID SATISFACTION; LABOR; BIRTH
AB Objective: to describe women's experiences and perceptions of their first pregnancy.
   Design, setting and participants: a qualitative study, using grounded theory. Data were obtained from 13 women whose interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Interviews were conducted in the women's homes on three occasions during pregnancy.
   Findings: the women's experiences were varied and diverse. Most had difficulty coping with the physical and emotional symptoms of pregnancy. Loss of control caused anxiety. Need for support emerged as important. Antenatal education classes were favourably commented upon, however, the women wanted more information on breast feeding, baby feeding/sleeping patterns and behaviour, and self-care.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: midwives committed to a wellness, woman-centred model of care and willing to provide continuity of care should endeavour to implement this model in the hospital environment. Teaching in the ward or childbirth/parenting programmes should not be compromised by midwives who believe that pregnant women cannot learn. A comprehensive review of the philosophy, content, delivery and evaluation of current childbirth/parenthood programmes should be undertaken. Also, a review of the qualifications and aptitude of educators conducting the programmes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Organisms have developed endogenous mechanisms for keeping track of time which allow them to adjust to environmental changes. Entrainment of endogenous rhythms to the day-night cycle is of elementary importance for the regulation of physiological processes. How environmental changes influence the manifestation of cicradian rhythms during intrauterine and extraurterine growth depend on complex networking of molecular, physiological and sensory mechanisms. This work reports on development of circadian rhythms in the infant, with particular emphasis on the roles of times cues to which the infant is exposed.
   Subjects and Methods: Activity data of 12 families were continously recorded during the first 4 months after birth using noninvasive actigraphs. Recordings of parental activity started at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, Time series analysis was used to investigate the periodic structure of the data. In addition, we review the literature on the ontogenesis of circadian rhythms in humans.
   Results: During the 3rd trimester, daily variation of physiological functions in the fetus showed a high degree of correspondence with maternal circadian rhythms. Early behaviour of most infants was highly variable between individuals but could be asigned to different entrainment patterns. Good correspondence of mother-infant activity patterns during the early postnatal period, when the infant was not yet entrained to the day-night-cycle, was correlated with the rapid development of an entrained daily pattern in the infant a few weeks later.
   Conclusion: Understanding the emergence of periodic structures at physiological and behavioural level during human ontogenesis will be an asset in the successful intervention and treatment during neonatal care.

AB The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that prenatal hypoxia in rats might lead to consistent changes in the entrainment of the circadian clock by light. Pregnant female rats were placed in a chamber provided with hypoxic gas (10 % O-2-90 % N-2) at gestational day 5 and returned to normoxia before delivery. Once adult, rats born to hypoxic mothers had significant alterations in their circadian rhythm of locomotor activity (recorded in freely accessible running wheels). Under a regular 12/12 light/dark (LD) cycle, they showed a phase advance of their rhythm of activity (mean phase advance of 87 min) and were less active than control rats. After an abrupt 6 h phase delay in the LD cycle, rats from the prenatal hypoxic group (PNH) took significantly more time to resynchronise to the new LD cycle compared to controls (+53 %; 6.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 0.5 days respectively). Under constant darkness, PNH and control rats had a similar period of activity (24.27 +/- 0.20 vs. 24.40 +/- 0.13) but the response of PNH rats to a light pulse in the early subjective night was less marked than that of control rats (101 +/- 9 vs. 158 +/- 13 min). When submitted to acute restraint stress, PNH rats had a prolonged secretion of corticosterone compared to controls. These results indicate that prenatal hypoxia is a factor that has long lasting consequences for the functional output of the biological clock and the hormonal response to stress.

AB Back-ground: This paper is part of a prospective, epidemiologic study concerning postpartum depression (PPD). The women were first examined during pregnancy; after delivery they were seen with their infants at 3 and 18 months. The present study focuses on the 3-months-postpartum results. Methods: A sample of 570 women and their infants were examined 3 months after delivery. Using the EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale: Cox et al., 1987. Br. J. Psychiatry 150:782-786), 10.2% of these new mothers presented PPD. The focus of the study concerned the effects of this neurotic disorder on the mother, the infant and on the mother-infant relationship. Results: The deleterious effects concerning the infant were functional disorders such as eating or sleeping difficulties. The `depressed' dyads presented less vocal and visual communications, less corporal interactions and less smiling. Conditions surrounding delivery and tiredness at 3 months are linked to difficulties in mother-infant relationship for the non-depressed mothers. Logistic models showed that primiparous PPD mothers have difficulties bathing their infants, whereas multiparous PPD mothers are more tired. Limitation: This study did not take into account either protective factors or the effects of the infant himself. Clinical relevance: Knowledge of the mothers' and infants' difficulties may help caregivers to detect these at-risk dyads and initiate therapeutic measures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We report results of the first longitudinal study of outcome correlates of parent-child bedsharing. Two hundred five families in nonconventional and conventional family lifestyles have been followed since 1975. A target child in each family was followed from the third trimester of mother's pregnancy through age 18 years. Bedsharing in early childhood was found to be significantly associated with increased cognitive competence measured at age 6 years, but the effect size was small. At age 6 years, bedsharing in infancy and early childhood was not associated with sleep problems, sexual pathology, or any other problematic consequences. At age 18 years, bedsharing in infancy and childhood was unrelated to pathology or problematic consequences, nor was it related to beneficial consequences. We discuss these results in light of widespread fears of harm caused by parent-child bedsharing. We suggest that such fears are without warrant if bedsharing is practiced safely as part of a complex of valued and related family practices.

AB CASE. Christine, a 4-month-old infant, is brought to the office for a health supervision visit by her mother, a 30-year-old emergency-room nurse. The mother, who is well known to the pediatrician to be a competent and attentive caregiver, appears uncharacteristically tired. They are accompanied by the 18-month-old and 4-year-old siblings because child care was unavailable, and her husband has been out of town on business for the last 5 weeks. When the pediatrician comments, "You look exhausted. It must be really tough to care for three young children," the mother appears relieved that attention was given to her needs. She reports that she has not been getting much sleep because Christine wakes up for two or more evening feedings and the toddler is now awakening at night. During the day, she juggles nursing the baby, caring for her other two young children, and managing the household. Although visibly fatigued and mildly depressed, the mother appears comfortable holding Christine; the baby likewise appeared closely attached. The mother has no concerns regarding Christine's health or development.
   During the physical examination, Christine is a slightly thin but active and alert infant. She has no remarkable or focal physical findings; her muscle strength, tone, and reflexes are normal. She achieves all motor, social, and language milestones for a 4-month-old infant. Plotting her height and weight on the growth chart, the pediatrician and mother were surprised to see that her weight (lid not change in 2 months, and her linear growth decelerated slightly. The growth measurements were repeated and corroborated. In the office, Christine was a vigorous feeder, latching onto the full areola quickly. During the nursing session, she studies her mother's face, cooed, and reached out for the breast with her free hand. The mother reports that breastfeeding occurs every 4 to 5 hours for at least 10 minutes on each breast. Her urine output and bowel movements are normal, and she did not have a history of vomiting or excessive regurgitation. The mother's diet and fluid intake seem adequate.
   A review of past medical history does not reveal an explanation for Christine's failure to gain weight. She was born full term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. Her birth weight was 8 pounds. She was nursing vigorously by the time of discharge from the hospital. At her 2-week and 2-month health supervision visits, her weight and linear growth and developmental milestones were normal. In addition, at those visits she was observed to respond quickly to visual and auditory cues. There was no family history of serious diseases.
   In that a comprehensive history and physical examination did not indicate an organic cause, the pediatrician reasoned that the most likely cause of her failure to thrive was an unintentional caloric deprivation secondary to maternal stress and exhaustion. Christine's mother and the pediatrician discussed how maternal stress, fatigue, and depression could hinder the let-down reflex and reduce the availability of an adequate milk supply, as well as make it difficult to maintain regular feeding sessions. The pediatrician recommended obtaining help with child care and household responsibilities. The mother was also encouraged to consume adequate fluids, eat high protein foods, nurse more frequently, and offer a formula supplement after nursing three times a day.
   At the same time that these therapeutic interventions were initiated, screening laboratory studies were obtained. All results were normal including a complete blood cell count with differential; serum electrolytes, creatinine, hepatic transaminase (ATL), total protein, and albumin; urinalysis; and stool fat stain and occult blood. A serum thyroxine was normal (6.3 mug/dL). A plan was made for Christine to return to the office in 1 week.

ID INFANTS; MOTHERS; BEHAVIOR
AB The questions addressed in this study were whether prenatal depression effects on the foetus and neonate varied by ethnicity and socio-economic status. Eighty-six depressed pregnant women were compared by ethnic group, Hispanic and African-American, and by socio-economic status (upper/lower) on prenatal and neonatal outcome variables. The Hispanic mothers were older, had a higher SES and had higher prenatal norepinephrine levels. Their foetuses were also more active. At the neonatal period they had higher anger scores, but also higher serotonin levels, and their infants had higher dopamine and lower cortisol levels and they spent less time in deep and indeterminate sleep. The comparison by middle/lower socio-economic status revealed that the middle SES group was older, had more social support and showed less depressed affect but had higher norepinephrine levels prenatally. At the postnatal period the middle SES mothers had lower depression, anxiety and anger scores and lower norepinephrine levels. Their infants also had lower norepinephrine levels, fewer postnatal complications and were less excitable on the Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale.

TI Physician beliefs and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction
SO CLINICAL PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; PRONE SLEEP POSITION; SMOKING; PREGNANCY
AB The AAP has alerted pediatricians to the importance of safe sleep environment for infants. The elements of a safe sleep environment include supine sleep position, safe crib, and avoidance of smoke exposure, soft bedding, and overheating. With the Back to Sleep campaign, prone sleeping among all U.S. infants has decreased to less than 20%, and the incidence of SIDS has decreased 40%. However, the decline in SIDS and prone sleeping has leveled off in recent years. Further declines may be possible with decreasing other modifiable risk factors, such as prenatal and postnatal exposure to cigarette smoking. Prior studies have demonstrated that health care professional advice is influential in determining infant care practices. It is important that physicians caring for infants be aware of the importance of a safe sleep environment and understand other modifiable risk factors for SIDS. We surveyed a random sample of 3,717 physicians in North Carolina and the metropolitan Washington, DC, area to determine knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction among physicians caring for pregnant women and infants. Twenty-three percent (835) responded. Most physicians are aware of prone sleeping and cigarette smoke exposure as risk factors for SIDS. Almost all physicians agree that there are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS, and they consider it important to discuss SIDS and SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents of young infants. In spite of this belief, only 56% of family/general practitioners, 18% of obstetrician-gynecologists, and 79% of pediatricians discuss SIDS routinely. Only 35% of pediatricians, 15% of family/general practitioners, and 16% of obstetrician-gynecologists provide written information. In addition, only 38% of physicians recommend supine, while 50% recommend side or back, 6% side, and 7% prone. Only two thirds of pediatricians and one third of family/general practitioners are aware that the AAP recommends supine as the preferred sleep position for infants. Pediatricians are more likely to be aware of the AAV recommendation (p<0.0001) and to discuss SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents (p=0.03). We conclude that many physicians who care for infants are unaware of the AAP's most current recommendation for sleep position and are incorrectly recommending the side position. Physicians may also be unaware of other sleep environment hazards. Further educational efforts must continue for physicians who provide care to pregnant women and children to ensure a continued decline in the incidence of SIDS.

AB Interest in cobedding multiple-gestation infants has grown as focus has increased on the developmental approach to the care of the neonate. Little data, however, exist on the infants' response to cobedding. It is important to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and physiologic impact of this practice. Cobedding was offered to parents of twin infants < 37 weeks gestation, without arterial lines or ventilator requirements, by the health care team according to standard practice in our nursery. After parental informed consent, infants were placed on an event-recording cardiorespiratory monitor for 12 hours before cobedding and for the first 12 hours of cobedding. Recordings were evaluated by an investigator blinded to the bedding status of the infant. Apnea (a pause of respiration > 10 seconds, central apnea), bradycardia (a decline in heart rate to < 80 beats per minute), periodic breathing (a respiratory pattern in which there are &GE; 3 pauses in respiration of &GE; 3 seconds with < 20 seconds of breathing between pauses), adverse events (changes in medication, changes in oxygen requirements, temperature instability, the need for sepsis evaluation, or death) were evaluated. Other physiologic parameters were obtained through the use of standard bedside monitoring. Eleven sets of preterm infants, n = 22, with a mean gestation of 31.8 +/- 2.9 weeks and a mean birth weight of 1,698.7 +/- 552.0 grams were studied. Infants were evaluated at a corrected gestational age of 33.5 +/- 1.9 weeks and a mean weight of 1,713.2 +/- 484.0 grams. The number of events of central apnea before cobedding (57) was greater than those recorded during cobedding (18), p<0.05. There was no difference found in any of the other parameters compared. The numbers of events recorded before and during cobedding were compared by Student's t-test and significance was determined by p < 0.05. No adverse events (AE) were noted, and all infants remained cobedded throughout the study. This preliminary study suggests that cobedding of healthy preterm twins showed no increase in adverse events. Of the physiologic parameters studied, only the occurrence of central apnea changed with cobedding. This decrease in central apnea may reflect a change in sleep pattern due to more frequent arousal by the twin. Alternatively, a more regular breathing pattern may reflect a positive physiological response to contact between twins.

AB Background: This article is a critical review of the efficacy of selected alternative treatments for unipolar depression including exercise, stress management techniques, acupuncture, St. John's wort, bright light, and sleep deprivation. Issues related to women across the life span, including pregnancy and lactation, are highlighted.
   Data Sources: Evidence of efficacy is based on randomized controlled trials. A distinction is made between studies that address depressive symptoms and studies that address depressive disorders. The review emphasizes issues related to effectiveness, such as treatment availability, acceptability, safety, and cost and issues relevant to women.
   Data Synthesis: Exercise, stress reduction methods, bright light exposure, and sleep deprivation hold greater promise as adjuncts to conventional treatment than as monotherapies for major depression. The evidence to date is not sufficiently compelling to suggest the use of St. John's wort in favor of or as an alternative to existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-regulated compounds. Initial evidence suggests that acupuncture might be an effective alternative monotherapy for major depression, single episode.
   Conclusion: This review indicates that some unconventional treatments hold promise as alternative or complementary treatments for unipolar depression in women and have the potential to contribute to its long-term management. Additional research is needed before further recommendations can be made, and there is an urgent need to carefully document and report the frequency of minor and major side effects.

AB It has been proposed that prostaglandin (PG) D-2 induces physiological sleep in mammals by acting on sleep centers located in the anterior hypothalamus. In fetal sheep, definitive rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep states appear at similar to125 d gestation (term is similar to147 d). In adult animals, PGD synthase (PGDS) (functionally and structurally homologous to beta-trace protein) is secreted into CSF with a circadian pattern, with the highest concentrations present during sleep. In this study we show that PGDS/beta-trace protein is present in fetal sheep CSF at 125 and 135 d gestation but not at 90 d gestation. SeCl4, a specific inhibitor of PGDS, was given to unanesthetized fetal sheep (130-140 d gestation) by intracerebroventricular infusion at a dose of 25, 100, 500, or 1000 pmol/min for 4 hr. Artificial CSF was infused in control experiments. Arousal behavior, defined as the presence of nuchal muscle electromyogram activity, electro-ocular activity, and breathing movements during low-amplitude electrocortical activity, increased from 3.8 +/- 1 min/hr to 6.6 +/- 0.5 and 7.0 +/- 0.3 min/hr at doses of 100 and 500 pmol/min, respectively (p < 0.05). SeCl4 at 25 and 1000 pmol/min had no significant effect on arousal activity. Infusion of PGD(2) at 500 pmol/min intracerebroventricularly for 4 hr decreased the incidence of arousal from 3.8 +/- 0.5 min/hr to 0.7 +/- 0.3 min/hr (p < 0.05). When 500 pmol/min PGD(2) was infused immediately after a 4 hr infusion of SeCl4 (500 pmol/min), the SeCl4-induced increase in arousal behavior was abolished. Together, the presence of PGDS/beta-trace protein in fetal CSF in late gestation and the effects of SeCl4 in increasing the incidence of arousal-like behavior suggest that PGD(2) has a role in the induction and maintenance of prenatal sleep.

AB End-organ damage associated with hypertension is more closely related to ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) than clinic or casual blood pressure measurements.
   ABP measurements give better prediction of clinical outcome than clinic or casual blood pressure measurements.
   The technique of ABP monitoring (ABPM) is specialised; validated monitors and appropriate quality control measures should be used.
   Interpretation of ABP profile should include mean daytime, night-time (sleep) and 24-hour measurements, and consideration of diary information and time of drug treatment. Reports may also include ABP "loads" (percentage area under the blood pressure curve above set limits) for daytime and night-time periods.
   Normal blood pressure values for adults are <135/85 mmHg for daytime, <120/75 mmHg for night-time, and <130/80 mmHg for 24 hours.
   ABPM is indicated to exclude "white coat" hypertension and has a role in assessing apparent drug-resistant hypertension, symptomatic hypotension or hypertension, in the elderly, in hypertension in pregnancy, and to assess adequacy of control in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.
   White coat hypertension requires continued surveillance; patients who display this phenomenon may, in time, develop established hypertension.
   Appropriate use of ABPM may result in cost savings.
   Randomised controlled trials comparing management based on clinic or casual versus ABP measurements are needed.

AB Aims: To assess the effects of breast feeding habits on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Methods: The analyses are based on data from the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study, a case-control study in which parents of SIDS victims in the Scandinavian countries between I September 1992 and 3 1 August 1995 were invited to participate, each with parents of four matched controls. The odds ratios presented were computed by conditional logistic regression analysis.
   Results: After adjustment for smoking during pregnancy, paternal employment, sleeping position, and age of the infant, the adjusted odds ratio (95% Cl) was 5.1 (2.3 to 11.2) if the infant was exclusively breast fed for less than four weeks, 3.7 (1.6 to 8.4) for 4-7 weeks, 1.6 (0.7 to 3.6) for 8-11 weeks, and 2.8 (1.2 to 6.8) for 12-15 weeks, with exclusive breast feeding over 16 weeks as the reference. Mixed feeding in the first week post partum did not increase the risk.
   Conclusions: The study is supportive of a weak relation between breast feeding and SIDS reduction.

AB Thalidomide was first introduced to the market in Germany under the brand name of Contergan in 1956, as a "non-barbiturate hypnotic", advocated to ensure a good night's sleep and to prevent morning sickness in pregnancy. It was advertised for its prompt action, lack of hangover, and apparent safety. It has been banned from the market si lice 1963 after it caused the worldwide teratogenic disaster: babies exposed to thalidomide in Utero during the first 34-50 days of pregnancy were born with severe life-threatening birth defects. Despite its unfortunate history, thalidomide has attracted scientific interest again because of its recently discovered action against inflammatory diseases and cancer. Its broad range of biological activities stems from its ability to moderate cytokine action in, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Early studies examined its anxiolytic, mild hypnotic, antiemetic, and adjuvant analgesic properties. subsequently, thalidomide was found to be highly effective in managing the cutaneous manifestations of leprosy, being superior to Aspirin in controlling leprosy-associated fever. Recent research has shown promising results with thalidomide in patients with myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, a variety of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and progressive body weight loss related to advanced cancer and AIDS. Here we review the history of its development, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, biologic effects, and the results of clinical trials conducted thus far. Further research in this field should be directed towards better understanding of thalidomide metabolism, its mechanism of action, and the development of less toxic and more active analogs.

AB Background The lack of nocturnal decline in blood pressure has been associated with an increase in end-organ damage and cardiovascular events, although results remain controversial, partly because of the inability to reproduce correctly, over time, the classification of patients into dippers and non-dippers. Moreover, the non-dipping status has been frequently related to an increase in nocturnal activity, differences in quality of sleep, or both.
   Objective To assess the relationship between activity and blood pressure in patients with hypertension.
   Methods We studied 306 mild-to-moderately hypertensive patients (130 men), 53.7 +/- 14.0 years of age (mean +/- SD). Blood pressure and heart rate were measured for 48 consecutive hours, at 20-min intervals during the day and at 30-min intervals at night, using an ambulatory device, and physical activity was simultaneously evaluated at 1 min intervals by wrist actigraphy. Circadian parameters of blood pressure, heart rate and activity established by population multiple-components analysis were compared between dippers and non-dippers, by non-parametric testing. Diurnal and nocturnal means of blood pressure and activity were computed for each patient according to individual resting hours determined by actigraphy, and compared among groups by analysis of variance.
   Results Despite highly statistically significant differences between dippers and non-dippers with respect to nocturnal means and in each hourly nightly mean of blood pressure, there were no differences between them for the same parameters during activity, whether or not the patients were receiving medication at the time of monitoring. The average duration of sleep and the 24-h mean and standard deviation of activity were also similar between the groups.
   Conclusions The highly significantly different circadian variation in blood pressure between dippers and non-dippers with essential hypertension is not related to a significant increase in nocturnal physical activity. Differences in blood pressure could, however, be related to the absence of 24-h therapeutic coverage in most non-dipper patients receiving antihypertensive medication.

It was found that total sleep time shortened, sleep efficiency decreased, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) increased in the weeks immediately after delivery. Compared with late pregnancy, total sleep time and sleep efficiency deteriorated significantly from the delivery week to the 12th post-partum week and there was a longer period of WASO until the 11th postpartum week. The after-delivery sleep parameters estimated by the actigraph were worse than those estimated from sleep logs.

AB Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a crucial cytokine for establishing pregnancy. It has been demonstrated previously in rats that sleep increases during early pregnancy and that centrally administered GM-CSF promotes both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Therefore, whether GM-CSF is involved in pregnancy-enhanced sleep was investigated using the anti-GM-CSF antibody. Female rats received an intracerebroventricular infusion of either anti-GM-CSF or control IgG (10 mug each) for four nights from the first day of pregnancy (PD1-PD4). Although sleep amounts on PD1 were not affected, anti-GM-CSF decreased non-REM and REM sleep significantly during PD2-PD4 compared with the control baseline of the IgG group. The results demonstrated that anti-GM-CSF treatment suppresses pregnancy-enhanced sleep, suggesting that GM-CSF contributes to sleep regulation during pregnancy.

ID BEHAVIORAL STATES
AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the association between fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram patterns during overnight sleep.
   STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected prospectively between December 1, 1999, and June 30, 2001. Initially, the participating patients were asked to complete a 66-question survey for the assessment of maternal perception of sleep quality that was referred to as the sleep disturbance score: a continuous score from 0 (no evidence of sleep disturbance) to 110 (extreme sleep disturbance). Second, a subgroup of patients was monitored overnight by concomitant fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram tracings. Statistical analysis included the Student t test, chi(2) test, logistic regression, and Cramer's V contingency correlation.
   RESULTS: One hundred two singleton pregnancies formed the study population. The mean sleep disturbance score was 26.7 +/- 9.9. Maternal age was the only variable that correlated with sleep disturbance score. A subgroup of 11 patients was studied overnight. A significant correlation between active fetal sleep and maternal wakefulness was demonstrated in 6 patients. The mean sleep disturbance score for these patients was significantly higher than for patients without such correlation (P = .04).
   CONCLUSION: This study establishes an association between fetal activity and maternal wakefulness, which explains many of the maternal awakenings during sleep in the third trimester.

AB This review highlights recent studies investigating the role of prostaglandin (PG)D-2 in reproduction. PGD(2) induces sleep, allergic responses, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and relaxation of vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle, and has some roles in reproduction.
   Two types of PGD(2) synthase are known. Lipocalin-type PGD synthase is present in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma and may play an important role in male reproduction. Another PGD synthase, hematopoietic PGD synthase is present in the spleen, fallopian tube, endometrial gland cells, extravillous trophoblasts and villous trophoblasts, and perhaps plays an important role in female reproduction. Recent studies demonstrate that PGD(2) is probably involved in multiple aspects of inflammation through its dual receptor systems, DP and CRTH2. CRTH2 but not DP is a chemo-attractant receptor for PGD(2). Interestingly, CRTH2 is a most reliable marker for the detection of human T helper type 2 (Th2) and T cytotoxic type 2 (Tc2) cells, and the percentages of CRTH expressing CD4(+)-T cells and CD8(+)-T cells were significantly higher in the decidua especially at the implantation site, suggesting that Th2 and Tc2 cells recruit into the materno-fetal interface, in a PGD(2)-mediated manner. PGD(2) has a very unique effect to inhibit antigen presentation by inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) migration through DP but not CRTH2. PGD(2) might appear to contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy by controlling the Th1/Th2 balance and antigen presentation by DCs through its dual receptor systems, CRTH2 and DP.

AB To determine the effect of Ob/Gyn residents' fatigue and training level on the accuracy of their clinical and ultrasonographical estimation of fetal weight (EFW).
   Methods: In this study, clinical and ultrasonographical EFWs were performed by various residents. Actual birth weight, gravidity, parity, gestational age, body mass index, presence or absence of diabetes and hypertensive diseases, presentation and amniotic fluid index were recorded. All EFWs were divided into 3 groups according to the hour they were performed. All residents were divided into 4 groups according to their training level. The accuracy of EFW as compared with actual birth weight was then analyzed according to the shift and to the residents' seniority by using the ANOVA test. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the factors that significantly and independently affected the weight evaluation.
   Results: Statistically significant differences were found between the clinical EFW and the birth weight among the working shifts for birth weights of 2,600 g and more (p = 0.032 and p = 0.035). For clinical EFW, night shifts were the most inaccurate (9.27, 8.05 and 9.78% of error for day, evening and night shift, respectively; p = 0.03). The accuracy of ultrasonographical EFW was not affected by the residents' fatigue level. The residents' training level did not alter the accuracy of either clinical or sonographical EFW. The accuracy of clinical EFW was affected independently by the work shift (p = 0.01), whereas no factor was found to independently effect the accuracy of ultrasonographic EFW.
   Conclusions: Ob/Gyn residents' fatigue affects the accuracy of clinical but not ultrasonographical EFWs. Residents' training level does not alter either the clinical or sonographical EFW.

AB Subtle quantitative abnormalities in neuronal populations derived from the rhombic lip (i.e. arcuate nucleus at the ventral medullary surface, external granular layer of the cerebellum) have been reported in victims of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In this study, we examined the inferior olive, a major rhombic lip derivative, to determine if subtle rhombic lip abnormalities also involve this nucleus in SIDS. We analyzed the number and density of neurons and reactive astrocytes in the inferior olive in 29 SIDS cases and 29 controls. Computer-assisted cell counting procedure, were used in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin[Luxol fast blue. There was a significant difference in the postconceptionally age-adjusted mean for neuronal density between SIDS cases (7,687 +/- 255 neurons/mm(3)) and controls (8,889 +/- 255 neurons/mm(3)) (p = 0.002). The difference in age-adjusted mean neuronal number between SIDS cases (1,932 +/- 89 neurons/2 sections) and controls (2,172 +/- 89 neurons/2 sections) was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Reactive astrocytes were present in the inferior olive in SIDS cases, but their number, density, and developmental profile were not significantly different from that of control infants dying of diverse known causes. SIDS victims found dead in cribs, beds, and sofas, prone or supine had subtle olivary abnormalities, suggesting that affected infants are at risk in various sleeping situations. We propose that at least some SIDS victims experience intrauterine brainstem injury including the olivo-arcuato-cerebellar circuitry derived from the rhombic lip. These observations provide future directions for SIDS research concerning the role of early insults in pregnancy, the rhombic lip, and the interactions of the ventral medulla and cerebellum in cardioventilatory control.

AB This study investigated the relationships of the excretion of the melatonin metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, to prenatal, natal, and postnatal variables and its possible relation to psychomotor development. Nocturnal urinary excretion of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin was studied over a 13-hour period in 355 term infants at 8 weeks of age (n = 320) and 16 weeks of age (n = 96). Data on a variety of perinatal factors including pregnancy course, delivery, early postnatal course, birth weight, medical problems, growth (length, weight, and head circumference), and psychomotor development were collected at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months. The relationship between nocturnal 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion at 8 and 16 weeks of age and these factors was investigated and analyzed. 6-Sulfatoxymelatonin levels at 16 weeks of age were significantly lower in infants with abnormal vs normal development at 3 months of age (7.27 + 1.44 vs 7.97 + 1.06, P = 0.05) as well as at 6 months of age (7.15 + 1.29 vs 7.95 + 1.10, P = 0.04). No other significant relation was evident among growth, perinatal complications, medical problems, and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion at 8 weeks of age and at 16 weeks of age. Low melatonin excretion in the first weeks of life correlates with delayed psychomotor achievements at 3 and 6 months of age. This association suggests a causal or predictive link between melatonin and neurodevelopment in infants. (C) 2002 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE menstrual cycle; sexual behavior; lesbian; heterosexual
ID OVULATION
AB Using a prospective design over three complete menstrual cycles, 147 heterosexual and 89 lesbian women made daily recordings of their basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus status, menses, and completed a daily checklist of various sexual behaviors (including sexual self-stimulation and sexual activity with a partner). They also gave their age, height, weight, age at menarche, number of pregnancies, duration of sleep, tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol use. and whether they had a live-in sexual partner. Using BBT, cervical mucus status, and menses information, cycle days were grouped into five discrete phases: menses, follicular, ovulatory. early luteal, and premenstrual. Daily frequencies of sexual behavior with a partner and autosexual behavior were computed for each phase. Mixed ANOVAs on the resultant proportional data revealed similar patterns for autosexual behavior across the phases for both heterosexuals and lesbians who did not have a live-in partner, in which autosexual behavior was highest during the follicular and ovulatory phases. For those with live-in partners, autosexual behavior did not vary across the phases. Lesbians engaged in more autosexual behavior overall. Allosexual behavior peaked during the follicular phase for both heterosexuals and lesbians, and the phasic pattern was unrelated to live-in partner status. Additional analyses suggest that the observed patterns were unrelated to anticipated changes in sexual activity due to menses. Results are discussed in terms of social variables and hormonal fluctuation, associated with the menstrual cycle. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Late-gestation blockade of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) activity in pregnant mice produces discrete morphological abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of offspring, We investigated the functional implications of this lesion on the behavioural arousal response to moderate hypoxia. Pregnant mice received twice-daily injections of 200 mul saline (control), or saline + 50 mug VIP antagonist (anti-VIP) on embryonic days 17 and 18. Offspring were studied unrestrained at 6-7 weeks after birth, in a bias-flow whole-body plethysmograph during behavioural quiet sleep. Arousal was defined by movement (MVT) lasting greater than or equal to 1 s. Hypoxic ventilatory (HVR) and arousal responses were measured during a 5 min exposure to 10% O-2-3 % CO2 (hypoxia); peripheral chemoreflex drive was estimated by transient hyperoxia administered at rest and end-hypoxia (Dejours-type test). MVTs increased in all mice during hypoxia, but in anti-VIP mice: (a) MVT onset was delayed (174 +/- 90 vs. 108 +/- 59 s from the start of hypoxia, anti-VIP vs. control; P 0.008); and (b) MVTs were less frequent, and total MVT time in hypoxia was less (8 +/- 7 vs. 15 +/- 9 P = 0.03). The HVR, and peripheral drive at rest and end-hypoxia were comparable in control and anti-VIP mice. In conclusion, a significant arousal deficit was evident in anti-VIP mice. This was not associated with obviously deranged peripheral or brainstem-mediated responses to hypoxia during sleep. This may signal a general deficit in the way hypoxic distress is monitored and processed, and arousal initiated and sustained in these mice.

AB The pineal hormone melatonin is the mediator of external light to physiologic adaptation to day and night rhythms, it regulates reproduction in animals but attempts to utilize melatonin in women for contraception have failed. Melatonin seems to be the natural hormone to facilitate sleep in insomniac patients and causes no hang over. When applied together with benzodiazepine it allows reduction of benzodiazepine without withdrawal effects. It should be applied 2 h before sleeping time in doses between 3 and 5 mg. Melatonin acts via the gamma-aminobutyric acid- and benzodiazepine receptor explaining its success in treatment of seizures in children and in adults. Constant application of benzodiazepine reduced the production of natural melatonin in rats. supporting the evidence that long-term application of benzodiazepine in humans does not restore sleeping habits but reduces natural sleeping habits even more. Low melatonin levels were seen in bulimia or neuralgia and in women with fibromyalgia: replacement reduced pain, sleeping disorders, and depression in fibromyalgia and bulimia. Melatonin profiles are a diagnostic tool to distinguish between several forms of depression. like major depression, winter depression (SAD). unipolar depression. delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). In patients with a major depression success with antidepressants correlated with an increase in their melatonin profiles but only patients suffering from DSPS can be successfully treated with melatonin. In perimenopausal women melatonin administration did produce a change in LH. FSH and thyroid hormones. Some oncostatic properties are supported by cell culture work and Studies in animals. In Nordic countries indigenous people suffer less from breast and prostate cancer, v,,inter darkness seems to protect. The supposedly increased melatonin levels created the 'melatonin hypothesis'. Epidemiological studies did show that blind people indeed have half the rate of breast cancers, supporting the hypothesis. Controversial results concerning melatonin and insulin resistance and glucose tolerance have been published. In postmenopausal women application of melatonin reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Pregnant women should avoid melatonin, since its teratogenic effect is not known. Patients suffering from non-hormone dependent tumors. like leukemia, should avoid melanin, since tumor growth was promoted in animal experiments. It can be expected that melatonin will receive wide consideration for treatment of sleeping disturbances, jet lag, and fibromyalgia once an oral formulation becomes available in Europe.

AB By investigating 336 gynaecological patients we wanted to explore the question if there is any relationship between gynaecological and sexual problems.
   The women were investigated by a long structured biographic interview as well as questionnaires. Both the interview and the questionnaires focussed on the topics relationship, love and sexuality.
   The most enriching materials we got were the very intimate life-stories of these women. In addition to the clinical results we found out that 30% of our patients suffered from different sexual problems. There were no particular correlations between specific gynaecological and specific sexual problems. Nevertheless, there was high prevelance in sexual problems in women with chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis and adhesions.
   Also those women who suffered from complications during pregnancy suffered significantly more from sexual problems than the other women. Those who had experienced sexual violence complained twice as much as others of sexual problems. A highly significant result was that those women who suffered from gynaecological as well as sexual problems much more also suffered from psychosomatic problems such as gastrointestinal, anxiety, eating, body-image, depressive and sleeping disorders.
   Conclusion: There is a compelling need to talk about sexuality in the gynaecological field.

AB Objective : To assess the prevalence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) risk factors in the Indigenous and non-Indigenous community of Townsville, a large remote urban centre in north Queensland, Australia.
   Methods : Thirty Indigenous and 30 non-Indigenous women with young children were surveyed using sections of the West Australian Infancy and Pregnancy Survey 1997-1998 . The prevalence of SIDS risk factors was compared between the two groups and medians and univariate associations were generated where appropriate.
   Results : The Indigenous women were significantly younger and more likely to be single. The median age of the infants was 8 months (range 0.3-26 months) with no difference between the two groups. Thirty-seven per cent of Indigenous infants slept prone (cf. 17% of non-Indigenous infants; P = 0.03), and 77% shared a bed (cf. 13% of non-Indigenous infants; P < 0.001). The Indigenous households had significantly more members, with 57% including extended family members (cf. 20% non-Indigenous group; P = 0.003). Fifty-three per cent of the Indigenous women smoked during pregnancy (cf. 23% of non-Indigenous women; P = 0.017), 60% were smokers at the time of the interview, and smoking occurred inside 40% of Indigenous houses (cf. 20% and 20% for non-Indigenous women, respectively; P < 0.001, 0.09).
   Conclusion : This small survey suggests that the prevalence of SIDS risk factors is higher in the Indigenous population, and a new approach to education is needed urgently to promote SIDS awareness among Indigenous women.

AB Background: Children born of mothers who abused illegal substances during pregnancy can present with signs and symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome, including irritability, jitteriness, diarrhoea. Usually these symptoms appear from a few hours up to a few days after birth. It is frequently followed by a post-withdrawal period of several weeks duration with crying, excitability, sleep irregularities and feeding difficulties. The purpose is to report the presence of nystagmus in infants born from drug-addicted mothers. Methods: Five children born from drug-addicted mothers were examined. Results: Three children (case 1-3) presented with congenital horizontal pendular nystagmus. Two other children (case 4-5) presented with a peculiar transient horizontal nystagmus, lasting 6 months and 7 months respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, transient horizontal pendular nystagmus has never been reported in the literature. It was detected in two children who suffered from a post-natal withdrawal syndrome necessitating substitution therapy, including morphine. This may represent a form of morphine midbrain toxicity.

AB Objectives. The Back to Sleep campaign has been credited with recent declines in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome. Using survey data for the 1996-1998 birth cohorts, this epidemiologic study examines infant sleep position in a large, population-based sample.
   Data and Methods. Data concerning infant sleep position are drawn from the 1996-1998 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for 15 states. Weighted multiple logistic regression analysis is used to examine correlates of infant sleep position.
   Results. The prevalence of prone infant sleeping significantly declined between 1996 and 1998 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.63, 0.78]). African Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone, (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.33,1.59), and were less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.57). Hispanic/Latinos were less likely overall than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.95), but were also less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.87). Adherence to sleep position recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics increased sharply among Hispanic/Latino infants. Very low birth weight infants and infants in larger families were less likely to sleep in the recommended supine position. Infants born between 1001 and 1500 g (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.79), and extremely low birth weight infants between 500 and 1000 g (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.72) were especially unlikely to sleep supine. Infants in households with more than 3 other children (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.74) were more likely to sleep prone.
   Conclusions. The prevalence of supine infant sleep increased between 1996 and 1998. Low adherence to sleep position recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics among African Americans, very low birth weight infants, and infants in large families remain public health concerns.

TI Adverse effects of the antimalaria drug, mefloquine: due to primary

   PROPHYLAXIS; CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS; COMBINATION; TRAVELERS; REGIMENS; EVENTS;
   TOLERABILITY; CONVULSIONS
AB Background: Mefloquine is a clinically important antimalaria drug, which is often not well tolerated. We critically reviewed 516 published case reports of mefloquine adverse effects, to clarify the phenomenology of the harms associated with mefloquine, and to make recommendations for safer prescribing.
   Presentation: We postulate that many of the adverse effects of mefloquine are a post-hepatic syndrome caused by primary liver damage. In some users we believe that symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs, either independently or as a secondary consequence of the hepatocellular injury. The mefloquine syndrome presents in a variety of ways including headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness, fatigue, disorders of sleep, mood, memory and concentration, and occasionally frank psychosis. Previous liver or thyroid disease, and concurrent insults to the liver (such as from alcohol, dehydration, an oral contraceptive pill, recreational drugs, and other liver-damaging drugs) may be related to the development of severe or prolonged adverse reactions to mefloquine.
   Implications: We believe that people with active liver or thyroid disease should not take mefloquine, whereas those with fully resolved neuropsychiatric illness may do so safely. Mefloquine users should avoid alcohol, recreational drugs, hormonal contraception and co-medications known to cause liver damage or thyroid damage. With these caveats, we believe that mefloquine may be safely prescribed in pregnancy, and also to occupational groups who carry out safety-critical tasks.
   Testing: Mefloquine's adverse effects need to be investigated through a multicentre cohort study, with small controlled studies testing specific elements of the hypothesis.

ID PANIC DISORDER; NIGHT TERRORS; SLEEP; SLEEPWALKING; SOMNAMBULISM
AB Objectives - A survey of the effects of pregnancy on parasomnias. Material and methods - In an area of a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community, women were interviewed during and after their pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess the frequency of their parasomnias. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant. the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last one the 3 months after delivery. Altogether 325 mothers filled all the five questionnaires and constitute the study group. Results - The total number of parasomnias declined ( P < 0.001) during pregnancy and even more among the primiparas than among the multiparas (difference until third trimester, P = 0.02). Among various parasomnias reported. sleep talking and sleepwalking decreased from the prepregnant period to the second trimester (22.8 vs 12.6%, change P = 0.003), and the reported sleep starts also diminished from the prepregnant time to the first trimester (78.5 vs 63.1%. P < 0.001), but these phenomena did not change further during the follow-up. Altogether 55.7% of the women reported having nightmares 3 months before the pregnancy, and 47.7, 49.5, 41.2 and 40.3% (change from the prepregnant period, P < 0.001), respectively, at first, second and third trimester and after the delivery. Reported hypnagogic hallucinations decreased from the prepregnant time to the first trimester (9.8 vs 6.5%, P = 0.027), but returned thereafter to the previous level. During the prepregnant period, 25.8% of the women reported bruxism and only 19.9% during the first trimester (P = 0.009). Though the prevalence of sleep paralysis decreased during the first trimester of pregnancy, it was the only parasomnia that increased during later pregnancy (from 5.7 to 13.3% in the second trimester, P < 0.013). Conclusions - The reported frequency of most parasomnias decreases during pregnancy and even more in primiparas than multiparas.

AB Gasping is a critically important mechanism for autoresuscitation and survival during extreme tissue hypoxia. Evidence of antecedent hypoxia in sudden infant death syndrome suggests that intermittently occurring hypoxic episodes may modify gasping and autoresuscitation. To examine this issue, an intermittent hypoxia (IH) profile consisting of alternating room air and 10% O-2-balance N-2 every 90 s was applied to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (IHRA; n = 50) and to pups after a normal pregnancy (RAIH; n = 50) as well as to control pups (RARA; n = 50). At postnatal day 5, pups were exposed to 95% N-2-5% CO2, and gasping and the ability to auturesuscitate were assessed. Compared with RARA, IHRA- and RAIH-exposed pups had a reduced number of gasps, decreased overall gasp duration, and were less likely to autoresuscitate on introduction of room air to the breathing mixture during the last phase of gasping (P < 0.001 vs. RARA). We conclude that both prenatal and early postnatal IH adversely affect gasping and related survival mechanisms.

AB Fifty-two pregnant women recruited during their second trimester were given EEGs and divided into greater relative right and left frontal EEG activation groups. The greater relative right frontal EEG women had lower dopamine levels during their second trimester and lower dopamine and higher cortisol levels during the neonatal period. The newborns of the right frontal EEG mothers also showed greater relative right frontal EEG, had lower dopamine and serotonin levels, spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had inferior Brazelton scores. A discriminant function analysis based on the mothers' prenatal depression scores and biochemical measures correctly classified 74% of the women as greater relative right or left frontal EEG group members.

AB Malaria is a major cause of illness and an indirect cause of mortality in pregnant women. It can also cause stillbirths and low-birthweight babies. We have shown previously that pregnant women attracted twice as many Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the principal African malaria vector, as their non-pregnant counterparts over distances of about 15 in. In the current study (in 1998/99) we compared the short-range attractiveness of both pregnant and non-pregnant women sleeping under untreated bednets in Gambian villages. First, we measured the rate of mosquito entry under bednets and, second, we calculated the proportion of mosquitoes biting mothers under each bednet compared to their children. The feeding preference of An. gambiae collected under nets was determined by DNA fingerprinting blood samples from human subjects sleeping under each bednet and comparing these to fingerprints obtained from mosquito bloodmeals. Pregnant women were more attractive to An. gambiae mosquitoes than nonpregnant women under an untreated bednet. The number of mosquitoes entering bednets each night was 1.7-4.5 times higher in the pregnant group (P = 0.02) and pregnant women also received a higher proportion of bites under the bednets than did non-pregnant women (70% vs 52%, P = 0.001). This study clearly demonstrates that pregnant women are more exposed to malaria parasites than other women, which contributes to the greater vulnerability of pregnant women to malaria.

AB Objective-To measure intraocular pressure (IOP) and progesterone concentrations in cats and to examine their reproductive organs to determine whether reproductive status affects IOP in cats.
   Animals-75 sexually intact domestic shorthair cats scheduled to be neutered, including 28 males, 21 females not in estrus, 13 females in estrus, and 13 pregnant females.
   Procedures-Applanation tonometry was conducted to measure IOP and radioimmunoassay was used to determine progesterone concentrations. Reproductive organs were examined at time of surgery.
   Results-The IOP in female cats that were in estrus was significantly higher than IOP in female cats that were not in estrus. Progesterone concentrations significantly affected IOP in pregnant cats.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-In cats, IOP is affected by changes in reproductive status. Such changes should be considered when interpreting tonometry results in this species.

AB We investigated whether the mechanical properties of the respiratory system represent a major constraint to spontaneous breathing in the newborn tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii, which is born after a very short gestation (approximately 28 days, birth mass approximately 380 mg). The rate of oxygen consumption (V-O2) through the skin was approximately 33 % of the total V-O2 at day 1 and approximately 14 % at day 6. The mass-specific resting minute ventilation (V-E) and the ventilatory equivalent (V-E/V-O2) were approximately the same at the two ages, with a breathing pattern significantly deeper and slower at day 1. The mass-specific compliance of the respiratory system (C-rs) did not differ significantly between the two age groups and was close to the values predicted from measurements in eutherian newborns. Mass-specific respiratory system resistance (R-rs) at day 1 was higher than at day 6, and also higher than in eutherian newborns. Chest distortion, quantified as the degree of abdominal motion during spontaneous breathing compared with that required to inflate the lungs passively, at day 1 was very large, whereas it was modest at day 6. We conclude that, in the tammar wallaby at birth, the high resistance of the respiratory system and the distortion of the chest wall greatly reduce the mechanical efficiency of breathing. At this age, gas exchange through the skin is therefore an important complement to pulmonary ventilation.

AB Objective: To determine specific sleep characteristics in neonatal opiate withdrawal, referred to as the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), by measuring sleep efficiency, deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation in three groups: (i) healthy term neonates; (ii) opiate-exposed neonates who were treated for opiate withdrawal; and (iii) a group of opiate-exposed neonates who did not require treatment.
   Methods: A cohort study recording sleep patterns of neonates at 2-10 days of age (after 36 or more weeks of gestation) was carried out. Twenty-one neonates were exposed to opiates during pregnancy and 15 neonates were healthy controls. Sleep characteristics were predefined, and treated newborns were divided into early and stabilized treatment groups. Polygraphic recordings of sleep, movement and breathing were made continuously after a daytime feed.
   Results: Sleep deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation were found in newborns with NAS and were associated with the severity of the withdrawal. Neonates treated for NAS displayed increased wakefulness during early treatment (deprivation), but were similar to controls once stabilized. Both treated and non-treated groups had reduced amounts of quiet sleep (deprivation). Treated newborns showed an increase in indeterminate sleep (disorganization) and arousals-to-wakefulness (fragmentation).
   Conclusion: This study determined the exact nature and degree of sleep disturbances in newborns during acute opiate withdrawal. The findings contribute to a further understanding of the physiology underlying neonatal opiate withdrawal and suggest that some changes in sleep are due to opiate withdrawal but others may reflect opiate dependency in utero.

AB Behavioral and neurochemical effects of perinatal alcohol exposure (3% v/v solution from Day 15 of gestation to Day 7 after parturition) have been investigated in Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and alcohol-nonpreferring (sNP) rat lines, selectively bred for opposite alcohol preference and consumption. In an elevated zero-maze model of anxiety, sucrose-exposed sP rats (sP-S): (i) spent significantly less time on the open arms (TO); (ii) exhibited a significantly lower number of head dips (HDIPS); and (iii) showed a higher number of stretched attend-postures (SAP) than sucrose-exposed sNP rats (sNP-S) at 90 and 180 days of age. Pie two rat lines displayed different emotional reactivity in response to alcohol exposure. Subtle differences in sexual behavior and ultrasonic emission (latency to the first intromission and to the first 50 kHz call) were observed between sP-S and sNP-S rats. sP-alcohol exposed (sP-A) offspring exhibited a higher latency to the first intromission Man sNP-alcohol (sNP-A) treated rats. Moreover, a lower number of sP-A rats exhibited both intromission and ejaculation with respect to sNP-A animals. sP-S rats were significantly slower in recover of the righting reflex than sNP-S animals after a challenge dose of alcohol (3 g/kg, i.p.). Perinatal alcohol did not affect either onset or duration of sleep time in either line. Neurochemical experiments have shown that perinatal alcohol did not influence basal dopamine levels or amphetamine-induced dopamine increase in the prefrontal cortex of either sP or sNP offspring. These results, showing an endpoint-specific differential sensitivity of sP and sNP lines to perinatal low alcohol exposure, indicate that genetic factors could be responsible for selective susceptibility to behavioral alterations induced by developmental treatment with this drug of abuse.

AB During gestation, the perinatal neuroendocrine axis keeps clock time. In primates, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (biological clock in mammals), shows oscillatory function by midgestation. There is evidence in rodents that the mother, during pregnancy, entrains the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and newborn circadian rhythms. We are investigating the role of maternal melatonin as an entraining signal for the newborn circadian time-keeping system in the Cebus apella (New World non-human primate). Twenty-four hour rhythms of temperature and cortisol are present in the 4 days old C. upella newborn. Preliminary data suggests that inhibition of maternal melatonin by exposing pregnant females to constant light alters these rhythms. We have found binding sites for melatonin and expression of mRNA for Mei IA receptor in hypothalamus, kidney and testis. These preliminary results suggest that maternal melatonin may play a role in relating the perinatal circadian time-keeping system to environmental signals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of body position on sidestream, end- tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) wave measurements in maturing infants. Sidestream EtCO2 wave patterns were analysed longitudinally in 20 preterm infants (born at greater than or equal to 32 wk) at 32- 37 wk gestation, and in 39 full-term controls. Capnography measurements included maximal EtCO2, inspired CO2 and frequency of apnoea events (> 3 s) in the supine, supine with inclination, side and prone positions. Apnoea frequency decreased during maturation, and was less prevalent in the prone than in the supine and side positions in preterm as well as in term infants (p < 0.05). No clinically significant apnoea episodes were found in our cohort. EtCO2 in term infants was lower than that in preterm infants (p < 0.05) and was not affected by sleep position in the most premature (< 33 wk) and in term infants (> 36 wk). EtCO2 was higher in the prone position than in supine or side positions in infants between 33 and 35 wk gestation (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Short apnoeic episodes decrease during maturation, and are less prevalent in the prone position in maturing infants (32- 37 wk). Only modest changes in EtCO2 were recorded in the different positions during maturation.

AB The use of a set of new end points derived from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), in addition to the blood pressure (BP) values themselves, has been advocated to improve the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing hypertension and to evaluate a person's response to treatment. An adequate estimation of rhythmic parameters depends, however, on the ability to describe properly the circadian pattern of BP variability. The purpose of this study was to identify a simple model that could characterize sufficiently well the circadian pattern of BP in normotensive healthy volunteers sampled by ambulatory monitoring. We studied 278 clinically healthy Spanish adults (184 men), 22.7 +/- 3.3 yr of age, without medical history of hypertension and mean BP from ambulatory profiles always below 135/85 mmHg for systolic/diastolic BP, who underwent sequential ABPM providing a total of H 15 series of BPs and heart rates (HRs), sampled on each occasion at 0.5h intervals for 48 h. Subjects were assessed while adhering to their usual diurnal activity and nocturnal sleep routine, without restrictions but avoiding the use of medication. The circadian rhythm in BP and HR for each subject was established by multiple-component analysis. A statistically significant 24h component is documented for 97% of the BP profiles, with a significant second (12h) harmonic documented in 65% of the profiles. Other Ultradian harmonic components were significant in less than 20% of the profiles. A statistically significant increase in the coefficient of determination (percent of overall variability explained by the function fitted to the data) was only obtained after including the periods of 24 and 12 h for BP, and periods of 24, 12, and 6h for HR in the model components. Although other ultradian components can be demonstrated as statistically significant in a small percent of subjects, a rather simple model including only the two first harmonics of the 24h period describes sufficiently well, at the specified sampling rate, the circadian pattern of BP in normotensive subjects. Departure from this model could characterize overt pathology, as recently demonstrated in the diagnosis of preeclampsia.

AB To understand the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on the developing fetus, we studied the heart rate and the heart rate variability (HRV) in near and full term cocaine-exposed infants during quiet sleep supine and following orthostatic stress. 21 cocaine-exposed and 23 control infants were studied within 120 hours of birth. 30-minute segments of the electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded with the infant, horizontal followed by the infant in a 25degrees head-up tilt. The cocaine-exposed group, as compared with the control group, had a trend toward an increase in heart rate in the horizontal position and a significant increase in heart rate following the tilt. The frequency components of the heart rate were lower in the horizontal position and increased following the orthostatic stress. These results are consistent with the known pharmacological actions of cocaine and demonstrate the possible adverse neonatal effects of cocaine abuse during pregnancy.

AB Background: The pathogenesis of neonatal jitteriness (JT) remains unknown. Neonatal JT could be one of the symptoms associated with drug withdrawal syndrome due to maternal medication. To study the influence of chemicals and environment on brain development in the fetal period, Swaab and Mirmiran proposed "behavioral teratology". JT could be one of the targets for this concept. Swaab and Mirmiran postulated that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM sleep) is useful for studying behavioral teratology. Aim: We aimed to determine the neurophysiological alterations in infants with JT by investigating REM sleep. Study design: Sleep records were obtained three times for each of six jittery infants. The mothers of three infants had been on medication (either alpha-methyl dopa, reserpine or haloperidol) during pregnancy, whereas the mothers of the other three infants took no medication during pregnancy. REM sleep parameters (the amount of REM sleep against the total sleep time, newly designated indices-tonic inhibition index (TII) and phasic inhibition index-, and the incidences of gross movements, phasic chin muscle activity (PCMA), and bursts of rapid eye movements) in the six jittery infants were compared with those in age-matched controls. Results: Regardless of maternal medication, TIIs, which represent the shortening of PCMA during REM sleep, were higher in the jittery infants than in the controls, No other REM sleep parameters showed constant differences between the patients and controls. Conclusion: Release of the blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the fetal brain is considered to be critical for the occurrence of neonatal JT with elevation of TII. Since the abnormal elevation of TII continued after 6 months of age when our patients did not show JT anymore, we have to keep monitoring jittery infants from the standpoint of "behavioral teratology".

AB The objective of this study was to determine if maternal sleeping position around the time of implantation influences eventual placental implantation site. Between November 1997 and April 1999, women with singleton pregnancies between gestational ages of 15 and 20 weeks presenting for ultrasound examinations were prospectively queried regarding their usual position of sleep during early gestation. Dominant position of sleep was noted as prone, supine, right side, or left side. At ultrasound examination, placental location was categorized as (1) fundal, (2) left high, (3) right high, (4) anterior high, (5) posterior high, (6) anterior low, (7) posterior low, (8) right low, (9) left low, or (10) central low. During the 18 months of this study, data were obtained from 1,500 patients. At the time of conception, front or prone sleeping was the most common (497 of 1,500, 33.1%), followed by right side (439 of 1,500, 29.3%) and left side (360 of 1,500, 24%), with the back being the least frequent position of sleep (204 of 1,500, 13.6%). Women who usually slept supine at the time of conception and implantation were significantly more likely to have a high or fundal placental location compared with those who usually slept in the prone position (p = 0.041). In addition, women who slept exclusively on their right side early in pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a right-sided placental location compared with women who slept exclusively on their left side (p = 0.025). The data from this investigation indicate that sleeping position early in gestation may influence the ultimate placental implantation site.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific pregnancy and labour and delivery events that may increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). A matched case-control study was conducted in Five counties in southern California, using California death certificate records. The sample consisted of 239 Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic and Asian mothers of SIDS infants and 239 mothers of control infants matched on sex, race, birth hospital and date of birth. Mothers participated in a detailed telephone interview and provided access to obstetric and paediatric records. More case than control mothers reported a family history of anaemia (OR = 2.12, P < 0.001). Placental abruptions were strongly associated with SIDS (unadjusted OR = 7.94, [95% CI 1.34,47.12]). There was an increased risk of SIDS death associated with maternal anaemia during pregnancy (OR = 2.51, [95% CI 1.25,5.03]), while simultaneously adjusting for maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal years of education and age, parity, infant birthweight, gestational age, medical conditions at birth, infant sleep position and post-natal smoking. Interactions of anaemia and prenatal smoking as well as anaemia and post-natal smoking were not statistically significant. There were no other statistically significant differences between case and control mothers for pregnancy conditions, labour and delivery events (e.g. caesarean sections, anaesthesia, forceps) or newborn complications (e.g. nuchal cord, meconium aspiration). Anaemia and placental abruptions were significantly associated with all increased risk of SIDS; both are circumstances in which a fetus may become hypoxic, thereby compromising the subsequent growth, development and ultimate survival of the infant.

AB Objective. In part 1 of this investigation, we demonstrated that children of multiple birth pregnancies are at higher risk for development of deformational plagiocephaly. In the current investigation, we explore whether certain prenatal and postnatal risk factors predispose one twin over the other by examining the occurrence and severity of plagiocephaly in both discordant (only 1 affected) and concordant (both affected) twin pairs.
   Methods. Throughout 1999, we obtained detailed medical histories on 140 sets of twins who had presented for treatment at 1 of 9 treatment centers across the United States. The study cohort consisted of 46 concordant and 94 discordant twin pairs (a total of 280 study participants). Information about prenatal and postnatal history of each infant was obtained through detailed review of the children's medical records as well as analysis of a patient database maintained on all infants who receive treatment. Follow-up interviews were performed to verify the information recorded and to obtain additional information about the child who had not received treatment (if appropriate) or use of reproductive assistance (fertility drugs, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, etc) that had not been previously recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the effects of prenatal and postnatal risk factors (in utero position, in utero orientation, birth weight, neck involvement, sleeping position) with respect to which infant was affected in the discordant twin pairs and to which infant was more severely affected in the concordant twin pairs.
   Results. Statistical analyses of both discordant and concordant twin pairs demonstrated that the lower in utero infant was significantly more likely to be affected (chi (2) = 17.391). In addition, the more severely affected infant was significantly more likely to have some form of neck involvement (torticollis, neck tightness; chi (2) = 46.380), as well as have been carried in a vertex position (chi (2) = 7.408). Conversely, neither sleeping position nor gender was found to be associated with development of plagiocephaly.
   Conclusions. The results of this investigation strongly support an in utero cause of plagiocephaly and demonstrate that intrauterine positioning may play a prominent role in determining both the occurrence and severity of deformational plagiocephaly in twins. These findings confirm that the lower in utero infant is at increased risk for the development of plagiocephaly, likely resulting from the more restrictive intrauterine environment encountered during the later part of the pregnancy.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB It was hypothesized that intermittent umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) would inhibit ovine fetal breathing movements (FBM) in association with increased cerebral adenosine levels. To test this hypothesis, on two successive days during late gestation (133-134 days; term=146 days), microdialysis samples were collected from the brains of 10 chronically instrumented fetal sheep during 2-h periods of complete UCO induced every 30 min (Day 1: 2-min UCOs; Day 2: 4-min UCOs). Control fetuses (n=10) underwent no UCO. Tracheal pressure was measured throughout. This regimen resulted in a decrease in fetal arterial PO2 (PaO2) during each UCO to 7.3+/-0.8 mmHg (P<0.01; Day 1) and 8.4&PLUSMN;1.1 mmHg (P<0.01; Day 2). Throughout each UCO period, fetal arterial pH (pHa) decreased to 7.28+/-0.02 (P<0.01; Day 1) and 7.11&PLUSMN;0.07 (P<0.01; Day 2). The hourly incidence of FBM decreased significantly only on Day 2, from 38.6+/-4.1% to 4.1+/-1.6% (P<0.01). The frequency of deep isolated inspiratory efforts increased from 4.7&PLUSMN;2.0 h(-1) to 17.6&PLUSMN;6.1 h(-1) (P<0.05; Day 1) and from 2.2+/-0.9 h(-1) to 33.6+/-4 h(-1) (P<0.01; Day 2). The amplitude of both FBM and deep isolated inspiratory efforts increased during the UCO periods on both days. The concentration of cerebral extracellular fluid (ECF) adenosine during UCO increased by 219&PLUSMN;215% (P<0.05; Day 1) and 172+/-107% (P<0.05; Day 2) over the baseline periods. In conclusion, the severity of the inhibitory effect of repeated UCO on FBM depends, in part, on the length of the occlusions. The inhibition of FBM during intermittent UCO may be mediated by the increase in ECF adenosine in the fetal brain. Furthermore, FBM and deep isolated inspiratory efforts appear to be regulated by different mechanisms.

ID CIGARETTE-SMOKING; ADOLESCENTS
AB Aims: This study was carried out to investigate how the locus of control (LOC) varies between those who stop smoking in connection with pregnancy and those who do not. The LOC reflects the extent to which a person is in control of her or his life events. Methods: One hundred and two women who were regular smokers at the time of conception and paid their first visits to the antenatal clinic (ANC) on account of the current pregnancy participated. The study was quantitative and questionnaire based. covering background factors, smoking habits, and the LOC. One hundred of the women were met a second time after the delivery. Smoking habits were monitored by the content of carbon monoxide in expired air. The LOC was recorded on a VAS scale (0-10). A lower index was consistent with a more internal LOC and a higher with a more external LOC. Results: The median LOC found was 4.0 (range 1.1-7.9). The LOC was not correlated to the CO in expired air. Younger age was linked to a more internal LOC, while worse sleep was correlated to a more external LOC (p < 0.05). No differences were found between those who stopped smoking and those who did not. This was the case in both light and heavy smokers. Conclusion: The LOC does not seem to influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy.

AB To understand the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on the developing fetus, we studied the heart rate and the heart rate variability in near and full term cocaine-exposed infants in quiet sleep supine and following orthostatic stress. Methods: We studied 21 cocaine-exposed and 23 control infants within 120 hours of birth. Two 30-minute segments of the electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded and analyzed in the time and frequency domain; the first with the supine infant, horizontal followed by the infant in a 25degrees head-up tilt. Results: The cocaine-exposed group, as compared with the control group, had a trend toward an increase in heart rate in the horizontal position and a significant increase in heart rate following the tilt in the cocaine-exposed group. The frequency components of the heart rate were lower in the horizontal position and increased following the orthostatic stress. Conclusions: These results are consistent with the known pharmacological actions of cocaine and demonstrate the dangers of cocaine abuse during pregnancy.

AB Objectives: To survey the effects of pregnancy on mothers' sleep.
   Methods: Mothers were interviewed during and after pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess alterations in their sleep. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last the 3 months after delivery. The study was carried out in a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community. Altogether, 325 pregnant women completed all five questionnaires.
   Results: The total amounts of reported sleep and of nocturnal sleep increased significantly during the first trimester of pregnancy, began to decrease thereafter and were shortest during the 3 months after pregnancy. During late pregnancy expectant mothers over 30 years of age reported less sleep than those under 30. During the whole pregnancy, but increasingly toward the end of pregnancy, sleep became more restless and fragmentary and its subjective quality worsened, due at least partly to increased restless legs and nightly awakenings increasing with advancing pregnancy.
   Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, although total sleeping time increases. The amount of reported sleep begins to decrease in the second trimester. The frequency of reported sleep disturbances, such as restless legs syndrome and nocturnal awakenings, is maximum in the third trimester but is about normal within 3 months after delivery.

AB The use of urinary cortisol (UC) as an additional tool to evaluate sows welfare was assessed in two experiments. In a preliminary methodological experiment, the kinetics of cortisol excretion in urine was studied during an Adreno Cortico Trophic lion-none (ACTH) challenge test in 10 pregnant sows. In a second experiment, 96 primiparous sows of an experimental unit were assigned to two different housing systems: 48 animals were housed in individual pens (IP) and 48 animals in collective pens (CP) with 6 animals per pen, UC was measured at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy and compared with other welfare indicators such as behaviour or skin damage. In both experiments, UC was measured using a high pressure liquid chromatography assay. In experiment 1, UC was constant on the day before injection of ACTH, with no variations related to circadian rhythm. It began to rise 2 h after the injection, peaked between 2 to 5 h after then returned to the basal concentration on the day after the injection. In experiment 2, UC concentrations were not different between CP- and IP-housed sows but they were higher in sows exhibiting the less stereotypies in comparison with sows exhibiting the most stereotypies. The results of this study suggest that UC is a good indicator of acute stress, more convenient than plasma cortisol measurement since it is a non-invasive method avoiding restraint or catheterisation of sows. They also suggest that UC could also give additional information on the assessment of chronic stress and improve the evaluation of animal welfare if used in conjunction with other welfare indicators.

AB The North American clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) population is far from self-sustaining. Breeding success is poor and behavioral problems (i.e., fur-plucking. tail-chewing, excessive hiding or pacing, and intersexual aggression that results in mate killing) are common. This study was undertaken to investigate whether some of these problems may be indicators of chronic stress (as reflected by persistently elevated glucocorticoid levels) and whether they are associated with specific management factors. A fecal corticoid metabolite assay was validated to monitor adrenal activity in clouded leopards. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenges conducted in four clouded leopards established the biological relevance of the assay system. Fecal corticoid concentrations increased 14-fold above baseline within 24 hours after ACTH administration. Adrenal activity then was monitored in 72 (36 males 36 females) clouded leopards (65% of the North American Species Survival Plan population) during a 6-week period and compared to husbandry and behavior data. There was a significant (P < 0.01) gender difference in fecal corticoid concentrations, with females producing higher concentrations than males, Multiple regression analyses revealed negative associations (P < 0.01) between enclosure height, number of hours keepers spent with each animal per week, and corticoid concentrations. A positive correlation (P < 0.001) was found between the number of keepers caring for an individual and corticoid concentrations. Higher fecal corticoid concentrations (P <= 0.05) were measured in clouded leopards kept on public display or near potential predators compared to individuals maintained off exhibit or in the absence of predators. Individuals that performed self-injuring behaviors also had elevated fecal corticoids (P < 0.01). Spearman-rank, correlation analysis of keeper ratings and hormone data revealed positive associations (P less than or equal to 0.05) between some behaviors (pace, sleep. hide, and fearful/tense) and fecal corticoid concentrations. Overall these results indicate that noninvasive fecal corticoid monitoring has enormous potential for investigating how management and behavioral problems are related to animal well-being. If conducted under carefully controlled experimental paradigms, this technique could allow researchers and managers to identify problem areas of captive management for clouded leopards (e.g., enclosure height, keeper time) and evaluate the efficacy of strategies designed to promote animal welfare and increased reproductive success.

Of the 3289 GPs involved in the program 2500 (76% respondent rate) completed the questionnaires in a group situation. There was no difference between respondents and non-respondents in terms of age, gender and year of graduation.
   Results: The majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counselling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify 'depression' were sleep disorders and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for DSM-IV major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. Fifty-seven percent of doctors used medicine together with nonpharmacological treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information.
   Conclusions: There is a need to improve GPs knowledge in diagnosing depression, in child psychiatry and in dealing with pregnant and suicidal patients.

AB Individually developing patterns of activity-rest rhythms in infants and the influence of environmental factors in the tuning and synchronisation of parent-infant pairs have important implications for the health of both infant and parents. After discharge from the hospital newborn infants are exposed to patterned influences of maternal and environmental regularities of a family's daily life resulting in varying degrees of social synchronisation,
   Actigraphic monitoring was used in this longitudinal study to examine how activity patterns of the entire family agree or disagree with each other, and how the infant entrains to the environment. Activity data of 12 families (father, mother and infant) were continuously recorded using non-invasive Actiwatch units. Recordings of parental activity started at the beginning of the 37th week of gestation, and were continued in parallel with the infants' recordings in three series of 21 days each until four months after birth: 1st to 3rd week, 7th to 9th week and 13th to 15th week of life. Fast Fourier transformation and cross correlation techniques were used to determine frequencies of each family member and to quantify the synchronisation of activity between parents and infants. To elucidate differences in social synchronisation between human cultures, synchronisation of a Melanesian family was additionally compared.
   Results showed the existence of corresponding ultradian frequencies in the activity patterns of mother-infant pairs at 1, 2 and 4 months. Increases in the synchronisation of parental activity were found from prenatal to postnatal and for mother-infant pairs from the first to the second month. Synchronisation between mother and infant always exceeded that of father and infant. Transient mono-, bi- or polyphasic activity patterns emerged in the infants immediately after birth. Good correspondence of mother-infant activity patterns during the early postnatal period was correlated with a rapid development of an entrained daily pattern in the infant.

AB Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is one of the commonest neurological disorders and causes significant disability, if left untreated. However, it is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice, probably due to lack of awareness and/or lack of necessary diagnostic facilities. Restless leg syndrome (RLS), aging, pregnancy, uraemia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy are some of the common causes of secondary PLMD. Clinical presentation, polysomnographic findings and management of six patients of PLMD have been discussed in this report.

AB The birth rate in 2000 (preliminary data) was 14.8 births per 1000 population, an increase of 2% from 1999 (14.5). The fertility rate, births per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years, increased 3% to 67.6 in 2000, compared with 65.9 in 1999. The 2000 increases in births and the fertility rate were the third consecutive yearly increases, the largest in many years, halting the steady decline in the number of births and fertility rates in the 1990s.
   Fertility rates for total white, non-Hispanic white, black, and Native American women each increased about 2% in 2000. The fertility rate for black women, which declined 19% from 1990 to 1996, has changed little since 1996. The rate for Hispanic women rose 4% in 2000 to reach the highest level since 1993. Birth rates for women 30 years or older continued to increase. The proportion of births to unmarried women remained about the same at one third, but the number of births rose 3%.
   The birth rate for teen mothers declined again for the ninth consecutive year. The use of timely prenatal care (83.2%) remained unchanged in 2000, and was essentially unchanged for non-Hispanic white (88.5%), black (74.2%), and Hispanic (74.4%) mothers.
   The number and rate of multiple births continued their dramatic rise, but all of the increase was confined to twins; for the first time in more than a decade, the number of triplet and higher-order multiple births declined (4%) between 1998 and 1999 (multiple birth information is not available in preliminary 2000 data). The overall increases in multiple births account, in part, for the lack of improvement in the percentage of low birth weight (LBW) births. LBW remained at 7.6% in 2000.
   The infant mortality rate (IMR) dropped to 6.9 per 1000 live births (preliminary data) in 2000 (the rate was 7.1 in 1999). The ratio of the IMR among black infants to that for white infants was 2.5 in 2000, the same as in 1999. Racial differences in infant mortality remain a major public health concern. The role of low birth weight in infant mortality remains a major issue. Among all of the states, Utah and Maine had the lowest IMRs. State-by-state differences in IMR reflect racial composition, the percentage LBW, and birth weight-specific neonatal mortality rates for each state. The United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality.
   Expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 76.9 years for all gender and race groups combined. Death rates in the United States continue to decline. The age-adjusted death rate for suicide declined 4% between 1999 and 2000; homicide declined 7%. Death rates for children 19 years of age or less declined for 3 of the 5 leading causes in 2000; cancer and suicide levels did not change for children as a group. A large proportion of childhood deaths, however, continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

AB Retrospective studies in humans suggest that chronic maternal stress during pregnancy, associated with raised plasma levels of CRH, ACTH and cortisol may increase the likelihood of preterm birth, developmental delays and bebavioural abnormalities in the children. In adulthood, it may contribute to the significant association between the incidence of schizophrenia, increased left or mixed handedness, reduction in cerebral asymmetry and anomalies in brain morphology. Our studies and others have shown that prenatal stress in rats can mimic these developmental and behavioural alterations. These rats show a reduced propensity for social interaction, increased anxiety in intimidating or novel situations and a reduction in cerebral asymmetry and dopamine turnover, consistent with those in schizophrenic humans. Prenatally-stressed (PS) rats also show behaviour consistent with depression, including a phase-shift in their circadian rhythm for corticosterone, sleep abnormalities, a hedonic deficit and greater acquisition of learned helplessness under appropriate conditions. These behavioural abnormalities are associated with impaired regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and increased CRH activity. PS males may show demasculinisation and feminisation of their sexual behaviour. The developmental and behavioural abnormalities in PS offspring could occur through sensitisation of the foetal brain by maternal stress hormones to the action of glucocorticoid and CRH and to neurotransmitters affected by them. This may have long-lasting consequences and could explain the precipitation of depressive symptoms or schizophrenia by psychosocial stress in later life. The character of the behavioural abnormalities probably depends on the timing of the maternal stress in relation to development of the particular neuronal systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   BIRTH OUTCOMES
AB Clinical depression is diagnosed in 5-15% of women during pregnancy, increasing the risk of negative outcomes. Fluoxetine (FX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is prescribed during pregnancy. In adults, FX alters sleep patterns with single doses decreasing total sleep time and rapid eye movement sleep. The effects of FX on sleep in the fetus are unknown. However, 5-hydroxytryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, has been reported to prolong high-voltage (HV) electrocortical (ECoG) activity and increase the incidence of fetal breathing movements (FBM) in the sheep fetus. We hypothesize that FX exposure will decrease the incidence of LV ECoG in the fetus. Twenty-one pregnant sheep were surgically prepared for chronic study of blood gases, ECoG activity, eye movements and FBM. After 3 days of recovery, ewes received a 70-mg bolus i.v. infusion of FX or sterile water followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.036 mg/min for 8 days. The incidence of low-voltage (LV) ECoG decreased from 54 +/-4% on the preinfusion day to 45 +/-5% on infusion day I in the FX group and remained decreased throughout the infusion period. In addition, the incidence of both eye movements and FBM was decreased on infusion day I compared to preinfusion day in the FX group. HV ECoG increased from 39 +/-3% on preinfusion day to 68 +/- 14% on FX infusion day I and remained elevated throughout the infusion period. These data show that maternal FX administration alters fetal behavioural state. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Preeclampsia is the most common disease of pregnancy, occurring in up to 10% of the pregnant population. The cause of the disease is as yet undetermined; however, most of the clinical effects are commonly attributed to damage to the endothelial layer, leading to increased pressor activity of all the maternal blood vessels. Therefore, we suspected that if obstructive sleep apnea. (OSA) coexisted with preeclampsia in pregnancy, the hemodynamic effects of the OSA would be markedly potentiated. To test this hypothesis, we performed full sleep studies and overnight beat-to-beat blood pressure (13P) monitoring. The control patient group included 10 pregnant women with OSA and no evidence of hypertensive disease either before or during their current pregnancy. The test group included 10 women with preeclampsia and coexisting OSA. The pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep were enhanced in preeclamptic patients compared with control OSA patients (21 +/- 2/12 +/- 1 mm Hg and 38 +/- 5/25 +/- 4 mm Hg above baseline in control OSA and preeclamptic OSA patients, respectively, P = .005/.005) In contrast, there was no difference in heart rate responses between the two groups of subjects (34 +/- 5 beats/min and 49 +/- 13 beats/min above baseline in control and preeclamptic patient groups, respectively, P = .326). We suggest that the augmented pressor responses in preeclamptic women occur as a result of maternal endothelial damage induced by the preeclampsia disease process. These findings may have important implications in the management of preeclamptic patients. (C) 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

AB ERG recordings from German cockroaches showed that the amplitude of light-evoked responses have a circadian rhythmicity in adult males that coincided with the locomotor circadian rhythm. The peak of the response occurred during the subjective night, and the circadian period was less than 24 h under DD condition. In contrast, although the locomotor circadian rhythm was masked by the development of ovaries and pregnancy in females, their visual responses displayed circadian rhythmicity. This inconsistency in expression of locomotor and visual sensitivity circadian rhythms in females implied separate pacemakers for these two overt rhythms. After severing the optic nerves, changes in ERG amplitude of the operated cockroaches still displayed a circadian rhythm under DD condition, demonstrating that the visual sensitive pacemaker was located in the eye and independent from the locomotor pacemaker.

AB Objectives: To describe beliefs about infant sleep position among African American grandmothers and other older caregivers (senior caregivers [SCGs]) and to measure the incremental effect on the rates of prone sleep after educating a group of African American SCGs.
   Design: Survey of sleep practices and beliefs. Randomized, controlled trial of a teaching intervention.
   Setting: Managed care prenatal clinic for normal risk obstetrics patients.
   Participants: Low-income pregnant women, self-identified as African American. An SCG is an older family member or friend to whom they would go for advice about routine child care. Pregnant women randomly assigned to the control group (educated about safe sleep practices) or the experimental group (education for both pregnant women and their SCG).
   Intervention: During the third trimester, 2 teaching sessions for pregnant women (both control and experimental groups) and for the experimental group's SCGs. One-on-one teaching emphasizing that infants should sleep supine.
   Main Outcome Measures: During the third trimester, description of rate of preference for prone sleep for infants among pregnant women and SCGs. Effects of teaching SCGs on (1) SCGs' postnatal beliefs about sleep position as a means to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, and (2) the eventual rate of prone sleeping among study infants.
   Results: One hundred twenty-five women were in the control group; 98 pregnant women and SCG pairs were in the experimental group. Senior caregivers were 47.1 +/- 12.4 years old (meant +/- SD). Most were grandmothers (either maternal, 72.5%, or paternal, 14.3%) or aunts or sisters (10.2%). No differences were noted in the prenatal rates of the prone preference (controls, 36.3%; experimental group, 35.7%; and SCGs, 34.7%). Teaching SCGs did not increase the rate of the usual prone sleep in the experimental vs the control group (13.3% vs 17.3%, chi (2)=0.59, P=.44, 95% confidence interval for difference from -5.8% to +13.8%). After the teaching and during the pregnancy, the SCGs became less worried that the infant was susceptible to sudden infant death syndrome (chi (2)=16.6, P=.003) or likely to die of sudden infant death syndrome (chi (2)=24.7, P < .001). Their concerns about sudden infant death syndrome were significantly less postnatally, in particular when the infant was placed supine (chi (2)=19.4, P < .001).
   Conclusions: Most African American women and SCGs endorsed the supine sleeping position for infants. Among a group of African American infants, prenatal teaching of their grandmothers and other SCGs did not have a statistically significant incremental effect on the rates of the usual prone sleeping position. Contrary to our starting hypothesis, the SCGs of pregnant women who receive prenatal care seemed responsive to messages about supine sleeping. The Back-to-Sleep message should be delivered prenatally, but special prenatal interventions should attempt to reach women who do not receive prenatal care and SCGs who persist in their opposition to the supine sleeping position.

AB Besides their binding to cognate intracellular receptors gonadal steroids may also act as functional antagonists at the 5-HT3 receptor. A structure-activity relationship for the actions of a variety of steroids at the 5-HT3 receptor was elaborated that differed considerably from that known for GABA(A) receptors. Steroids appear to interact allosterically with ligand-gated ion channels at the receptor membrane interface. The functional antagonism of gonadal steroids at the 5-HT3 receptor may play a role for the development and course of nausea during pregnancy and of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we could demonstrate that 3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids concurrently modulate the GABA(A) receptor and regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular oxidation. Animal studies showed that progesterone is converted rapidly into GABAergic neuroactive steroids in vivo. Progesterone reduces locomotor activity in a dose dependent fashion in male Wister rats. Moreover, progesterone and 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone produce a benzodiazepine-like sleep EEG profile in rats and humans. In addition, there is a dysequilibrium of such 3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids during major depression which is corrected by successful treatment with antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids may further be involved in the treatment of depression and anxiety with antidepressants in patients during ethanol withdrawal. First studies in patients with panic disorder suggest that neuroactive steroids may also play a pivotal role in human anxiety. The genomic and non-genomic effects of steroids in the brain contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions through their unique molecular properties and may constitute a yet unexploited class of drugs.

ID APNEA
AB Study objectives: This study was designed to evaluate sleep-related disordered breathing in obese women during pregnancy. Obesity is known to predispose to sleep-related breathing disorders. During pregnancy, obese mothers gain additional weight, but other mechanisms may counteract this effect.
   Design: A case-control study to compare sleep-related breathing in obese pregnant women (mean prepregnancy body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m(2)) with pregnant women of normal weight (mean BMI, 20 to 25 kg/m(2)).
   Setting: University teaching hospital with a sleep laboratory.
   Participants: We recruited 11 obese women (BMI, 34 kg/m(2); mean age 31 years) and 11 control women (BMI, 23 kg/m(2); mean age 32 years).
   Interventions: Overnight polysomnography was performed during early (after 12 weeks) and late (after 30 weeks) pregnancy.
   Measurements and results: During pregnancy, obese mothers gained 13 kg and control women gained 16 kg. Sleep characteristics did not differ between the groups. During late pregnancy, the women in both groups slept more poorly and slept in supine position less. During early pregnancy, their apnea-hypopnea indexes (1.7 events per hour vs 0.2 events per hour; p<0.05), 4% oxygen desaturations (5.3 events per hour vs 0.3 events per hour; p<0.005), and snoring times (32% vs 1%, p<0.001) differed significantly. These differences between the groups persisted in the second polysomnography, with snoring time further increasing in the obese. Preeclampsia and mild obstructive sleep apnea were diagnosed in one obese mother. One obese mother delivered a baby showing growth retardation (weight-3 SD).
   Conclusions: We have shown significantly more sleep-related disordered breathing occurring in obese mothers than in subjects of normal weight, despite similar sleeping characteristics.

AB Women have twice the incidence of major depression compared with men. They are prone to develop episodes of depression during times of reproductive hormonal change at puberty, with use of oral contraceptives, during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, postpartum and during the perimenopause (see review: Parry 1995a). Wirz-Justice (1995) describes the variety of disturbances in biological rhythms observed in mood disorders. In this report, we describe the chronobiological disturbances observed in female-specific mood disorders, namely, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, pregnancy and postpartum depression and menopause. We hypothesize that changing reproductive hormones, by affecting the synchrony or coherence between components of the circadian system, may alter amplitude or phase (timing) relationships and thereby contribute to the development of mood disorders in predisposed individuals.

ID DEATH-SYNDROME; PACIFIC; BELIEFS
AB This paper describes and compares the infant care practices and beliefs of Maori, Tongan, Samoan, Cook Islands, Niuean and Pakeha (European) caregivers residing in Auckland, New Zealand. Focusing on four areas - sources of support and advice; infant Feeding; infant sleeping arrangements; and traditional practices and beliefs - it explores inter-ethnic similarities and differences and intra-ethnic tensions. The international literature indicates that there can be significant cultural variation in infant care practices and in the meanings attributed to them. There is, however, little New Zealand literature on this topic, despite its importance for effective health service and health message delivery. Participants were primary caregivers of infants under 12 months. An average of six focus groups were conducted within each ethnic group, resulting in a total of 37 groups comprising 150 participants. We found similarities across all ethnic groups in the perceived importance of breastfeeding and the difficulties experienced in establishing and maintaining this practice. The spectrum of behaviours ranged widely with differences most pronounced between Pacific caregivers, especially those Island-raised, and Pakeha caregivers, especially those in nuclear families. Amongst the former, norms included: the family as central in providing support and advice; infant bedsharing; abdominal rubbing during pregnancy; baby massage; and the importance of adhering to traditional protocols to ensure infant well-being. Amongst the latter, norms included: strong reliance on professional advice; looser family support networks; the infant sleeping in a cot; and adherence to Western biomedical understandings of health and illness. Maori caregivers bridged the spectrum created by these groups and exhibited a diverse range of practices. Intra-cultural differences were present in all groups indicating the dynamic nature of cultural practices. They were most evident between Pacific-raised and New Zealand-raised Pacific caregivers, with the latter attempting to marry traditional with Western beliefs and practices.

AB Self-reported snoring is common in pregnancy, particularly in females with pre-eclampsia. The prevalence of inspiratory flow limitation during sleep in preeclamptic females was objectively assessed and compared with normal pregnant and nonpregnant females.
   Fifteen females with pre-eclampsia were compared to 15 females from each of the three trimesters of pregnancy, as well as to 15 matched nonpregnant control females (total study population, 75 subjects). All subjects had overnight monitoring of respiration, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure (BP).
   No group had evidence of a clinically significant sleep apnoea syndrome, but patients with pre-eclampsia spent substantially more time (31 +/-8.4%, of sleep period time, mean SD) with evidence of inspiratory flow limitation compared to 15.5 +/-2.3% in third trimester subjects and <5% in the other three groups (p=0.001). In the majority of preeclamptics, the pattern of flow limitation was of prolonged episodes lasting several minutes without associated oxygen desaturation. As expected, systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly higher in the pre-eclamptic group (p<0.001), but all groups showed a significant fall (p less than or equal to0.05) in BP during sleep. Inspiratory flow limitation is common during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder.

AB Objectives: To assess awareness of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and risk reducing recommendations in a sample of mothers in North Queensland, Australia, and to examine their infant care practices.
   Method: Interviews conducted with 195 women using a standardized questionnaire between October 1997 and January 1998.
   Results: 191 questionnaires analyzed; 134 (70.2%) Caucasian and 57 (29.8%) indigenous women. Four women with previous SIDS experience were excluded from the analysis. Eight (4.2%) had never heard of SIDS. Twenty-nine (15.2%) had heard of SIDS and 154 (80.6%) had heard of SIDS and could list risk recommendations to reduce its incidence. Multivariate analysis identified ethnicity as the only significant predictor of maternal knowledge. Indigenous mothers knew less about SIDS: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 5.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [2.1-14.0]. Avoidance of prone sleeping was the most frequently identified recommendation (n = 132), with no smoking in pregnancy (n = 48) and breastfeeding (n = 40) identified least frequently. There were 80.2% of mothers who put their infant in non-prone positions to sleep. Only 48 (25%) women identified smoking in pregnancy, and 93 (48.6%) smoking in the infant's environment as risk factors. Indigenous women were more likely to smoke in their pregnancy (P = 0.004), bed share with their infant (P = 0.0001), and have smokers in the home.
   Conclusion: There is a high level of awareness of SIDS and the main associated risk factor of infant prone sleeping, but the link between SIDS and smoking requires further emphasis. Future campaigns should ensure the SIDS message is delivered more effectively to the indigenous communities.

AB Circadian rhythms of mammals are generated endogenously, the master oscillator system residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Previous experiments have indicated that the rabbit has a feeding entrainable circadian oscillator (FEO) which is supposed to be of greatest importance during the early infancy of the rabbit. Here we report the course of telemetrically monitored core body temperature of rabbit pups and of their does. Temperature increased from 37.6 +/- 0.3 degreesC on day 2 to 39.5 +/- 0.10 degreesC on day 28 of life. The pups showed a 24 h temperature rhythm even during their first days of life. Temperature increased 2 1/2-3 h prior to nursing for 0.4-0.8 degreesC and rose for an additional 0.4-0.6 degreesC immediately after milk ingestion. The anticipatory, but not the postprandial component persisted when nursing was skipped twice. The persistence of a rhythm in the absence of any entraining agent is crucial for its endogenous generation. In the doe, the core body temperature gradually decreased during the last 2/3 of pregnancy. During parturition it steeply rose for 1.5-1.7 degreesC and attained a plateau of 39.7 +/- 0.2 degreesC during lactation. The circadian rhythm persisted during the whole course of pregnancy and lactation. Thus, in the rabbit an endogenous, feeding entrainable circadian oscillator appears to operate from the first days of life. It is of functional significance in that it alerts the pup in time so that it is able to utilize the singular short presence of the doe for maximal milk intake.

AB Time spent on inactive behaviours (loafing, resting and sleeping) by 100 stall-fed sheep was recorded on three occasions for 24 consecutive hours. Bout length and inter-bout length for each inactive behaviour were recorded. Data related to behaviour duration, bout duration and inter-bout duration were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks to determine differences between the seven categories of sheep, viz. lamb (12), young (10), hogget (24), ram (12), pregnant ewe (12), lactating ewe (10), and non-pregnant ewe (20). The Wilcoxon signed ranked test was used to study the significance of differences between day-time (part of the day with natural light, 06.01-18.00 h) and night-time (time of darkness, 18.01-06.00 h). Loafing (375 min per day) was the most frequent form of inactive behaviour followed by resting (252 min per day) and sleeping (56 min per day). Compared to rains, lambs took more time (P < 0.05) for all three forms of inactive behaviour except loafing time during day-time. Diurnal variation (P < 0.05) was observed for loafing time in hogget and resting time in non-pregnant ewes. Bout length of loafing, resting and sleeping had durations of 9, 12 and 12 min, respectively, at day-time and 9, 13 and 15 min, respectively, at night-time. The inter-bout length during day-time and night-time was 23 and 29 min, respectively. for loafing; 52 and 53 min, respectively, for resting and 154 and 220 min, respectively, for sleeping. For the three inactive behaviours, short duration bout length (< 16 min) was predominant; about 90% of total bouts of each inactive behaviour had duration of < 30 min. Resurgence of resting activity occurred either before 15 min or after 30 min of completion of the preceding bout. Two-thirds of total inter-bout lengths for loafing and sleeping activity had durations of < 16 and > 30 min, respectively. Knowledge on the inactive behaviour will help to develop management practices for rearing sheep under stall-fed conditions. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive ability of parameters of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension in women who are already considered at risk for these disorders.
   STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty-two pregnant women who were considered high risk for the development of preeclampsia underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring between 18 and 30 weeks gestation, while their condition was normotensive according to routine mercury sphygmomanometry. One hundred sixty-four healthy primigravid women who were considered at usual risk for preeclampsia underwent the same tests as a parallel study. Routine blood pressure, awake and sleep average blood pressure, and 24-hour mean average blood pressure were entered into multiple logistic regression as predictors of either preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; significant variables were then tested by a series of receiver operator curves.
   RESULTS. Eight percent of usual risk and 45% of high risk women experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In both groups, the average routine mercury blood pressure and awake, sleeping, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood pressure were significantly higher in women who later experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In usual risk women, 24-hour systolic blood pressure of greater than or equal to 115 mm Hg and sleeping systolic blood pressure of greater than or equal to 106 mm Hg were predictive of later preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but sensitivities were low (77% and 54%, respectively). In high risk women, sleeping diastolic blood pressure of greater than or equal to 62 mm Hg and sleeping mean arterial pressure of greater than or equal to 79 mm Hg were predictive of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but again sensitivities were low (70% and 65%, respectively).
   CONCLUSION: Awake and sleeping blood pressure are higher in midpregnancy in women who later experience the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a noninvasive method of selecting some of these women, but this test has a sensitivity no better than that of other predictive tests, even in women at high risk for preeclampsia.

AB Studies based on casual blood pressure measurements concluded that both age and parity have significant effects on blood pressure during pregnancy. We have tested these results on clinically healthy normotensive women who were systematically studied by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during their pregnancies. We analyzed 1254 blood pressure series sampled for 48 consecutive hours every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery in 205 normotensive pregnant women. Data were divided for comparative analysis by parity (nulliparous versus multiparous), age (less than or equal to 25, 26 to 30, 31 to 35, and greater than or equal to 36 years), and trimester of gestation. Circadian parameters established by population multiple-component analysis were compared between groups with a nonparametric test. Effects of age and parity on blood pressure were also tested by ANOVA. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern described by a model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 hours is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (always P <0.001). There was no significant difference in 24-hour mean among groups divided by parity at any age or stage of pregnancy (always P >0.160). A trend of increasing blood pressure with age was found for diastolic but not systolic blood pressure. Although statistically significant, differences in the 24-hour mean of diastolic blood pressure among groups divided by age were always <1.5 mm Hg. Data obtained from systematic ambulatory monitoring in normotensive pregnant women indicate the lack of differences in blood pressure according to parity. The small, although significant, increase in diastolic blood pressure with age may have little influence in the proper identification of women with gestational hypertension. Reference thresholds for blood pressure to be used in the early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy could thus be developed as a function of rest-activity cycle and gestational age, independent of parity or maternal age.

AB We report a Japanese family with glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA) in whom gene abnormality was identified by the long-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The proband was a 21-year-old female incidentally found to have high blood pressure (173/107 mmHg). Laboratory tests showed hypokalemia (3.7 mmol/l), and high plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC, 234 pg/ml) with suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA, < 0.1 ng/ml/h). The circadian rhythm pattern and the results of a rapid adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) test indicated ACTH-dependent changes in PAC. Imaging studies showed no adrenal mass on either side. A dexamethasone (Dexa) suppression test (1.0 mg/day orally for 7 days) showed a marked decrease of PAC 2 days after administration, and this decreased level was maintained throughout Dexa administration. High blood pressure and hypokalemia also improved during Dexa treatment. The proband's younger sister was 19 years old and had hypertension, PAC of 231 pg/ml, and PRA < 0.1 ng/ml/h. The mother was 53 years old and had hypertension, PAC of 98.5 pg/ml, and PRA < 0.1 ng/ml/h. The proband's elder sister was a 22-year-old normotensive with PAC of 110 pg/ml and PRA of 0.1 ng/ml. Long-PCR was performed for detection of the chimeric gene associated with GRA, using DNA samples from all four cases and two normal control subjects. Although the aldosterone synthase gene was expressed among all DNA samples, the chimeric gene was detected only in the proband, her younger sister and her mother. Our clinical data and genetic investigation confirmed the presence of GRA in this Japanese family.

AB Objective Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increases are reported during normal pregnancy, but the relation to arterial pressure and the renin-angiotensin system is debatable. We assessed whether normotensive pregnancies with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) present an alteration of maternal ANP levels.
   Design A total of 11 pregnant women with IUGR, in the absence of any other maternal or fetal pathology, entered the study during the third trimester. They were compared with 12 healthy pregnant women of similar age and characteristics. We monitored all subjects for blood pressure (BP), ANP, aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA), under the same conditions for 24 h. All subjects were submitted to the same regimen of life; with homogenous dark: light periods, salt intake and meal times.
   Methods BP was monitored at 20 min intervals for 24 h and blood tests performed at six time points during the 24 h. EDTA plasma samples were immediately centrifuged. Hormone assays were performed by radioimmunoassay.
   Koch's nonparametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the hormone time-dependent profiles in the two groups. Circadian rhythms were assessed by cosinor analysis.
   Results The IUGR group was characterized by higher ANP values compared to normal pregnancy, (205 +/- 24 versus 146 +/- 21 pg/ml: P < 0.05) but not significant differences were shown for PRA, aldosterone and BP circadian rhythms.
   Conclusions This study shows higher ANP values in human pregnancy complicated by IUGR, with presence of normal BP, aldosterone and PRA profiles. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Over the past 30 years or more, the problem of sudden, unexplained death in infants (SIDS) has made little headway. Many hypotheses have been offered but the basic cause remains elusive. The only successful prevention has been made by the supine sleeping posture. There is still, however, a hard core of unexplained incidents. There is evidence that certain stress factors are involved, and there is good evidence that the tragedy has a familial or genetic tendency. The third factor necessary for the event is inefficient oxidation in brain cells induced most commonly by marginal malnutrition in pregnancy or after birth. The absence of any one or more of these three factors decreases risk to the point of extinction. Anything that impedes healthy oxidation, or accelerates energy utilization through responding to stress, increases the risk greatly. Improving the biochemical mechanisms through appropriate nutrition is by far the best defense. (C) 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

AB Trials were conducted on a farm in Mpumalanga Province in South Africa to test the possibility of grading the colour of the ocular mucous membranes of sheep as an indication of the extent to which the animals are affected by Haemonchus contortus infection. The range of observed colour shades were classified into five categories, from red, through red-pink, pink and pink-white to white.
   Over a period of 125 days routine drenching of a flock of 388 sheep on irrigated kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) pasture was terminated. During this time the animals were examined at practically weekly intervals and haematocrit determinations done for all the sheep with pale conjunctivae. Only those sheep having a haematocrit of 15 % or lower were treated.
   Compared to a previous drenching tempo of close to every 3 weeks during the Haemonchus season on the farm, drenching was reduced by approximately 90 %, as 70 % of the sheep did not require salvage drenching and only 10 % of the flock had to be given more than one salvage treatment.
   At the time of the trial the five clinical classifications were not related to predetermined haematocrit categories. However, when compared to categories that were set in later trials, 94 % of the clinical estimates in the present trial were either in the correct haematocrit category, or, if not, the sheep were probably not disadvantaged by the errors. In 2.6 % of cases the incorrect estimate may have placed the sheep concerned in jeopardy, as the haematocrit values were so low that salvage drenching was required, while the sheep were not regarded as anaemic.
   Changes in the mean haematocrit values of drenched and undrenched sheep were mirrored reciprocally by the changes in clinical colour estimates.
   Lactating ewes were by far the most susceptible class of sheep, as only 44.6 % of them were able to manage without drenching, compared to 83 % of dry, and 70.6 % of pregnant ewes. Correlations between the haematocrits and clinical estimates were highly significant, although the associations were not high enough to give reasonable surety that the haematocrit values of individual animals could be predicted with confidence from their clinical classifications.
   Exceptionally large numbers of worms were recovered from seven of the 14 sheep that were culled because of age at the end of the trials but these were reflected neither in their faecal worm egg counts, nor, with one exception only, in clinical signs.

AB This quasi-experimental research investigates developmental regulation around a critical life-span transition, the "biological clock" for childbearing. The action-phase model of developmental regulation proposes contrasting control orientations in individuals approaching versus those having passed a developmental deadline. Individuals in an urgency phase close to the deadline should be invested in goal pursuit, whereas those who have passed the deadline without attaining the goal should focus on goal disengagement and self-protection. In 2 studies, women at different ages and with or without children were compared with regard to various indicators of primary and secondary control striving for goal attainment versus goal disengagement and self-protection. Finding, support the action-phase model of developmental regulation. Patterns of control striving congruent with the participants' status as preversus postdeadline were associated with superior psychological well-being.

AB Objective-To study the distribution of prenatal and postnatal risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Design-A questionnaire-based survey for SIDS risk factors; family interviews were performed among the parents of SIDS victims and symptom-free infants.
   Setting-The survey was conducted in paediatric primary health care units in Budapest, Hungary in the period 1996 to 1998.
   Subject-Eighteen SIDS cases and 74 symptom-free healthy infants aged 7-365 days were investigated.
   Main outcome measures-Occurrence of risk factors and impact of social environment were analysed using conditional logistic regression.
   Results-In this study, the classic risk factors of small birth weight, maternal smoking, bottle-feeding did not reflect differences between the investigated groups. The prone position did not demonstrate a difference between SIDS cases and controls (p=0.86). Short intervals between pregnancies (OR=4.8, CI=1.2-19.9, p=0.025) and social disadvantage (OR=6.7, CI=1.3-35.7, p=0.015) indicated significant differences between SIDS cases and controls.
   Conclusion-The outcome of our survey shows that infants from a lower social and economic environment may be at higher risk for SIDS.

AB 1. In fetal sleep during late gestation the aims of the present study were to (1) develop a technique for inducing prolonged but reversible periods of controlled compression of the umbilical cord and (2) characterise the cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic responses to this challenge.
   2. Under 1-2% halothane anaesthesia, 16 Welsh Mountain sheep fetuses were chronically instrumented at 118 +/- 2 days of gestation (term is ca 145 days) with an inflatable occluder cuff around the umbilical cord, amniotic and femoral vascular catheters and with transit-time flow probes around the coti tra-lateral femoral artery and an umbilical artery. At 125 days, umbilical blood flow was reduced by 30 % from a pre-determined 24 h baseline for 3 days by automated servo-controlled inflation of the occluder cuff (n = 8). The occluder was then deflated allowing return of umbilical blood flow to baseline. The remaining eight fetuses were used as sham-operated controls in which the occluder was not inflated throughout the protocol. Fetal cardiovascular variables were recorded at 8 s intervals and arterial blood samples; taken for measurement of blood gases, glucose and lactate and plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline and vasopressin concentration throughout the study.
   3. Automated servo-controlled inflation of the occluder cuff, programmed to reduce umbilical blood flow by 30 % from baseline, reduced umbilical blood flow by 30.2 +/- 1.7 %, with a coefficient of variation during compression of 6.5 +/- 1.1 %. Sustained partial compression of the umbilical cord produced falls in fetal arterial pH, P-a,P-O2, percentage O-2 saturation of haemoglobin, and hindlimb oxygen delivery, and increases in P-a,P-CO2, haemoglobin concentration, arterial blood oxygen carrying capacity and in blood glucose and lactate concentrations. While the reductions in P-a,P-O2, percentage saturation of haemoglobin and hindlimb oxygen delivery and the increase in P-a,P-CO2, were sustained throughout compression, the reduction in arterial pH and the increase in arterial oxygen carrying capacity had returned towards baseline values by 48 h compression. Fetal blood lactate concentrations reached a peak at 8 h of compression and, thereafter, were maintained at an elevated level relative to baseline.
   4. Partial compression of the umbilical cord produced fetal hypertension, a reduction in femoral blood flow and, consequently, an increase in calculated fetal femoral vascular resistance for the duration of the challenge. In addition, the fall in heart rate measured in sham control fetuses by the end of the study, did not occur in cord-compressed fetuses. Cosinor analysis on 24 h rhythms of cardiovascular data indicated a significant increase in the amplitude or the 24 h rhythm in heart rate in cord-compressed fetuses relative to sham controls during the period of compression or sham-compression. Furthermore, cord compression led to an increase in fetal plasma noradrenaline, but not adrenaline and vasopressin concentrations relative to sham control fetuses.
   5. In conclusion, a novel reversible method for controlled, long-term compression of the umbilical cord in sheep has been developed. The data show that sustained, partial compression of the umbilical cord produced moderate but sustained asphyxia, which resolved after the end of the compression period, and induced changes in fetal cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic functions.

AB The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the welfare of pregnant mares kept in straight stalls mid given only limited exercise, conditions that are similar to those encountered in the pregnant mare urine industry. Sixteen pregnant mares (eight in each of two years) were randomly assigned to two groups: Ex (exercised in a paddock for 30 min per day) or NoEx (exercised for one 30 min period every 14 days). The horses were housed in straight (or 'tie') stalls for six months and had ad libitum access to grass hay. Each hors's behaviour was recorded oil videotape once per week for 24 h. The major behaviours were eating hay, standing, and stand-resting (head clown and one hind limb flexed). There was no difference between the behaviours or the number of foot lifts per min of the Ex and NoEx groups in their stalls. Nine of 16 mares were not observed in recumbency throughout the whole of the six-month observation period, suggesting that horses with no previous experience BE straight stalls may be reluctant to lie down. Thirteen of 16 mares dropped to their knees at least once, probably when they were REM sleeping while standing. There were no significant differences between the Ex and the NoEx mares in baseline plasma cortisol levels or in cortisol response to ACTH. Following 30 min of exercise, NoEx mares showed an increase in cortisol from 5.0 to 5.4 mug dL(-1), whereas Ex mares showed a decrease from 4.6 to 3.6 mug dL(-1). The NoEx horses that had been confined for two weeks trotted more (NoEx = 22 [6-38; median and range]% of lime, Ex = 2.4 [0-8.7]%) and galloped more (NoEx = 6 [2-8]%; Ex = 0 [0-4]%) than the Ex that were released daily, but walked less (NoEx = 17 [10-26]%; Ex = 35 [20-40]%) mad grazed less (NoEx = 0%; Ex = 3 [0-12]%). Confined horses show rebound locomotion - that is, a compensatory increase - when released from confinement, indicating a response to exercise deprivation.

AB Aim-To look for changes in risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after decrease and stabilisation of the SIDS rate.
   Methods-Questionnaires were distributed to parents of 174 SIDS infants, dying between 1984 and 1998, and 375 age and sex matched controls in southeast Norway.
   Results-The proportion of infants sleeping prone has decreased, along with the decrease in SIDS rate for the region during the periods studied, but over half of the SIDS victims are still found in the prone position. As the number of SIDS cases has decreased, additional risk factors have become more significant. Thus, after 1993, a significantly increased risk of SIDS is seen when the mother smokes during pregnancy. After 1993, young maternal age carries an increased risk. Maternal smoking and young maternal age are associated with each other. For SIDS victims, an increase in the number of infants found dead while co-sleeping is seen, and the age peak between 2 and 4 months and the winter peak have become less pronounced.
   Conclusion-Changes in risk factor profile following the decrease in SIDS rate in the early 1990s, as well as consistency of other factors, provides further clues to SIDS prevention and to the direction of further studies of death mechanisms.

AB To monitor infant care practices associated with risks for sudden infant death, 400 Belgian families with infants less than 6 months old were questioned by 21 paediatricians during routine visits to local paediatric practices and well baby services (I I in urban centres, 10 in rural areas). Because of incomplete information, 35 families were excluded. Of the 365 mothers included in the study, 36.1% had under 7 years of schooling, 38.4% less than 13 years, and 25.5% had a professional school or a university degree. Risk factors for sudden infant death were found in 208 (56.9%) families: a usual non-supine sleep position (31.5% of the infants); sleeping under a duvet (24.1%); mothers Smoking during and after gestation (16.4%); a high room temperature (6.6%); use of sedatives (3.8%); necklaces or plastic film in the cot (2.5%); and soft beddings (2.2%). Maternal education, but not the fathers' profession was significantly related to the number of risk factors (mean odds ratio of 4.4; 95% Cl: 1.5 to 5.3; P = 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the mother's length of schooling as the single most significant independent factor for the presence of risk (P < 0.005).
   Conclusion Less educated mothers reported having been informed of risk-reducing recommendations as frequently as better educated mothers. It can be concluded that future reduction in risks for sudden infant death syndrome should include new strategies designed to modify infant care practices.

AB Objective To determine (a) the prevalence of hypertension during sleep in pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, and (b) whether women with hypertension during sleep have worse pregnancy outcomes than hypertensive pregnant women with controlled (normal) blood pressure (BP) during sleep.
   Design Prospective double-blind cohort study.
   Setting Inpatients and outpatients managed in a day assessment unit (DAU) at St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia.
   Participants A total of 186 hypertensive pregnant women, 158 of whom had successful 24 h BP monitoring; 40% had proteinuric pre-eclampsia (PE), 43% gestational hypertension (GH) and 17% essential hypertension (EH).
   Interventions Blood pressure, 24 h non-invasive, monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was undertaken successfully in 158 women with PE, GH or EH, whether or not they were receiving antihypertensives. Women and clinicians were blinded to results of these BP monitors. Sleep hypertension was defined as BP > 117/68 mmHg at 26-30 weeks or > 123/72 mmHg after 30 weeks gestation.
   Main outcome measures Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between women with and without sleep hypertension and the prevalence of sleep hypertension was determined.
   Results Sleep hypertension was present in 59%, more commonly in PE (79%) than GH/EH (45%), P < 0.0001. Sleep hypertensives also had higher routine sphygmomanometer Bps [137(10)/91(7) mmHg; mean(SD)] than women with normal sleep BP [130(12)/87(8) mmHg] P = 0.007, and higher awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) Bps [137(8)/88(7) versus 127(7)/79(6) mmHg], P < 0.0001. Awake, but not sleep, average heart rate was lower in sleep hypertensives [85(11) versus 91(10) beats per minute, bpm], P = 0.002. Sleep hypertensives had a significantly greater frequency of renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and episodes of (awake) severe hypertension (P < 0.05), as well as lower birth weight babies [2715(808) versus 3224(598) g, P < 0.0001].
   Conclusions Hypertension during sleep is a common finding in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia. These women also have higher awake BPs and a greater frequency of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. These findings are largely explained by the greater likelihood of pre-eclamptics having sleep hypertension.

AB This study assessed the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on ventilatory and waking responses of infants to a respiratory challenge. This challenge mimicked the time-course and concentration of gases that an infant would experience rebreathing face-down into soft bedding. Control (C; n = 97) and smokers' infants (SM; n = 96) were studied at ages 1 and 3 mo. Asphyxial gas (hypercapnia/hypoxia) was delivered to the supine sleeping baby via a hood by slowly altering the inspired air: CO2 maximum 5% and O-2 minimum 13.5%. Respiratory pattern was recorded by inductive plethysmography as the sum of ribcage and abdominal movements. The change in ventilation with inspired CO2 was measured over 5-6 min of the test. The slope of a linear curve fit relating inspired CO2 to the logarithm of ventilation was taken as a quantitative measure of ventilatory asphyxial sensitivity (VAS). Protective responses were graded from 1: no waking and an estimated arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) greater than or equal to 60 mmHg (least protective), to 4: fully awake (most protective). The results showed VAS was higher in SM infants than controls: +0.03 (p = 0.04). The oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) of SM infants fell -0.4% (p = 0.02) more than SaO(2) Of controls despite a greater tidal volume increase: +13.0% (p = 0.04). Overall protective responses were the same between groups, but grade 1, although rare, was found in 7 SM infants and only 4 control infants; this difference was not significant.
   Conclusion: The study did not confirm the postulate that infants of mothers who smoked during pregnancy have a reduced ventilatory response or raised waking thresholds.

DT Article
DE chronic pelvic pain; prevalence, illness behaviour
AB Background: Chronic pelvic pain has often been described as a major women's health issue, but no information exists on the extent of the problem in the United Kingdom.
   Aim: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women.
   Design of study: Postal questionnaire survey.
   Setting: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916) randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register.
   Method: The questionnaire response rate (adjusted for non-deliveries) was 74% (2304/3106). Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse of pregnancy. Case subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group.
   Results: The three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24.0% (95% CI = 22.1% to 25.8%). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago. Recent consulters (32% of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41% of cases) did not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. Irrespective of consulting behavior, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31%) compared with women with dysmenorrhoea (7%).
   Conclusions: This study showed a high community prevalence of chronic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in the degree to which they were affected by their symptoms. The high symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes.

AB To elucidate diurnal variations in eye movement and fetal heart rate (FHR) variability in the term fetus, we observed these two parameters continuously for 24 h, using real-time ultrasound and Doppler cardiotocograph, respectively. Studied were five uncomplicated fetuses at term. The time series data of the presence and absence of eye movement and mean FHR Value for each 1 min were analyzed using the maximum entropy method (MEM) and subsequent nonlinear least squares fitting, According to the power value of eye movement, all five cases were classified into two groups: three cases in the large power group and two cases in the small power group. The acrophases of eye movement and FHR variability in the large power group were close, thereby implying the existence of a diurnal rhythm in both these parameters and also that they are synchronized. In the small power group, the acrophases were separated. The synchronization of eye movement and FHR variability in the large power group suggests that these phenomena are governed by a common central mechanism related to diurnal rhythm generation.

DT Article
ID COUNTRIES; ACCOUNTS; VIOLENCE; ANXIETY
AB Discussions of the health of women in the developing world have typically been shaped by the concerns of policy makers, health care professionals and other experts. They have focused on reproductive health and, above all, women have been defined in terms of their childbearing role. Yet when women themselves are given a voice, a different set of issues emerges. The research reported here aimed to explore women's own concerns about their health and how they understand their health problems. The study was conducted in the Volta region of Ghana and it included interviews with 75 women of varying background. Almost three-quarters of the women reported 'thinking too much' and many also said that they had problems sleeping, suffered frequent headaches and often felt unhappy or sad. They explain these psycho-social health problems in terms of their social and material circumstances and one of the main themes women emphasised was their relationship with me. Relying on women's accounts, we trace the ways in which they conceptualised their health, seeing it as shaped by their lack of control over the conditions of their lives; gender relation define their responsibilities while at the same time withholding the control and resources they require in order to achieve a measure of economic independence and predictability.

AB This study examines the effect of inhibiting the synthesis of gamma -aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) agonist steroids on behavioural activity and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in late gestation fetuses. Pregnane steroid production was suppressed by infusion of the 5 alpha -reductase inhibitor, finasteride in chronically catheterised fetal sheep, 130-135 days gestation. Finasteride treatment (160 mg in 10 ml of vehicle over 2 h) significantly increased the incidence of fetal arousal during the period 4-10 h after commencing the infusion (P < 0.05, n = 6), whereas other behavioural parameters were not effected. In three of four animals, finasteride produced an increase in the amplitude of the N22 peak of the SEP during high voltage electrocortical activity. We conclude that suppressio n of pregnane steroid synthesis, by inhibition of the 5<alpha>-reductase enzyme, increases arousal activity in the fetus which is consistent with a reduction in GABA(A) receptor mediated inhibition.

AB This open-label prospective study examined maternal and neonatal safety and efficacy outcome measures during and following prenatal buprenorphine exposure. Three opioid-dependent pregnant women received 8 or 12 mg sublingual buprenorphine tablets daily for 15-16 weeks prior to delivery. Results showed that buprenorphine in combination with comprehensive prenatal care was safe and effective in these women. Prenatal exposure to buprenorphine resulted in normal birth outcomes, a mean of 4.33 days (minimum possible = 4) hospitalization, and a 'relatively mild' neonatal abstinence syndrome comprised primarily of tremors (disturbed), hyperactive moro and shortened sleep after feeding. The infants required no pharmacological treatment. Onset of neonatal abstinence signs occurred within the first 12 h after birth, peaked by 72 h and returned to below pre-12 h levels by 120 h. It is concluded that buprenorphine has potential utility for the treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent women. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A cll-year-old man fell into type II respiratory failure after catching a cold, and became dependent on a respirator, Chest radiography showed no abnormalities and the hyperventilation test showed improved arterial blood gas findings. His sleep study showed marked nocturnal desaturation due to hypopnea and apnea with a decrease of thoracic and abdominal movement during sleep, Therefore, we diagnosed hint as primary alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (PAH), Seven years previously, his 2-year elder sister had suffered from similar respiratory failure during her second pregnancy and had been diagnosed as PAH, While myopathy was suspected in both cases, attenuation of muscle strength was slight and it appeared not to be the main cause of alveolar hypoventilation, Since medication was not effective in each case, they underwent non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). While sustained mild hypercapnia remained during the daytime, it improved their respiratory failure, To our knowledge, this is the first study of familial adult onset PAH.

AB Purpose: Routine use of ultrasound during pregnancy has emphasized the need for greater knowledge about normal and abnormal voiding function during fetal live. We describe the developmental changes in lower urinary tract function from the middle of the second to the early third trimester of gestation.
   Materials and Methods: The study included 22 male fetal pigs of 13 pregnant Goettingen minipigs (gestational period 111 to 115 days) with 11 fetuses in the middle of the second (median 61.5 days, 0.55 of term) and 11 fetuses in the beginning of the third trimester of gestation (median 80 days, 0.72 of term). With the sow under isoflurane anesthesia catheters were placed in the bladder, rectum and amniotic cavity of the fetuses, and a flow probe was placed around the distal urethra. After the sow was at light sleep urethral flow, amniotic pressure, abdominal pressure and bladder pressure were recorded a median of 241 minutes.
   Results: The recordings of 14 fetuses were evaluable. In the middle of the second trimester the fetuses showed an almost constant dribbling with a median flow of 0.2 mi. per minute and a median of 4 concomitant bladder contractions per minute of median 3.5 cm. H2O (detrusor pressure). At the beginning of the third trimester the fetuses had periods of staccato flow (median 0.2 mi. per minute, staccato frequency 1 to 2 Hz.) on top of contractions (median 4 contractions per minute, median detrusor pressure 5.5 cm. H2O) with no flow between voidings.
   Conclusions: Development of storage and voiding function in male pigs occurs between the mid-second and early third trimester of gestation, together with emergence of striated sphincter bursting activity, which interrupts flow in the urethra during the voiding phase.

Subjects were 10 primipara and 12 non-pregnant women. Their polysomnographic recordings were made using a Medilog recorder at home. In interrupted sleep, low sleep efficiency. decreased total sleep time, and a decreased percentage of stage 2 were significantly observed compared with non-pregnant women. Sleep parameters of non-interrupted sleep, except for increased percentage of stage 4, did not show any significant differences from non-pregnant women. Mothers sleep fluctuated between interrupted sleep similar to the early post-partum sleep from 1 to 6 weeks and non-interrupted sleep with increased stage 4.

SO AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
LA English
DT Article
ID HYPERPROLACTINEMIA; PROLACTINOMAS
AB Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wail irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.

AB OBJECTIVES: Indirect evidence suggests that adrenal steroid production in the human fetus may have a circadian rhythm. To assess whether there is a 24-hour rhythm of fetal cortisol in the human fetus, we investigated the relationship between fetal and maternal cortisol and cortisone concentrations in maternal, umbilical arterial, and umbilical venous blood samples over a 24-hour period.
   STUDY DESIGN: Elective cesarean sections were scheduled every 2 hours around the clock in 57 term (38-41 weeks' gestation) nonlaboring pregnant women. Plasma cortisol and cortisone concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography.
   RESULTS: The mean 24-hour cortisol concentration was higher In umbilical arterial than in umbilical Venous blood samples. 63.6 +/- 4.6 ng/mL (SEM) versus 48.7 +/- 3.2 ng/mL, respectively (P <.05). Fetal plasma cortisol showed a rhythm in the umbilical artery (acme from noon to 4 PM) (I-way analysis of variance and least significant difference test; P <.05) but not in the umbilical vein. Umbilical arteriovenous differences showed no net transfer of cortisol to the fetus at any time of the day and net fetal production of cortisol from 8 AM to 6 PM. There was limited transfer of cortisone to the fetus and only in the 2 AM-to-noon time interval.
   CONCLUSION: These data suggest the presence of a 24-hour rhythm of fetal adrenal cortisol secretion that may be controlled by a fetal circadian pacemaker.

AB A Structured Clinical Interview (SCI) was used to assess both proximal characteristics of the rearing environments of prenatally polydrug exposed infants in a low SES sample and infant behavioral characteristics (e.g., feeding, sleeping, self-regulation). The 95-item questionnaire systematized collection of developmental history and caregiving environment for 132 infant-caregiver dyads who were seen for follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Outcome data were indexed in five theoretically based areas: Care-giving Instability, Problems with Social Routine, Dysregulation, Infant Feeding Problems and Infant Sleeping Problems. Main effects were found in the Caregiving Instability and Sleeping Problems Index scores for drug exposure but not gestational age. Chronological age and drug interactions were found for Feeding Problems and Sleeping Problems Index scores, with those in the drug group having persistent difficulties in these areas. Additionally, there was a term and drug interaction effect in the Problems with Social Routine Index. In all of these areas, prenatal drug exposure was associated with less optimal scores. The SCI proved to be a useful tool in studying this high-risk population and may be useful in research and clinical settings. Future instrument development is planned.

AB Experiments were carried out to determine the threshold level of maternal nicotine that impairs protective responses of rat pups to hypoxia. From days 6 or 7 of gestation, pregnant rats received either vehicle or nicotine (1.50, 3.00, or 6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate.kg body wt(-1).day(-1)) or vehicle continuously via a subcutaneous osmotic minipump. On postnatal days 5 or 6, pups were exposed to a single period of hypoxia produced by breathing an anoxic gas mixture (97% N-2 or 3% CO2) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they were exposed to intermittent hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from hypoxic-induced primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the time to last gasp or the total number of gasps when the pups were exposed to a single period of hypoxia. The number of successful autoresuscitations on repeated exposure to hypoxia was, however, decreased in pups whose dams had received either 3.00 or 6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate/kg body wt; these dosage regimens produced maternal serum nicotine concentrations of 19 +/- 6 and 35 +/- 8 ng/ml, respectively. Thus our experiments define the threshold level of maternal nicotine that significantly impairs protective responses of 5- to 6-day-old rat pups to intermittent hypoxia such as may occur in human infants during episodes of prolonged sleep apnea or positional asphyxia.

   CONSUMPTION; EXPOSURE; GLUTATHIONE
AB Two peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated, in part, with severe oxidative damage. NAP and ADNF-9 have been shown to exhibit antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [H-3] NAPVSIPQ indicated that 39% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI Restless legs syndrome and sleep disturbance during pregnancy: The role
   of folate and iron
SO JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH & GENDER-BASED MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; PERGOLIDE
AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurosensory disorder that typically begins in the evening and often prevents a person from falling asleep. It has been associated with iron deficiency anemia and dopaminergic pathways and is often treated with iron infusion or dopamine agonists. The purpose of this secondary analysis of longitudinal data collected on women before, during, and after pregnancy is to document the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy, contrast its effect on sleep and mood state, and explore the role of folate and iron in the expression of RLS, specifically during the third trimester when the syndrome is most distressing. The prevalence increased from 0 during preconception to 23% (n = 7) during the third trimester of pregnancy. Only 1 subject continued to experience RLS after delivery. Compared with those without complaints of restless legs, those with restless legs had low serum ferritin at preconception and significantly lower folate levels during preconception and at each trimester. In addition, time to sleep onset was significantly delayed and depressed mood was significantly higher in the RLS group. Rather than indicators of iron deficiency anemia (serum ferritin, serum iron, and hemoglobin) or pernicious anemia (vitamin B-12), if was reduced serum folate level that was associated with RLS in this sample of pregnant women. Findings indicate a need to reconsider recommendations about the normal ranges of serum ferritin and serum folate levels during pregnancy to minimize the complaints of restless legs and promote more consolidated sleep and better daytime mood state during pregnancy.

AB In the newborn, presence of sleep-wake cycles indicates integrity and maturity of the central nervous system. By spectral EEG analysis and polygraphic recordings subtle variations of EEG background activity and behavioural patterns corresponding to early sleep-wake cycles have been found in preterm infants as young as 27 weeks of gestation. The emergence of sleep-wake cycles at early gestational ages may have a positive predictive value for long-term neurological outcome. Sleep-wake cycles and their significance for later outcome have not been studied in very preterm infants so far. Accordingly, we prospectively investigated maturational changes of EEG activity and sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants below 30 weeks of gestational age using the Cerebral Function Monitor, an amplitude-integrated EEG. We present preliminary data on the emergence of sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants from this ongoing study. Of 100 infants enrolled during a 1-year period, 38 infants without neurological complications were included in the reference group. In this group (mean gestational age 27 weeks), we observed cyclical variations of EEG background activity resembling early sleep-wake cycles at a mean gestational age of 28 weeks and a median postnatal age of 6 days. It is hypothesised that these cyclical variations of EEG background activity may represent switches between thalamo-cortical and neo-cortical pattern generators and indicate integrity of central nervous system function. Amplitude-integrated EEG may thus serve as a useful noninvasive test for brain function in preterm infants.

ID APNEA; MORTALITY
AB Three studies were undertaken: (i) a nation-wide case-control study for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), with 393 cases and 1592 controls, examined the association between parental reported apnoea and SIDS; (ii) a case-short study, with 84 cases of parental reported apnoea and 1502 controls, aimed to identify risk factors for apnoea; and (ii) national hospital admission data for ALTE and national SIDS mortality data were compared for the years 1986 to 1994. Parental reported apnoea was associated with a significant increased risk of SIDS [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 3.09]. The population attributable risk was 8%. There was a significant increased risk for parental reported apnoea in infants who did not die after adjustment for potential confounders with maternal smokers, short gestation and admission to the neonatal unit. There was no association with prone sleeping position, co-sleeping and bottle feeding. The mean annual admission rate for ALTE was 9.4/1000 live births. This did not change significantly over the study period (1986-1994). In contrast, the SIDS mortality rate decreased from over 4/1000 to 2.1/1000. Admission rates were higher for Maori infants and boys. Conclusion: It may be concluded that the relationship between parental reported apnoea and SIDS is tenuous.

DE Angelman syndrome; EEG; fertility; Prader-Willi syndrome; pregnancy
ID IMPRINTED EXPRESSION
AB We report on a 32-y-old woman with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and her daughter with Angelman syndrome (AS). PWS in the mother was confirmed as due to a deletion of 15q11-q13, and molecular analysis in the neonate indicated an inherited maternal deletion of the same region. Features of AS in early infancy, such as jerky movements, feeding problems and poor sleep, were observed. At 5 mo of age, a triphasic high voltage EEG pattern was reported.
   Conclusions: This case confirms the non-Mendelian inheritance of PWS and AS and, in addition to previous reports, provides evidence of fertility in PWS women. We recommend the provision of information regarding fertility in females with PWS to parents, guardians and individuals with PWS, and frequent EEG monitoring for early AS diagnosis. Given the different genetic aetiologies for PWS and AS, cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis is strongly indicated for counselling and risk estimation.

AB A theory based on the model of how the auditory-brain system perceive primary sensations is used to explain the differential effects of noise and music signals on the sleep of babies and on the performance of mental tasks by children. In a previous study by Ando and Hattori, [1], it was found that sleeping babies (2-4 months old) whose mothers had begun living in a noisy area before conception or during the first five months of pregnancy did not react to daily aircraft noise but did react to music. In another previous study by Ando et al. [2], the percentage of the pupils in "V-type relaxation" state during an adding task in a quiet living area was much greater when pupils heard music than when they heard noise. These phenomena are explained here by the difference between the temporal factors extracted from kthe running autocorrelation Function of the noise and music signals. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB The recent miniaturization of implantable radiotelemetric devices offers the possibility of an accurate, reliable, and simple phenotyping tool for longterm, hands-off measurement of blood pressure in unrestrained, untethered mice; however, use has been limited because of high morbidity and mortality in all but larger-than-average mice. Also, because the device was developed for abdominal aorta implantation at the renal artery level, its use has not been feasible in studies where infrarenal blood flow is critical, i.e., in pregnant mice. We provide details of a very successful alternative approach for implanting radio-telemeters in mice, whereby thoracic aortic implantation of the pressure-sensing catheter is combined with subcutaneous placement of the transmitter body along the right flank. We used female C57/BL6 (C57) or BPH/5 mice, a strain derived from the cross of inbred hypertensive and hypotensive mouse strains. We show that this is a reliable procedure for providing high-fidelity mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings for 50-60 days in mice weighing 22 g on average but as small as 17 g. No morbidity or mortality was observed in either strain using this procedure. Importantly, neither strain fully recovered from anesthesia and surgery, as indicated by a return of normal circadian rhythms, until 5-7 days postsurgery. This was also reflected in significantly elevated baseline MAP and HR levels in both strains during this recovery period. Moreover, strain-related differences in relative increases in MAP during the first 5 days of recovery masked the significant elevation in BPH/5 baseline MAP (vs. C57) observed in fully recovered mice. This suggests that methods must allow at least 5-7 days recovery from surgery to provide accurate cardiovascular (CV) phenotyping in mice. Finally, we show that CV parameters can be monitored continuously before, during, and after pregnancy in mice using this alternative implantation approach. The device did not interfere with conception, gestation, delivery, or postnatal care of pups. These results demonstrate the feasibility of stress-free, long-term monitoring of CV parameters in pregnant or nonpregnant mice of typical size and offer exciting possibilities for application in CV functional genomic research.

This review examines sleep in normal pregnancy; discusses the physiologic bases for alterations in sleep, including hormonal and mechanical factors; and correlates these factors with changes in sleep of pregnant women, as determined subjectively by surveys and objectively by polysomnographic studies. The changes in respiratory physiology during pregnancy, the possible predisposition of the pregnant woman to sleep-disordered breathing because of these changes, and results of published studies of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy are discussed. Finally, the effect of pregnancy on other sleep disorders and the management of these sleep disorders during pregnancy are outlined, including changes in management necessitated by this state. The paucity of available data and the need for further studies of incidence and outcomes of sleep disorders in the pregnant woman are emphasized.

ID PROZAC TOXICITY; FLUOXETINE
AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a new group of antidepressants used in mild to moderate cases of depression. In studies evaluating the safety of SSRIs during pregnancy, no increase in major anomalies has been reported. This might have led to increasing off-label prescription of SSRIs to pregnant women. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome commonly occurs in infants exposed during the third trimester to drugs known to cause addiction. We report five cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome after third trimester in utero SSRI exposure. In three cases the mother used paroxetine in doses from 10 to 40 mg, one mother used citalopram 30 mg, and one mother fluoxetine 20 mg. Withdrawal symptoms occurred within few days after birth and lasted up to one month after birth. Four of the infants needed treatment with chlorpromazine. Symptoms were irritability, constant crying, shivering. increased tonus, eating and sleeping difficulties and convulsions.
   Conclusion: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome can occur after third trimester in utero SSRI exposure. Further research should focus on whether it is safe to use SSRIs during the last trimester. All neonates exposed to SSRIs during the last trimester should be followed-up closely for withdrawal symptoms after birth.

ID SLEEP-POSITION; HEALTH; OUTCOMES; CLINICS
AB Objectives. This study analyzed the relationship between prenatal maternal smoking and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and examined the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions.
   Methods. All recorded US singleton SIDS deaths from the 1995 birth cohort with birthweight exceeding 500 g were investigated. Infants with available maternal smoking data were matched with controls who survived to I year. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate SIDS risks and accompanying cost-effectiveness.
   Results. A total of 23.6% of singleton SIDS deaths appear to be attributable to prenatal maternal smoking. Typical cessation services available to all pregnant smokers could avert 108 SIDS deaths annually, at an estimated cost of $210 500 per life saved.
   Conclusions. Typical prenatal smoking cessation programs are highly cost-effective but have limited impact on the population incidence of SIDS.

AB Objective To determine whether low dose xylazine with ketamine reduces the concentrations of cortisol and prolactin in sheep postoperatively and to characterise the effects of the drugs on behaviour during recovery.
   Design Analysis of variance was used to compare the effects of anaesthesia, surgery and combined ketamine/xylazine treatment on the plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations and on behavioural variables in pregnant ewes subjected to abdominal surgery.
   Procedure Twelve ewes were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine/xylazine or placebo in association with anaesthesia and surgery. Both groups of ewes underwent anaesthesia alone followed a week later by anaesthesia with laparotomy and hysterotomy. Plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations were assayed during these procedures and for 5 days afterwards. Behavioural observations were made remotely during recovery from anaesthesia and anaesthesia plus surgery.
   Results The concentrations of cortisol in the plasma of pregnant ewes undergoing surgery were increased by preoperative handling and the onset of thiopentone/halothane anaesthesia, with a further increase during surgery (P = 0.033). Cortisol concentrations decreased over the first four postoperative hours (P = 0.029) and were normal by 24 h. The drug treatment did not affect the immediate responses of ewes to anaesthesia or surgery, although treated ewes had lower cortisol concentrations than saline-treated controls over the first five postoperative days (P = 0.018).
   Prolactin concentrations increased in response to anaesthesia (P = 0.047), but were not affected by surgery or the drug treatment.
   Drug-treated ewes had prolonged sleeping time after surgery (P = 0.002), but they took no longer to stand than saline-treated controls and required fewer attempts to stand successfully (P = 0.025).
   Conclusion At the doses used, ketamine and xylazine did not mitigate the immediate endocrine consequences of surgery but the behavioural data provide a basis for further investigations that may lead to improvements in analgesic treatments.

AB The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants, born at term and this increase is inversely related to gestational age. The incidence and severity of apnoea of prematurity, are also inversely related to gestational age. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia affected the maturation of arousal responses. Twenty-five premature infants were studied. A perinatal risk score was determined for each infant and infants were divided into those with a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia (n = 16) and those without (n = 9). All infants were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) a preterm study around 36 weeks gestation. (b) within 3 weeks of term, and (c) 2-3 months: post-term. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cmH(2)O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares: were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Arousal thresholds were elevated in apnoeic infants compared to control infants in both AS (P < 0.05) and QS (P < 0.001) at the term study and in QS at 2-3 months post-term (P < 0.01). In addition. arousal thresholds were positively correlated with perinatal risk score in both sleep states, in all studies, with the exception of AS at 2-3 months when all infants were readily arouseable. We conclude that a history of prematurity with neonatal apnoea has a persisting effect on decreasing arousabilty from sleep and these infants may be at (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB 1. We determined the effects of betamethasone on the fetal sheep electrocorticogram (ECoG) using linear (power spectral) and non-linear analysis. For non-linear analysis we used an algorithm based on the Wolf algorithm for the estimation of the leading Lyapunov exponent which calculates a,prediction error based on the course of the time series in the phase space. A high prediction error stands for low predictibility or low regularity and vice versa.
   2. After 48 h of baseline recordings, vehicle (n = 6) or betamethasone (n = 7) at 10 mug h(-1) was infused over 48 h to the sheep fetus at 128 days gestational age (0.87 of gestation).
   3. ECoG spectral analysis revealed no difference in power spectrum between vehicle- and betamethasone-treated fetuses. The prediction error of the ECoG during REM sleep was higher than during non-REM or quiet sleep in both groups (P < 0.0001) revealing lower causality of brain activity during REM sleep. During REM sleep, prediction error significantly decreased 18-24 h after onset of betamethasone treatment (P < 0.05) and returned to baseline values within the following 24 h of continued betamethasone treatment. No ECoG changes were found during quiet sleep. Non-linear ECoG changes during metabolically active REM sleep accompanied the previously described decrease in cerebral blood flow.
   4. These results suggest that betamethasone in doses used in perinatal medicine acutely alters complex neuronal activity.

AB Objective: To assess maternal blood pressure (BP) responses to working outside the home in late pregnancy, using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.
   Methods: Our paired observational study involved 24hour ambulatory BP monitoring of 100 normotensive women (51 primiparas, 49 multiparas) on work and nonwork days. Mean BP differences were calculated for working, postworking, sleeping, and 24-hour periods on both days. Main outcome measures were BP differences between work and nonwork days and subsequent pregnancy hypertension. Comparisons in BP between work and nonwork days were done with Student paired t test. Comparisons between study subgroups were done with unpaired t test. Potential predictors of change in BF were examined using multiple linear regression.
   Results: During job time, BP was significantly higher on work days than on nonwork days. The mean increase in BP associated with work was 2.6 mmHg (systolic BP, P < .001), 2.8 mmHg (diastolic BP, P < .001), and 2.9 mmHg (mean arterial BP, P < .001). Those observations were independent of parity. More than 10% of our subjects had increased mean arterial BP of 10 mmHg or more during job time on work days compared with nonwork days. Higher absolute BP levels (regression coefficient 0.21, P = .04) and greater perceived job stress (regression coefficient 1.34, P = .04) correlated positively with BP increases at work. Twelve women developed hypertension. Those women had a larger increase on work days in mean systolic (6.6 mmHg compared with 2.1 mmHg, P = .013), mean diastolic (6.4 mmKg compared with 2.3 mmHg, P = .014), and mean arterial (7.4 mmHg compared with 2.3 mmHg, P = .002) BP compared with normotensive women. The magnitude of BP responses to work was a significant predictor of pregnancy hypertension, independent of absolute BP level.
   Conclusion: Blood pressure increased in women when they worked outside the home. The effect of maternal work is important when treating pregnancy hypertension. Ambulatory BP monitoring makes assessment of maternal BP responses to work a practical clinical option. (C) 2001 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB Objective. To assess the role of parental bedsharing in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)-like deaths, this study examines the hypothesis that, compared with other SIDS cases, the age distribution of deaths associated with bedsharing should be lower in younger, less vigorous infants.
   Methods. For 84 SIDS cases in Cleveland, Ohio, 1992 to 1996, age at death, maternal weight, and other risk factors for SIDS were compared for cases grouped according to bedsharing status.
   Results. Mean ages at death were 9.1 weeks for 30 bedsharing and 12.7 for 54 nonbedsharing cases, counting 10 with missing information as nonbedsharing. Mean pregravid weights of bedsharing mothers exceeded those of nonbedsharing mothers (84.1 vs 67.0 kg). Mean ages at death for nonbedsharing infants, bedsharing infants of smaller mothers, and bedsharing infants of larger mothers were 12.7, 10.3, and 7.6 weeks, respectively. Large maternal size did not affect age at death in the absence of bedsharing.
   Conclusions. By demonstrating that among an urban population at high risk for SIDS, bedsharing is strongly associated with a younger age at death, independent of any other factors, this study provides evidence of a relationship between some SIDS-like deaths and parent-infant bedsharing, particularly if the parent is large.

   RLS; PERGOLIDE; SLEEP
AB Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a well-defined symptom complex and is frequently associated with sleep disturbance and a recognized family history. It occurs either as idiopathic RLS or in association with many medical, neurological or vascular disorders. The neurological examination and routine investigations in idiopathic RLS are normal. Polysomnography supports the diagnosis of RLS by documenting the associated sleep disturbances and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). Although MRI studies disclose no intracerebral lesions, recent Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies point to some involvement of the basal and red nuclei and the cerebellum. No definitive etiology is known for this condition, but several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. There is supportive evidence that RLS is a Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction, suggesting widespread involvement of the descending dopaminergic (DA) pathways, possibly originating in the diencephalon or upper brainstem. This is corroborated by the successful treatment of RLS with DA agents, sedatives, and neurotransmitters. However, RLS can also occur with spinal disorders and spinal cord lesions implying the existence of a spinal generator. The incidence of RLS in pregnancy is well known and its association with vascular disorders supports another mechanism in some patients. The primary treatment of RLS is largely symptomatic and quite effective with DA agents, DA agonists, opioids and other neurotransmitters. The treatment of RLS associated with various diseases is aimed at the correction of the underlying pathological or deficiency states. Antidepressant medications frequently precipitate or worsen the condition of RLS.

AB Background. The proportion of women who stop smoking during pregnancy has varied between 17 and 40% percent in Sweden with a tendency of lower prevalence in recent years. The aim of the present study was to examine the factors that might influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy.
   Method. One hundred and two women were interviewed shortly after their first visit to the antenatal clinic and a second time approximately one month after delivery. Two women who had late spontaneous abortions were excluded. The women were asked about background factors, smoking habits of their parents, smoking history and current smoking habits. The carbon monoxide in expiratory air was measured to verify reported smoking habits.
   Results. Fifty-six of the 100 participating women had stopped smoking before the second interview. Having started smoking at an older age, having no previous children, smoking few cigarettes, a higher level of education, positive support from the partner and having lived with non-smoking parents were all associated with stopping smoking when tested as single factors. Reported smoking habits could be verified. Age, smoking habits of the partner, passive smoking at work, quality of sleep, general perceived health, length of sick-leave or amount of nausea were not correlated to stopping smoking.
   Conclusion. The presence of several factors found to influence stopping smoking during pregnancy, and the tendency for smoking habits to be passed over to the new generation, are reasons for comprehensive and individualized, anti-smoking support.

AB The role of gender and the menstrual cycle in small bowel motility has not been clearly elucidated. Jejunal motility was recorded with a nasojejunal catheter incorporating five solid-state pressure transducers in ambulatory menstruating women and men of comparable age over 24 h. All women were studied twice, in the early follicular (early-F) and midluteal (mid-L) phases of the menstrual cycle, verified by determining serum levels of gonadal steroids and gonadotropins. The propagation velocity of phase III was slow and the contraction amplitude was high in both menstrual cycle phases compared with men, and these parameters were correlated with serum estrogen levels in the mid-L phase. In the early-F phase, migrating motor complex (MMC) cycle duration during sleep was long compared with other groups and positively correlated with estrogen concentrations, whereas in the mid-L phase MMC cycle duration during sleep was negatively correlated with serum progesterone levels. In all groups, the frequency of phase III contractions was low and the intercontractile interval measured from pressure peak to peak was long during sleep compared with the awake state. Postprandial motility did not display gender difference in any parameter examined. The results demonstrate that the majority of patterns of motility are similar in menstruating women and men, whereas certain aspects of the MMC, most conspicuously propagation velocity and phase III contraction amplitude, differ. We have also documented circadian variation of phase III contraction frequency in both women and men.

   ANSWER It is not always possible to isolate the effect of marijuana exposure from other possible confounders on pregnancy outcome. Although marijuana is not an established human teratogen recent well conducted studies suggest it might have subtle negative effects on neurobehavioural outcomes, including sleep disturbances, impaired visual problem solving, hyperactivity, impassivity, inattention and increased delinquency.

AB Introduction. The restless legs syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation in the legs which causes an imperative need to move the legs and is therefore considered to be a disorder of movement. When it appears before going to sleep, it may interfere with falling asleep and lead to a sleep-deficit. Development and conclusions. It is a clinical condition with a satisfactory treatment, and improvement of the associated sleep disorder. The etiology is unknown, sometimes it is familial, The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Polysomnography is not necessary unless one suspects an associated disorder of periodic leg movements. Treatment is by dopaminergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant drugs or clonidine.

AB Objective: We investigated the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the Tyrol before and after an intervention campaign.
   Patients and methods. Descriptive characteristics and risk factors of SIDS before the campaign were assessed in a retrospective case-control study (1984 to 1994). in April 1994 a country-wide information campaign on modifiable risk behaviours was initiated. Thereafter we prospectively collected data on child care practices four to six weeks after birth for all infants born in the Tyrol (participation rate 72%; n = 28,361) and evaluated new SIDS cases (1994 to 1998). For this purpose two questionnaires were used, one with 96 items for the evaluation of all SIDS cases and assessment of child care practices before 1994, and the other with 24 items for prospective data collection.
   Results: The incidence of SIDS decreased from 1.83 (mean incidence, 1984-1994) to 0.4/1000 live births immediately after the campaign and remained low until 1998. The frequency of maternal smoking during pregnancy declined (22.9% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.01), as did the prevalence of the prone sleeping position (53.7% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) and of non-breastfeeding (21.3% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001). All these variables were prominent risk factors for SIDS before the campaign and remained significant thereafter. On account of the markedly reduced prevalence of the prone sleeping position, smoking became the most common SIDS risk factor. The prevalence of sleeping on the side significantly increased (5.1% vs. 36.4%, p < 0.001) and the social status of mothers of SIDS infants tended to be tower than that before the campaign. The clear winter preponderance of SIDS which was evident before the campaign disappeared, or was even reversed.
   Conclusions: Our study documents the long-term efficacy of a low-cost intervention campaign by way of health education. Further efforts must be directed toward lower social classes, thereby focusing on maternal smoking and avoidance of the side sleeping position.

AB Although pregnant women are discouraged from drinking alcohol because of alcohol's detrimental effect on fetal development, the lore of many cultures encourages lactating women to drink alcohol to optimize breast milk production and infant nutrition. In contrast to this folklore, however, studies demonstrate that maternal alcohol consumption may slightly reduce milk production. Furthermore, some of the alcohol consumed by a lactating woman is transferred to her milk and thus consumed by the infant. This alcohol consumption may adversely affect the infant's sleep and gross motor development and influence early learning about alcohol. Based on this science, it would seem that the recommendation for a nursing mother to drink a glass of beer or wine shortly before nursing may actually be counterproductive.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the definition of daytime and nighttime on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in pregnancy. To determine the prevalence of a < 10% decrease in mean arterial pressure with sleep (nondipper) in pregnancy and the consistency of nondipper status throughout pregnancy. In a prospective, longitudinal study, 102 pregnant woman underwent 24-h ABP monitoring and recorded sleep patterns at less than or equal to 14, 19 to 22, 27 to 30, 35 to 37 weeks' gestation and 5 to 9 weeks' postpartum Nighttime was defined by arbitrary hours or actual periods of sleep. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements using the different definitions of nighttime were compared in the total cohort and individual women. Nondipper status of each woman was determined throughout pregnancy and postpartum. At 35 to 37 weeks' gestation, 19% of women napped during the day and 20% were awake during the night. Throughout pregnancy, mean day and night systolic and diastolic ABP measurements were similar whether daytime and nighttime were defined by arbitrary hours or by sleep periods. In individuals, the use of arbitrary hours (day 07:00 to 21:59, night 22:00 to 06:59) compared to sleep periods to define day and night resulted in differences in daytime systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of up to 4 and 5 mm Hg, respectively. Similarly there were individual differences in nighttime SEP up to 10 mm Hg and DBP up to ii mm Hg. A third of women were nondippers at least once during pregnancy, but only two women were consistent nondippers. The different definitions of day and night did not change group ABP measurements, but resulted in significant variation in ABP measurements in individual pregnant women. Nondippers were common and nondipper status frequently changed during pregnancy. (C) 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

AB Background-From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, there was a significant rise in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Scandinavia. Following the risk reducing campaign, the incidence has fallen to about the same level as in 1973.
   Aims-To identify the changes that have occurred in the epidemiology of SIDS.
   Methods-We compared the Swedish part of the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study (NESS), covering the years 1992-1995, with two earlier, descriptive studies during this period. To assess the changing effects of risk factors, we analysed data from the Medical Birth Registry of Sweden, covering the years 1973-1996.
   Results-There was a predominance of deaths during weekends in the 1970s and 1990s. The seasonal variation was most notable in the 1980s. The proportion of young mothers decreased from 14% to 5%. Cohabitation (living with the biological father) was as frequent in the 1990s as in the 1970s. The prevalence of high parity, admissions to neonatal wards, low birth weight, prematurity, and multiple pregnancies were all increased in the 1990s compared to the 1970s. No significant change in the prevalence of previous apparent life threatening events was found. Deaths occurring in cars diminished from 10% to below 2%. In the data from the Medical Birth Registry of Sweden, there were significantly increased odds ratios after the risk reducing campaign of the risk factors smoking during early pregnancy and preterm birth. We could find no increased effects of maternal age, parity, or being small for gestational age over time. The rate of deaths at weekends remained increased; the median age at death fell from 90 to 60 days. Seasonal variation was less notable in the periods of low incidence.

AB One family group of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) maintained in captivity under natural environmental conditions (Natal, Brazil, 05 degrees 46'S, 35 degrees 12'W) was observed by focal sampling at two non-consecutive days per week during two nonconsecutive pregnancies (pregnancy 1: the last 8 fortnights before parturition; pregnancy 2: the last 5 ones) and after parturition (4 fortnights for both). The hourly percentiles of the duration of self-grooming and allogrooming interactions of the reproductive pair were submitted to Cosinor analysis for the 24-h period (p less than or equal to 0.05). The reproductive female's progesterone was monitored by fecal collection twice a week between 7: 00 h to 9: 00 h. Levels of progesterone were determined by ELISA method. During pregnancy 1, all interactions of the reproductive pair showed a 24-h statistically significant period. However, after parturition this periodicity is not present in some behaviors of the reproductive male. This animal presents the 24-h periodicity only toward to the reproductive female, the subadult son and to the newborns. Hormonal levels of the reproductive female showed isolated increases above 100 ng/g at the second and third fortnight after parturition, but did not characterize ovulation. Between pregnancy 1 and 2, the family was increased by the birth of four animals. During pregnancy 2, a statistically significant 24-h period was find only in self-grooming of the reproductive male and female, and in the interactions between the reproductive pair. Also, in the interactions of the reproductive male with only one of the juvenile son. After parturition the reproductive female ovulated at the second fortnight and became pregnant again. At this time, those interactions still have a 24-h period, except in grooming directed to the juvenile son by the reproductive male. As in the first post-partum, grooming directed to the newborns showed statistically significant 24-h period. These results suggest that the reproductive pair performs 24-h rhythmic grooming interactions only with some animals, supposed to be the preferential grooming partners. Furthermore, the temporal grooming expression in common marmosets may be affected by the reproductive condition (progesterone levels) of the reproductive female, by the care of newborn after parturition and the group size.

AB Rat or hamster pups exposed to constant light or darkness since birth exhibit many circadian rhythms synchronized with those of the mother. During early development, a number of cues derived from the maternal circadian system synchronize the fetal and neonatal circadian clock. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation during early pregnancy disrupts maternal synchronization of parotid alpha -amylase and testicular malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythms in rat pups. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation was used to study potential agents able to synchronize the fetal or neonatal circadian clock. Melatonin injection to denervated pregnant mothers prevents the pineal sympathetic denervation effect on those circadian rhythms. We now studied the synchronizing effect of a benzodiazepine compound, diazepam. This GABA(A) agonist synchronized testicular malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity of pups when it was injected to sympathetic denervated pregnant dams (a daily dose at 07:00 or 19:00 h from the 14(th) to the 20(th) day of gestation) or orally administered to the pups (a daily dose at 19: 00 h from the 10(th) to 24(th) day of life). Co-injection of diazepam and GABA(A) antagonist, flumazenil, blocked the synchronizing effect of diazepam. The results demonstrate that diazepam has a synchronizing effect on the development of the circadian clock in rats and suggest that modulation of maternal GABA(A) could participate in mammalian maternal synchronization.

AB It is now recognized that high-level impulse noises penetrate the uterus of pregnant sheep, elevate thresholds of fetal auditory-evoked potential and produce damage to fetal inner ear hair cells. However, little is known about functional effects of airborne impulse noise on the late-term fetus. In the present study, the effects of a series of 20 impulses on the behavioral state of 6 fetal sheep were tested, Noise impulses produced 169.3 peak sound pressure level (pSPL) in air. Peak levels recorded near the fetal head averaged 161.1 dB. Impulses delivered to the fetus during periods of NREM sleep resulted in a decrease in average fetal heart rate (FHR) from 185 +/- 22 beats/min (bpm) before stimulation to 174 +/- 23 bpm 2-5 s after stimulation (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, an FHR acceleration occurred (before stimulation: 177 <plus/minus> 24 bpm, after stimulation: 189 +/- 31 bpm; p < 0.05). Impulse exposure during NREM sleep resulted in reductions in delta-, theta- and alpha-band powers. As a consequence, total power decreased from 100 to 72 <plus/minus> 16% (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, stimulation provoked a short decrease in total band power from 100 to 73 <plus/minus> 20% and a similar decrease in the theta- and beta-band powers. The results indicated that impulse noise evoked short-term alterations in FHR and cortical activity. These changes were mediated by auditory brain stem activation that led to cortical desynchronization during both NREM and REM sleep in late-term fetal sheep. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objective To lay the basis for planning an improved malaria control programme in Bungoma District, Kenya.
   Methods By means of a cluster sample household survey an investigation was conducted into the home management of febrile children, the use of bednets, and attendance at antenatal clinics,
   Findings Female caters provided information on 314 recently febrile children under 5 years of age, of whom 43% received care at a health facility, 47% received an antimalarial drug at home, and 25% received neither. Of the antimalarial treatments given at home, 91% were started by the second day of fever and 92% were with chloroquine, the nationally recommended antimalarial at the time. The recommended dosage of chloroquine to be administered over three days was 25 mg/kg but the median chloroquine tablet or syrup dosage given over the first three days of treatment was 15 mg/kg. The total dosages ranged from 2.5 mg/kg to 82 mg/kg, administered over one to five days. The dosages were lower when syrup was administered than when tablets were used. Only 5% of children under 5 years of age slept under a bednet. No bednets had been treated with insecticide since purchase. At least two antenatal visits were made by 91% of pregnant women.
   Conclusions Carers are major and prompt providers of antimalarial treatment. Home treatment practices should be strengthened and endorsed when prompt treatment at a health facility is impossible. The administration of incorrect dosages, which proved common with chloroquine, may occur less frequently with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, as its dosage regimen is simpler. High levels of utilization of antenatal clinics afford the opportunity to achieve good coverage with presumptive intermittent malaria treatments during pregnancy, and to reach the goal of widespread bednet use by pregnant women and children by distributing nets during antenatal clinic visits.

AB During the first weeks of life, preterm neonates show fewer circadian rhythms in their physiological parameters than full-term neonates. To determine whether preterm neonates differ in their temporal adaptation to the day-night cycle from full-term neonates at the early age of 1 week, we compared activity-rest behavior of both groups. Activity-rest behavior of 10 neurologically healthy preterm neonates (born in 34th to 36th week of gestation) and 10 neurologically healthy full-term neonates (born in 37th to 42nd week of gestation) was monitored longitudinally for 8 successive days in the first 2 weeks of life. Actigraphy was used to register and display time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small actometers, which resemble a wristwatch. Nursing/feeding was recorded using the actometer's integrated event marker button. Recordings for preterm neonates were conducted in the hospital; recordings for full-term neonates were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Amounts of daily sleep time, nightly sleep time, and sleep time during 24h were compared. Nursing/feeding epochs were also analyzed for 5 preterm and 5 full-term neonates to compare their food intake behavior. The majority of preterm neonates showed a multitude of ultradian frequencies in their spectra. In contrast, several full-term neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency. In preterm neonates, average nightly sleep and average daily sleep of all recorded days were very similar, but after the fourth day of life, only average nightly sleep increased. In full-term neonates, average nightly and daily sleep time of all recorded days differed by about lh. Average sleep time during 24h for preterm and full-term neonates was similar. Preterm neonates showed longer intervals between events of food intake than full-term neonates. The circadian peaks in the frequency spectra of full-term neonates may indicate the initial adaptation in the first week of life to a 24h day. This is in agreement with our results concerning the different durations of nightly and daily sleep. The increase in nightly sleep time of preterm neonates may be attributed to the progressing adaptation to a circadian activity-rest pattern.

ID HYPERTENSION; PREECLAMPSIA
AB Objective. To investigate the acceptability of an ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitor (SpaceLabs 90207) and a self-initiated blood pressure monitor (Omron HEM-705CP) to pregnant women.
   Methods. Acceptability of the SpaceLabs 90207 and Omron HEM-705CP monitors was evaluated, using a modified British Hypertension Device assessment form, by (1) healthy, pregnant women at < 15 weeks (n = 120), 35-37 weeks (n = 81), and 5-9 weeks postpartum (n = 86); and (2) women with preeclampsia (n = 52).
   Main Outcome Measures. A monitor was acceptable if a woman graded the overall impression as "good" or "very good."
   Results. Healthy women at < 15 and 35-37 weeks' gestation and preeclamptic women reported the SpaceLabs 90207 monitor caused discomfort in 54%, 52%, and 60%, interfered with activities in 38%, 40%, and 23%, and disturbed sleep in 62%, 52% and 31%, respectively. Fewer than 12% in any group reported these problems with the Omron HEM-705CP monitor. In the 78 women who evaluated both monitors at 35-37 weeks, the SpaceLabs 90207 and Omron HEM-705CP were acceptable to 78% and 95% of healthy women, respectively (p = 0.005). Women with preeclampsia rated the SpaceLabs 90207 as "bad" or "fair" (14%), "good" (58%), and "very good" (28%) compared with "bad" or "fair" (8%), "good" (28%), and "very good" (64%) for the Omron HEM-705CP monitor (p = 0.009).
   Conclusions. Pregnant women found the less intensive blood pressure monitoring with the Omron HEM-705CP more acceptable than the 24-h ABP monitoring with the SpaceLabs 90207. If accurate self-initiated blood pressure devices become available, pregnant women would prefer this method of home blood pressure monitoring.

DT Article
AB The effects of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy on behavioral and physiological measures of arousal were examined in a sample of 50 neonates. After the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and maternal demographic variables were statistically controlled, regression analyses showed that maternal smoking during pregnancy was predictive of higher heart rates overall and during quiet and active sleep. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was also predictive of lower heart rate variability and an increased number of tremors and changes in behavioral state. These findings suggest that maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy affects the regulation of spontaneous autonomic activity in neonates.

AB Serum melatonin concentrations were studied in normal pregnant women and in women with several types of pathologic pregnancies, e.g., twins, preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Blood samples were collected from the material antecubital vein at 14:00 hr (daytime) and 02:00 hr (nighttime) during pregnancy, and also from the umbilical vein and artery immediately after delivery. Serum melatonin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Daytime serum melatonin levels in normal (single fetus, singleton) pregnancies were low. While the levels showed an increasing tendency toward the end of pregnancy, no statistically significant changes occurred. On the other hand, the nighttime serum melatonin levels increased after 24 weeks of gestation, with significantly (P < 0.01) high levels after 32 weeks; these values decreased to non-pregnant levels on the 2nd day of puerperium. Nighttime serum melatonin levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in twin pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation than in singleton pregnancies, whereas the patients with severe preeclampsia showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower serum melatonin levels than the mild preeclampsia or the normal pregnant women after 32 weeks of gestation. Melatonin concentrations in umbilical vessels showed a higher tendency in neonates who were born during at night compared with the other neonates; moreover, those in the umbilical artery were generally higher than those in the umbilical vein. The present results indicate that in humans, the maternal serum melatonin levels show a diurnal rhythm, which increases until the end of pregnancy, reflecting some pathologic states of the feto-placental unit. Fetuses may produce melatonin with a circadian rhythm.

AB BACKGROUND - Increased intracranial pressure can be attributable to many causes, including venous thrombosis and space-occupying lesions. However, a very common disorder is idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
   REVIEW SUMMARY - IIH is a condition seen in obese women of childbearing age. Although the incidence is 1 in 100,000 in normal-weight individuals, the incidence jumps to 20 in 100,000 in women who are obese. Symptoms include headache, transient visual obscurations, and tinnitus. IIH is characterized by papilledema. The diagnosis is made by a scanning procedure to rule out other causes of intracranial hypertension, including Venous sinus thrombosis. The spinal fluid examination must be performed to document elevated intracranial pressure and show that the spinal fluid is normal. Evaluations for this condition consist of a neuro-ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity and visual fields. The patient must be followed carefully for changes in visual field function, because treatment options are affected by the effect of intracranial pressure on visual function. Treatment is aimed at reducing pressure, usually medically, with diuretics such as acetazolamide. If a patient begins to lose vision, optic nerve sheath decompression or lumboperitoneal shunting has been suggested. Children may also lose vision; therefore, careful attention must also be paid to children with this condition. IIH has a profound impact on the quality of life for individual patients.
   CONCLUSIONS - Because IIH is a common disorder, all neurologists should be familiar with the symptoms and signs as well as the evaluation and treatment.

AB The demonstration of receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in several parts of rat brain suggested their novel functional role. Subsequent studies tested the effect of hCG (intraperitoneally or intracerebroventricularly) on brain arousal and different types of stress situations in an intact female rat model on the day of proestrus. Treatment resulted in changes of activity and several other behavioral patterns associated with sites of brain hCG/LH receptors. hCG given peripherally caused a longer sleeping time and a decreased activity level. Whereas administration of indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited the effects of hCG. hCG increased immunoreactive prostaglandin D-2 (PGD(2)) and decreased PGE(2) in brain areas controlling activity and sleep. hCG effects were probably mediated via prostaglandin pathways. After central hCG treatment, animals were less active and showed less exploratory behavior in an open-field box than the control animals. Taste and odor neophobias were dramatically decreased following central injection of hCG. hCG-treated rats were less anxious and exhibited a higher level of maternal interest than the controls. hCG treatment also had a beneficial effect against stress ulcer, which was prevented by pretreatment with antisense receptor oligonucleotide, suggesting a direct hCG receptor-mediated effect. In summary, because hCG can cross the blood-brain barrier, both peripheral administration and central administration affect several behavioral patterns. This effect is similar to treatment with anxiolytics and suggests the functional relevance of brain LH/hCG receptors. Some observed behavioral changes have parallels in pregnant women.

AB Background/Purpose: Over half of mothers with infants under one year are employed. This study explored the work experiences of women who returned to employment during the first year and the relationship of employment characteristics to maternal health.
   Design/Methods: Longitudinal, repeated measures during pregnancy and 1, 4, 8, and 12 months postpartum. Data on employment characteristics and health status gathered between 1990-95 by questionnaire from 149 employed, partnered women residing in a large urban area in the northwestern United States.
   Results: Work-family interference increased significantly between pregnancy and each postpartum occasion (p < .001). Between 19-34% of the variance in health status at each measurement occasion was explained by employment characteristics. Work-family interference consistently contributed to the variance in health status.
   Conclusions: New models are needed to further understand the complex interplay of work and family lives. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press. Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments of the American Psychiatric Association identified treatment of major depression during pregnancy as a priority area for improvement in clinical management. The goal of this article was to assist physicians in optimizing treatment plans for childbearing women.
   Method: The authors' work group developed a decision-making model designed to structure the information delivered to pregnant women in the context of the risk-benefit discussion. Perspectives of forensic and decision-making experts were incorporated.
   Results: The model directs the psychiatrist to structure the problem through diagnostic formulation and identification of treatment options for depression. Reproductive toxicity in five domains (intrauterine fetal death, physical malformations, growth impairment, behavioral teratogenicity, and neonatal toxicity) is reviewed for the potential somatic treatments. The illness (depression) also is characterized by symptoms of somatic dysregulation that compromise health during pregnancy The patient actively participates and provides her evaluation of the acceptability of the various treatments and outcomes. Her capacity to participate in this process provides evidence of competence to consent. Included in the decision-making process are the patient's significant others and obstetrical physician. The process is ongoing, with the need for incorporation of additional data as the pregnancy and treatment response progress.
   Conclusions: The conceptual model provides structure to a process that is frequently stressful for both patients and psychiatrists. By applying the model, clinicians will ensure that critical aspects of the risk-benefit discussion are included in their care of pregnant women.

AB Time patterns of activity-rest rhythms during and after pregnancy are increasingly recognised as important factors for the well-being and health of young families. This longitudinal study examined activity-rest patterns of couples during late pregnancy and subsequently the alterations in the periodic structure of parental and neonatal time patterns during the first four months after birth. Part I concentrates on the effects of late pregnancy and birth to the mother's rest-activity patterns and those of the father and, after birth, what time pattern the infant developed. Part II attempts to clarify how activity patterns of the entire family agree or disagree with each other and investigates how the infant synchronises with the environment that includes the process of parent-infant interaction. Activity data of, so far. seven families (father, mother and child) were continuously recorded using non-invasive Actiwatch units. Recordings of parental activity started at the beginning of the 37th week of gestation, and were continued in parallel with the infants' recordings in three series of three weeks each until four months after birth: 1st to 3rd week, 7th to 9th week and 13th to 15th week of life. In a standardised diary, record was kept of household routines, parental activities, type of feeding, initiation of sleep or waking up. Activity data of seven non-pregnant women were collected and used as a control. Irregular nocturnal activity epochs occurred frequently in pregnant women and were absent in non-pregnant women. Period lengthenings and shortenings of the circadian rhythms appeared in both parents from prepartum to postpartum. Activity at night increased from prepartum to postpartum in mothers and fathers. Three infants showed a marked circadian rhythm between day 3 and 14 after birth. All seven infants showed a predominant circadian rhythm between day 8 and 19 after birth. The onset of daytime activity of mothers and their infants corresponded well to each other. Postpartum frequency spectra of parents and child always had some ultradian components in common.
   Time patterns of activity-rest rhythms of couples and parents are shown to be altered during and after pregnancy and we suggest that the infants' adaptation to the environment begins during the first week that includes the process of mother-infant interaction.

AB The major clinical challenges facing women with bipolar illness, and the practitioners who care for them, are the management of rapid cycling and of the postpartum period. Among patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder, the treatment of depression is particularly problematic. The most commonly prescribed mood stabilizers are more potent antimanic than antidepressant agents, and the use of antidepressants may precipitate mania or rapid cycling. The availability of new anticonvulsant medications that may have both mood-stabilizing and antidepressant effects is an important development in this regard. In the postpartum period, women with bipolar illness are at uniquely high risk for relapse. The possible reasons for this high risk, and options for the management of pregnancy and the postpartum period in bipolar women, are discussed.

AB Hypophosphatasia is an inherited disease characterised by low tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) levels and skeletal defects. Diagnosis is usually made by measurement of serum total alkaline phosphatase (TALP, reference range 40-130 iu/l) and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA). Neutrophil all;aline phosphatase (NAP) scores (reference range 20-150) have been reported to be low in isolated cases, but no comparison has been made of the diagnostic value of NAP, TALP, PEA and PRP in hypophosphatasia. We undertook such a comparison in six families with hypophosphatasia. In four families (Families 1, 2, 5, 6) with the adult type of hypophosphatasia, inherited as autosomal dominant, the NAP score and TALP (<40 iu/l), were low, <20 and <40 iu/l respectively, in all affected subjects, though the PEA and PLP were not consistently abnormal. In one of the two families (Family 3) with the autosomal recessive type of hypophosphatasia an affected subject had low NAP as well as low TALP, PLP and PEA. In another family (Family 4) one of the heterozygotes had a low NAP while the other had a normal NAP score (45). A child in this family had a normal TALP level. Her low NAP score (15) supported her to be a possible heterozygote. NAP score is readily available from most laboratories and may be diagnostically helpful in hypophosphatasia.

ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; GYNECOLOGIC HEALTH; PREGNANCY; HISTORY
AB Background: Studies indicate that women abused by their intimate partners are at increased risk for a number of health problems and have increased rates of health care utilization. However, these findings are based mainly on studies using clinic or health plan populations. In this study, we examined the association between intimate partner abuse (IPA) and health concerns and health, care utilization in a population-based sample of adult women.
   Methods: We analyzed data on 2043 women aged 18 to 59 who participated in the 1998 Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a population-based health survey that included questions on IPA. IPA was defined as experiencing physical violence by, fear of, or control by an intimate partner. Consequences of IPA and self-rated health status and health care utilization of women experiencing TPA were examined.
   Results: A total of 6.3% of Massachusetts women aged IS to 59 reported IPA during the past year. Women experiencing IPA were more likely than other women to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HN testing, and condom use. Women experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance, but received routine health care at similar rates as other women.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that women in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for several serious emotional and physical health concerns. Most of these women are in routine contact with health care providers. These findings also suggest that the BRFSS may provide a valuable mechanism for tracking state-based TPA prevalence rates over time.

AB Background: Insomnia is the subjective complaint of poor sleep or an inadequate amount of sleep that adversely affects daily functioning. For the past 4 decades, treatment of insomnia has shifted away from the use of barbiturates toward the use of hypnotic agents: of the benzodiazepine class. However, problems associated with the latter leg, next-day sedation, rebound insomnia, dependence, and tolerance) have prompted development of other agents.
   Objective: This review describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine agent, zaleplon.
   Methods: Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles listed in MEDLINE(R) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences.
   Results: The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken less than or equal to2 hours before awakening without "hangover" effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15% -18%). Compared with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg.
   Conclusions: Insomnia has a substantial impact on daily functioning. If pharmacologic treatment is indicated for insomnia, the choice of an agent Should be guided by individual patient characteristics.

AB Drug development offers potential solutions to a number of tropical health diseases, although the expense of pharmaceutical research and lack of return on investment has limited the production of new agents. The greatest successes have been through the development of single dose therapy and mass treatment control programmes for a number of diseases. We review some of the current treatment regimens for malaria, intestinal helminth infection, onchocerciasis, filariasis and schistosomiasis, and their use in clinical practice.
   Geographical spread and emergence of drug resistant parasites have hindered the control of malaria, the most important global parasitic infection. Artemisinin compounds have proved effective antimalarial agents producing rapid reduction of parasite load and can be used in combination treatment regimens to combat multidrug resistance.
   Intestinal helminth infections are widespread, giving rise to nutritional deficiencies and impaired childhood cognitive development. Pregnant women in developing countries are at increased risk of morbidity. Treatment with a single dose benzimidazole such as albendazole or mebendazole has beneficial effects on morbidity and rates of transmission.
   Diethylcarbamazine has been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and human filariasis. A complicated escalating dose regimen over several weeks is associated with systemic and allergic reactions and may require corticosteroid cover. Simplified regimens for mass population treatment with ivermectin have proved useful and been used in combination with single dose albendazole and diethylcarbamazine. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control in West and Central Africa has been one of the most successful mass control programmes virtually eliminating new infections by a combination of chemotherapy, education and vector control.
   Schistosomiasis is of increasing importance as a result of the creation of new snail habitats by agricultural and economic development. Praziquantel has become the most widely available and effective chemotherapy for schistosomiasis. There have been a number of reports of persistent schistosome egg shedding after treatment posing concerns about the emergence of drug resistance.
   Eflornithine has been successfully used in patients with human trypanosomiasis failing melarsoprol therapy however expense and availability have limited its potential.
   Mass control treatment programmes have targeted schoolchildren, adolescents and pregnant women. The integration of schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, filariasis and helminth control programmes has been considered as a cost-effective method of delivering treatment. It is likely that future control will be based on this optimisation and integration of existing regimens, rather than the development of new agents.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of critically timed sleep deprivation in major mood disorders (MMD) occurring during pregnancy and postpartum. Methods: Nine women who met DSM-IV criteria for a MMD with onset during pregnancy or within I year postpartum underwent a trial of either early-night sleep deprivation (ESD), in which they were sleep deprived in the early part of one night and slept from 03:00-07:00 h, or late-night sleep deprivation (LSD), in which they were deprived of sleep in the latter part of one night and slept from 21:00-01:00 h. Mood was assessed before the night of sleep deprivation, after the night of sleep deprivation, and after a night of recovery sleep (sleep 22:30-06:30 h) by trained clinicians, blind to treatment condition, using standardized scales. Results: More patients responded to LSD (nine of 11 trials: 82%) compared with ESD (two of six trials: 33%) and they responded more after a night of recovery sleep (nine of Il nights: 82%) than after a night of sleep deprivation (six of 11 nights: 55%). Pregnant women were the only responders to ESD and the only nonresponders to LSD. Limitations: The small and heterogeneous sample size prevents us from making more definitive conclusions based on statistical analyses. Conclusions: Although the findings are preliminary, the results suggest that with further study, critically timed sleep deprivation interventions may benefit women with pregnancy or postpartum major mood disorders and potentially provide a viable alternative treatment modality for those women who are not candidates for pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic interventions. Such interventions are needed to help prevent the devastating effects of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period on the mother, infant, her family and society.

AB Objective: Epidemiological studies suggest that high birth weight might be associated with an increased risk of obesity later in life. Programming of metabolic, endocrine, and/or autonomic pathways during intrauterine development has been proposed to explain this association.
   Research Methods and Procedures: To determine the relationship between birth weight and body composition and energy metabolism later in life, we measured fat mass and fat-free mass (hydrodensitometry or double-energy X-ray absorptiometry), 24-hour energy expenditure, sleeping metabolic rate, and 24-hour respiratory quotient (respiratory chamber) in 272 adult nondiabetic Pima Indians (161 males/ III females, age 25 +/- 5 years, mean +/- SD). In these subjects, birth weight varied over a wide range (2000 to 5000 g). Individuals known to be offspring of diabetic pregnancies were excluded. In 44 of the 272 subjects, muscle sympathetic nerve activity was assessed by microneurography.
   Results: Birth weight was positively correlated with adult height (r = 0.20, p < 0.001) and fat-free mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.001), but not with fat mass (r = 0.01, not significant). Sleeping metabolic rate, adjusted for age, sex, fat-free mass, and fat mass, was negatively related to birth weight (r -0.13, p < 0.05), whereas adjusted 24-hour energy expenditure (r = 0.07, not significant) and 24-hour respiratory quotient (r = -0.09, not significant) were not. There was no relationship between birth weight and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (r = 0.12, not significant, n = 44).
   Discussion: In Pima Indians who are not offspring of diabetic pregnancies, high birth weight is associated with increased height and lean body mass, but not with increased adiposity later in life. Although high birth weight may be associated with relatively low resting energy expenditure, it is not associated with major abnormalities in 24-hour energy metabolism or with low muscle sympathetic nerve activity later in life.

AB Study Objectives: To test the hypotheses that: 1) an increase in endogenous progesterone levels during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle will alter REM sleep and mood state, and 2) a decrease in endogenous progesterone levels during postpartum will also alter REM sleep and mood state.
   Design: A longitudinal descriptive study utilizing ambulatory polysomnography for two consecutive nights at seven time points.
   Setting: Subject's homes
   Participants: The first hypothesis was tested with 34 women studied during both the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycle. The second hypothesis was tested with 31 women who completed the sleep studies during pregnancy and at one month postpartum.
   Interventions: N/A
   Measurements and Results: Women who ovulated thigh levels of serum progesterone in the luteal phase) had shorter REM latency, more REM sleep, and more positive mood state compared to those who did not ovulate (low luteal progesterone). Compared to the third trimester (high progesterone), REM latency was significantly shorter at one month postpartum (low progesterone). Mood state was most positive at the second trimester and most negative at one month postpartum.
   Conclusions: REM sleep and mood state were related to low progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle, but postpartum REM sleep and mood state were related to increased wake time rather than changes in progesterone levels.

AB Objective To describe the prevalence of various symptoms five months and twelve months after childbirth in two European countries, according to employment, financial difficulties and relationship with partner.
   Design Longitudinal multicentre survey with a similar design in France and Italy. Women were interviewed three times: at birth and twice after childbirth. At 12 months after childbirth, the survey was postal in both countries.
   Population Women who had been delivered of their first or second baby in three maternity units in France and five units in Italy. Women who had multiple pregnancies, a stillbirth or known neonatal death were excluded.
   Results The response rates were 83% in France and 88% in Italy. Fifteen symptoms were considered. The results were similar in the two countries and showed that the prevalence of most symptoms was higher at 12 months than at five months after childbirth. When their baby was one year old, more than half of the women reported backache, anxiety and extreme tiredness. Around one-third of women reported headache, lack of sexual desire, sleep disorders and depression. Piles, constipation and painful intercourse were also common. One year postpartum women with financial problems or a difficult relationship reported poor psychological health more frequently.
   Conclusion Physical and emotional problems are common after birth, and they tend to increase over time. Backache, headache and piles can seriously interfere with day-to-day Life. Sexual problems also may be a source of unhappiness for the woman and her partner. Extreme tiredness, anxiety and depression may make a woman feel guilty for not corresponding to the image of a healthy, happy and well-coping mother. There is a link between financial problems or a difficult relationship with her partner and her own wellbeing. Health professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of health problems among new mothers, and of the social context of women who are more likely to suffer from them. They should counsel the women in their care, in order to help them to find the best solution, be it medical or social in nature.

AB Phylogenetically prolactin is an old hormone that plays an important role in the physiology of fishes and reptiles as well as mammals. In humans, prolactin levels normally increase during sleep, pregnancy and lactation. Causes of abnormal hyperprolactinemia include exogenous factors, drugs and pituitary tumors. Functional hyperprolactinemia can result from central mechanisms interfering with dopamin metabolism. The most common symptom is impaired reproductive function. Prolactin secretion by the pituitary gland is regulated mainly through the inhibitory effect of dopamin. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia should be directed to the underlying disorder, if known. Most cases are treated with dopamin agonists. Patients with prolactinomas that do not repond to medical treatment will require surgery or radiotherapy. During pregnancy, prolactinomas can increase in size but most will respond to medical therapy.

AB A 6-year-old boy presented with complaints of redness and scarring over the face to the outpatient clinic of the Dermatology Department of Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, India.
   The child was apparently normal until the age of 6 months when his mother noticed an erythematous eruption with small blisters and mild discomfort over the face on exposure to sunlight. Gradually, the eruption became more progressive, extending to the forehead, nose, and ears with the development of oozing, crusting, atrophy, and telangiectasias over the face, despite treatment. Over the last 3 months, he had developed ulceration of the skin over the right cheek just below the lower eyelid without any signs of healing. No history suggestive of constitutional symptoms, bowel and bladder complaints, Raynaud's phenomenon, alopecia, discoloration of urine on standing, and chronic systemic or cutaneous infections could be obtained. The patient is a product of a full-term pregnancy with normal vaginal delivery of nonconsanguineous parents. His developmental milestones were delayed, with sitting at 2.5 years and standing and speech at 3 years.
   Our patient is a Hindu by religion and Rajput by caste. India is a vast land mass, bounded by the Himalayan mountains to the north-west, lush green forests to the east, and the scenic Kashmir valley to the north; the land tapers into the Indian Ocean at the southern peninsula where the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea meet. India is a republic consisting of different states and union-territories with Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and people from other religions. Among the Hindus, several castes exist, such as "Brahmins," "Kshatriyas" (Rajputs-the warrior dan), "Vaishyas," and "Shudras," classified according to their profession from ancient times. The parents of our patient had migrated from the Multan region of Pakistan back to India at the time of partition, and are presently residing in the hilly region of Uttar Pradesh (Fig. 1). There was no history of consanguinity in the family members presented in the pedigree chart (Fig. 2).
   The patient's father (39 years) and mother (35 years) were apparently normal and had four children. The eldest child is a normal 14-year-old girl. The second was a girl who died at the age of 2 years, presumably of a similar ailment. The third is a normal 1 I-year-old boy, and the last is the 6-year-old boy brought to our clinic. A similar problem has been said to exist in a 15-year-old male paternal cousin of the patient, but he has not been examined by us as he does not reside in the area.
   Physical examination of the patient revealed an alert and active boy with a pleasing personality, but an irritable mood. He had definite stunted growth, and his body weight (10 kg), height (91 cm), and head circumference (46 cm) were all below the fifth percentile. His voice was high pitched and his hair and eyes were brown, but normal. He had a small, thin body frame and a delicate, tender, narrow, bird-like facies with small mandible and pointed nose, high arched palate, and dolichocephalic skull (Fig. 3).
   Dermatologic examination revealed characteristic facies with diffuse erythema extending onto the forehead, nose, and ears, with thin atrophic scarring, telangiectasias, and mild hypertrichosis. A circular, superficial, bleeding ulcer of 2 cm x 1.5 cm was located on the right cheek, extending onto the margins of the lower eyelid (Fig. 4). The borders of the ulcer were not raised but covered with yellowish crusts, and mild ectropion of the eyelid was also seen. In addition, he also had hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots) of varying sizes, measuring from 1 to 3 cm in diameter, over the trunk, back, and sacral region which also had a small circular dimple. Two circular hypopigmented macules of 1 cm in diameter were present over the chest. He also had clinodactyly of the fingers; his nails were normal but for minimal clubbing. The right testis was small in size and the left testis had not fully descended to the scrotum. The rest of the cutaneous and systemic examination revealed no other abnormality, except for mild mental retardation with an IQ of 60-65 on psychometric examination by the Adaptive Behavior Score.
   Routine hematologic and radiologic studies revealed no abnormalities. Immunologic studies including lupus erythematosus (LE) cell and ANA were negative. The biochemical profile of blood and urine was negative for porphyrins. Histopathologic examination of the skin over the face on hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed changes suggestive of chronic actinic damage with epidermal atrophy, hydropic degeneration of the basal cell layer, and dermal edema, with dilatation of the vessels and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis. Due to nonavailability, immunofluorescence studies were not carried out.
   Peripheral blood was collected from the patient and whole-blood cu Itu res were performed with and without 10% serum supplementation. To all cultures, 10 mg/mL of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was added at the time of culture. In addition, bromodeoxyuridine (10 mg/mL) was added to some cultures either at 0 h or at 24 h after culture. These cultures were incubated at 37 degreesC for 72 h and harvested after adding colchicine (0.05 mg/mL) at 69 h after culture.
   Slides were prepared by the air dry method and were stained using the standard fluorescent plus Giemsa (FPG) technique (Goto K, Akenmatsu T, Shimazu H, Sugiyama T. Simple differential Giemsa staining of sister chromatids after treatment with photosensitive dyes and exposure to light and the mechanism of staining. Chromosome 1975, 53:223-230) carried out routinely in the laboratory (Bamezai R, Shiraishi Y. Cell cycle progression and SCE rate of Bloom syndrome cells with/without co-cultivation in the presence/absence of normal cells. Exp Cell Res 1986; 164: 163-173; Bamezai R, Kumar N. Sleep deprivation in human males and its effect on SCE rates in chromosomes-a preliminary study. Mutat Res 1992; 283: 229-232). Better chromosome plates (31 plates) were identified and the terminal exchanges between two chromatids of the same chromosome were scored as 1 sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and the symmetrical exchanges as 2 SCEs.
   Results showed a high frequency of SCEs (Fig. 4) in the patient, with the mean SCE per cell being 72. The standard error calculated from the Sigma Stat program was 3.25 and the standard deviation was 26.9. Further chromosomal abnormalities, such as breaks, deletions, triradials, quadriradials, and dicentric chromosomes, were observed. Cytologic studies of the father's blood did not reveal any abnormality.
   The facial erythema improved with the application of topical sunscreen ointments, but the ulceration over the face showed no signs of healing despite treatment with oral and topical antimicrobials, zinc, vitamins, and hematinics. The scarring and telangiectasias over the face persisted. The child was sent home with adequate counseling to avoid exposure to sunlight and to report to the clinic quarterly for regular check-ups.

AB Tiffany, a 3-year-old girl, was referred to the developmental and behavioral pediatrics service for evaluation of significant and persistent negative behaviors associated with refusal to eat at meal time and constant snacking during the past 3 months. She lost 2 pounds, but her weight for her height was at the 50th percentile. Her mother indicated that Tiffany had frequent night awakenings (>10) and late sleep onset (between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m.). Her mother described her as being "easily frustrated" getting upset and angry very quickly. Tiffany was identified at an early intervention program as having mild to moderate developmental delays in pragmatic speech, gross and fine motor skills, and social interaction skills.
   Tiffany was born at 33 weeks gestation and was hospitalized for 10 days without significant perinatal problems. She was readmitted at 2 months of age when she was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux, lactose intolerance, sleep apnea, and bradycardia. She was discharged with an apnea monitor. A seizure disorder was diagnosed at I year of age and reactive airway disease at 2 years of age. At the time of the referral to the developmental and behavioral pediatrics service, Tiffany was followed by multiple services, including cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology, psychology, and pulmonary. Pharmacologic therapies included albuterol and cromalyn inhalers, phenobarbital, valproic acid, levocarnitine, ranitidine, and an inhaled steroid. She continued to use the apnea monitor each night, although three sleep studies demonstrated a normal sleep pattern with no evidence of apnea or bradycardia. A recent electroencephalogram was normal.
   Tiffany lives with her mother and maternal grandparents. Her mother is morbidly obese with a history of asthma and depression. She was infertile for a 10-year period, which she attributed to the stress associated with living with an abusive man. Tiffany was the result of a subsequent, brief relationship with another man; she has not had contact with her father. Her mother is a licensed practical nurse who has not worked as a nurse since Tiffany's birth. An interdisciplinary treatment approach to Tiffany's multiple biological and behavioral problems was implemented by admitting her to a collaborative care unit at a children's hospital.

AB We investigated the long-term influence of early dietary NaCl on adult mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), assessed continuously for 7 weeks when fed water and chow containing 1% NaCl (weeks 1, 4, 7), 0% NaCl (weeks 2-3), and 3% NaCl (weeks 5-6) while on a 12:12 light/dark cycle. Subjects were offspring of female Sprague-Dawley rats fed solid chow consisting of either 0.1% (basal), 1% (intermediate), or 3% (high) NaCl throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning on postnatal day (PD) 21, offspring were fed the same NaCl diet of their mother until PD 30, at which time all offspring were given Purina 5001 diet (1% NaCl) as their solid chow. On PD 60, 22 adult male offspring (eight basals, six intermediates, eight highs) were implanted with an aortic electronic sensor for transmitting blood-pressure signals by telemetry. MAP and HR varied significantly across the 7-week testing period in association with dietary NaCl levels. The three perinatal salt groups had similar HR levels on normal 1% NaCl chow. However, HR increased in all groups during 0% NaCl and decreased in all groups during 3% NaCl. In contrast, the average MAP levels were significantly greater in the highs compared to both the intermediate and basal groups during both dark and light periods. MAP increased in high and basal groups during both 0% and 3%; however, the increase was more pronounced in the highs. In conclusion, exposure to high levels of dietary NaCl early in development led to a persistent increase in MAP in adulthood. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Review
DE Sleep; Arousal; Non-rapid eye movement sleep; Rapid eye movement sleep;
   Arousal threshold; Environment
AB Objective: To review the major confounding factors that influence the determination of arousal thresholds in infants.
   Review of confounding factors: The determination of arousal thresholds in infants measures their arousability from sleep. The evaluation is influenced by various conditions. The infant's arousability is decreased by maternal factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke, alcohol, illegal drugs or medications during gestation or breastfeeding. The levels of arousal thresholds also depend on the age of the infant and on experimental conditions, such as previous sleep deprivation, type of arousal challenges, time of administration of the arousal challenge, sleep stage, body position, room temperature, use of a pacifier, bed sharing, or type of feeding. In addition, spontaneous arousals can occur and modify the infant's response to external arousal challenges.
   Conclusions: Factors known to modify infants' arousability from sleep should be controlled during studies designed to determine arousal thresholds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Investigation of daytime sleepiness, blood pressure changes and presence of sleep disordered breathing, in healthy young women during pregnancy.
   Methods: Young, healthy pregnant women between 18 and 32 years of age, seen in three different prenatal care clinics, were enlisted in a prospective study divided in two parts: part 1 of the study consisted of completing a standardized questionnaire on past and present sleep disorders. It also included filling out visual analog scales (VAS) for daytime sleepiness and snoring by the subject and bed partner. Blood pressure measurement was performed at 9 AM as per the WHO protocol. Similar data were collected again at the 6-month prenatal visit and at the 3-month post-delivery visit. At the 6-month visit, ambulatory monitoring of nocturnal sleep using a portable six-channel recorder (Edentrace (R)) was performed at home. Part 2 involved a subgroup of subjects that were randomly selected after stratification based on results of VAS and ambulatory monitoring. It included 1 night of nocturnal polysomnography with esophageal manometry and 24 h of ambulatory BP monitoring with portable equipment with cuff inflation every 30 min.
   Results: Of the 267 women who participated in part 1 of the study, only 128 consented to enroll in part 2, from which 26 were selected to undergo polysomnography. At the 6-week prenatal visit 37.45% of the subjects reported daytime sleepiness of variable severity. At the 6-month visit, this was noted in 52% of the subjects. Bed-partners reported chronic, loud snoring prior to pregnancy in 3.7% of the study population, but this increased to 11.8% at the 6-month visit. Blood pressure (BP) remained below the pathological range, i.e. less than 150/95 mm Hg, during the entire pregnancy. However, ambulatory monitoring indicated that 37 women, including the loud chronic snorers, had some minor SaO(2) drops during sleep and this same group presented the largest increase in BP between the 6th week and the 6th month prenatal visits. Part 2 included 26 women, 13 from the above identified 37 women and 13 from the rest of the group, chosen randomly, age and body mass index (BMI) matched. Polysomnography did identify two abnormal breathing patterns during sleep: (1) esophageal pressure 'crescendos' associated predominantly with stage 1 and 2 NREM sleep, and (2) 'abnormal sustained efforts' seen predominantly with delta sleep. These abnormal breathing patterns were noted during a significantly longer time during sleep. This group of women with the abnormal breathing patterns were not only chronic snorers but also had significantly higher systolic and diastolic BP increases when compared to the 13 other non-snorers. Six out of the 13 snorers were 'non-dippers' at the 24-h BP recording.
   Conclusion: Abnormal breathing during sleep (that is frequently, but not always, associated with loud, chronic snoring, and may be a consequence of edema induced by hormonal changes associated with pregnancy), can be seen in otherwise healthy young pregnant women. It may contribute to the symptom of daytime sleepiness. The changes in blood pressure noted were of no pathological significance in our population but could be an added risk factor in high-risk pregnancies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

   IMMUNIZATION
AB Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS or cot death) was the major cause of post-neonatal infant death in many countries in the late 1970s and 1980s. There is now very strong evidence that public intervention campaigns targeting the prone sleeping position, which had been identified by epidemiological studies as a major risk factor, were followed by substantial falls in the rate of SIDS. In the present review we discuss the evidence on which current recommendations for the prevention of SIDS are based. The prone sleeping position is now clearly causally associated with SIDS. Further reductions in SIDS may be produced by recommending the back sleeping position as opposed to the side position. Maternal smoking in pregnancy and bed sharing by infants of mothers who smoke are also strongly associated with SIDS, but have been harder to influence. Paternal smoking has also been implicated, although the magnitude of the reported risk is small. Finally, breastfeeding, pacifier use and having the infant sharing the parents bedroom, but not the bed, may also reduce risk. Continued reductions in SIDS mortality will require innovative public health education to target these major risk factors, while building on the "back to sleep" approach.

AB We report the case of a 30-year-old woman affected by hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), who developed a painless left axillary neuropathy after sleeping on her left side, on a firm orthopaedic mattress, in her eighth month of pregnancy. Electromyography (EMG) showing neurogenic signs in the left anterior and middle deltoid, and normal findings in the left teres minor, posterior deltoid and other proximal upper limb muscles, demonstrated that the lesion was at the level of the axillary anterior branch. A direct compression of this branch against the surgical neck of the humerus seems the most likely pathogenic mechanism. This is the first documented description of an axillary neuropathy in HNPP. Knowledge of its possible occurrence may be important for prevention purposes.

AB Adverse perinatal events affecting cerebral functions are a major cause of neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term neurologic deficit. Intrapartum fetal EEG, which records fetal brain electrical activity, provides a monitoring modality for evaluating the fetal CNS during labor. In this study, we describe a new approach to such monitoring that is based on real-time spectral analysis of the fetal EEG during labor. Fourteen pregnant women with uncomplicated term pregnancies who went into labor participated in the study. Two suction-cup electrodes were applied to the fetal scalp at the occipitoparietal or parietal region after rupture of membranes. Real-time spectral analysis was used to determine the frequency and amplitude of the fetal EEG signal. The spectral edge frequency (SEF) was calculated as the frequency below which 90% of the power in the power spectrum resides. The average EEG amplitude and the SEF were displayed using the density spectral array technique. Fetal heart rate and intrauterine pressure were also measured. Two fundamental EEG patterns were identified: high-voltage slow activity and low-voltage fast activity. The SEF was found to be an excellent index of cyclic EEG activity. Fetal heart rate demonstrated increased variability and an elevated baseline during low-voltage fast activity, whereas both parameters decreased during high-voltage slow activity. During episodes of variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate, a decrease in the SEF was observed, accompanied by an increased EEG voltage. The results obtained substantiate the presence of sleep cycles in the human fetus. This kind of cortical activity monitoring may enable rapid alertness to cerebral hypoxia and allow for prompt intervention thereby decreasing the risk for birth asphyxia and subsequent brain damage.

AB Background: Although nitrous oxide (N2O) is used commonly during anesthesia, clinically relevant advantages-disadvantages of using this agent are not well established in the ambulatory setting. This study in women undergoing ambulatory gynecologic surgery compares outcomes in patients administered total intravenous anesthesia with propofol versus the propofol plus N2O. The primary outcome was the time to home readiness. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postanesthetic adverse events.
   Methods: Women presenting for elective ambulatory termination of pregnancy or gynecologic laparoscopy were indued with an intravenous sleep dose of propofol and fentanyl. After induction, subjects were randomly allocated to maintenance anesthesia with propofol alone or propofol plus 65% N2O. patients were assessed by a blinded observer in the postanesthetic care unit at 20-min intervals to determine home readiness. Postoperative pain and nausea were measured with visual analog scales. Postoperative analgesics and antiemetics were recorded. The incidence of adverse events occurring after hospital discharge was assessed by a telephone interview 24 h postoperatively.
   Results: A total of 740 patients received propofol alone and 750 patients received propofol plus N2O. Mean home readiness times were not significantly different between treatment groups. There were no significant differences between groups in pain scores, nausea scores, analgesia administration, or antiemetic administration before discharge. There were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse events for 24 h after discharge from hospital.
   Conclusions: Omission of N2O from a propofol-based anesthetic for ambulatory gynecologic surgery does not affect time to home readiness or the incidence of postoperative adverse events up to 24 h after discharge from hospital.

AB The present study tested the hypothesis that acute treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) impairs fertility, disrupts the nocturnal melatonin rhythm, and suppresses lymphocyte function. Adult Siberian hamsters administered 2 or 100 mu g TCDD/kg body weight/0.2 ml sesame oil had a delayed latency to first litter and an increased adult mortality compared to hamsters given 0.1 mu g/kg or vehicle. Within 75 days of TCDD treatment, full reproductive capabilities were achieved. Moreover, the nocturnal melatonin rhythm was not disrupted in adults administered TCDD or in their progeny. Lymphocyte activity varied with respect to time of day and treatment. Lymphocyte proliferation was enhanced at night irrespective of TCDD treatment; during the day, 2 wk after the 2-mu g/kg treatment, blastogenesis was reduced compared to that in the 0.1-mu g/kg group or in vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, TCDD did not affect the mixed lymphocyte reaction in response to allogeneic antigen when assessed at 2 and 20 wk post-treatment. Thus, findings indicate that TCDD produced acute effects on fertility, mortality, and systemic lymphocyte proliferation, but long-lasting effects on specific aspects of reproductive, neuroendocrine, and immune cell functions were not observed.

AB With the aim to describe the daily pattern of blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 1494 blood pressure series systematically sampled by ambulatory monitoring for 48 hours every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 124 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 55 with gestational hypertension, and 23 with a final diagnosis of preoclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group and trimester of gestation was established by population multiple-component analysis. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern represented by a linear model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 hours is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P<0.001 in all cases). The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (always P<0.001). There is also a statistically significant difference in circadian amplitude (extent of daily change) of blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies in all trimesters (always P<0.004). Results further indicate similar circadian characteristics between women who later developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these 2 groups in circadian mean is statistically significant in the second trimester for systolic (P=0.022) but not for diastolic blood pressure (P=0.986). In the third trimester, the difference in circadian mean is highly statistically significant for both variables (P<0.001). The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy. Those highly significant differences are found when both systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological range of blood pressure variability. These differing changes in the circadian pattern of blood pressure with advancing gestational age between healthy and complicated pregnancies offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic intervention.

AB Neurulation is a complex process of histogenesis involving the precise temporal and spatial organization of gene expression(1,2) Genes influencing neurulation include proneural genes determining primary cell fate, neurogenic genes involved in lateral inhibition pathways and genes controlling the frequency of mitotic events. This is reflected in the aetiology and genetics of human and mouse neural tube defects, which are of both multifactorial and multigenic origin(3). The X-linked gene Nap1l2, specifically expressed in neurons, encodes a protein that is highly similar to the nucleosome assembly (NAP) and SET proteins. We inactivated Nap1l2 in mice by gene targeting, leading to embryonic lethality from mid-gestation onwards. Surviving mutant chimaeric embryos showed extensive surface ectoderm defects as well as the presence of open neural tubes and exposed brains similar to those observed in human spina bifida and anencephaly. These defects correlated with an overproduction of neuronal precursor cells. Protein expression studies showed that the Nap1l2 protein binds to condensing chromatin during S phase and in apoptotic cells, but remained cytoplasmic during G1 phase. Nap1l2 therefore likely represents a class of tissue-specific factors interacting with chromatin to regulate neuronal cell proliferation.

ID PERIODIC LIMB MOVEMENTS; SLEEP
AB There is a genetic contribution to the idiopathic restless legs syndrome (iRLS), An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is suspected, but as yet no gene has been identified. To assess the frequency and characteristics of the hereditary restless legs syndrome (RLS) in comparison to those of non-hereditary RLS, we analysed the clinical data of 300 RLS patients. All 300 patients diagnosed as RLS according to the criteria of the International RLS Study Group were examined using a standard questionnaire covering demographic data, family history, clinical symptoms, subjective sleep disturbances and course of the disease. In all patients a complete neurological examination was performed, and in selected cases electrophysiological examinations and polysomnographic studies. Family history was rated as definitely positive when at least one first-degree relative was examined and classified as RLS according to the criteria by one of the authors. If it proved impossible to contact family members to verify reports of a family history, the patients were classified as only having a "possible positive family history." 232 of the 300 patients had iRLS and 68 secondary RLS due to uremia (uRLS), 42.3% of the patients with iRLS and 11.7% of those with uRLS were classified as having "definite positive" hereditary RLS, with a further 12.6% of iRLS patients and 5.8% of uRLS patients as having "possible positive" hereditary RLS. Patients with definite hereditary RLS were significantly younger at the age of onset than those with a negative family history (35.45 vs, 47.17 years, p< 0.05). The clinical characteristics of the disease were similar in both groups, except that women with hereditary RLS experienced a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy (19.1% vs. 2.6%, p< 0.05). Our study shows that patients with hereditary RLS may experience an earlier onset of the disease. Hereditary and non-hereditary RLS present with similiar clinical signs and symptoms.

AB Study Objectives: Pre-eclampsia is currently the predominant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Diurnal blood pressure variation is flattened or reversed in pre-eclampsia; however, sleep has not been extensively investigated in this disease. Our objective was therefore to study sleep architecture in this group of patients.
   Study Design: Full polysomnography using the Compumedics Sleepwatch System(R) or Compumedics p-series.
   Setting: NA
   Patients: 25 pre-eclamptic patients and 17 primigravidas with normal pregnancies and no history of cardiovascular disease or sleep disorder. With the exception of one subject, all pre-eclamptics were taking clonidine (a known suppressant of rapid eye movement-REM-sleep) for control of their hypertension.
   Interventions: NA
   Results: Pre-eclamptic subjects had markedly altered sleep architecture, with a markedly increased percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) (21 * 2% versus 43 * 3%, p < 0.001). There was a longer latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (92 * 11 mins vs. 205 * 23 mins in control and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively, p < 0.001) and reduced time spent in REM (18 * 1% and 10 * 2% in control and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: While the increased REM latency and decreased REM time are most likely due to clonidine, this is unlikely to also account for the increased SWS. Two possible explanations for this include cerebral edema and release of cytokines, which are known to alter sleep structure.

DT Article
ID PRAMIPEXOLE; AKATHISIA; DISEASE; IRON
AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic movement disorder that is often associated with a sleep complaint. Patients with RLS have an irresistible urge to move their legs, which is usually due to disagreeable sensations that are worse during periods of inactivity and often interfere with sleep. It is estimated that between 2 and 15 percent of the population may experience symptoms of RLS, Primary RLS likely has a genetic origin. Secondary causes of RLS include iron deficiency. neurologic lesions, pregnancy and uremia. RLS also may occur secondarily to the use of certain medications. The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on the patient's history. A list of questions that may be used as a basis to assess the likelihood of RLS is included in this article. Pharmacologic treatment of RLS includes dopaminergic agents, opioids, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants. The primary cam physician plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of RLS.

AB Preeclampsia is the predominant cause of admissions to neonatal intensive care. The diurnal blood pressure pattern is flattened or reversed in preeclampsia. We hypothesized that snoring and partial upper airway obstruction contribute to nocturnal rises in blood pressure. We tested this hypothesis by controlling sleep-induced upper airway flow limitation and snoring with nasal positive pressure. Eleven women with preeclampsia underwent two consecutive polygraphic sleep studies with simultaneous beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring. Average blood pressure for the night overall and in each sleep stage was calculated. Sleep architecture was similar on the two study nights. Sleep-induced partial upper airway flow limitation occurred in all patients in the initial study. Autosetting nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied at a mean maximal pressure of 6 +/- 1 cm H2O eliminated flow limitation throughout sleep on the treatment night. Blood pressure was markedly reduced on the treatment night [(128 +/- 3)/(73 +/- 3)] when compared with the initial nontreatment study night [(146 +/- 6)/(92 +/- 4)], p = (0.007)/(0.002). We conclude that partial upper airway obstruction during sleep in women with preeclampsia is associated with increments in blood pressure, which can be eliminated with the use of nasal CPAP.

AB Background: There is a need to identify, as early as possible, infants who are at risk for long-term neurological morbidity.
   Methods: To predict neurodevelopment outcome of preterm infants <30 weeks' gestation in a population of 100 infants, we used several neonatal and neurobehavioral tests, including cranial ultrasonography, the Prechtl neurological test, quality of spontaneous general movements, and quality of sleep-wake organization.
   Results: The Prechtl test at corrected term age and findings on cranial sonograms both had high specificity, but the Prechtl test had Letter overall positive predictive power for normal neurological and developmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age. Developmental changes in sleep and the amount of indeterminate sleep did not correlate with outcome. Scoring general movement quality did not predict outcome and did not augment the positive predictive power of the Prechtl test.
   Conclusions: The Prechtl test at corrected term age (independent of the other tests) is the Lest positive predictor of normal neurological outcome and Bayley test results at 2 years' corrected age.

AB The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recently amended its regulation concerning patients who have received therapeutic amounts of radioactivity. The amended regulation allows patient release based on a total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) limit of 5 mSv (500 mrem) instead of the activity administered or retained [1,110 MBq (30 mCi)] or the dose rate [0.05 mSv h(-1) (5 mrem h(-1)) at 1 m], Record-keeping and written post-release radiation safety precautions are required, however, A general algorithm, combining patient-specific kinetics and dose rate measurements, has been developed to systematically determine the actual duration of post-release radiation precautions as well as the time of release posttreatment. This algorithm is based on the maximum permissible effective dose equivalents (MPEDEs) of the respective cohorts exposed, 5 mSv (500 mrem) to non-pregnant adult family members and 1 mSv (100 mrem) to pregnant women, children, and members of the general public, Operational equations to determine the times post-radionuclide treatment of release from medical confinement, of not working, of avoiding pregnant women and children, of limiting holding of children, and of sleeping partners riot sleeping together have been derived and illustrated with a hypothetical example, TEDE-based release criteria should be less restrictive than the previous activity-based or dose rate-based release criteria. Howe cer, post-release radiation precautions may be more intrusive and longer in duration than those to which most practitioners have grown accustomed. Up to now, however, the duration (typically 1-2 d) of advised post-release precautions had not been rigorously derived from MPEDEs and were generally inappropriately short. Even so, dose-based release criteria should prove more cost-effective overall than hospitalization of patients commonly imposed by activity-based and dose rate-based release criteria.

AB Daily rhythmicity of renal blood flow (RBF) and urine flow (UF) was studied in fetal sheep between 121-125 d of gestation. Fetal arterial blood pressure, heart rate, UF, and right RBF were measured continuously for 24-h periods in 10 sheep, Rhythmic variations during a 24-h period were found for all variables studied. The rhythms of arterial blood pressure and heart rate were highly correlated, whereas an inverse correlation was found between arterial blood pressure with RBF and between arterial blood pressure with UF. These findings indicate that fetal RBF is not blood pressure dependent. Furthermore, fetal UF appears not to be mediated by pressure-dependent diuresis.

AB Female CD-1 mice were exposed to a commercial amine Formulation of 2.4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on days 6-16 of gestation in drinking water at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0% of the formulated product, equivalent to approximately 0 650 mg/kg/d expressed as the amine derivative. The effect of 2,4-D on urethan-induced pulmonary adenoma formation was evaluated in female offspring 19 w after birth. Urethan-induced sleeping times observed following ip injection of 1.5 mg urethran/g bw 7 w after birth were not altered by 2,4-D (0 = 0.10), indicating that 2,4-D did not affect the rate of urethan elimination. 2,4-D exposure did not affect the number of tumors produced (0 = 0.58), but did reduce the mean tumor diameter in the highest dose group (p < 0.01). This minor antineoplastic activity of 2,4-D may be related, in part, to inhibitory effects of 2.4-D on various enzymatic or metabolic pathways, essential for cellular growth and tissue development. Since exposure to 2,4-D during pregnancy had little impact of tumor production, it is unlikely that persistent alteration to developing immune cells involved in the cell-mediated immunosurveillance mechanisms occurred. The subtle alteration in tumor size and the mild impairment of growth in the offspring were observed almost exclusively in the highest treatment group. Since this level of exposure is well in excess of those associated with normal application of 2,4-D, the hazard to non-target mammalian populations appears minimal.

AB The current study examined the consequences of prenatal SKF-38393 exposure on the cellular response in the adult suprachiasmatic nuclei to light. Pregnant rats were injected with the dopamine agonist SKF-38393 or vehicle daily from gestational day 15 to 21. Adult offspring received a light pulse (1 min/2 lux) 4 or 8 h after lights off (ZT16 or ZT20 where ZT = zeitgeber time). Brains were processed for c-FOS-like immunoreactivity in the SCN. At ZT20 the number of cells expressing c-FOS protein after a light pulse was the same in both groups. At ZT16 the number of cells in the SCN of SKF-38393-exposed animals was 58% lower than the vehicle-treated group. The data suggest that prenatal SKF-38393 treatment may have long-term consequences for SCN function. NeuroReport 11:1539-1541 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Aims-To investigate the effects of small for gestational age (SGA) in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants on growth and development until the fifth year of life.
   Methods-VLBW (< 1500 g) infants, selected from a prospective study, were classified as SGA (n = 115) on the basis of birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and were compared with two groups of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants matched according to birth weight (AGA-BW; n = 115) or gestation at birth (AGA-GA; n = 115). Prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors were recorded, and duration and intensity of treatment were computed from daily assessments. Body weight, length, and head circumference were measured at birth, five and 20 months (corrected for prematurity), and at 56 months. General development was assessed at five and 20 months with the Griffiths scale of babies abilities, and cognitive development at 56 months with the Columbia mental maturity scales, a vocabulary (AWST) and language comprehension test (LSVTA).
   Results-Significant group differences were found in complications (pregnancy, birth, and neonatal), parity, and multiple birth rate. The AGA-GA group showed most satisfactory growth up to 56 months, with both the AGA-BW and SGA groups lagging behind. The AGA-GA group also scored significantly more highly on all developmental and cognitive tests than the other groups. Developmental test results were similar for the SGA and AGA-SW groups at five and 20 months, but AGA-BW infants (lowest gestation) had lower scores on performance intelligence quotient and language comprehension at 56 months than the SGA group. When prenatal and neonatal complications, parity, and multiple birth were accounted for, group differences in growth remained, but differences in cognitive outcome disappeared after five months.
   Conclusions-Being underweight and with a short gestation (SGA and VLBW) leads to poor weight gain and head growth in infancy but does not result in poorer growth than in infants of the same birth weight but shorter gestation (AGA-BW) in the long term. SGA is related to early developmental delay and later language problems; however, neonatal complications may have a larger detrimental effect on long term cognitive development of VLBW infants than whether they are born SGA or AGA.

AB Objective: To determine the effects of external light stimulation on fetal behavioral states and know the difference from those of vibroacoustic stimulation. Methods: A flashlight and a vibroacoustic stimulator was applied directly on the maternal abdomen to determine the response of 56 normal fetuses at 36-40 weeks gestation. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and body movements were recorded using an actocardiograph. and fetal eye movements were observed using real-time ultrasonography. Using Nijhuis's criteria, the fetal behavioral states (1F-4F) were determined. FHR acceleration was considered a fetal response to the stimulations. Results: The lag time between stimulation and fetal response was within 4 s. A positive response rate to the light stimulation was higher at behavioral states 2F (82%) and 3F (83%) than at state 1F (4%). Light stimulation changed the behavioral state of two of the six 3F fetuses (33%) from 3F to 4F. No change of state was observed in fetuses that were in states 1F and 2F. For vibroacoustic stimulation, fetal response was 100% positive and changes of states were observed frequently irrespective of the behavioral state before the stimulation. Conclusion: Fetal response to light stimulation is closely connected to fetal behavioral states and may reflect some distinct stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.

AB Prenatal exposure to cocaine, as well as other drugs, has been linked with "dysregulation," usually defined as problems in arousal and/or behavioral regulation. This study was designed to describe the physiological basis of dysregulation as a function of prenatal cocaine/polydrug exposure and term status. Eight-week-old infants were selected because they are just developing the ability to modulate arousal. One hundred-eighteen infants (23 preterm control, 27 preterm drug-exposed, 29 full-term control, and 39 full-term drug-exposed) completed a protocol during which heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) were measured. Drug group differences were found in baseline, arousal (response to stress), and arousal modulation (recovery from stress). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine the portion of variance attributable to postnatal caregiving environment, term status, and specific drug exposure. Term status accounted for significant variance in arousal (both RR and HR), and in arousal modulation (only RR). Prenatal exposure to cocaine contributed a significant amount of unique variance in HR arousal whereas tobacco contributed significantly to HR arousal modulation. Prenatal drug exposure and preterm status contributed differently to dysregulation as measured by physiological responses. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Our aim is to evaluate serial changes in normal full-term fetal cerebral circulation according to the behavioral states. Flow velocity waveforms in the middle cerebral artery and fetal heart rate (FHR) were well recorded in ten of 19 cases by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography and actocardiography over 45 min, respectively. Behavioral states were classified as resting or active phase by FHR patterns. Resistance indices (Rls) were calculated every 5 s as an average of two consecutive waveforms. and median RI was chosen in each 2-min segment. In order to evaluate changes in median RI from active-to-resting transition to resting-to-active one statistically, differences in RI between two 2-min segments were examined using Mann-Whitney U-test. As a result: median RI was decreased to the minimum one in the active-to-resting transition for 12 min in all cases: significant decrease to the 2-min segment with the minimum one (P < 0.01). Various types of increase to the maximum median RI during resting phase followed the minimum one: significant increase from the 2-min segment with the minimum one to that with the maximum one in all cases (P < 0.001 in eight cases, P < 0.01 in two cases). Thereafter, median RI was decreased from the end of resting phase in the resting-to-active transition for 12 min in all cases: significant decrease from the last 2-min segment of resting phase in all cases (P < 0.01). We reveal that fetal cerebral circulation changes dynamically in relation to the timing in each behavioral stale. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of prenatal exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), a major component of cigarette smoke, was studied alone or in combination with postnatal hyperthermia, on the structural and neurochemical development of the postnatal brain at 1 and 8 weeks. Pregnant guinea pigs (n = 11) were exposed to 200 p.p.m CO for 10 h/day from midgestation until term (68 days), whereas control mothers (n = 10) breathed room air. On postnatal day 4, neonates from the control and GO-exposed pregnancies were exposed to hyperthermia (35 degrees C) for 75 min or remained at ambient (23 degrees C) temperature. Using semiquantitative immunohistochemical techniques the following neurotransmitter alterations were found in the medulla at 1 week: a decrease in met-enkephalin-immunoreactivity (PR) following postnatal hyperthermia and an increase in 5-hydroxytryptamine-IR following a combination of CO and hyperthermia. No alterations were observed in substance P- or tyrosine-hydroxylase-IR in any paradigm. At 8 weeks of age the combination of prenatal CO exposure followed by a brief hyperthermic stress postnatally resulted in lesions throughout the brain and an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein-IR in the medulla, Such effects on brain development could be of relevance in cardiorespiratory control in the neonate and could have implications for the etiology of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, where smoking and hyperthermia are major risk factors.

AB Placental progesterone metabolites may influence fetal behaviour during late gestation. We have investigated the effect of the neuroactive metabolite, pregnanolone, on the sleep/awake behaviour of fetal sheep. These studies can only be effectively performed in unanesthetized animals with chronically implanted leads and catheters. The relatively large internal volumes of these catheters raises problems for cerebroventriclear infusions. Therefore, we developed a device with negligible deadspace (approximate to 10 mu l) consisting of a ventricular cannula attached to a small cap which allowed the instillation of yl volumes of neuroactive steroids into a cerebral ventricle of fetal sheep in utero. Two catheters attached to the cap allow it to be filled in a push-pull configuration. The smaller internal diameter of the ventricular cannular prevents the solution entering the ventricle until the outflow catheter is occluded and solution is forced through the probe. Using this device, the infusion of 5 beta-pregnane-3 alpha-ol-20-one (pregnanolone, 1 mg), in 35% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, resulted in a marked suppression of fetal behaviour parameters indicative of arousal, while vehicle alone did not affect these parameters. We conclude that neuroactive steroids can be infused into the cerebroventricular system of chronically catheterised fetal sheep in small volumes and that pregnanolone may act directly to influence fetal behaviour.

AB The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome has been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants born at term. Failure to arouse from sleep is one possible mechanism for sudden infant death syndrome. This study compared the arousal responses to nasal air-jet stimulation in a longitudinal study between groups of healthy preterm and term infants. Preterm infants (n = 9) were born at 31-35 wk gestation with normal birth weights for gestational age and studied on three occasions: a preterm study at 36 wk, at 2-3 wk post-term. and at 2-3 mo post-term. Term infants (n = 22) were born at 37-42 wk and were studied at 2-3 wk and 2-3 mo post-term. Arousal thresholds were determined in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). In preterm infants, there was no state-related difference in arousal thresholds at either the 36 wk or 2-3 wk study; however, at 2-3 mo, arousal threshold was significantly greater in QS than AS (p < 0.05). In contrast, in term infants, arousal thresholds were significantly elevated in QS compared with BS at both 2-3 wk and 2-3 mo (p < 0.001). Arousal thresholds in AS were not different between the two groups of infants, with both groups of infants remaining readily arousable. However, in QS at 2-3 mo, arousal thresholds were significantly lower in the preterm infants (p < 0.05). This study has demonstrated that arousability is altered by gestational and postnatal age. The lower arousability that characterizes QS in term infants regardless of age is not evident in preterm infants until 2-3 mo post-term age.

AB Repeated prenatal exposure to cocaine is associated with attenuated respiratory and arousal responses in infants and piglets. As the normal development of these functions is influenced by medullary opioid systems, the present study explored the possible contribution of the opioid systems to the attenuation induced by cocaine. Methionine-enkephalin (metenkephalin), an endogenous opioid peptide, was delineated by immunocytochemistry in respiratory- and arousal-related medullary regions of relatively immature (6-7-day-old) and more mature piglets (20-21-day-old). The animals were either unexposed, or exposed prenatally to 2 mg/kg cocaine four times daily administered to the pregnant sows intravenously throughout the last third of gestation. At control, met-enkephalin was found in the neurons, fibers and terminals of the respiratory- and arousal-related medullary regions throughout the age range studied. Prenatal cocaine exposure increased met-enkephalin immunoreactivity in the respiratory-related hypoglossal and solitary tract nuclei of both age groups. These findings support a modulatory role of met-enkephalin in the normal development of respiratory control, and an involvement of this peptide in the attenuation of respiration by repeated prenatal exposure to cocaine.

AB The abuse of social drugs Such as cocaine during pregnancy represents enormous risks to the offspring. Recent studies showed that drugs administered to the pregnant rat can activate cell populations in the fetal brain, possibly altering the timing of key neuronal developmental events. The current study examined the ontogeny of light-responsiveness of the neonatal rat suprachiasmatic nucleus using c-FOS protein in SCN nuclei as a marker. The effect of acute administration of the dopamine D1 agonist, SKF-58393, on the development of light responsiveness was also examined. Pregnant dams received either SKF-38393 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle 7 after dawn on gestational day 20. Litters were then assigned to one of seven experimental time points from 4 h after subjective dark onset on the day of birth (P0-CT16) at 4-h intervals until CT16 on the day after birth (P1-CT16). Half of the pups in each litter were exposed to a 200 lux/2 h Light pulse and the other half remained in darkness. Three time points (P1-CT0, P1-CT8 and P1-CT16) were used to examine the prenatal drug effects on light-responsiveness. Light exposure at the time of subjective lights on, the day after birth (P1-CT0), resulted in a significant increase in c-FOS-positive cells. The number of positive cells recorded in the SCN after a Light pulse at P1-CT0 and P1-CT8 was significantly less in SKF-38393 pretreated pups compared to vehicle treated animals. The exposure to dopaminergic stimulation during gestation may have altered the timing of development of afferent connections to the fetal SCN, resulting in alteration of the initial response of the circadian timing system to light.

AB In April 1994, an intervention campaign to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was established in the Tyrol. The campaign was intended to increase knowledge concerning risk factors for SIDS in the general community and to improve individual care for infants at risk. In contrast to interventional programmes in other federal states of Austria (i.e. Vorarl-berg, Styria), this programme did not utilise polysomnography for identifying infants at risk. A part of the intervention programme was the "Styrian risk questionnaire", a standardised questionnaire concerning risk factors for SIDS. Individual instructions for health care of children at risk (risk score greater than or equal to 7) were provided and, if necessary, subscription of home monitoring was performed at the outpatient department (SIDS out-patient service) of the Department of Paediatrics in Innsbruck and other paediatric departments throughout the Tyrol. The educational programme also included information concerning basic life support. Psychological support was offered to parents of SIDS infants. Risk factors for SIDS in the Tyrol before the campaign were assessed in a retrospective case-control study (time period 1984-1994; 99 SIDS infants, 136 controls). The risk of SIDS was markedly reduced when parents had detailed knowledge of the risk factors of SIDS (odds ratio (OR) 0.03; p<0.001), which emphasises the importance of information and educational programmes.
   The incidence of SIDS declined after the beginning of the intervention campaign from 1.83/1000 live births (average incidence from 1984-1994) to 0.4/1000 live births and remained at this level thereafter. Post-neonatal mortality also declined from 3.9 to 1.3/1000 live births. The prevalence of the prone sleeping position declined immediately after the campaign (53.7% vs. 5.4%, p<0.001), as did the frequency of maternal smoking during pregnancy (22.9% vs. 14.5%, p<0.01). Breast feeding became more popular.
   In all, the low-cost intervention programme in the Tyrol proved to be highly efficient in reducing the risk of SIDS and in maintaining this effect for several years.

AB The human brainstem is fashioned around the 6th-7th week of gestation and matures in a caudal to rostral are, thereby forming the medulla, pens, and midbrain. The medulla mediates arousal, breathing, heart rate, and gross movements of the body and head, and medullary functions appear prior to those of the pens, which precede those of the midbrain. Hence, by the 7th-9th gestational week the fetus displays spontaneous movements, I week later takes its first "breath," and by the 25th week demonstrates stimulus-induced heart rate accelerations. As the pens, which is later to mature, mediates arousal, body movements, and vestibular and vibroacoustic perception, from around the 20th to 27th weeks the fetus responds with arousal and body movements to vibroacoustic and loud sounds delivered to the maternal abdomen. The midbrain inferior-auditory colliculus followed by the superior-visual colliculus is the last to mature and in conjunction with the lower brainstem makes fine auditory discriminations and reacts to sound with fetal heart rate (FHR) accelerations, head turning, and eye movements-around the 36th week. When aroused the fetus also reacts with reflexive movements, head turning, FHR accelerations, and may fall asleep and display rapid eye movements. Thus fetal cognitive motor activity, including auditory discrimination, orienting, the wake-sleep cycle, FHRs, and defensive reactions, appear to be under the reflexive control of the brainstem, which also appears capable of learning-related activity.

AB The neurohypophysial hormones oxytocin and vasopressin show daily rhythms of secretion with elevated hormone release during the hours of sleep. This pattern can be modulated by ovarian steroids and alters with age. The pattern appears to be due in part to the nocturnal increase in melatonin secretion, which stimulates hormone release in man, while being inhibitory in the rat. Pinealectomy alters both the 24 h pattern of neurohypophysial hormone release in the rat and the firing rate of magnocellular supraoptic nucleus neurones. There is also a reduced hormone release in response to hypovolaemia and raised plasma sodium concentration compared to sham operated animals, with a smaller increase in neuronal activity. as determined by immediate-early gene expression. The normal responses can be restored by nocturnal administration of melatonin. Melatonin also influences the neurohypophysial hormone response in the human to known stimuli of release, such as raised plasma osmolality, exercise and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Recent studies have revealed that not only does the release of vasopressin and oxytocin vary over each 24 h, but the respective renal and pregnant uterine responses also show diurnal variations.

AB There has been considerable interest in heart rate (fH) fluctuations in relation to cardiovascular control systems and foetal conditions during pregnancy in mammals. prominent fluctuations in fH also occur in avian embryos, which are an important experimental model for studying developmental physiology. The present study determined the instantaneous fH of seven chick embryos continuously from the last stage of prenatal development (day 18), throughout the pipping (perinatal) period (days 19-21) until hatching and, subsequently, of newly hatched chicks (up to day 2),
   The distinctive patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations took the form of specific changes within a broad mean fH baseline. Cyclic oscillations (ultradian rhythm) occurred until an early stage of the perinatal period, when the fH baseline started rising, Subsequently, the baseline dropped and respiratory arrhythmia began to appear concomitant with external pipping, During the final stage of external pipping, when the fH baseline rose again prior to hatching, three unique patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations were evident: relatively long-lasting cyclic small accelerations, irregular intermittent large accelerations and short-term repeated large accelerations. Furthermore, repeated alternate occurrences of the latter two types of acceleration formed an additional oscillating pattern with a period of 10-15 min.
   During the early period after hatching, when the fH baseline reached its maximum, instantaneous fH changed relatively slowly accompanied by transient rapid decelerations, probably due to augmented vagal tone, Subsequently, the mean fH baseline dropped to its minimum, and a circadian rhythm and three types of previously reported fH fluctuations (types I-III) appeared.
   Developmental patterns of mean fH and the appearance of distinctive patterns of instantaneous fluctuations in fH and circadian rhythms were not influenced by an ultimate failure of hatching after a normal development.
   The demonstration of complex, repeatable patterns of fH fluctuation that change during development suggests that the avian embryo model should be useful in studying the phenomenon of fH fluctuation and its underlying causes.

AB Studies on the maternal transfer of photoperiodic information in mammals indicate that the daily photoperiod perceived by the mother during the gestation-lactation period is communicated to the fetus either through the placenta or via the milk. However, the impact of photoperiodic exposures during gestation and lactation on the maternal pineal and reproductive physiology has not been reported for any tropical rodent. The exposure of pregnant female Indian palm squirrels (Funambulus pennanti) to constant light (24 h light:0 h dark), constant dark (0 h light: 24 h dark), long daylength (14 h light: 10 h dark) or short daylength (10 h light: 14 h dark) during early gestation (< 30 days) resulted in the resorption of pregnancy, while during late gestation (> 30 days), it did not interfere with the maintenance of pregnancy. Alterations in photoperiodic condition during late gestation and lactation altered the postpartum recovery process. Pineal gland activity, as assessed by pineal mass, protein content and plasma melatonin, was lowest during the breeding phase, but increased gradually after parturition until the next breeding phase. During gestation and lactation, constant light, long daylength and short daylength conditions were less effective, while constant dark condition had a profound effect in depressing pineal gland activity, which subsequently advanced postpartum recovery. Hence, lactating females under constant darkness prepare themselves for next mating much earlier than females under natural daylength (12 h light:12 h dark) conditions. Therefore, photoperiodic information, mediated via the pineal gland, may be important for maintaining gestation physiology as well as postpartum recovery in female rodents.

TI Effect of hormone variations and other factors on symptom severity in

SO MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS
LA English
DT Article
ID ESTROUS-CYCLE; DOPAMINE; FLUCTUATIONS; INFUSION
AB Objective: To determine if any relationship exists between the severity of symptoms in women with dystonia and female reproductive hormonal variations.
   Patients and Methods: We surveyed 279 women with dystonia seen at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale over a 6-year period (1990-1995), and 204 responded. The women were asked questions regarding their reproductive and menstrual histories and dystonia severity and other questions with an emphasis on possible exacerbating or relieving factors,
   Results: Although in the majority of women hormonal influences had no consistent effect on dystonia symptom severity, 26 (41.9%) of 62 premenopausal women noted a change in the severity of their dystonic symptoms in relation to the 3 phases of their menstrual cycle. Other factors that exacerbated dystonia included stress and fatigue, while sleep improved symptoms, Pregnancy, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy had no effect on symptoms.
   Conclusions: Menstrual cycling may result in subjective worsening of dystonia symptoms in some women with dystonia, Further clinical and physiologic evaluation is indicated in such patients, as they may represent an important subgroup of dystonic patients that might yield some cites to the pathophysiology of dystonia and to improved treatment strategies.

TI Managing women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy - Canadian
   consensus
SO CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
LA English
DT Article
AB QUESTION I have a 30-year-old pregnant patient who is asthmatic and is taking prednisone. Whenever she decreases her prednisone dose, her nausea increases tremendously even though she is taking two tablets of doxylamine and pyridoxine combination (Diclectin(R)) daily. She is already at 26 weeks' gestation, and I really do not want her to continue the prednisone beyond what is needed for her asthma, but two attempts to taper prednisone off failed because of unbearable nausea.
   ANSWER Several controlled trials show the efficacy of prednisone for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), but your case is fascinating in proving the point by challenge-rechallenge. You should try to decrease the prednisone while increasing doxylamine and pyridoxine to its recommended dose of two tablets before sleep, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon.

AB We examined the precesses of cortical activation and deactivation of the fetal brain during spontaneous sleep state transitions and during central nervous processing of vibroacoustic stimulations (VASs) using nonlinear analysis of the electrocorticogram (ECoG). Tests of nonlinearity and a random shuffling routine revealed deterministic and nonlinear portions in the fetal ECoG. As common nonlinear measures are not applicable to nonstationary time series, we developed an algorithm to estimate the predictability of the ECoG in its time course by means of a point prediction error (PPE). The ECoG was recorded before and during VAS from the maternal abdominal surface in seven chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0.8 of gestation. The PPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM steep. VAS in NREM sleep resulted in an abrupt increase of the PPE not reaching the level of REM sleep. The steep increase of the PPE at onset and its slow decrease after cessation of the stimulus were very similar to the dynamics of spontaneous sleep state transitions, suggesting the involvement of the same cortical activating mechanisms. In conclusion, the stage and the time course of fetal brain activation and deactivation patterns can be clearly shown by PPE techniques. The PPE is a useful complement to spectral analysis. Both techniques describe different properties of the ECoG.

AB We validated the use of urine to monitor changes in the activity of both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in swine. Ten pregnant sows were fitted with venous catheters 3 wk after mating. In the early (wk 6), middle (wk 9), and late (wk 14) stages of gestation, blood and urine were collected over 24 h to monitor diurnal changes in plasma cortisol, urinary cortisol, and urinary catecholamines (norepinephrine [NE] and epinephrine [EPI]). Dexamethasone suppression tests (DST) and ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) challenge tests were also performed at each stage of gestation. All plasma and urinary values changed markedly around the clock. Diurnal variations of urinary cortisol were comparable to those in plasma, with a late nocturnal peak and a trough occurring in the evening. During the dark period, urinary catecholamines were lower than during the light period. Norepinephrine increased sharply after lights came on and peaked after meal time. Epinephrine began to rise at the end of the dark period and peaked just before meal time. Average plasma cortisol increased with the stage of gestation, due to higher levels during daylight hours. Dexamethasone at 2000 (20 mu g/kg i.v.) decreased plasma cortisol at 0830 and nocturnal cortisol excretion. The magnitude of the decrease in plasma ACTH and urinary cortisol after DST was lower in late than in early and midgestation, indicating increased feedback resistance at that stage. The CRH (1 mu g/kg i.v.) increased plasma and urinary cortisol. Peak levels occurred 30 min and 2 to 3 h after the injection, respectively. Catecholamines and cortisol in urine produced during the night (2000 to 0800) and the early morning (0400 to 0800 and 0800 to 0900) were highly correlated with their 24-h excretion rate. These results indicate that it is possible to monitor changes in the HPA axis and SNS activity through urinary measurements in pigs.

AB We have examined the effects of exposure to chronic maternal anemia, throughout the final one-third of gestation, on postnatal ventilatory and arousal responses to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia-hypercapnia in sleeping lambs. While resting quietly awake, lambs from anemic ewes had higher arterial PCO2 levels than control animals during the first 2-3 postnatal wk, but pH, arterial PO2, and arterial O-2 saturation were not different. During active and quiet sleep lambs from anemic ewes had higher end-tidal CO2 levels than control animals when breathing room air and at the time of spontaneous arousal or when aroused by progressive hypercapnia or by combined hypoxia-hypercapnia. Ventilation and arterial O-2 saturation during uninterrupted sleep and ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia (inspiratory O-2 fraction, 10%), progressive hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia/hypercapnia were not significantly affected by exposure to maternal anemia. Our findings show that maternal anemia results in elevated PCO2 levels in the offspring. This effect may be due, at least in part, to altered pulmonary function.

AB To determine whether gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in culture without the hypothalamus secrete GnRH in a pulsatile fashion, the nasal placode (NAP) was obtained at day 13.5 of gestation and cultured by a roller tube method. If the GnRH release occurs in a pulsatile fashion, it can be said that the pulse generator of GnRH exists inherently in each cell or community of cells in the culture. The concentration of GnRH in the NAP culture medium collected at 8-min intervals for 160 min after 2- to 4-week cultures showed that GnRH release occurred in a pulsatile fashion with a mean interpulse interval of 29.8 +/- 2.3 min (n = 9), When the NAP was cultured with tissues of the forebrain vesicle (n = 3) or the hypothalamus (n = 4), GnRH was also released in a pulsatile fashion with similar intervals (27.3 +/- 1.0 min for the NAP+forebrain vesicle culture and 36.0 +/- 6.3 min for the NAP+hypothalamus culture) as those in cultures without brain tissues. It is concluded that pulsatile GnRH release is an inherent function of GnRH neurons. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB To determine the influence of maternal smoking on autonomic nervous system in healthy infants, 36 infants were recorded polygraphically for one night. Their mothers were defined, according to their smoking frequency during pregnancy, as "nonsmokers" (no cigarettes smoked during pregnancy) or "smokers" (10 or more cigarettes per day). The infants had a median postnatal age of 10.5 wk (range 6 to 16 wk); 18 were born to nonsmokers, and 18 to smokers. During the whole night, spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) were evaluated as a function of sleep stages. Two major peaks were recognizable: a low-frequency component (LF) related to sympathetic and parasympathetic activities and a high-frequency component (HF) reflecting parasympathetic tonus. The ratio of LF/HF powers was calculated as an index of sympathovagal interaction. In REM sleep, "smokers" infants were characterized by significantly lower HF powers and normalized HF powers, and higher LF/HF ratios than "nonsmokers." The finding did not reach statistical significance in NREM sleep. In conclusion, maternal smoking induced changes in autonomic control and maturation in infants. These effects of cigarette smoke exposure can be added to those already reported and offer additional evidence for counseling mothers to stop smoking.

AB Objective To evaluate the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on the neurogenic control of neonatal heart rate.
   Methods Thirty-six healthy newborns (20 boys and 16 girls) with a mean age of 52 h were examined by means of Hotter ECG recordings during quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS) and awake states. Seventeen of the mothers had smoked during pregnancy and 19 were non-smokers,
   To compare the neonatal autonomic control of heart rate between the smoking and the non-smoking groups, heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated with spectral analysis of R-R intervals and the mean values of 2-min epochs. Total power, low-frequency power (LF), high-frequency power (HF) and the low to high frequency ratio (LF/HF) were examined. The LF/HF ratio is considered to reflect sympathovagal balance.
   Results Prenatal exposure to nicotine did not influence the total power or the high- or low-frequency components. Boys had a tendency to higher HRV than girls and this was significantly higher at LF during 95. On combining the effects of maternal smoking and gender, boys with smoking mothers had a lower LF/HF ratio than boys with non-smoking mothers: 0.87 +/- 0.37 and 1.34 +/- 0.51, respectively (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion Smoking during pregnancy may have a different effect on the sympathovagal balance in the development of the fetal male autonomic nervous system than on that of the female.

AB Prenatal exposure to alcohol can produce a number of behavioral alterations, including hyperactivity, learning deficits and motor impairments. However, the severity and nature of behavioral alterations varies markedly among children of women who drink during pregnancy. One important determinant of this variation may be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. Recently, we demonstrated that exposure to alcohol during development produced hyperactivity in rats bred for high alcohol sensitivity (HAS), but not in rats bred for low alcohol sensitivity (LAS). These lines were selectively bred for extremes in alcohol-induced "sleep time." The present study investigated the effects of ethanol exposure during development on motor coordination later in life in both HAS and LAS rats. Using an artificial rearing procedure, neonatal pups from each line were exposed to a binge-like alcohol treatment on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. Within each line, one group was exposed to ethanol (6.0 g/kg/day), one group served as an artificially reared control, and a third served as a normally reared control group. On PD 30, parallel bar motor performance was evaluated. Exposure to ethanol during development severely impaired motor performance in the HAS rats compared to their controls. In LAS rats, early ethanol exposure produced only mild and nonsignificant effects on motor performance. Thus, HAS rats were more vulnerable to ethanol-induced motor deficits compared to the LAS rats. Importantly, there were no differences in peak blood alcohol level between the lines, indicating that vulnerability to ethanol's teratogenic effects was not due to differences in metabolic rate. These results suggest that genetic differences in response to alcohol may serve as a predictor for susceptibility to ethanol's teratogenic effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Study objective: Our purpose was to study the relationship between snoring and pregnancy-induced hypertension and growth retardation of the fetus.
   Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional, consecutive case series.
   Setting: The Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Umea, Sweden,
   Participants and measurements: On the day of delivery, 502 women with singleton pregnancies completed a questionnaire about snoring, witnessed sleep apneas, and daytime fatigue. Data concerning medical complications were taken from the women's casebooks.
   Results: During the last week of pregnancy, 23% of the women reported snoring every night, Only 4% reported snoring before becoming pregnant, Hypertension developed in 14% of snoring women, compared with 6% of nonsnorers (p < 0.01), Preeclampsia occurred in 10% of snorers, compared with 4% of nonsnorers (p < 0.05), An Apgar score less than or equal to 7 was more common in infants born to habitual snorers. Growth retardation of the fetus, defined as small for gestational age at birth, had occurred in 7.1% of the infants of snoring mothers and 2.6% of the remaining infants (p < 0.05), Habitual snoring was independently predictive of hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; p < 0.05) and growth retardation (OR, 3.45; p < 0.01) in a logistic regression analysis controlling for weight, age, and smoking.
   Conclusions: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a sign of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Snoring indicates a risk of growth retardation of the fetus.

AB Blood specimens were obtained at different daily times from the umbilical cord and brachial vein from 53 women within 10 minutes after delivery. Enzyme activities were measured in the white blood cells (WBCs) and serum of each sample. For each enzyme, the results were grouped according to sampling (delivery) times and arrayed to form a 24h time series. Separate time series were generated for maternal and fetal enzymes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and cosine best-fit analyses were applied to elucidate significant differences between enzyme activity patterns of mothers and fetuses with regard to time dependency, number of peaks, and acrophases. These and previously documented results indicate that not all mothers and fetuses have rhythms that are concordant. For some enzymes of fetuses, the activity rhythms differ in phase and shape of the time series pattern from those of the mothers; for other enzymes, the activity rhythms develop after birth.

AB Several reports indicate that pregnancy and parturition are associated with elevated maternal pain thresholds to noxious stimuli. The objective of this study was to examine whether the human placental extract, a clinically used preparation. can inhibit experimental nociception. Nociception was assessed in mice using acetic acid-induced writhing and hot-plate tests. The human placental extract (200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.) elicited dose related antinociception in the acetic acid-induced writhing test. Furthermore, it (200 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the morphine-induced antinociception (1.25 mg/kg, s.c.). In the hot-plate test, the human placental extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.) per sr, displayed no significant antinociception but potentiated the duration of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) analgesia. The potentiation by the extract of the morphine-induced antinociception in both acetic acid and hot-plate tests was, however. Found to be naloxone sensitive. Mice treated with the extract (400 mg/kg, i.p.) neither manifested any overt behavioural change ill the open-field test nor demonstrated significant influence on pentobarbital sleeping time, suggesting that it has no central depressant or sedative activity. The data provide evidence to show that the human placental extract has a peripheral analgesic property possibly mediated by an opioid mechanism.

AB The postpartum is a time when healthy, young women interact with the health care system and when they may be uniquely interested in increasing healthy behaviors both for their own welfare and that of their newborn infant. For women who care for small preterm infants, unique challenges may be posed in optimizing healthy behaviors in the early months of their young infants' Lives. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in health behaviors between mothers of preterm, very low birth-weight infants and of mothers of healthy term infants. Specifically, changes in weight loss, nutrition, exercise, sleep, caffeine intake, and smoking were examined over the first four postpartum months. The sample consisted of 124 mothers of term and preterm infants who reported weight, a 24-hour diet recall, a sleep log, and the Four Week Physical Activity Questionnaire, and who had peripheral blood drawn to measure caffeine and cotinine. No differences were noted in the health behaviors of mothers of preterm and term infants. Mothers were successful in losing weight and managing sleep. Minimal amounts of caffeine were ingested. However, mothers consumed high fat diets, had minimal exercise, and increased smoking activity over the first four postpartum months. Recommendations for hearth care professionals are made.

TI Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - are parents getting the message?

DT Article
ID SLEEPING POSITION; MATERNAL SMOKING; COT DEATH; RISK; PREGNANCY; ASTHMA
AB Background Factors that place an infant at increased risk of sudden infant death include the prone sleep position, overheating and parental smoking, while practices such as bottle-feeding, co-sleeping and the use of pacifiers remain controversial. Major publicity campaigns have been undertaken, which have included the distribution of printed material and extensive media coverage.
   Aims To examine if Irish parents follow the currently recommended childcare guidelines to reduce the risk of sudden infant death and to examine factors that may have impact on their acceptance.
   Methods A random selection of 197 infants from the Birth Register of the Eastern Health Board. Parents were interviewed and a semi-structured survey questionnaire was completed,
   Results Forty one per cent of infants are still placed on their side to sleep, an inherently unstable position. First time parents are more likely to place their infants on their backs. Over 60% of infants are exposed to one or more adults smoking in the home despite parental knowledge of its association with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Sixty eight per cent of infants are overwrapped at night and parental understanding of what constitutes overwrapping is poor, Thirteen per cent of infants regularly co-sleep with their parents and 20% of these parents smoke. Pacifier use is common.
   Conclusion Future programmes should target first time parents, should provide clear information regarding appropriate infant thermal environment, and should ensure regular updating of medical personnel so that they can instruct families on best current practice. Smoking remains a significant health issue with an impact on sudden infant death.

AB The prevalence of depressive disorders in women is twice that in men. This Sender difference emerges around the time of puberty and persists through the childbearing years. Reproductive events and psychosocial factors are important influences on depression in women. Women often present with atypical depressive symptoms and comorbid disorders that can complicate both diagnosis and treatment. Sex differences in pharmacokinetics have been noted, as well as differences in antidepressant treatment response. While sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain may be part sf the constellation of depressive symptoms, they are also important considerations in selecting a treatment option for depressed women.

Three scenarios consisted of EPs unable to work regular shifts because of periodic migraines, a sleep disorder, and periodic difficulty handling stress, The other scenarios involved an EP with a probable future pregnancy, a recovered alcoholic, and a healthy HIV-positive physician. Most respondents said they were unlikely to recommend hiring colleagues who disclose a disorder restricting their availability for regular shifts. EPs; were generally tolerant of recovered alcoholics and plans for pregnancy leave, but nearly half had significant reservations regarding hiring HIV-positive peers, Am understanding of which conditions negatively impact an EP's ability to obtain employment in Emergency Medicine may be useful in emergency medicine career counseling or in the process of obtaining disability coverage, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

DE prolactin; parity; metoclopramide; domperidone
ID BREAST-MILK; PREGNANCY; RELEASE
AB OBJECTIVE: The gastrointestinal motility agents metoclopramide and domperidone are known to increase pituitary prolactin (PRL) secretion and breast milk production. This study compared the effect of single doses of two strengths of metclopramide and a single dose of domperidone on PRL secretion.
   METHODS: Ten pregnant women had baseline evaluation of serum PRL concentrations. The PRL concentrations were then determined after random oral administration of metoclopramide 10 mg, metoclopramide 5 mg, and domperidone 10 mg. Blood samples were drawn in the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle, at 13 time points over a 6-hour period (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes), with the zero time point beginning at 0800 hours. Variables such as weight, height, age, gravidity, parity, and oral contraceptive use were recorded.
   RESULTS: Baseline PRL concentrations showed the natural circadian rhythm. Metoclopramide and domperidone both caused a significant increase in PRL. However PRL secretion was most influenced by parity. Nulliparous women had the quickest and highest PRL secretion with metoclopramide 10 mg, compared with the PRL response with metoclopramide 5 mg and domperidone 10 mg. Conversely, multiparous women had PRL secretion patterns that were equivalent between the medications.
   Conclusions: The PRL response to the medications was most influenced by parity. Therefore, we suggest that the medication therapy of choice for enhancing lactation may not be the same in all women, but may instead be determined by parity.

TI The voiding pattern of healthy preterm neonates
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY

DT Article
DE bladder; premature infant; urine; ultrasonography
AB Purpose: To elucidate further the maturation of voiding habits from gestation to infancy we investigated the free voiding pattern of healthy preterm neonates.
   Materials and Methods: We evaluated 11 male and 8 female healthy preterm newborns at a mean of 32 weeks after cessation of menstrual flow (postmenstrual age). Assessment was done in the neonatal ward using 4-hour voiding observation, a method described previously in studies of free voiding pattern of full-term newborns.
   Results: The voiding pattern of male and female preterm neonates was characterized by 1 void per hour and a mean voided volume of 53% of bladder capacity with 58% frequency of interrupted voiding. Residual urine was increased but varied during observation (mean 11% bladder capacity) and was 0 after at least 1 void during 4 hours in 14 of the 19 subjects. Two-thirds of all voiding occurred during sleep, whereas a third of the newborns showed signs of arousal with a mean awake time of only 17 minutes.
   Conclusions: The voiding pattern of preterm versus full-term subjects is characterized by an increased number of interrupted voidings, further indicating that these voidings represent immature behavior of detrusor-sphincter coordination. Also, the high number of voidings during sleep suggest a more immature pattern for preterm newborns.

AB Objective: To describe changes in women's sleep patterns from prepregnancy to postpartum.
   Methods: Polysomnography was done in women's homes for 2 consecutive nights. Forty-five women were studied during the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles, and 33 conceived and were studied during each trimester of pregnancy. Twenty-nine were studied at 1 and 3 months postpartum.
   Results: Compared with prepregnant sleep characteristics, significant changes in sleep patterns were evident by 11-12 weeks' gestation, with a significant increase in total sleep time but less deep sleep and more awakening during sleep. By the third month postpartum, there was improvement in sleep characteristics; however, sleep efficiency remained significantly lower than baseline prepregnancy values.
   Conclusion: Sleep disturbance was greatest during the first postpartum month, particularly for first-time mothers. (Obstet Gynecol 2000;95:14-8. (C) 2000 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.).

AB Objective. Little is known about the neurophysiologic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use. The aim of this study, designed to overcome methodologic limitations of previous research, was to investigate the effects of prenatal cocaine use on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, a marker of central nervous system development.
   Methods. In a longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible newborns were fullterm, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or crack during their pregnancy (n = 34).
   Results. Women who used cocaine/crack during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral EEG power values at 1 year of age. Prenatal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use were found to affect state regulation and cortical activities.
   Conclusions. These results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use can be detected with quantitative EEG measures.

AB During pregnancy, placenta-derived CRH increases exponentially in the plasma. Circulating levels of CRH-binding protein decrease considerably in the last trimester of pregnancy, resulting in further elevation of bioavailable plasma CRH, The adrenal glands during pregnancy gradually become hypertrophic because of the increase in ACTH, which parallels that of CRH, Thus, pregnancy is a transient period of relative hypercortisolism, The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy has been proposed to function as a biological clock. In this model, the placenta is perceived as a stress-sensitive organ and placental CRH as a timing starter, determining a preterm, term, or postterm labor. During pregnancy, as well as during the immediate postpartum period, the hypothalamic maternal CRH secretion is suppressed, because of the circulating levels of cortisol, Hypothalamic CRH secretion normalizes within 12 weeks. This transient postpartum maternal hypothalamic CRH suppression, together with the steroid withdrawal that follows parturition, might be causally related to the mood disorders and the vulnerability to autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis often observed during the postpartum period.

AB Instantaneous heart rate (IHR) of chicks was determined by electrocardiogram measured non-invasively from the day of hatch to day 6 for continuity of investigation of HR fluctuations from embryos and for ascertainment of HR diurnal rhythms. In Experiment I, IHR was determined for 1-h periods twice a day, in daytime and at night, to investigate development of heart rate fluctuations (variability and irregularities). Chick IHR was substantially more arrhythmic than embryonic HR and spontaneous accelerations dominated HR fluctuations. Chick HR fluctuations were categorized into three types, [1] Type I as a widespread baseline HR (20-50 bpm) due to respiratory arrhythmia, with a mean oscillatory frequency of 0.74 Hz (range 0.4-1.2 Hz); [2] Type II as low frequency oscillations of baseline HR, at a mean of 0.07 Hz (range 0.04-0.10 Hz), and [3] Type III as non-cyclic irregularities, dominated by frequent transient accelerations. In Experiment II, continuous measurements of HR were made under conditions of a natural photoperiod, thermoneutrality and with feed available throughout the first week after hatching and circadian rhythms of HR were ascertained. HR was very variable in the daytime (250-500 bpm), due in part to feeding and activity, and decreased to a diurnal low (200-350 bpm) at night when mean HR was relatively stable. HR fluctuations persisted throughout the diurnal cycle. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To describe sleeping position, room and bed-sharing, tobacco smoke exposure and infant feeding for a sample of Australian Aboriginal infants from a metropolitan area.
   Methods: Interviews with Aboriginal mothers who resided in the Perth metropolitan area and had given birth during a continuous 15-month study period. The interviews took place when the infants were approximately 6-12 weeks old and efforts were made to contact all eligible mothers. Results are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: Of all the eligible mothers (n=515), 87% were contacted and 53% (n=273) completed the interview. Of all the infants, 11% slept prone, 96% shared a room and 68% shared a bed; 65% of mothers smoked during pregnancy and 65% were smokers at the time of interview; 66% of the partners were smokers and 80% of the infants were regularly exposed to tobacco smoke; 89% of mothers initiated breast-feeding and 70% were breast-feeding at time of interview.
   Conclusion: Prevalences of non-prone sleeping and breast-feeding are similar to the overall Western Australian population, whilst tobacco smoke exposure of the infants is markedly higher. Programs of community and family education and support are required urgently to decrease this exposure.

AB Most vital statistics indicators of the health of Americans were stable or showed modest improvements between 1997 and 1998. The preliminary birth rate in 1998 was 14.6 births per 1000 population, up slightly from the record low reported for 1997 (14.5). The fertility rate, births per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years, increased 1% to 65.6 in 1998, compared with 65.0 in 1997. The 1998 increases, although modest, were the first since 1990, halting the steady decline in the number of births and birth and fertility rates in the 1990s.
   Fertility rates for total white, non-Hispanic white, and Native American women each increased from 1% to 2% in 1998. The fertility rate for black women declined 19% from 1990 to 1996, but has changed little since 1996. The rate for Hispanic women, which dropped 2%, was lower than in any year for which national data have been available. Birth rates for women 30 years or older continued to increase. The proportion of births to unmarried women remained about the same at one third.
   The birth rate for teen mothers declined again for the seventh consecutive year, and the use of timely prenatal care (82.8%) improved for the ninth consecutive year, especially for black (73.3%) and Hispanic (74.3%) mothers.
   The number and rate of multiple births continued their dramatic rise; the number of triplet and higher-order multiple births jumped 16% between 1996 and 1997, accounting, in part, for the slight increase in the percentage of low birth weight (LBW) births. LBW continued to increase from 1997 to 1998 to 7.6%.
   The infant mortality rate (IMR) was unchanged from 1997 to 1998 (7.2 per 1000 live births). The ratio of the IMR among black infants to that for white infants (2.4) remained the same in 1998 as in 1997. Racial differences in infant mortality remain a major public health concern. In 1997, 65% of all infant deaths occurred to the 7.5% of infants born LBW. Among all of the states, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire had the lowest IMRs. State-by-state differences in IMR reflect racial composition, the percentage LBW, and birth weight-specific neonatal mortality rate for each state. The United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality.
   Expectation of life at birth increased slightly to 76.7 years for all gender and race groups combined. Death rates in the United States continue to decline, including a drop in mortality from human immunodeficiency virus. The age-adjusted death rate for suicide declined 6% in 1998; homicide declined 14%. Death rates for children from all major causes declined again in 1998. A large proportion of childhood deaths, however, continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

AB Maternal entrainment of circadian activity rhythm was studied in the laboratory mouse (C57BL/6J). Pregnant mice gave birth in constant dim light and the mother raised the pups until Postnatal Day 18 (weaning). The wheel running activity of these pups was individually monitored from Day 18. It was found that the phases of pups' activity on the day of weaning were similar to the phases of their mother's rhythm (p < 0.001), indicating that maternal entrainment occurs in the C57BL/6J pups. When the mother mouse was cyclically presented to the pups for 12 h of a day, thereby creating presence-absence (PA) cycles of 12:12 h, it was found that the pups' activity rhythm entrained to the imposed cycles. The onset of activity of the pups coincided with the beginning of the mother's 12-h absence period. It is proposed that the social contact between the mother and the pups is taken by the pups as subjective day (rest time) and absence of the mother as subjective night (activity time). This maternal (nonphotic) entrainment, however, does not continue beyond Postnatal Days 23-26, despite ongoing PA. cycles. These results indicate that the PA cycles of the mother are a transient zeitgeber, and are effective in entraining the rhythm of pups only for about 4 weeks after birth.

AB The present study analyzes the morphological aspects of the cerebellum of rats with prenatal exposure to ozone. A double blind histological and planimetric analysis was performed studying sagittal sections of the anterior cerebellar lobe at postnatal days 0, 12 and 60. Ozone exposed rats showed cerebellar necrotic signs at age 0, diminished area of the molecular layer with Purkinje cells with pale nucleoli and perinucleolar bodies at age 12, and Purkinje cells showing nuclei with unusual clumps of chromatin in the periphery at age 60. We conclude that exposure to high concentrations of ozone during gestation induces permanent cerebellar damage in rats. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. - This case-control prospective study was conducted to determine whether and how medical, psychological and affective development differs from premature to full-term newborns without severe disability.
   Population and methods. - Newborns under or at 33 weeks gestation (W) were included from December 1992 to January 1994 and were matched with two controls. The same examiners evaluated each infant at the effective postnatal age of nine to ten months.
   Results. - Fifty premature babies (average gestational age [GA] = 30.7 W) were compared to 100 controls. The main problems were bronchopulmonary (P = 0.03) and sleep (P = 0.027) disorders. Motor disability was suspected in 9% of the cases and none control (P = 0.00003, OR = 3.44). By multivariate analysis, cases differed from the controls by infant-mother relation disturbances (OR = 13.3), motherhood anxiety (OR = 13.3), poor expressiveness (OR = 5.6), peripheral tonus anomalies (OR = 39.5) and sleep troubles (OR = 5.8).
   Conclusion. - Premature newborns had risks for the child-mother relation but not for psychoaffective development disturbances. (C) 1999 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Our study looked at the variation in peripheral blood lymphocytes, during the menstrual cycle, of frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) in 819 women and cells with aberrant chromosomes (CA) in a selected sample of 136 volunteers. We observed significant fluctuations in SCE and CA frequencies: SCEs reached a maximum value at the end of menstruation and a low at the time of ovulation, whereas CAs showed a continuous increase from the beginning of the menstrual cycle up to the time of ovulation and a progressive decrease thereafter. MN frequency did not fluctuate in a statistically significant way. No statistically significant differences in SCE, CA and MN frequencies were observed when fertile women were compared with women taking the contraceptive pill or those in menopause and no difference was found between women who had undergone physiological or surgically induced menopause. Moreover, no difference was found between women with a history of miscarriages and matched controls. These data together suggest that the natural variations in sexual hormone levels, but not those due to the contraceptive pill or their reduction at menopause, can contribute in modulating the baseline frequencies of SCEs and CAs, Moreover, these data suggest that the increased risks either of producing a chromosome imbalance in the progeny (eliciting miscarriages) or of occurrence of gynaecological diseases is not predictable by evaluating cytogenetic end-points in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

ID PREGNANCY
AB In this article, we report the case of a 16-month-old German boy who was admitted to the Children's Hospital of Stuttgart with a 4-week history of intermittent fever, decreased appetite, weakness, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. He was healthy at birth and remained so for the first 15 months of his life. On admission, physical examination showed enlarged cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes, as well as hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory data revealed pancytopenia, elevated liver function tests, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Blood, stool, and urine culture results were negative. Viral infections and rheumatologic and autoimmune disorders were ruled out, but a positive titer for Leishmania antibodies was noted. In a liver and bone marrow biopsy, the amastigote form of the parasite could not be seen in cells. The promastigote form of Leishmania was found and the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was made by combining the cultures of both the liver and the bone marrow biopsy material in 5 mL 0.9% saline on brain heart infusion agar, supplemented with defibrinated rabbit blood and incubated at 25 to 26 degrees C for 5 days. The parasite was identified by Southern blot analysis as Leishmania infantum.
   Specific therapy with the antimonial compound sodium stibogluconate with a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight was begun immediately. Within 4 days, the patient became afebrile. The side effects of treatment, including erosive gastritis, cholelithiasis, worsening hepatosplenomegaly, elevation of liver enzymes, pancreatitis, and electrocardiogram abnormalities, necessitated the discontinuation of treatment after 17 days. On discharge 4 weeks later, the patient was stabilized and afebrile with a normal spleen, normal complete blood count, normal gammaglobulins, and decreasing antibody titers to Leishmania. During the next 24 months, the patient experienced intermittent episodes of abdominal pain, decreased appetite, recurrent arthralgia, and myalgia. But at his last examination in January 1998, he was well; all symptoms mentioned above had disappeared.
   Because the child had never left Germany, nonvector transmission was suspected and household contacts were examined. His mother was the only one who had a positive antibody titer against Leishmania donovani complex. She had traveled several times to endemic Mediterranean areas (Portugal, Malta, and Corse) before giving birth to the boy. But she had never been symptomatic for visceral leishmaniasis. Her bone marrow, spleen, and liver biopsy results were within normal limits. Culture results and polymerase chain reaction of this material were negative. A Montenegro skin test result was positive, indicating a previous infection with Leishmania. Western blot analysis showed specific recognition by maternal antibodies of antigens of Leishmania cultured from the boy's tissue.
   Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic to several tropical and subtropical countries, but also to the Mediterranean region. It is transmitted by the sand fly (Phlebotomus, Lutzomyia). Occasional nonvector transmissions also have been reported through blood transfusions, sexual intercourse, organ transplants, excrements of dogs, and sporadically outside endemic areas. Only 8 cases of congenital acquired disease have been described before 1995, when our case occurred.
   In our patient, additional evaluation showed that the asymptomatic mother must have had a subclinical infection with Leishmania that was reactivated by pregnancy, and then congenitally transmitted to the child. Visceral leishmaniasis has to be considered in children with fever, pancytopenia, and splenomegaly, even if the child has not been to an endemic area and even if there is no evidence of the disease in his environment, because leishmaniasis can be transmitted congenitally from an asymptomatic mother to her child.

DT Article
ID CLINICAL PECULIARITIES; PREVALENCE
AB We report 5 girls presenting Rett syndrome. All of them were from south Tunisia. They fulfilled the Rett syndrome diagnosis criteria (The Rett syndrome diagnosis criteria work group, 1988). Pregnancy, birth and psychomotor development during the first year of live were normal. The mean age at the onset was 19.8+/-2.5 months. The two revealing symptoms were psychomotor regression (3 cases) and epilepsy (2 cases). They were admitted to our ward at a mean age of 4.7+/-1.5 years. Clinical presentation was typical of Rett syndrome. Mental retardation, stereotypic hand movement (hand washing/wringing or clapping/tapping) and loss of purposeful manual skills were noted in ail cases. Gait was apraxic and increase of head circumference was slowed. Additional features included: respiratory dysfunction (episodic hyperventilation and breath-holding), epilepsy, scoliosis (4 cases), growth retardation and spasticity (3 cases). Electroencephalography showed slow activity with multifocal epileptiform abnormalities. Sleep enhanced these EEG abnormalities. MRI and CT-scan disclosed non specific cortical and sub-cortical atrophy. AII cases were isolated and parents were consanguineous in 3 cases. Rett syndrome is relatively frequent in Europe, but in Tunisia this disease remains rare and certainly underdiagnosed.

AB Objective. Preliminary reports suggest that antenatal steroid administration may confound the assessment of fetal well-being by suppressing biophysical activities, consequently drug-induced effects could prompt unwarranted delivery of premature fetuses. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of antenatal betamethasone administration on fetal biophysical activities and Doppler flow indices of the umbilical and middle cerebral circulation.
   Methods. Forty women at risk of premature delivery between 27-32 weeks gestation (mean 30.2 weeks) received two consecutive doses of intramuscular betamethasone, 24 hours apart. Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior for 30 minute periods and Doppler examination of the umbilical and cerebral arteries were performed prior to (0 hours), 48 hours after, and 96 hours after administration of the first dose. To account for fetal circadian rhythms and maternal prandial status, all examinations were carefully timed and performed between 1-4 pm. Analysis of Variance, chi-square lest and Fisher's Exact test were used for statistical analysis, as appropriate.
   Results. Nine patients were excluded from analysis due to delivery prior to completion of all examinations. Number of breathing episodes as well as total breathing time at 48 hours decreased by 83.0% (p<0.01) and 90.4% (p<0.01), respectively, at 48 hours in comparison to baseline. Fetal limb and trunk movements decreased by 53.2% (p<0.01) and 48.6% (p<0.01), respectively. Amniotic fluid volume and fetal tone were normal in all patients. At 48 hours, 14 of 31 fetuses and 4 of 31 fetuses had a biophysical profile score of 6/8 and 4/8, respectively, in comparison to 0 of 31 and 0 of 31 at 0 hours (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). All parameters returned to baseline values sit 96 h. Pulsatility indices of umbilical and middle cerebral arteries remained unchanged at 48 hours and 96 hours (p=NS).
   Conclusions. Betamethasone induces a profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal breathing, limb and trunk movements, resulting in decreased biophysical profile scores. Awareness of this drug-induced effect might prevent unnecessary iatrogenic delivery of preterm fetuses.

ID AGENTS AFFECTING EMESIS; CHRONIC PAIN; AMITRIPTYLINE; DESIPRAMINE;

AB OBJECTIVE: Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) has been described infrequently in adults, and treatment in both children and adults remains unsatisfactory. We report clinical features of a group of adults with CVS and anecdotal outcome from open-label treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, medications that have some efficacy in other unexplained gastrointestinal disorders.
   METHODS: Clinical data were examined from 17 adult patients with CVS seen over a IO-yr period, each having been treated with a tricyclic antidepressant. Outpatient records were reviewed, clinical outcome was extracted using a priori criteria, and findings were compared with 37 patients having usual functional nausea and vomiting who also received tricyclic antidepressant therapy.
   RESULTS: Symptoms in CVS began at age 35 yr (range 14-73 yr); the average episode length was 6 days (range 1-21 days) and the symptom-free interval averaged 3.1 months (range 0.5-6 months). Vomiting cycles typically began without warning, and fewer than one-third of the subjects reported a prodrome or potential trigger event, such as menstrual periods, pregnancy, or large meals. Sleep was seemingly beneficial in 23.5%. Tricyclic antidepressant therapy was associated with complete remission in 17.6% and partial response in 58.8%, but was less effective than for functional nausea and vomiting (p = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: CVS is a rare diagnosis with distinctive features in adults. Duration of episodes and cycles varies considerably across subjects. In open-label, uncontrolled use, tricyclic antidepressants appear beneficial for some subjects but are less effective in CVS than in chronic, persistent functional nausea and vomiting.

AB This study tested the hypothesis that the uterus achieves maximum contractile capabilities before the onset of labor. Basal and agonist-stimulated contractions were assessed in uterine strips on Day 15 or 18 of pregnancy, the day of parturition, or 1 day postpartum (n = 4-13 per group). Spontaneous contractions were evident in all groups (n = 4-13 per gestational group); contraction frequency was greater in peripartum groups than in virgin controls (similar to 4.6 versus 2.8/200 sec). Peak amplitude was nearly 9-fold higher on Days 15 and 18 and over 30-fold higher in the postpartum and 1 day postpartum groups than in nonpregnant mice. Maximum frequency and peak amplitude were achieved in response to 10(-6) to 10(-8) M oxytocin or arginine vasopressin (OTmax or AVP(max)). Frequency of contractions in response to OTmax peaked on Day 18 and then declined. Contraction amplitude increased 5-fold on Day 15, declined on the day of birth (equivalent to nonpregnant level), then rebounded to peak on postpartum Day 1. AVP(max) similarly increased frequency and amplitude of contractions, except that maximum contraction amplitude occurred postpartum. Thus, an endogenous oscillator, residing in the uterus, sustains high basal and agonist-induced contraction frequency during pregnancy. Although acceleration of this pacemaker occurred before term, the data suggest that peripartum increases in contraction amplitude characterize the transition to the powerful synchronous contractions of parturition.

She underwent an elective Caesarean section delivery but ending the pregnancy did not improve her clinical symptoms. By treating her with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, a worsening of her headaches and glaucoma was prevented. The administration of acetazolamide controlled all of her symptoms. Treatment with nasal ventilation is the best initial approach, it is also important to assure normal oxygenation before pregnancy since the foetus may: suffer from the severe deprivation that may occur in these patients.

AB The discovery of the adipocyte-produced hormone leptin has greatly changed the field of obesity research and our understanding of energy homeostasis. It is now accepted that leptin is the afferent loop informing the hypothalamus about the state of fat stores, with hypothalamic efferents regulating appetite and energy expenditure. In addition, leptin has a role as a metabolic adaptator in overweight and Easting states. New and previously unsuspected neuroendocrine roles have emerged for leptin. In reproduction, leptin is implicated in fertility regulation, and it is a permissive factor for puberty. Relevant gender-based differences in leptin levels exist, with higher levels in women at birth, which persist throughout life. In adult life, there is experimental evidence that leptin is a permissive factor for the ovarian cycle, with a regulatory role exerted at the hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal levels, and with unexplained changes in pregnancy and postpartum. Leptin is present in human milk and may play a role in the adaptive responses of the newborn. Leptin plays a role in the neuroendocrine control of GH secretion, through a complex interaction at hypothalamic levels with GHRH and somato-statin. Leptin participates in the expression of CRH in the hypothalamus, interacts at the adrenal level with ACTH, and is regulated by glucocorticoids. Since leptin and cortisol show an inverse circadian rhythm, it has been suggested that a regulatory feedback is present. Finally, regulatory actions on TRH-TSH and PRL secretion have been found. Thus leptin reports the state of fat stores to the hypothalamus and other neuroendocrine areas, and the neuroendocrine systems adapt their function to the current status of energy homeostasis and fat stores.

AB This study extends previous results on the effects of low-dose aspirin on blued pressure in pregnant women at differing risk of developing hypertension in pregnancy and who received aspirin at different times according to their rest-activity cycle. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 240 pregnant women randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups according to treatment (placebo or aspirin, 100 mg/d. stm tine at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation) and the time of treatment: on awakening (time 1), 8 hours after awakening (time 2), or before bedtime (time 3). Blood pressure and heart rate for each subject were automatically monitored for 2 days every 4 weeks from the day of recruitment until delivery, as well as at puerperium (6 to 8 weeks after delivery). Subjects were further divided for comparative purposes according to the results of the tolerance-hyperbaric test for early identification of those with a higher risk for developing hypertensive complications in pregnancy, Results indicated that there was no effect of aspirin on blood pressure at time 1 (compared with placebo). A blood pressure reduction was, however, highly statistically significant at time 2 and, to a greater extent, at time 3 (mean reductions of 14.2 and 9.6 mm Hg in 24-hour means for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, at the time of delivery compared with placebo given at the same time). Effects of aspirin on blood pressure wen significantly larger for women with a positive test at the time of recruitment (P<0.001). Differences in blood pressure among pregnant women receiving aspirin at different times in the circadian cycle disappeared at puerperium (P>0.212). There was no effect of aspirin or placebo on heart rate. This study corroborates the statistically significant, time-dependent effect of low-dose aspirin on blood pressure in pregnant women with differing risk of developing hypertensive complications in pregnancy. Although the mechanism involved in the administration-time-dependent responsiveness of blood pressure to aspirin still remains uncertain, the use of doses of aspirin <80 mg/d that do not affect placental thromboxane, initiation of the use of aspirin after 16 weeks' gestation, and the lack of circadian timing for aspirin administration could all explain the lack of positive results in previous clinical trials.

AB Administration of either ethanol or adenosine inhibits fetal breathing movements (FBM), eye movements, and low-voltage electrocortical activity (LV ECoG). The concentration of adenosine in ovine fetal cerebral extracellular fluid increases during ethanol-induced inhibition of FBM. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a selective adenosine Al-receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyltheophylline (8-CPT) on the incidence of FBM during ethanol exposure. After a 2-h control period, seven pregnant ewes received a I-h intravenous infusion of ethanol (1 g/kg maternal body wt), followed 1 h later by a 2-h fetal intravenous infusion of either 8-CPT (3.78 +/- 0.08 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1)) or vehicle. Ethanol reduced the incidence of FBM from 44.0 +/- 10.4 to 2.7 +/- 1.3% (P < 0.05) and 51.2 +/- 7.6 to 11.9 +/- 5.0% (P < 0.05) in fetuses destined to receive 8-CPT or vehicle, respectively. In the vehicle group, FBM remained suppressed for 7 h. In contrast, during the first hour of 8-CPT infusion, FBM returned to baseline (31 +/- 11%) and was not different from control throughout the rest of the experiment. Ethanol also decreased the incidence of both low-voltage electrocortical activity and eye movements, but there were no differences in the incidences of these behavioral parameters between the 8-CPT and vehicle groups throughout the experiment. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that adenosine, acting via Al receptors, may play a role in the mechanism of ethanol-induced inhibition of FBM.

AB Groningen, Ne report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 (UPD(14)). At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). He showed short stature, obesity, mild developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and some mild dysmorphic features. The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy. His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. Motor development was delayed. After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46,XY). DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities. Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD(14). At that time precocious puberty was evident. DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD(I I), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis. This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD(14) based on clinical features. This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD(14) in patients with a similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14.

SO PEDIATRICS

AB Objectives. To establish whether epidemiologic characteristics for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have changed since the decrease in death rate after the "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1991, and to compare these characteristics with sudden and unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI) from explained causes.
   Design. Three-year, population-based, case-control study. Parental interviews were conducted soon after the death and for 4 controls matched for age and date of interview. All sudden unexpected deaths were included in the study and the cause of death was established by a multidisciplinary panel of the relevant health care professionals taking into account past medical and social history of the mother and infant, the circumstances of death, and a full pediatric postmortem examination. Contributory factors and the final classification of death were made using the Avon clinicopathologic system.
   Setting. Five regions in England, with a total population of >17 million people, took part in the study. The number of live births within these regions during the particular time each region was involved in the study was 473 000.
   Study Participants. Three hundred twenty-five SIDS infants (91.3% of those available), 72 explained SUDI infants (86.7% of those available), and 1588 matched control infants (100% of total for cases included).
   Results. Many of the epidemiologic features that characterize SIDS infants and families have remained the same, despite the recent decrease in SIDS incidence in the United Kingdom. These include the same characteristic age distribution, few deaths in the first few weeks of life or after 6 months, with a peak between 4 and 16 weeks, a higher incidence in males, lower birth weight, shorter gestation, and more neonatal problems at delivery. As in previous studies there was a strong correlation with young maternal age and higher parity and the risk increased for infants of single mothers and for multiple births. A small but significant proportion of index mothers had also experienced a previous stillbirth or infant death. The majority of the SIDS deaths (83%) occurred during the night sleep and there was no particular day of the week on which a significantly higher proportion of deaths occurred. Major epidemiologic features to change since the decrease in SIDS rate include a reduction in the previous high winter peaks of death and a shift of SIDS families to the more deprived social grouping. Just more than one quarter of the SIDS deaths (27%) occurred in the 3 winter months (December through February) in the 3 years of this study. In half of the SIDS families (49%), the lone parent or both parents were unemployed compared with less than a fifth of control families (18%). This difference was not explained by an excess of single mothers in the index group. Many of the significant factors relating to the SIDS infants and families that distinguish them from the normal population did not distinguish between SIDS and explained SUDI. In the univariate analysis many of the epidemiologic characteristics significant among the SIDS group were also identified and in the same direction among the infants dying as SUDI attributable to known causes. The explained deaths were similarly characterized by the same infant, maternal, and social factors, 48% of these families received no waged income. Using logistic regression to make a direct comparison between the two index groups there were only three significant differences between the two groups of deaths: 1) a different age distribution, the age distribution of the explained deaths peaked in the first 2 months and was more uniform thereafter; 2) more congenital anomalies were noted at birth (odds ratio [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.52-6.51) among the explained deaths (20%) compared with the SIDS (8%), which was not surprising given that 10% of these deaths were explained by congenital anomalies; and 3) a higher incidence of maternal smoking during pregnancy among the SIDS mothers, the proportion of smokers within the explained SUDI group was much higher (49%) than the controls (27%), but among SIDS mothers the proportion of smokers was higher still (66%) and this difference was significant (66% vs 49%; OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.16-3.54). The largest subgroup of explained SUDI deaths were those attributable to infection (46%). There was a winter peak of deaths from infection, the highest number occurring in December (21%) but this was not significant. A multivariate model of these deaths showed parental unemployment to be the most significant factor (OR = 27.74; 95% CI: 3.19-241.34). Short gestational age (OR = 11.67; 95% CI: 1.84-74.14), neonatal problems (OR = 14.27; 95% CI: 1.89-107.81), and higher prevalence of males (OR = 9.26; 95% CI: 1.63-52.52) were also significant.
   Half of the deaths from infection occurred in crowded households (>1 adult or child per room excluding hallways, toilets, bathrooms, and kitchens if not used as a dining room) which was also a significant factor (OR = 10.37; 95% CI: 1.08-99.59). Conclusions. The study identifies changes in the epidemiologic characteristics of SIDS that have followed the "Back to Sleep" campaign, and confirms that many underlying factors are similar between infants who die as SIDS and those dying suddenly of explained causes. Many studies investigating SIDS have reported numerous epidemiologic characteristics and risk factors strongly associated with SIDS when compared with live control infants. It has been generally assumed that these factors are specific to SIDS to the extent that the syndrome has been described as an "epidemiologic entity." Many of the factors associated with SIDS that were significantly different from the control population were not significantly different when compared with the explained deaths. This suggests that SUDI share some of the same underlying factors irrespective of the clinical or pathologic findings, and challenges a rigid concept of SIDS as an epidemiologic entity. The particular finding that the incidence of maternal smoking during pregnancy, although high among mothers of explained SUDI infants, was significantly higher among SIDS mothers, lends weight to the mounting evidence that the association between smoking and SIDS may be part of a causal mechanism.

AB Prenatal stress impairs activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress in adult offspring. So far, very few data are available on the effects of prenatal stress on circadian functioning of the HPA axis. Here, we studied the effects of prenatal stress on the circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion in male and female adult rats. To evaluate the effects of prenatal stress on various regulatory components of corticosterone secretion, we also assessed the diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin, total and free corticosterone levels, and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. Finally, in the search of possible maternal factors, we studied the effects of repeated restraint stress on the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant female rats. Results demonstrate that prenatal stress induced higher levels of total and free corticosterone secretion at the end of the light period in both males and females, and hypercorticism over the entire diurnal cycle in females. No diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin was observed in any group studied. The effects of prenatal stress on corticosterone secretion could be mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in corticosteroid receptors at specific times of day. Results also show that prepartal stress alters the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant females. Those data indicate that prenatally stressed rats exhibit an altered temporal functioning of the HPA axis, which, taken together with their abnormal response to stress, reinforces the idea of a general homeostatic dysfunction in those animals, (C) 1999 John Wiley Bt Sons, Inc.

   ENTEROKINASE; RECEPTOR
AB The primary factors in feeding premature infants are dependent on the development and maturation of digestion and absorption. The maturation of digestive and absorptive functions of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins in the young premature infant were determined in relation to availability of hydrolytic enzymes, such as lipases, proteases, amylases, glucosidases, and lactase. The feeding is dependent on the ability of the premature infant to secrete salivary enzymes, gastric acid, pepsin, pancreatic exocrine enzymes, the presence of enterohepatic circulation, and the hydrolytic and absorptive capacity of the entercocyte. To evaluate the complexity of the gut maturation process, we proposed a unified concept where the ontogeny of the gastrointestinal system is the result of the following four major determinants: genetic endowment, intrinsic developmental and biological clock, endogenous regulatory mechanisms, and environmental influences. The developmental clock represents a predetermined temporal sequence of happenings in ontogeny that is inherently controlled. By 20 weeks of gestation, the anatomic differentiation of the fetal gut has progressed to the extent that it resembles that of a newborn. Secretory and absorptive functions, however, develop at different rates; the intestinal absorptive process is only partially available before 26 weeks of gestation, whereas gastric and pancreatic secretion is only basal and can be stimulated only partially even in the full-term newborn period. Regulatory mechanisms control the expression of the genetic endowment at various stages in gastrointestinal development. Neural-hormonal factors play major roles in the ontogeny of the gut. Adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy, and thyroidectomy delay the development of the gut. Administration of glucocorticoids or thyroxine at the critical stage in maturation causes early appearance of enzymes within the intestine. Other hormones that are potentially important in regulating gastrointestinal development include cholecystokinin, gastrin, secretin, which have trophic effects on the gastrointestinal tract, and insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and epidermial growth factor.
   The development of gastrointestinal secretory function, particularly in response to hormonal stimulation, has received considerable attention. The degree of response of the target cell is determined not only by the amount of effective hormone reaching it but also by the number and affinity of receptors on its surface. Human newborns have high levels of gastrin in their sera, yet have low acid output. Exogenous gastrin is an ineffective stimulant despite the presence of seemingly "anatomically developed" parietal cells. It seems that neither endogenous nor exogenous gastrin has an effect on the target cell. If one accepts the role of circulating gastrin levels in the regulation of its own receptor, one can hypothesize the absence of a regulatory effect of gastrin in the newborn period. It was shown that hormonal regulation of migrating activity by motilin is also absent in the preterm and term infant. Plasma levels of motilin in neonates are comparable to those found in adults, but migrating motor complexes occur in the absence of cycling of plasma concentrations. Interestingly, however, the motilin receptor appears to be present.
   In conclusion, the feeding mode content, concentration, and volume of the very young premature infant can be assessed by the development of digestive and absorptive capacity and gut motility. The concomitant changes in gut hormones and regulatory peptides during ontogeny and feeding will add a new dimension in the understanding of when, what, and how to feed the very young premature infant.

AB This study using an information processing model of memory, made a detailed examination of the possible locus (loci) of any memory change in gravid and postpartum women using a battery of seven objective memory tests: implicit, incidental, explicit, semantic, short-term, working, and prospective memory. In addition, links were sought bath between (a) self-reported data on sleep, health, and memory performance, and (b) these variables and objective memory performance. Five groups of women were tested (n = 22/23 per group), (1) primigravid, (2) multigravid, (3) postpartum, (4) nonpregnant parents with children, and (5) never been pregnant, an self-report and objective memory tests. The gravid and portpartum groups reported significantly more everyday forgetting than the non-pregnant groups but on the objective tests performed no differently from the non-pregnant groups on all tests. Sleep loss was a significant predictor of reported memory change, but not of any memory test performance, and may contribute to a perceived memory change. Pregnant women and new mothers generally should be confident of performing to their normal cognitive capabilities, but may be more affected than usual by a high cognitive load.

AB Aims. To determine whether exposure to fluoridated water supplies prenatally or postnatally at the time of death increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Methods. A nationwide, case-control study, with infant's water fluoridation status determined from census area unit information for mother's usual address at the time of the infant's birth, infant's usual address at the time of death / nominated sleep and address where infant died / was at nominated sleep. SIDS risk associated with fluoride exposure postnatally was assessed according to method of infant feeding (breast or reconstituted formula), for the two days prior to infant's death / nominated sleep.
   Results. Infants exposed to fluoridated water supplies during pregnancy were not at increased risk for SIDS, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82, 1.74). For breast-fed infants at the time of death / nominated sleep, fluoridated water exposure was not associated with an increased risk for SIDS, adjusted OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.66, 1.79). Similarly, 'fluoridated' formula feeding, when compared with 'unfluoridated' formula feeding, showed no increased risk of SIDS, adjusted OR 1.25 (95% CI 0.73, 2.13). There was no evidence of an interaction between fluoridation and infant feeding for the last two days (chi(2) = 0.171, df = 1, p = 0.68).
   Conclusion. Exposure to a fluoridated water supply prenatally or postnatally at the time of death did not affect the relative risk for SIDS.

AB During the first half of gestation in the rat, prolactin (PRL) from the anterior pituitary gland exerts its luteotropic function on the ovary to stimulate progesterone secretion. During this period, beta-endorphin stimulates PRL secretion by regulation of dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus. During the second half, placental lactogens (PLs) take the place of PRL in maintenance of pregnancy, and initiate a negative feedback to suppress PRL secretion. However, the effect of PLs on beta-endorphinergic neurons is not known. The aim of this study was to examine the possibility that PLs suppress PRL secretion by inhibiting beta-endorphinergic neuronal activity. To accomplish this aim, we examined the changes in the neuronal activity of beta-endorphinergic neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus, as measured by Fos immunoreactivity, after manipulating the levels of PRL and PLs during pregnancy. On day 4 of pregnancy, animals received either Rcho-1 cells in the lateral ventricle that secrete PLs or HRP-1 cells as controls. In a separate experiment on day 12, hysterectomy was performed to remove the intrinsic source of PLs. These rats received Rcho-1 cells, HRP-1 cells, or nothing. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Rcho-1 into hysterectomized rats was done to examine the effect of PL replacement. Sham-hysterectomy was also performed as a control. Animals were sacrificed 2 days after each treatment at 0200 h, 1400 h, and 1800 h. Brains were used for dual immunocytochemistry of Fos/beta-endorphin. The neuronal activity of beta-endorphinergic neurons of HRP-1 i.c.v. injected animals showed a daily rhythm, with high levels at 0200 h and 1800 h, and a low level at 1400 h. These animals also exhibited two surges of PRL secretion on day 6 of pregnancy. This rhythmicity of beta-endorphinergic neurons was also observed in Rcho-1 i.c.v. injected animals, which showed very low and unchanging PRL levels. However, the magnitude of neuronal activity was reduced. On day 14 of pregnancy, all four experimental groups showed diurnaI rhythms of beta-endorphinergic neurons. This rhythmicity occurred even though PRL was elevated at all three time points in the hysterectomized rats and very low in the Rcho-1 i.c.v. injected hysterectomized and sham-hysterectomized rats. Our results demonstrate that there is a diurnal rhythm of beta-endorphinergic neuronal activity in the mediobasal hypothalamus during pregnancy in the rat. PLs might reduce the neuronal activity of beta-endorphinergic neurons, but only during the first half of pregnancy, partially explaining the suppression of PRL surges. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Approximate entropy (ApEn) is a statistic that quantifies regularity in time series data, and this parameter has several features that make it attractive for analyzing physiological systems. In this study, ApEn was used to detect nonlinearities in the heart rate (HR) patterns of 12 low-risk human fetuses between 38 and 40 wk of gestation. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was sampled at a rate of 1,024 Hz by using Ag-AgCl electrodes positioned across the mother's abdomen, and fetal R waves were extracted by using adaptive signal processing techniques. To test for nonlinearity, ApEn for the original HR time series was compared with ApEn for three dynamic models: temporally uncorrelated noise, linearly correlated noise, and linearly correlated noise with nonlinear distortion. Each model had the same mean and SD in HR as the original time series, and one model also preserved the Fourier power spectrum. We estimated that noise accounted for 17.2-44.5% of the total between-fetus variance in ApEn. Nevertheless, ApEn for the original time series data still differed significantly from ApEn for the three dynamic models for both group comparisons and individual fetuses. We concluded that the HR time series, in low-risk human fetuses, could not be modeled as temporally uncorrelated noise, linearly correlated noise, or static filtering of linearly correlated noise.

ID VENTILATION; WOMEN; LUNG
AB Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen and, in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related disturbances, these changes could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because of conflicting data from respiratory sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 11 pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the PaO2 every 2 h. Contrary to many other studies, we found that during pregnancy PaO2 levels were significantly lower at 36 weeks of gestation compared to the postpartum period. This is probably related to the large volume of abdominal content, as in ascites, pneumoperitoneum and obesity, the effect of which is more severe in the supine position during sleep. We did not find any correlation between SaO(2)/PaO2 levels and apneas or hypopneas or percent of REM sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea was significantly lower during pregnancy, which may be due to the raised level of progesterone. This may not preserve the maternal decrease in arterial oxygen tension during sleep, in pregnant healthy women. Med Sci Res 27:549-552 (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Serum cortisol concentration at birth can reflect the prenatal adrenocortical function of young animals. Its relation with the growth rate and serum gamma-globulin levels during the first 5 days of post-natal life was studied in full-term and eutocial goat kids. Two groups of kids born with high (n = 14, 10.59 +/- 0.43 mu g/dl) or low (n = 15, 5.09 +/- 0.28 mu g/dl) serum cortisol levels had similar (p> 0.05) mean birth weight, serum glucose and gamma-globulin concentrations at birth. Post-natal profiles of serum cortisol for kids of both groups declined to a similar (p > 0.05) level by 2 days of age. The ACTH responsiveness of serum cortisol at 5 days of age was not different (p > 0.05) between groups. The kids with higher serum cortisol levels at birth gained about 33% more weight (p < 0.05) during the 5-day period than those with lower serum cortisol levels. Serum glucose levels after birth remained normal at all time intervals measured and were higher (p < 0.05) for kids born with high serum cortisol levels. The peak serum gamma-globulin level reached at about 18 h after the first colostrum feeding was greater in kids of 'high' cortisol group, and a consistently greater level of serum gamma-globulin was maintained throughout the study compared to the kids of the 'low' cortisol group. The results suggest that there does not appear to be a relationship between serum cortisol levels at birth and birth weight or post-natal adrenocortical function of normal kids. High serum cortisol levels at birth are desirable for growth and immunoglobulin acquisition of neonatal kids. The possible mechanisms were discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Melatonin (MEL) is a widely used, over-the-counter sleep aid, and it has putative contraceptive, antioxidant, antiaging, and anticancer effects. The developmental toxicity potential for repeated oral doses of MEL had not previously been evaluated. In the present studies, time-mated, Sprague-Dawley-derived (CD(R)) rats were administered MEL or vehicle by gavage on gestation days (gd) 6-19. MEL-treated groups received 1-, 10-, 100-, 150-, or 200-mg/kg body weight/day in the screening study (15 rats/group), and 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day in the definitive study (25 rats/group). In both studies, maternal food/water consumption, body weight, and clinical signs were monitored at regular intervals throughout gestation. At termination (gd 20, both studies:), maternal liver and gravid uterine weights, number of ovarian corpora lutea, conceptus survival, fetal sex, and fetal body weight were evaluated. Fetal morphological examination included external structures (both studies) as well as visceral and skeletal structures (definitive study). In the screening study, maternal serum levels of 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone were determined by radioimmunoassay, and mammary tissue was fixed, stained, and evaluated for percent glandular area within the fat pad. No maternal morbidity/mortality was found In either study. In the screening study, aversion to treatment (greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day) and reduced maternal weight gain (greater than or equal to 150 mg/kg/day) were noted, but reproductive/endocrine parameters and fetal development were not affected. In the definitive study, aversion to treatment was noted at greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day, and mild sedation, reduced maternal food intake, and reduced body weight gain were found during initial treatment with 200 mg/kg/day. MEL had no effect on prenatal survival, fetal body weight, or incidences of fetal malformations/variations. Thus, in the definitive study, the maternal toxicity NOAEL and LOAEL were 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the developmental toxicity NOAEL was greater than or equal to 200 mg/kg/day.

AB It has been reported that progesterone (P-4) induces changes in sleep, but the brain regions involved in these actions are unknown. We studied the effects of Pq microinjections into the pontine reticular formation (PRF) upon rat sleep. Intact adult male and ovariectomized female rats were unilaterally injected with Pq into the PRF and the sleep-waking cycle was recorded for 6h.P-4 (1.0 and 5.0 mu g/0.2 mu l) did not modify sleep, but at a higher dose (7.5 mu g/0.2 mu l) it produced a marked decrease in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) latency in both male (55%) and female (63%) rats. A non-significant increase in the number of REM episodes was observed after Pq administration. These findings suggest that P-4, should participate in the mechanisms related to REM initiation in the rat through its effects in the PRF. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Contradictory findings on the effect of betamethasone versus dexamethasone on antenatal tests of fetal well-being have been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of these steroid compounds on fetal heart rate patterns and biophysical activities in a prospective, randomized trial.
   Study design. Forty-six pregnant women (gestational age range 27-34 weeks) at risk for preterm delivery were randomized to receive betamethasone or dexamethasone for enhancement of fetal lung maturity. Fetal heart rate was recorded for 60 minutes and analyzed with the Sonicaid System 8000 before (0 hours), and 48 hours and 96 hours after steroid administration. Subsequently, fetal limb, body and breathing movements were sonographically observed and quantified for 30 minutes. To account for fetal circadian rhythms, all examinations were performed between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., at least one hour after maternal meals.
   Results. Fetal heart rate accelerations (p<0.001; p<0.01), short-term variation (p<0.0001; p<0.05), long-term variation (p<0.01; p=NS), duration of high episodes (p<0.001; p<0.05), total movement count (p<0.001; p<0.05), and duration of breathing time (p<0.0001; p<0.0001) were substantially reduced 48 h after betamethasone and dexamethasone administration, respectively with percent reduction being larger for the betamethasone group, except for breathing movements (p<0.05, p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.005; p<0.05; p=NS; respectively). In 68.2% and 45.5% of fetuses, less than 30 seconds of continuous breathing movements were found in the betamethasone and dexamethasone groups, respectively. In 71.8% and 12.5% of fetuses, respectively, less than 2 body/limb movements were observed. Therefore five and two fetuses in the betamethasone and dexamethasone study group, respectively, had both nonreactive fetal heart rate monitors for 60 minutes and biophysical profiles of less than or equal to 4/10. All parameters returned to baseline values at 96 h. Baseline fetal heart rate and numbers of decelerations remained unchanged (p=NS).
   Conclusions. Both betamethasone and dexamethasone induce a profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal heart rate characteristics and biophysical activities in the preterm fetus. However, the effect of betamethasone is more pronounced. Awareness of these phenomena might prevent unwarranted iatrogenic delivery of preterm fetuses.

AB Women experience depression twice as often as men. The diagnostic criteria for depression are the same for both sexes, but women with depression more frequently experience guilt, anxiety, increased appetite and sleep, weight gain and comorbid eating disorders. Women may achieve higher plasma concentrations of antidepressants and thus may require lower dosages of these medications. Depending on the patient's age, the potential effects of antidepressants on a fetus or neonate may need to be considered. Research indicates no increased teratogenic risk from in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants. SSRIs are effective in treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder and many comorbid conditions associated with depression in women. Psychotherapy may be used alone in women with mild to moderate depression, or it may be used adjunctively with antidepressant drug therapy. Women who have severe depression accompanied by active suicidal thoughts or plans should usually be managed in conjunction with a psychiatrist.

AB This study was undertaken to determine ifa relationship existed between the duration of spontaneous general movements before and after birth. Twenty-two infants were examined three times as fetuses between 38 and 40 weeks gestational age and three rimes as neonates between 2 and 4 weeks postnatal age. Motor activity level during active sleep periods was quantified by direct sonographic visualization for fetuses and by videotaped images of trunk movement for neonates. We found that both fetuses and neonates exhibited stable individual differences in motor activity level. In addition, infants who moved at a certain rate as fetuses generally moved at the same relative rate as neonates up to 4-weeks postnatal age. Our findings suggested that individual differences in motor activity level in the 1st month following birth probably arise during fetal life. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Homeostasis is maintained primarily by the parasympathetic nervous system and is thought to provide a physiological substrate for the development of complex behaviors. This investigation was undertaken to test the hypothesis that infants with high parasympathetic tone are more efficient regulators of homeostasis than infants with low parasympathetic tone. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was used as a measure of parasympathetic tone, and the efficiency of homeostatic control tvas quantified, for each infant, by the slope (S-RSA) and correlation coefficient (R-RSA) of the regression line relating fluctuations in heart period and fluctuations in RSA. To test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between RSA and both S-RSA and R-RSA in 34 low-risk human fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. We found that fetuses who were parasympathetic-dominated had larger S-RSA and R-RSA values, and hence were more efficient regulators of homeostasis, than fetuses who were sympathetic-dominated. The results of our analyses are important because they establish, very early in development, a physiological basis for the relationship between vagal tone and the development of complex behavior's.

AB To investigate the organization of diurnal rhythmicity during gestation, the relationship between daily cycles of maternal and fetal heart rate were measured in long-term studies of healthy chronically instrumented pregnant baboons. In each of six pregnancies, hourly mean values over a 168 h time series were obtained during a 7 to 10 day interval between 135 and 160 days of gestation. Data were modeled by a least squares fit to a cosine function with a period of 24 h. Hourly mean heart rate in the fetus ranged from 161 to 172 bpm (167.9+/-0.6 bpm), and the mother from 105 to 125 bpm (107.9+/-1.4 bpm). The amplitude of the daily fluctuations were 15 to 25 bpm for the fetuses and 25 to 60 bpm for the mothers. The relation between time series data and model estimates were significant (P < 0.001) in all cases with aggregate r(2) = 0.747 for fetuses and 0.737 for the mothers. On average the time of day of the peak in fetal heart rate (15:05+/-0.3 h) was about 45 min after the maternal peak (14:21+/-0.4 h). This phase delay was significant (t = 2.63, P < 0.05). There was significant (P < 0.01) diurnal periodicity for each of six parameters used to assess different aspects of fetal heart rate variability with peak variability at night (23:00 to 2:00). Thus, during the latter third of pregnancy in both the maternal and fetal baboon 24 h periodicities of heart rate are present with peak rates in the midafternoon. The daily rhythms in fetal heart rate are linked with periodicities in maternal heart rate with a phase delay in the majority of cases. The synchrony of 24 h fluctuations in rate with parameters of rate variability is consistent with diurnal input into the fetal autonomic nervous system.

AB Objective: Sudden infant death syndrome has been related to both exposure to prenatal cigarette smoke and impaired arousability from sleep. We evaluated whether healthy infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had higher auditory arousal thresholds than those born to mothers who did not smoke and whether the effects of smoking occurred before birth.
   Study design: Twenty-six newborns were studied with polygraphic recordings for 1 night: 13 were born to mothers who did not smoke, and 13 were born to mothers who smoked (>9 cigarettes per day). Other infants with a median postnatal age of 12 weeks were also studied, 21 born to nonsmoking mothers and 21 born to smoking mothers. White noise of increasing intensity was administered during rapid eye movement sleep to evaluate arousal and awakening thresholds.
   Results: More intense auditory stimuli were needed to induce arousals in newborns (P = .002) and infants (P = .044) of smokers than in infants of nonsmokers. Behavioral awakening occurred significantly less frequently in the newborns of smokers (P = .002) than of nonsmokers.
   Conclusions: Newborns and infants born to smoking mothers had higher arousal thresholds to auditory challenges than those born to nonsmoking mothers. The impact of exposure to cigarette smoke occurred before birth.

AB Objective: We tested the hypothesis that inhaled beclomethasone therapy for prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia does not cause adrenal suppression.
   Study design: Infants receiving ventilatory support with birth weights less than or equal to 1250 g and born at <33 weeks' gestation, age 3 to 14 days, were enrolled in a multicenter randomized trial to study the efficacy and safety of beclomethasone therapy Versus placebo for prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Adrenal function was assessed on study day 21 (+/- 2 days) by determination of basal and stimulated plasma cortisol levels. Initially, cortisol response was assessed with insulin-induced hypoglycemia test (IIHT) (n = 63) until an interim analysis revealed insignificant cortisol response in both study groups. Thereafter cosyntropin stimulation was used (n = 85).
   Results: Beclomethasone therapy was associated with lower median basal cortisol levels (5 mu g/dL beclomethasone, 6 mu g/dL placebo, P = .04). IIHT revealed insignificant change in cortisol response within each group. Cortisol response to cosyntropin stimulation was similar for each group (17 mu g/dL beclomethasone, 18 mu g/dL placebo, P = .86).
   Conclusion: Beclomethasone therapy was associated with a small decrease in basal cortisol levels. There was no evidence of adrenal suppression in response to cosyntropin stimulation during beclomethasone therapy Lack of cortisol response to hypoglycemia may reflect missed timing and/or decreased response of the premature infants' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to hypoglycemia.

AB The study set out to document child care practices in as many different countries and cultures as possible with the aim of providing baseline child care data and stimulating new hypotheses to explain persisting differences in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rates between countries. The protocol, piloted in four countries in 1992, was distributed to 80 potential centres in 1995. Data from 19 centres were received. This paper describes the demographic characteristics of the data from the different centres. Comparison showed significant differences for a number of variables including mean age of completion of the study, response rate, mean gestation, mean birth weight, method of delivery and incidence of admission to neonatal intensive care units. High caesarean section rates identified in the Chinese samples (44 and 40%) were unexpected and have important public health implications. This finding warrants further study but may be related to China's one child policy. We consider that international comparison of: child care practice is possible using standardised data collection methods that also allow some, individual variation according to local circumstances. However, in view of the heterogeneity of the samples, it will be important to avoid over-interpreting differences identified and to view any differences within the qualitative context of each individual. sample. Provided there is acknowledgement of limitations, such ecological studies have potential to produce useful information especially for hypothesis generation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB This study investigated the belief held by over 50% of parous women that they are more forgetful during pregnancy and postpartum relative to other times, Comparisons were made between both the reported and objective; memory performances of three groups of women (n = 20 per group) (1) primigravid, (2) primiparous (baby younger than 12 months), and (3) never been pregnant, matched on age and education levels. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographic, health, and sleep details, the Inventory of Memory Experiences, and tests of implicit, explicit, and working memory. The groups did not differ on self-rated levels of physical or emotional health, or anxiety level. The primigravid and primiparous groups reported overall poorer memory performance since pregnancy relative to controls. The primigravid group also reported significantly more sleep disruption, with this being a significant predictor of reported memory change. On the objective tests, there were no differences between groups on the implicit and explicit memory tests, but the primigravid and primiparous groups scored significantly lower on a test of working memory. Self-reports of memory change during pregnancy and postpartum may he related to life changes, such as sleep change, and may reflect changed perceptions rather than objective changes.

AB Although the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) continues to play an important role in the study of parturitional processes; a detailed behavioral description of birth in this species, necessary for accurately assessing the effects of experimental manipulation, is lacking. It is the aim of this report to provide such a description and to compare it with corresponding behavior in the better-studied rat. Ten pregnant chinchilla-breed rabbits and 10 pregnant Wistar rats were placed in glass-bottomed observation cages 2 days before term, and their behavior recorded on closed-circuit video, viewing the animals from below. All aspects of parturition were accomplished much faster in rabbits than rats; latency to birth of first pup; rate of delivery, duration of vaginal retention, time spent by mothers eating placentas, and in licking and nursing pups. In contrast to rat pups, rabbits were usually born separated from the placenta and already free from membranes. They were much more active, and well able to cast off any remaining membranes, suckle, and survive, whether directly attended to by the mother or not. We conclude that the tight temporal organization of events in the rabbit provides an unusually sensitive assay for investigating mechanisms underlying mammalian parturition.

AB Developmental aspects of behavioral organization were investigated in 29 healthy fetuses from 24-weeks gestation onwards: (a) short-term association between body (GM) and eye (EM) movements; (b) linkage of pairs of the three state variables [fetal heart rate pattern (FHRP), GM, and EM]; and (c) sequence of change of state variables during transitions. Linkage and sequence were also studied in complicated pregnancies.
   Short-term association between GM and EM was well established after 28 weeks. Linkage of state variables improved considerably after 32-34 weeks. FHRP was the first variable to change during synchronized transitions from 1F to 2F between 28-39 weeks, and the last variable during 2F to 1F transitions between 32-39 weeks.
   Although clear developmental patterns could be recognized, the interfetal variability was such that identification of the abnormal fetus is still difficult. Only transitions were significantly different in growth-restricted fetuses, as they showed no specific sequence of change. Assessing the temporal organization of fetal behavior seems, therefore, until now, not of great clinical value. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Case reports of four patients with therapy-resistant lesional partial epilepsies and additional foci of benign epileptic discharges of childhood, in addition to the usual electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, are presented. A family history of epileptic or febrile seizures in childhood was reported in all four patients. A distant relative of one patient, not manifesting seizures, demonstrated rolandic spikes on EEG, An abnormal pregnancy (polyhydramnion, premature pains, induced labor because of an abnormal CTG, placenta insufficiency) was reported in one patient, risk factors during birth (birth 14 days after term, placenta insufficiency) were reported in one, and bacterial meningitis at 4 weeks of age was reported in one. All patients manifested a retarded, partly severe, unfavorable infantile psychomotor development. An early seizure onset was observed in all patients (in three patients during the first year of life and in one patient during the second year), A hemifacial seizure symptomatology was seen, in addition to other symptoms, in two patients, possibly indicating the seizure pattern indicative of benign partial seizures; seizures occurred exclusively in sleep in one patient. The benign focus was never located in the lesional area. It was recorded over the same hemisphere in two patients and over the other hemisphere in the other two. (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB We present a large-scale social marketing programme of insecticide-treated nets in 2 rural districts in southwestern Tanzania (population 350 000) and describe how the long-term child health and survival impact will be assessed. Formative and market research were conducted in order to understand community perceptions, knowledge, attitudes and practice with respect to the products to be socially marketed. We identified Zuia Mbu (Kiswahili for 'prevent mosquitoes') as a suitable brand name for both treated nets and single-dose insecticide treatment sachets. A mix of public and private sales outlets is used for distribution. In the first stage of a stepped introduction 31 net agents were appointed and trained in 18 villages: 15 were shop owners, 14 were village leaders, 1 was a parish priest and 1 a health worker. For net treatment 37 young people were appointed in the same villages and trained as agents. Further institutions in both districts such as hospitals, development projects and employers were also involved in distribution. Promotion for both products was intense and used a variety of channels. A total of 22 410 nets and 8072 treatments were sold during the first year: 18 months after launching, 46% of 312 families with children aged under 5 years reported that their children were sleeping under treated nets. A strong evaluation component in over 50 000 people allows assessment of the long-term effects of insecticide-treated nets on child health and survival, anaemia in pregnancy, and the costs of the intervention. This evaluation is based on cross-sectional surveys, and case-control and cohort studies.

AB To determine whether placental abnormality (placental abruption or placental previa) during pregnancy predisposes an infant to a high risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the authors conducted a population-based case-control study using 1989-1991 California linked birth and death certificate data, They identified 2,107 SIDS cases, 96% of whom were diagnosed through autopsy. Ten controls were randomly selected for each case from the same linked birth-death certificate data, matched to the case on year of birth, About 1.4% of mothers of cases and 0.7% of mothers of controls had either placental abruption or placenta previa during the index pregnancy. After adjustment for potential confounders, placental abnormality during pregnancy was associated with a twofold increase in the risk of SIDS in offspring (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.1). The individual effects of placental abruption and placenta previa on the risk of SIDS did not differ significantly. An impaired fetal development due to placental abnormality may predispose an infant to a high risk of SIDS.

AB Objective: To examine whether maternal pregnancy complications, adverse birth events, respiratory illnesses, or developmental difficulty were increased in neurologically normal children with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and whether severity of OSA adversely affects the child's development and temperament.
   Methodology: Maternal report of perinatal events, respiratory illness and developmental difficulty in 37 children with OSA was contrasted with a comparison group (n = 67). Children with OSA were assessed developmentally (Griffiths Scales), had a parental rating of temperament (Australian Temperament Scale) and attended an overnight polysomnographic sleep study.
   Results: Children with OSA had an increased prevalence of adverse maternal pregnancy and perinatal events, respiratory disease and developmental concerns. Limited associations were found between the severity of OSA and development or temperament difficulty.
   Conclusions: This study suggests a relationship between OSA, though not its severity, and pre/perinatal adversity and child development. Polysomnographic and detailed developmental assessment of community-based samples of children with OSA and control children are necessary to confirm these findings.

AB Shift work and night work in particular have been associated with sleep difficulties, general malaise, fatigue, peptic ulceration, ischaemic heart disease, cigarette smoking and adverse pregnancy outcome. The medical conditions previously regarded as making individuals unsuitable for shift work show wide ranging patho-physiological activity and there is no published evidence for any such condition to be regarded an absolute reason to exclude an individual from shift work, The fulfilment of the legal obligations of the Working Time Regulations 1998 is neither prescribed nor constrained in any way. It is advisable therefore to build on existing health procedures where they are in effect. Periodic health questionnaires can offer health professionals an opportunity to detect any disorder likely to be aggravated by shift work or by a combination of shift work, job demands and workplace conditions. A further purpose of the questionnaire is the assessment of ability to undertake shift work duties. However, health questionnaires are neither sensitive nor specific enough to be used to Select applicants or employees for shift work, since they do not consistently predict tolerance of shift work or subsequent health problems. Whether employers should offer anything more than a simple questionnaire will depend on the culture of the company and accessibility of health services, Screening programmes affect many people relative to the few who benefit and with existing knowledge, periodic general health examinations performed in asymptomatic subjects have limited predictive or preventive value.

AB Arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) of 31 hospitalized pregnant women at low risk of hypertension were automatically monitored for 48 h at 15-min intervals. Each of the recorded 56 data series for systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and HR was chronobiologically assessed by linear-nonlinear rhythmometry. The rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR), circadian amplitude, circadian acrophase, and best-fitting period were grouped by pregnancy trimester and further subjected to analysis of variance. BP MESOR remained unaltered, whereas HR MESOR increased significantly in middle and late pregnancy. Ultradian rhythms, with an amplitude higher than that of the circadian rhythm, were found in 25% of the SAP records in the second and third trimester. Such ultradian rhythms were not detected in the simultaneously recorded HR. Finally, the group BP and HR circadian acrophases coincided in the first trimester, but were significantly apart in mid and late pregnancy. These observations support the notion that the coordination of BP and HR rhythmicity involves different physiological mechanisms. Analysis of the individual variability in the chronobiological end points (based on the records of nine women monitored in each pregnancy trimester)revealed that only the BP MESOR was well reproducible in the course of pregnancy and may be useful in early diagnosis of gestational hypertension.

AB We previously demonstrated that pregnancy-associated sleep enhancement is correlated with the daily surges of prolactin (PRL), However, in spite of a surge of PRL in the proestrous night, a reduction of nocturnal sleep occurs in phase with proestrus, Therefore, to clarify the physiological role of PRL in sleep regulation during the estrous cycle, time-course changes in sleep were analyzed in bromocriptine (CB-154)-treated and/or PRL-supplemented female rats. Sleep patterns characteristic of proestrus-to-estrus were not affected by the CB-154 treatment. In contrast, nocturnal rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) was significantly increased after the PRL supplementation. The CB-154 treatment diminished the RER IS-enhancing effect of PRL. Thus, the results suggest that the endogenous PRL is not crucial for the regulation of sleep during the estrous cycle, while exogenous PRL can enhance REMS.

An irregularity of the sleep-wake cycle with increased number of wakings at night was notable during about 1 month after delivery, compared to the late pregnancy period, and subsequently this number tended to decrease. These results were indicative of the association between the lactation cycle to neonates and the sleep-wake cycle.

AB Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the incidence of perinatal mortality and Sudden infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). We have evaluated prenatal or postnatal nicotine exposure in developing rats to examine the potential role of altered neurotransmitter receptor expression in these processes. Pregnant rats received continuous infusions of nicotine throughout gestation, at doses mimicking the plasma levels found in smokers. After birth, cardiac M2-muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which are responsible for inhibitory autonomic actions, were enhanced in the nicotine group, coincidentally with decreases in stimulatory P-adrenergic receptors that have been demonstrated previously. Studies of adenylyl cyclase activity confirmed that the changes in receptor binding represented functional alterations: the stimulatory response to isoproterenol was obtunded by prenatal nicotine exposure, whereas the inhibitory response to carbachol was enhanced. Elevations of M2-muscarinic receptor binding were not generalized to all tissues, as the same prenatal nicotine treatment elicited a reduction in these receptors in the brainstem, an effect that has also been noted in infants who died of SIDS; we found no effects of prenatal nicotine on brainstem Mi-receptor binding. Postnatal administration of nicotine produced similar brainstem receptor effects when treatment was conducted during the first postnatal week but not thereafter; postnatal nicotine treatment did not affect cardiac M2-receptor binding. Thus, during a critical developmental period, nicotine exposure produces cardiac and brainstem receptor imbalances that favor inhibitory responses, effects that can contribute to morbidity and mortality evoked by hypoxic episodes, such as those experienced during parturition, sleep apnea or airway obstruction.

Only the massage therapy group, however reported reduced anxiety, improved mood, better sleep and less back pain by the last day of the study. In addition, urinary stress hormone levels (norepinephrine) decreased for the massage therapy group and the women had fewer complications during labor and their infants had fewer postnatal complications (e.g., less prematurity).

AB Aim of the study: The etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated. Based upon recent data from the,Munich Interdisciplinary Research and intervention Program (MIRIP)", this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory moctels. In addition,novel approaches of intervention shall be presented.
   Methods: The sample consists of 63 1-6 months old infants, as well as 49 age-matched controls. Using a structured clinical interview, behavioral protocols, questionnaires and videotaped samples of mother-infant interaction the following aspects have been evaluated: Mean daily cry/fuss-duration of the infant, organic and psychosocial risk factors of the infant and its family, infant temperament as perceived by the parents, marital satisfaction, maternal depression, maternal child care attitudes, social support of the family, quality of mother-infant interaction and relationship in age relevant contexts, Finally, all infants underwent a thorough, standardized pediatric, neuropediatric and developmental examination.
   Results: Persistently crying infants and their families from the MIRIP were significantly different from control infants in the following aspects: higher cumulative organic, and even more pronounced, psychosocial and psychic risk factors of the child and its family. A specific organic etiology of persistent crying, such as cow's milk intolerance, could be demonstrated only in a minority. However, more than half of the crying infants (51%) as opposed to only 22% of control infants showed minor to moderate neurological abnormalities. Immaturity of the infants regulation of arousal and sleep-wake-cycles as well as dysfunctional parent-infant-interactions are among the specific maintaining conditions of excessive crying.
   Conclusions: The current sample exhibits a surprisingly high cumulation of organic and psychosocial risk factors. Pediatric diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, focussing on identifying and diminishing specific risks might prevent more severe infant developmental and relationship problems.

AB Background: Metabolic adjustments occur during pregnancy and lactation to support fetal growth and milk synthesis; however, the effect of body composition and hormonal milieu on these changes is poorly understood.
   Objective: We hypothesized that energy metabolism changes during pregnancy and lactation to support fetal growth and milk synthesis, and that body composition and hormonal milieu influence these alterations.
   Design: We measured energy expenditure, body composition, and hormone, metabolite, and catecholamine concentrations in 76 women (40 lactating, 36 nonlactating) at 37 wk gestation and 3 and 6 mo postpartum. Total energy expenditure (TEE), basal metabolic rate (BMR), sleeping metabolic rate (SMR), and minimal SMR (MSMR) were measured with room calorimetry. Fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass were estimated with a 4-component model.
   Results: TEE, BMR, SMR, and MSMR were 15-26% higher during pregnancy than postpartum after being adjusted for FFM, fat mass, and energy balance. TEE, SMR, and MSMR were higher in lactating than in nonlactating women. Easting serum insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, fatty acids, and leptin, and 24-h urinary free norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine correlated positively with TEE, BMR, SMR, and MSMR. In nonlactating women, the respiratory quotient decreased over time, carbohydrate oxidation decreased, and fat oxidation increased. Substrate utilization was not influenced by body composition, fasting serum hormones, or 24-h urinary catecholamines.
   Conclusions: These results indicate increased energy expenditure and preferential use of carbohydrates during pregnancy and lactation. Elevated respiratory quotient and carbohydrate utilization during pregnancy continue during lactation, consistent with preferential use of glucose by the fetus and mammary gland.

AB The cardiac orienting reflex is elicited by a low-intensity sound, it consists of a sustained heart rate (HR) deceleration, and it is a specific physiological correlate of cognitive processing. In this study we examined the relationship between behavioral state and the cardiac orienting reflex in 75 human fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated with a 30-s speech sound at an average intensity of 83 dB SPL in quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS). The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on HR pattern and the presence or absence of eye and general body movements. We found that a significant HR deceleration occurred, in both QS and AS, following stimulus onset. However, HR decelerations occurred more often in QS than AS; and for fetuses exhibiting a HR deceleration, the magnitude of the deceleration was greater in AS compared to QS. In addition, in AS female fetuses exhibited a larger, more sustained HR deceleratory response than male fetuses, but the seconds x gender interaction in QS was not significant. Based on these results, we concluded that behavioral state is an important determinant of the HR deceleratory response in human fetuses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using a standardised procedure, 20 women who were 37 weeks pregnant logged fetal movements for 1 h in the morning and evening for 3 days. Close agreement between such logs and ultrasound recordings of individual differences in fetal movements have been documented. After birth, the babies' sleeping, waking, feeding and crying behaviour were recorded prospectively in validated behaviour diaries at 1, 6 and 12 weeks of age.
   The fetal movements showed an evening peak, due to a diurnal variation in strong movements. These strong movements did not predict the babies' crying. Weak fetal movements provided a reliable index of fetal differences and predicted the amounts the babies cried at 1, 6 and 12 weeks of age. The findings suggest that temperament-like dispositions present before babies are born predict how much they are likely to cry. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To establish the influence of fetal behavior states on venous and arterial pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms in the normally developing term fetus.
   Methods: The relation between venous and arterial pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms and fetal behavior states was investigated in 18 normal term fetuses. Recordings of the venous pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained just proximal to the entrance in the left atrium, and the arterial pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms were taken from the most proximal branch of the pulmonary artery in the same lung using color Doppler imaging. Time-averaged peak systolic, peak diastolic, and end-diastolic now velocity; peak systolic to peak diastolic ratio; pulsatility index; and fetal heart rate were calculated from both venous and arterial Doppler recordings obtained during behavior states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep). Fetal behavior states were determined from combined recordings of fetal eye and body movements.
   Results: Recordings of sufficient quality for analysis were obtained from ten fetuses. Venous pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms demonstrated a statistically significant increase in time-averaged peak diastolic and end-diastolic velocity during fetal behavior state 2F. No behavior-state-related changes were observed for the arterial pulmonary blood now velocity waveform.
   Conclusion: The data suggest an increased pressure gradient between the pulmonary venous system and the left atrium during behavior state 2F. Flow velocity waveforms from the proximal arterial pulmonary branch are independent of behavioral state. (Obstet Gynecol 1999;93:184-8.

SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To identify the levels of grief and depression and the coping mechanisms of women with infertility problems who participated in in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation-induction medication.
   Methods: Pretest and post-test data were obtained from 50 IVF and 50 ovulation-induction medication patients receiving treatment at two urban infertility centers.
   Results: Both groups of women experienced measurable levels of grief and depression before, during, and after treatment. Higher scores on the Grief Experience Inventory were found for both groups of women when pregnancy did not occur. Age, reproductive problems, years infertile, financial impact, and number of past IVF cycles were not found to influence the reported grief or depression levels. Women in the IVF and ovulation-induction medication groups used isolation coping behaviors such as self-talk and sleep.
   Conclusion: Because of moderate to high levels of grief and depression, therapeutic counseling may be more effective if initiated before the infertility treatment. Women's present levels of distress and coping strategies should be assessed prior to initiating infertility treatment to provide the patients with opportunities to learn and practice new adaptive behaviors that could enhance their ability to cope with infertility and the associated medical procedures.

AB OBJECTIVE: The object of the study was to characterize daily values and patterns of salivary estriol levels during normal pregnancy at mid to late gestation. STUDY
   DESIGN: We measured salivary estriol levels in a clinical research center setting with an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fourteen pregnant women (24-36 weeks' gestation) submitted unstimulated saliva samples hourly from 10:00 am until 10:00 pm and at midnight and 2:00, 4.00, 6:00, and 8:00 am.
   RESULTS: Each subject demonstrated greater salivary estriol levels at night (10:00 pm-6:00 am) than in the daytime (8:00 am-9:00 pm, P <.001). Salivary estriol levers consistently increased at 10:00 pm, peaked at 4:00 am, and returned to daytime levels between 6:00 and 7:00 am. Salivary estriol concentrations were stable during daylight hours.
   CONCLUSIONS: (1)There was a dramatic diurnal Variation in salivary estriol levels (nadir during daylight with nighttime apogee). (2) Diurnal patterns and salivary estriol levels were consistent in each of 14 subjects evaluated in the latter half of pregnancy. Samples for baseline measurements of salivary estriol level should be obtained during daylight hours (8:00 am-8:00 pm).

ID SLEEP DISTURBANCES; CHILDBEARING
AB The objective of this study was to use validated scales to determine if fatigue is increased during the first trimester of pregnancy compared to nonpregnant women with similar demographic characteristics. Women between 6 and 12 weeks' gestation were invited to complete a demographics questionnaire and the Numerical Rating Scale for Fatigue (NRS-F), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Beck Depression Index (BDI-II). Nonpregnant women were also invited to participate. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U, Fisher's exact, Spearman correlation, and Monte Carlo tests where appropriate; significance was assumed at p <0.05. Twenty pregnant and 15 nonpregnant patients were enrolled. There was no difference in age, parity, BMI, race, marital status, education, income or hours worked outside the home between pregnant and nonpregnant subjects. Pregnant women reported greater number of hours spent sleeping each day (8 [7-10] vs. 7 [6-9], p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in BDI-II, STAI-S, or STAI-T scores, but pregnant women had significantly higher scores on the NRS-F test (72.5 [20-88] vs. 36 [18-94], p <0.05). Women in the first trimester of pregnancy experience significantly greater fatigue compared to a similar group of nonpregnant women.

AB Ontogenic changes in baseline and 24-h rhythms of fetal arterial blood pressure (FABP) and heart rate (FHR) and their regulation by the fetal adrenal were studied in 18 fetal sheep chronically instrumented at 109-114 days gestation (GA). In the long-term study, FABP and FHR were continuously recorded from 120 days GA to spontaneous term labor (>145 days GA) in five animals. Peak times (PT) and amplitudes (Amp) of cosinor analysis were compared at 120-126, 127-133, and 134-140 days GA. Consistent, significant linear increases in FABP and linear decreases in FHR were observed in all fetuses. Significant 24-h rhythms in FABP and FHR were observed during all the time windows. In the adrenalectomy study, to test the hypothesis that fetal cortisol plays a key role in cardiovascular maturation, fetal adrenals were removed in eight animals (ADX); sham fetal adrenalectomy was performed on five animals (Con). Cortisol (4 mu g/min) was infused intravenously in four ADX fetuses from day 7 postsurgery for 7 days (ADX+F). No significant changes in PT and Amp in FABP and FHR were observed. Plasma cortisol levels remained low in Con and ADX fetuses (<4.9 ng/ml). Cortisol infusion increased fetal plasma cortisol to 22.3 +/- 3.2 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) on day 13 in ADX+F fetuses. FABP increased in control and ADX+F but not ADX fetuses; FHR decreased in control and ADX but rose in ADX+F fetuses. These results suggest that, in chronically instrumented fetal sheep at late gestation, 1) increases in FABP and decreases in FHR are maintained consistently from 120 to 140 days GA, with distinct 24-h rhythms, the PT and Amp of which remain unchanged, and 2) the physiological increase in FABP is dependent on the fetal adrenal; bilateral removal of the fetal adrenals does not prevent the ability of cortisol to produce a sustained increase in FABP.

AB Seasonal infertility in sows is a problem in the pig industry characterized by delayed onset of puberty in summer and decreased farrowing rate resulting from silent oestrus and aborted pregnancy. Summer infertility is thought to be influenced by heat, sunburn and stress. However, the strongest contributory factor is photoperiod. The difference in seasonality between wild boar and commercial pig breeds suggests that there may be a genetic component to this trait. The maps and associated molecular tools emerging from the pig genome project have created opportunities to examine the genetic component of seasonal infertility. We are identifying and mapping genes that are likely to be involved in biological clock mechanisms and the melatonin pathways as candidate seasonality genes.

AB Both maternal and fetal genetic factors influence variations in response to prenatal ethanol exposure. To assess the effect of maternal genotype on the incidence of ethanol teratogenesis, a reciprocal cross study was conducted in an animal mode using the relatively susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and the relatively resistant DBA/2J (D2) inbred mice. This mating pattern produced four embryonic genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and D2D2 litters and hybrid B6D2 and D2B6 litters. To examine the role of maternal egg cytoplasm as the source of variation that could account for a maternal effect, B6D2 and D2B6 Fl females were mated back to B6 males, which produced two additional embryonic genotypes: B6D2.B6 and D2B6.B6. Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg of ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin on day 9 of pregnancy. On day 18 of pregnancy, dams were sacrificed, fetuses were removed, weighed, sexed, and examined for gross morphological malformations. Every other fetus within a litter was prepared for either skeletal or soft tissue analysis. Results showed a higher rate of teratogenesis in the B6D2 group compared to the genetically similar D2B6 group, which indicates an influence of maternal genotype on susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. The percentage of affected male and female fetuses did not differ, which suggests that sex-linked factors are not responsible for the maternal effect. The backcross B6D2.B6 and D2B6.B6 litters did not differ significantly for any measure of teratogenesis, suggesting that differences in maternally transmitted cytoplasmic material are not the cause of the maternal effect. Factors that could account for the maternal effect are differences in the maternal uterine environment and genomic imprinting. Separating maternal from fetal-mediated mechanisms responsible for susceptibility to ethahol teratogenesis is needed for identifying mothers and infants at risk.

AB Leptin is a 16-kDa cytokine secreted in humans primarily but not exclusively by adipose tissues. Its concentration in blood is usually proportional to body fat mass, but is higher in women than in men not only because of a different distribution of and greater fat mass in women, but also because testosterone reduces its level in men. Leptin features in different ways during the life span. It is synthesized in the ovary, transported in the oocyte, and made by both fetus and placenta, particularly during the last month of gestation. It is made by the lactating mammary gland and ingested by the newborn infant in its milk. The prime importance of leptin is realized at puberty when it is necessary for progression to a normal adult reproductive status in females. Fasting and chronic undernutrition result in a lower level of leptin in the blood. Lack of leptin results in hunger, ensuring that the individual eat to survive, and also inhibition of reproduction, until such time as food and fat stores are adequate to supply energy for pregnancy and lactation. Thus, leptin is important for survival of the individual and survival of the species. Although an extremely rare genetic absence of leptin induces hyperphagia and obesity in humans, as it does in mice, there appears to be little role for leptin in humans in ensuring that fat stores are not in excess of adequate, that is, in preventing obesity. The mouse differs from humans in many respects, in particular in the far more drastic ways it conserves energy when it very rapidly adapts to lack of food. These include not only suppression of reproduction but also lowering of its body temperature (torpor), suppressing its thyroid function, suppressing its growth, and increasing secretion of stress hormones (from the adrenal). This review concentrates on roles of leptin in human physiology and pathophysiology but also discusses why some observations on actions of leptin in mice are not applicable to humans.

AB Coffee is commonly given daily to toddlers in Guatemala. Possible negative effects of coffee ingestion on cognitive development and sleep patterns were assessed in 132 children 12-24 months of age who had received coffee for > 2 months and were iron deficient on at least one indicator. Children were stratified by initial hemoglobin (A = anemic, Hgb < 10.5 g/dl; NA = 'non-anemic', Hgb greater than or equal to 10.5 g/dl) and were randomly assigned to an experimental group (S = substitute consisting of sugar and coloring), and a control group (C = continuation of coffee) (42 C-NA; 53 S-NA; 18 C-A; and 19 S-A). Anemic children were provided Fe supplements for 2-3 months, Compliance was assessed every 2 weeks. After 5 months, testers masked to treatment group and anemia evaluated children with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II in a central location. Scores were the Mental Development Index (MDI), the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), and scales from the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS). The child's sleep in the previous 24 h was assessed with a set of standardized sleep questions to the care giver on the first visit and every 2 weeks thereafter. No significant effects of treatment on test scores or BRS ratings were found. In the 24 h period reported on at the final visit, children in the Substitute group slept more during the night and overall (night plus naps) than children in the Coffee group, a difference not found at the first visit. No differences were found in sleep difficulty or number of times waking at night. Women's reported coffee intake per day during pregnancy was associated with lower BRS ratings, even after controlling for SES and child age. The effects of postnatal coffee ingestion in Guatemala were seen for sleep duration, but not for cognitive development. Prenatal coffee ingestion was negatively associated with Behavior Rating Scales and should be investigated further. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a telephone intervention to reduce fatigue and the resulting symptom distress of mothers in Iceland who reported having a behaviourally difficult infant of 2-3 months of age. A sample of 78 mothers who reached distress criteria of depressive symptoms and parental stress was selected and randomly allocated in a controlled experimental study. In a brief intervention both maternal distress and infant difficulty were discussed. Results indicate a significant (P < 0.001) intervention effect on fatigue and its side-effects. It is concluded that intervention by telephone can be effective with fatigued mothers caring for a difficult infant.

AB Placental progesterone metabolites may suppress fetal behaviour by interacting with GABP(A) receptors. In an initial study, the effect of 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (pregnanolone) given as a bolus (2.5 and 5.0 mg) or infused at a rate of 25 mg/h was investigated in unanaesthetized, catheterized fetal sheep, 127-135 days gestation. The incidence of fetal breathing movements (FBM) and behavioural arousal activity, defined as nuchal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity during low voltage electrocortical (LV ECoG) activity were suppressed by pregnanolone administered as a bolus, while the pregnanolone infusion produced a significant decrease in arousal and EOG activity, and an increase in the presence of HV ECoG. The effect of pregnanolone on fetal behaviour and arousal induced by the GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin was also investigated. Picrotoxin was given as a bolus (approximate to 300 mu g/kg) and pregnanolone was subsequently administered as a bolus (5.0 mg), and behavioural parameters were recorded and analysed. The incidence of arousal and FBM were 1.1 +/- 1.6 min/10 min and 2.5 +/- 2.3 min/10 min, respectively, before picrotoxin treatment and increased during the 10-20 and 20-30 min epochs after picrotoxin treatment (arousal: 5.0 +/- 2.2 and 6.5 +/- 3.6 min/10 min, respectively, n = 6, P < 0.05; FBM: 7.3 rt 3.2 and 9.3 +/- 1.2 min/10 min, respectively, n = 6, P < 0.05.). The picrotoxin-induced increases in arousal and FBM were significantly suppressed (n = 6, P < 0.05) by pregnanolone treatment to 1.6 +/- 1.5 min/10 min and 4.6 +/- 2.3 min/10 min, respectively. We conclude that; (i) the GABA(A) active steroid pregnanolone suppresses basal and picrotoxin-induced fetal arousal and FBM; and (ii) steroid sensitive GABA(A) receptors may regulate fetal behaviour and breathing.

AB In this study we aimed to investigate the circadian rhythm and the effect of dopamine (DA) on expressions of Pit-1 and prolactin-growth hormone (PRL-GH) genes in the rat placenta. Also we aimed to certify the role of Pit-1 on expressions of PRL-GH genes in the rat placenta during the late pregnancy using the mobility shift assay and northern blot analysis. According to the northern blot analysis, dopamine receptor 2 (D-2) gene was expressed in tha rat placenta and the mRNA level was peaked from pregnant day 12 to 14 and pregnant day 20. In the placental junctional zone, Pit-1 mRNA level was higher at day time than at night time. In contrast to the junctional zone, Pit-1 mRNA level was higher at night time than at day time in the placental labyrinth zone. PL-Iv and PLP-C genes were mainly expressed in the junctional zone and the circadian rhythm of PL-IV was equal to the rhythm of Pit-1. DA injection decreased the mRNA level of Pl-Iv, PLP-C and Pit-1. Binding ability of placental Pit-1 protein was defined by the mobility shift assay using the synthesized oligomers correspond to the Pit-1 binding site of prolactin and Pit-1 gene promoters. Inhibitory effect of DA on the pituitary PRL release and gene expression has been known to mainly mediated by D-2 receptor activation (1). Together with the present result, it is presumed that D-2 receptor activation may play a main pathway to regulate PL-Iv and PLP-C gene expressions via a Pit-1 protein in the rat placenta.

AB An antigen-detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA) based on affinity-purified polyclonal antibody was utilised as an immunodiagnosis for Trypanosoma evansi infections in cattle. Five hundred pregnant heifers were introduced in Loei province, Thailand and a total of 271 samples were collected at 37 farms during four visits over a year commencing a month after the introduction. Each time the haematocrit centrifuge technique (HCT) was carried out as a field diagnosis for I: evansi, and sera were examined for trypanosomal antigen levels by Ag-ELISA. At the first sampling over 80% of the cattle were positive for trypanosome antigens by Ag-ELISA although the titres were low. Soon after, aborted cases at the late stage of pregnancy were reported and at the second sampling in the rainy season, 25.5% of the cattle sampled were found to harbour I: evansi by HCT. This time the infection rate by Ag-ELISA was 52.9% with high antigen levels. Between the first and second sampling nine cattle out of 51 aborted, which was suspected to be due to I: evansi. As soon as treatment with a trypanocidal drug was started, abortion cases decreased. However, the infection rate remained high during the rainy season when Tabanus flies were active. As the climate became cool and dry, the antigen levels in the area lowered and the positive rate by Ag-ELISA dropped to 32.3%. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of maternal melatonin on fetal and neonatal melatonin and dopamine D1 receptor systems in the central nervous system, mainly in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), were investigated after pinealectomy of rats at day 7 of pregnancy. I-125-labelled iodomelatonin injected intravenously into the pregnant rats (at day 21) was transferred in considerable amount into the fetal circulation. In vitro autoradiography data demonstrated an increase in the melatonin binding activity in the fetal (embryonic day 21) and early postnatal SCN (postnatal day 3) caused by maternal pinealectomy. This upregulation of the melatonin receptor in the SCN was then normalized after the melatonin system of the neonate started to work. The pregnant rats themselves did not show such a change in their melatonin receptors in the SCN following pinealectomy, Dopamine D1 receptor binding was affected by pinealectomy exclusively in the SCN of fetal and neonatal rats as well as in that of mothers. These results clearly indicate that the fetal circadian clock in the SCN is controlled and prepared before birth to some extent by maternal melatonin rhythm. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB Infants,that died suddenly and unexpectedly were studied as part of the European Concerted Action on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Three paediatric pathologists, first independently of each other and later in a consensus meeting, classified 63 cases into 3 groups: SIDS (19 cases), borderline SIDS (30 cases) and non-SIDS (14 cases). The interobserver agreement among the pathologists before the consensus meeting was moderate (Kappa = 0.41) and jointly it was higher (Kappa = 0.83). The distribution of epidemiologically determined risk factors was studied over these three groups. Maternal smoking after birth, low socioeconomic status and thumb sucking were found more often in SIDS than in the other cases. Inexperienced prone sleeping was a determinant for SIDS, but not for non-SIDS. Previous hospital admission, low birthweight and/or short gestation were associated with borderline SIDS. Non-SIDS cases received more breastfeeding, the parents hardly smoked during pregnancy and after birth, a firm mattress had been used, and more often signs of illness had been reported by the parents, compared with the SIDS and borderline SIDS cases. Bedding factors and both primary and secondary prone sleeping were equally distributed over the three groups which supports the hypothesis that, in SIDS and borderline SIDS, as well as in non-SIDS cases, some similar external and preventable factors might influence the events leading to death. Research should therefore focus on all sudden unexpected deaths, after which subgroups such as SIDS cases can be separately analysed. The postmortem is an essential part of the whole work-up of each case and the results should be interpreted with all other available data to arrive at a sound evaluation of cases and thus form the basis for the prevention of all sudden unexpected infant death.

DT Article
DE sudden infant death syndrome; altitude; prone sleeping position
ID SLEEPING POSITION; BIRTH-WEIGHT; ADAPTATION
AB Objective-To investigate the association between altitude of residence and risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Methods-A retrospective, case control study in the Tyrol, Austria enrolled 99 infants with SIDS occurring between 1984 and 1994, and 136 randomly selected control cases. Data on pregnancy, delivery, child care practice, and sociodemographic characteristics including altitude of residence were collected with a standardised questionnaire.
   Results-The risk of SIDS increased gradually with increasing altitude of residence. This relation remained independently significant when the analysis was adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, prenatal care, mother's age at delivery, educational level of parents, and cigarette smoking during pregnancy. The prone sleeping position emerged as an obligatory cofactor in this association. In the whole of Austria, a similar trend of association emerged between the average altitudes in the 99 political counties and the rates of SIDS.
   Conclusions-This study identified altitude of residence as a significant risk predictor of SIDS, primarily in combination with the prone sleeping position. Respiratory disturbances, reduced oxygen saturation, and lower temperatures at high altitude might explain this association.

AB Failure to autoresuscitate by hypoxic gasping during prolonged sleep apnea has been suggested to play a role in sudden infant death. Furthermore, maternal smoking has been repeatedly shown to be a risk factor for sudden infant death. The present experiments were carried out on newborn rat pups to investigate the influence of perinatal exposure to nicotine (the primary pharmacological and addictive agent in tobacco) on their time to last gasp during a single hypoxic exposure and on their ability to autoresuscitate during repeated exposure to hypoxia. Pregnant rats received either nicotine (6 mg.kg(-1).24 h(-1)) or vehicle continuously from day 6 of gestation to days 5 or 6 postpartum via an osmotic minipump. On days 5 or 6 postpartum, pups were exposed either to a single period of hypoxia (97% N-2-3% CO2) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they were exposed repeatedly to hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the time to last gasp, but it did impair the ability of pups to autoresuscitate from primary apnea. After vehicle, the pups were able to autoresuscitate from 18 +/- 1 (SD) periods of hypoxia, whereas, after nicotine, the pups were able to autoresuscitate from only 12 +/- 2 periods (P < 0.001) of hypoxia. Thus our data provide evidence that perinatal exposure to nicotine impairs the ability of newborn rats to autoresuscitate from primary apnea during repeated exposure to hypoxia, such as may occur during episodes of prolonged sleep apnea.

ID THYROID-GLAND
AB We describe a case of lingual thyroid (LT) with primary hypothyroidism, presenting during pregnancy and continuing beyond it with oropharyngeal obstructive symptoms and sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) of mixed type. Although SAS of a combined obstructive and central type should not be too surprising in a case of LT with hypothyroidism, we were unable to find such a documentation previously. Only four weeks of L-thyroxin treatment resulted in a dramatic improvement in dysphagia, disturbed phonation, haemoptysis, arterial desaturation, sleep apnoea and overall sleep efficiency, in conjunction with a regression in the size of the lingual mass. This case highlights the vagaries confronted in the management of such a case and focuses on efforts towards accurate diagnosis and treatment.

AB Many positive trends in the health of Americans continued into 1997. In 1997, the preliminary birth rate declined slightly to 14.6 births per 1000 population, and the fertility rate, births per 1000 women 15 to 44 years of age, was unchanged from the previous year (65.3). These indicators suggest that the downward trend in births observed since the early 1990s may have abated.
   Fertility rates for white, black, and Native American women were essentially unchanged between 1996 and 1997. Fertility among Hispanic women declined 2% in 1997 to 103.1, the lowest level reported since national data for this group have been available. For the sixth consecutive year, birth rates dropped for teens. Birth rates for women 30 years or older continued to increase. The proportion of births to unmarried women (32.4%) was unchanged in 1997.
   The trend toward earlier utilization of prenatal care continued for 1997; 82.5% of women began prenatal care in the first trimester. There was no change in the percentage with late (third trimester) or no care in 1997. The cesarean delivery rate rose slightly to 20.8% in 1997, a reversal of the downward trend observed since 1989. The percentage of low birth weight (LBW) infants rose again in 1997 to 7.5%. The percentage of very low birth weight was up only slightly to 1.41%. Among births to white mothers, LBW increased for the fifth consecutive year, to 6.5%, whereas the rate for black mothers remained unchanged at 13%. Much, but not all, of the rise in LBW for white mothers during the 1990s can be attributed to an increase in multiple births. In 1996, the multiple birth rate rose again by 5%, and the higher-order multiple birth rate climbed by 20%.
   Infant mortality reached an all time low level of 7.1 deaths per 1000 births, based on preliminary 1997 data. Both neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates declined. In 1996, 64% of all infant deaths occurred to the 7.4% of infants born at LBW. Infant mortality rates continue to be more than two times greater for black than for white infants. Among all the states in 1996, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire had the lowest infant mortality rates. Despite declines in infant mortality, the United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality.
   Expectation of life at birth reached a new high in 1997 of 76.5 years for all gender and race groups combined. Age-adjusted death rates declined in 1997 for diseases of the heart, accidents and adverse affects (unintentional injuries), homicide, suicide, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and diabetes. In 1997, mortality due to HIV infection declined by 47%. Death rates for children from all major causes declined again in 1997. Motor vehicle traffic injuries and firearm injuries were the two major causes of traumatic death. A large proportion of childhood deaths continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

DT Article
AB We studied changes in the sleep patterns of ten young women from late pregnancy (36 weeks) to the sixth postpartum week, focusing on the relationship between the women's sleep patterns and their infants' movements. The mothers' polysomnograms and their infants' ankle actigrams were simultaneously recorded using a Medilog 9000 at home in three sessions, during the first, third, and sixth postpartum weeks. The mother-infant pairs slept in close proximity. Two subjects had difficulty with their infants and were dealt with as a separate group. Analysis for the eight subjects who adapted well to the postpartum period showed that wake lime after sleep onset increased significantly during the postpartum period compared with late pregnancy given responsibility for feeding. Stage 3+4 and Stage REM did nor change across the four sessions (pregnancy, first, third, and sixth postpartum weeks), but Stage 2 decreased significantly from pregnancy to postpartum. There was a high synchronization between infants' movements and mothers' wakefulness. Eight mothers did not complain of sleep disturbance, while the two mothers who had difficulty with their infants did. We suggest that mothers who tolerate well sleep interruption arising from feeding and maintain their Stages 3+4 and REM should not be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance. Mothers who have difficulty with their infants and complain of sleep disturbance should be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance.

AB To investigate whether sleep homeostasis in the female rat is modulated by the estrous cycle, the vigilance states, EEG power spectra and cortical temperature (T-CRT) were assessed on the basis of 4-day continuous recordings. A regulatory response was elicited by 6-h sleep deprivation (SD) during the proestrous (PRO) and the estrous (EST) day and compared to the baseline recordings. The vigilance states varied across the estrous cycle. In the PRO dark period the amount of sleep was reduced. The decrease in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep was already evident towards the end of the preceding light period, and an increased fragmentation of sleep was present throughout PRO. Compared to the other days of the estrous cycle, slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG power density 0.75-4.75 Hz) in nonREM (NREM) sleep was lower in PRO at the end of the light period and in the beginning of tho dark period. High-frequency activity (HFA; EEG power density 10.25-25.0 Hz) was increased in the dark period of PRO. The SD performed during the first 6 h of the light period of PRO and EST enhanced SWA in NREM sleep and reduced sleep fragmentation during the subsequent 6 h. The extent and time course of the response to SD did not differ between the two phases of the estrous cycle. It is concluded that despite the marked baseline variations of the vigilance states and the EEG, homeostatic regulation is little affected by the estrous cycle. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This study aimed to assess whether previously established risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are still valid now that the incidence in the Netherlands has dropped to 0.26 per 1000 liveborn infants. A distinction was made between immutable and mutable risk factors. This case-control study (part of the European Concerted Action on SIDS) comprised 73 SIDS cases and 146 controls and lasted from March 1995 to September 1996. Adjustments were made for sleeping position and bedding factors by treating them as covariables. Apart fr-om these factors, well known risk factors that remain of importance in the Netherlands are: male sex, young maternal age, twins, and low socioeconomic status. These factors are largely immutable. Other well known risk factors which might reflect attitudes to child care and could possibly be mutable ape: smoking, alcohol consumption by the mother, bottle feeding, and change of babycare routine. Intervention strategies should focus on early signalling, thereby assisting parents in changing these unfavourable parenting attitudes. Information on optimal child care and extra support by public health nurses specifically aimed at families at risk could help to decrease further the incidence of SIDS in the Netherlands.

DT Review
ID MENSTRUAL MIGRAINE; DOUBLE-BLIND; HEADACHE; PROPHYLAXIS; WOMEN;
   MANAGEMENT; MAGNESIUM; HORMONES; THERAPY
AB The occurrence of migraine in women is influenced by hormonal changes throughout the lifecycle. A beneficial effect of pregnancy on migraine; mainly during the last 2 trimesters, has been observed in 55 to 90% of women who are pregnant, irrespective of the type of migraine. A higher percentage of women with menstrual migraine find that their condition improves when they are pregnant. However, in rare cases migraine may appear for the first time during pregnancy.
   The positive effects of pregnancy on migraine and the possible worsening post partum are probably related to the uniformly high and stable estrogen levels during pregnancy and the rapid fall-off thereafter.
   Nondrug therapies (relaxation, sleep, massage, ice packs, biofeedback) should be tried first to treat migraine in women who are pregnant.
   For treatment of acute migraine attacks 1000 mg of paracetamol (acetaminophen) preferably as a suppository is considered the first choice drug treatment. The risks associated with use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and ibuprofen are considered to be small when the agents are taken episodically and if they are avoided during the last trimester of pregnancy. The 'triptans' (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan), dihydroergotamine and ergotamine tartrate are contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Prochlorperazine for treatment of nausea is unlikely to be harmful during pregnancy. Metoclopramide is probably acceptable to use during the second and third trimester. Prophylactic treatment is rarely indicated and the only agents that can be given during pregnancy are the beta-blockers metoprelol and propranolol.

AB Prior to three months of age there is little melatonin (MLT) secretion in humans. MLT production then commences, becomes circadian, and reaches its highest nocturnal blood levels between the ages of one to three years. During the remainder of childhood, nocturnal peak levels drop progressively by 80%. In adults, these levels show an additional drop of some 10%, mainly during senescence. The large drop in serum MLT during childhood is probably the result of the increase in size of the human body, despite a constant MLT production after infancy. The additional decline of MLT with higher age may be due to a yet unidentified physiological mechanism accompanying senescence. The biological significance of these MLT alterations remains unknown. Since the discovery of:MLT, an immediate sedative action of this hormone has been known. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that MLT indeed exerts a sleep-promoting action by accelerating sleep initiation, improving sleep maintenance, and marginally altering sleep architecture. The potential of MLT in the treatment of insomnia is being explored, and the results are promising. Although in most of these studies pharmacological dosages of MLT have been used, preliminary data suggest that similar effects can also be achieved by physiological hormone concentrations. The latter observation raises the question of whether MLT might be involved in the physiological control of sleep. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Mice lacking the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor EPAS1 die at mid-gestation. Despite normal morphological development of the circulatory system, EPAS1-deficient mice display pronounced bradycardia. In addition to the vascular endothelium, EPAS1 is expressed intensively in the organ of Zuckerkandl (OZ), the principle source of catecholamine production in mammalian embryos. EPAS1-deficient embryos contained substantially reduced catecholamine levels. Mid-gestational lethality was rescued by administration of the catecholamine precursor DOPS to pregnant females. We hypothesize that EPAS1 expressed in the OZ senses hypoxia during midgestational development and translates this signal into an altered pattern of gene expression, leading to increases in circulating catecholamine levels and proper cardiac function.

AB Disturbed sleep regulation is often observed in neonates of women who drank heavily during pregnancy. It is unknown if (and how) an occasional drink affects fetal sleeping behavior. In 28 near-term pregnant women we examined the effects on fetal behavioral state organization of two glasses of wine (0.25 g of ethanol/kg of maternal body weight). Simultaneous 2-h recordings of fetal heart rate and body, eye, and breathing movements were made on two successive days, once without alcohol exposure and once during maternal alcohol consumption. The study was standardized for time of day and fetal sleep state, i.e. the start of recording was either during quiet sleep (rt = 16) or during active sleep (n = 12). Alcohol intake reduced fetal eye movements, disorganized behavioral state organization (rapid eye movement sleep was affected in particular), and suppressed fetal breathing activity almost completely. Modest maternal alcohol intake affects fetal behavioral state organization, which reflects an immediate effect on fetal brain function.

AB Children of women who consume high amounts of alcohol during their pregnancies vary greatly in physical and behavioral outcomes. Although many factors, such as dose and timing of exposure, undoubtedly contribute to this variation, one important determinant may be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. The present study examined activity levels in high alcohol sensitivity (HAS) and low alcohol sensitivity (LAS) rats following neonatal alcohol exposure. These lines were selectively bred for extremes in ethanol-induced "sleep times." The HAS and LAS offspring were exposed to alcohol via an artificial rearing procedure using the "pup-in-the-cup" technique. Rat pups were exposed to ethanol (6 g/kg/day) from postnatal day (PD) 4 through 7 and faded to a dose of 3 g/kg/day on PD 8 and 9. An artificially reared gastrostomy control group (GC) and a normally reared suckle control group (SC) were also included. Activity level was measured on PD 18 through PD 21 for 30 min daily in automated activity monitors. Neonatal ethanol exposure produced overactivity in HAS rats, relative to their controls, but the same ethanol treatment had no effect on the LAS rats. Importantly, there were no differences in blood alcohol concentrations (around 420 mg/dl) between the two lines during the treatment period. These data suggest that genetic differences in response to alcohol may be a predictor for some of the behavioral teratogenic effects of alcohol. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Obesity is epidemic in America. About 80 million Americans are obese, 33.4% of adults and about 20% to 25% of children. Obesity produces morbidity and mortality: there are 300,000 obesity-related deaths annually in America. The definition of obesity has not been standard. Recently, the World Health Organization defined overweight as a body mass index (BMI = kg/m(2)) of 25 and obesity as a BMI of greater than or equal to 30. A BMI of greater than or equal to 35 produces a high risk from obesity and of greater than or equal to 40 produces a severe risk. the presence of complications of obesity (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, etc.) increases the risk. Treatments of obesity depend on the severity of obesity, the presence of complications, and the absence of exclusions. Exclusions from obesity treatment include pregnancy, lactation, terminal illness, major mental illness, anorexia nervosa. Eating disorders and major medical disorders are strong cautions for obesity treatment. Obesity with a low or modest health risk (BMI: 25-30) is best treated with a diet lower in calories and fat than the current diet, exercise, and lifestyle modification. With obesity that produces a moderate to high health risk (BMI: 30-35), the above treatments plus a very low calorie diet or obesity drugs may be indicated. High and very high health risk due to obesity may be treated with the above regimen plus obesity surgery. In every category of obesity, the presence of complications of obesity increases the risk and justifies more aggressive forms of treatment. Treatment of obesity with drugs has gained acceptance in recent years. There are no absolute indications for drug treatment. Contraindications include pregnancy and lactation, unstable cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, severe psychiatric disorder or anorexia, and other drug therapy, if incompatible. Cautions include the presence of any severe systemic illness and certain other problems such as closed angle glaucoma. Obesity surgery is reserved as a last resort. Contraindications to surgery and significant mental or physical diseases preclude obesity surgery. Whatever the form of treatment, individualized attention with careful follow-up is mandatory. Obesity is similar to other chronic diseases; if the treatment stops, the disease comes back. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. 1998.

AB 1. Hypoxaemia during intrauterine life may be important in the development of cardiovascular diseases in later life. Thus it was the aim of this study to investigate the effect of repeated acute hypoxia on the cardiovascular development and growth of the fetus.
   2. Fourteen fetal sheep (105-109 days gestational age) were instrumented with amniotic and vascular catheters, an electrocardiogram (ECG) electrode and a flow probe around the femoral artery. Seven animals were given repeated acute isocapnic hypoxaemia (P(a,O2) reduced to ca. 13 mmHg) for 1 h every day for 14 days and they were compared to seven animals which remained normoxic throughout with respect to fetal mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), fetal heart rate (PHR), and fetal baro- and chemoreflexes.
   3. No differences were found between the two groups of fetuses in FHR, MAP, baro- or chemoreflexes, femoral blood flow, femoral vascular resistance or fetal growth.
   4. Repeated acute hypoxaemia of a moderate degree over a period of 2 weeks in late gestation does not affect cardiovascular development or growth in the fetal sheep.

AB The effect of infusing the neuroactive steroids pregnanolone and iso-pregnanolone on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and electrocortical (ECoG) activity was studied in unanaesthetised fetal sheep, 130-135 days gestation. Intravenous infusion of pregnanolone (6 mg/kg per h) significantly increased the proportion of high voltage ECoG (56.1 +/- 4.8% vs, control 43.5 +/- 3.2%, P < 0.05), and decreased low voltage ECoG (43.9 +/- 4.8% vs. control 56.6 +/- 3.2%, P < 0.05). Pregnanolone treatment decreased the amplitude of the N25 peak of the SEP (89.9 +/- 2.8% of control, P < 0.05) evoked following stimulation of the skin of the upper lip. In contrast, iso-pregnanolone treatment had no effect on ECoG activities, or on the amplitude and latency of peaks in the SEP. We conclude that 3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane steroids are active at GABA(A) receptors in fetal sheep and can modulate sleep/wake activity before birth. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to systematically investigate previous anecdotal reports of memory decline during pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: We used a longitudinal design to investigate memory in women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Closely matched, nonpregnant women were similarly studied at equivalent intervals. We also assessed degree of depression and anxiety.
   RESULTS: There was a significant time-by-group interaction (P<.01) for both immediate and delayed recall of paragraph length material. Contrasts showed a significant decline in memory for the pregnant group from the second to the third trimester (P<.01). No significant changes in memory were noted for the control group. The pregnant women scored higher on both depression and anxiety scales; however, somatic rather than cognitive items accounted for the elevated scores. Fluctuations in mood and memory did not coincide.
   CONCLUSION: There is a pregnancy-related decline in memory, which is limited to the third trimester. The decline is not attributable to depression, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or other physical changes associated with pregnancy.

AB Aims-To analyse the contribution of certain social, familial, prenatal, perinatal, and developmental background factors in the pathogenesis of deficits in attention, motor control, and perception (DAMP).
   Methods-A population based case-control study was carried out with 113 children aged 6 years, 62 diagnosed with DAMP and 51 controls without DAMP. The children's health and medical records were studied and their history with regard to background factors was taken at an interview with the mother using a standardised schedule. Familial factors, possible non-optimal factors during pregnancy (including smoking), developmental factors (including early language development), and medical and psychosocial data were scored in accordance with the reduced optimality method.
   Results-Low socioeconomic class was common in the group with DAMP. Familial language disorder and familial motor clumsiness were found at higher rates in the DAMP group. Neuropathogenic risk factors in utero were also more common in the children with DAMP. Maternal smoking during pregnancy appeared to be an important risk factor. Language problems were present in two thirds of the children with DAMP. Sleep problems and gastrointestinal disorders, but not atopy or otitis media, were significantly more common in the DAMP group.
   Conclusions-Prenatal familial and neuropathogenic risk factors contribute to the development of DAMP. Primary prevention, such as improved maternal health care and early detection or treatment, or both, of associated language problems appear to be essential.

AB Infants between 1 and 6 months of age (mean age 3.6 months) who were referred to the Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Programme because of persistent crying and their mothers were examined and compared with an age-matched community-based control sample with no current cry problem. Three groups, referred extreme criers, referred moderate criers, and controls, were compared with regard to measures of psychosocial and organic risks, the mothers' perception of her own psychological state and infant temperament, the quality of mother-infant relationship, and intuitive parenting in mother-infant face-to-face interactions. In comparison with general-community samples of infants with persistent crying, the present clinical sample represents a biased group with particularly,high levels of infant distress for long periods of time, with problems of sleep-wake organization, neuromotor immaturity, and difficult temperament. Moreover, extreme crying was associated with a cumulation of organic and psychosocial risks, including high rates of prenatal stress and anxiety, maternal psychopathology and partnership conflicts. Mothers in both referred groups scored similarly low on feelings of self-efficacy, and high on depression, anxiety, exhaustion, anger, adverse childhood memories, and marital distress. Mother-infant relationships were more often distressed or disturbed among referred dyads than among controls, and 40% as compared with 19% showed dysregulatory patterns of interactional failures in face-to-face contexts. The findings suggest that factors related to parental care did not cause persistent crying, but functioned as maintaining or exacerbating factors. Dynamic interactions between persistent crying, difficult temperament, and parenting factors which compromise maternal resources and intuitive parenting may put such families at long-term risk for both relationship and behaviour problems.

ID BEHAVIORAL STATES; NEWBORN-INFANT; HUMAN FETUSES; HEART-RATE;
   STIMULATION; GESTATION; PATTERNS; HEALTHY
AB A behavioural state transition is the time interval between two different behavioural states. In low-risk fetuses, the fetal heart rate pattern (FHRP) is the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F('non-REM-sleep' to 'REM-sleep') and the last variable to change in transitions from 2F to 1F. This is not the case in IUGR (intra-uterine growth retardation), and absence of a specific order in which behavioural variables are changing might be an indication for a (mild) disturbance of the fetal central nervous system (CNS). We investigated whether state transitions in twelve low risk term fetuses (39-41 weeks post menstrual age, PMA; control group) differ from those in twelve uncomplicated pregnancies > 41 weeks PMA (study group). All subjects underwent one behavioural study in which fetal heart rate pattern, eye and body movements were recorded simultaneously. We recorded 23 transitions from 1F to 2F and 20 from 2F to 1F. Median (range) duration for transitions from 1F to 2F was 85 (10-180) s in the study group, and 60 (10-180) s in the control group. Transitions from 2F to 1F lasted 80 (10-140) and 60 (30-100) s, respectively. In both groups, the FHRP was the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F, however, in transitions from 2F to 1F, no specific order in change of variables could be demonstrated. We conclude that the study of transitions does not distinguish between the term and after term fetuses under optimal conditions. Whether or not the analysis of state transitions can be used to distinguish 'normal' from 'abnormal' fetuses and detect the fetus at risk after term awaits further study.

ID PERINATAL-MORTALITY; BIRTH; SWITZERLAND
AB While circadian variations in birth and perinatal mortality rates have previously been described in the literature, the reasons behind these observed rhythms remain unclear. The principal hypothetical causes include variations in obstetric practices and an association between the time of birth and biological parameters. In order to explore this issue we analysed the distribution patterns for time and day of birth, as well as circadian variations in maternal characteristics, obstetric practices and neonatal risk in a population at low obstetric risk. The study population included 685 low-risk pregnant women consecutively admitted at an early stage of labour to six maternity units. The results showed hourly variations in the birth rate and circadian variations in obstetric practices that might explain the hourly pattern observed for the birth rate. By contrast, the frequency of a positive neonatal risk indicator was uniform across all time categories in this population at low obstetric risk.

AB Exposure to drugs of abuse during embryogenesis may adversely affect nervous, immune, and endocrine systems development. We compared exposure on embryonic day 18 (E18) by single or multiple cocaine (COC) injections (56.25 mg/kg total dose for both) or saline on hatching and activity measures. In saline-exposed controls, repeated testing, age, and gender affected activity levels. A single or multiple COC injections increased the median latency to explore and multiple COC injections decreased the median number of lines crossed by female chicks in the open field. We also determined if pretreatment with the serotonin, (5-HT2) receptor antagonist ritanserin could attenuate COC's effects on open-field behavior as well as behaviors sensitive to immune system stimulation (lipopolysaccharide (LPS:)-induced sickness behavior). Eggs containing em bryos were pretreated on E17 with 0.4 mg ritanserin/kg or its vehicle followed by multiple COC injections or saline on E18. E18 COC treatment decreased the median number of lines crossed and distress vocalizations in females. Ritanserin pretreatment mitigated the COC induced effects. E18 COC exposure also suppressed LPS-induced sickness behaviors in both males and females, increasing food consumption and the time spent awake and active, as well as decreasing the time spent sleeping. Ritanserin alone had no effect on the food consumed or time spent active, nor did this dose affect COG-induced alterations in sickness behavior. Ritanserin alone decreased time spent sleeping and also failed to affect the COG-induced suppression. Thus, embryonic COC exposure can suppress open field and LPS-induced sickness behavior in the young chick, and ritanserin pretreatment can block the former, but not the latter effects at the dose chosen for these experiments.

AB OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to describe medical findings and health-related concerns of sexual assault victims who returned for follow-up and to assess demographic and assault characteristics of victims who used follow-up services compared to those who did not.
   STUDY DESIGN: This study is a retrospective cohort analysis involving records from two sources: the acute sexual assault evidentiary examination and the SAFE (Sexual Assault Follow-up Evaluation) Clinic visit. Data were extracted from the records of 389 adolescent and adult victims who reported an acute sexual assault and underwent a complete evidentiary examination between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 1997. Descriptive statistics were generated on demographic and historical information, assault characteristics, and medical and laboratory findings. For the subgroup that presented for follow-up, additional descriptive statistics were generated to describe their interim history, concerns, medical outcomes, treatments, and psychosocial functioning, chi(2) analyses were used to identify differences in the group that returned for follow-up compared with the group that did not. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.
   RESULTS: There were no differences in age, race, or perpetrator factors between patients who used follow-up services and patients who did not return to the SAFE Clinic. Similarly, there were no other assault characteristics, relationships, or physical examination findings that were associated with follow-up patterns. A total of 31% (n = 122) of all sexual assault victims returned for a follow-up visit. Physical complaints were reported by 42.6%, but 98.0% had normal findings at a general examination, and 94.8% had a normal result of gynecologic examination. Pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus. were identified through the follow-up clinic. Since the assault, 49.2% had been sexually active, 10% with multiple partners and 73.3% without consistent condom use. Disturbances in sleep, sexual function, and appetite were commonly reported among victims at follow-up. Numerous assault-related fears were reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among recent rape victims, follow-up rates are low, and there are no factors that correlate with the use of follow-up services. Those who do come in for follow-up have physical complaints and health-related concerns that are related to their recent assault, but most have normal physical findings. Efforts to reach sexual assault Victims will require aggressive and innovative strategies to remain in contact with women and girls after rape.

AB The aim of these studies was to investigate maternal entrainment of developing circadian locomotor activity rhythms in the Siberian hamster. In Experiment 1, mothers were transferred from a 16:8 LD cycle into constant dim red light (DD) from the day of parturition, and wheel-running activity of the mother and pups was individually monitored from the time of weaning. The phases of the individual pups' rhythms were found to be synchronized both to the phase of the mother and to the phase of lights off (ZT 12) of the photo cycle that the mother was exposed to until the day of parturition. To investigate whether this synchrony might reflect direct effects of light acting upon the fetal circadian system in late gestation, the experiment was repeated but with mothers placed into DD early in pregnancy (less than or equal to day 7 of gestation). The results were similar to the first study, suggesting that the mother rather than the photo cycle during the latter part of gestation entrains the developing circadian system. The third experiment investigated whether this entrainment occurred during the postnatal period. Breeding pairs were maintained on alternative light-dark cycles, LD and DL, that were 12 h out of phase. Litters born to mothers on one light-dark cycle were exchanged on the day of birth with foster mothers from the reversed light-dark cycle, then raised in DD. Control Litters exchanged between mothers from the same light-dark cycle had similar Litter synchrony as shown by nonfostered Litters of Experiment 1. However, pups cross-fostered with mothers on reversed LD cycles showed a very different distribution of pup phases. Pups were not synchronized to their natural mother but to their foster mother. Moreover, pups were more scattered over the 24-h period and were found to be significantly synchronized to the phase of the reversed LD cycle. These results demonstrate the occurrence of postnatal entrainment in the Siberian hamster. The increased scatter produced by the cross-fostering paradigm results from some Litters being completely entertained to the phase of the foster mother, some with an intermediate distribution between the phases of the natural and foster mothers, and a minority being associated with the phase of the natural mother. These results suggest that Siberian hamster pups are initially synchronized either prenatally or at birth but that the mother continues to provide entrainment signals during the postnatal period.

AB Objective: To determine the influence of breast-feeding on the prevalence and persistence of sleeping problems in southern Finland (SF) and southern Germany (SG).
   Design: Prospective binational population study of infants admitted to special care units (SCUs) in geographically defined areas in SF and SG. Subjects: In SE the number of SCU infants was 1057 (very preterm, 47; preterm, 258; term, 752); 485 term infants were control subjects. In SG, the number of SCU infants was 4427 (very preterm, 284; preterm, 1419; term, 2724).
   Main outcome measure: Parent reports of child sleeping problems at 5, 20, and 56 months of age.
   Results: Night waking at 5 months of age was less frequent for SCU very preterm (25.5%), preterm (40.6%), and term infants (48%) than For term control subjects (56.7% to 59.9%) in SF. No differences in sleeping behavior according to gestation were found at 20 and 56 months. Sleeping problems were greater in SF infants (25.5% to 48%) than in SG infants (15.1% to 19.1%) at 5 months of age and were explained by a higher rate of breast-feeding in SF. Breast-feeding had no long-term effects on night waking or on co-sleeping in SF. In contrast, breast-fed infants continued to wake more often in SG.
   Conclusions: Breast-feeding rather than gestational age is strongly related to night waking. More support for dealing with night waking might prevent early termination of breast-feeding.

ID BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; METABOLIC-RATE; CARE
AB Temporary skin-to-skin contact between preterm infant and the mother is increasingly used in neonatal medicine to promote bonding. It is not known at which gestational age (GA) and postnatal age skin-to-skin contact outside the incubator is a sufficiently warm environment and is tolerated by preterm infants without a decrease in body temperature, oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) increase, or unrest. We conducted a prospective clinical study of 27 spontaneously breathing preterm infants of 25-30-wk GA. Rectal temperature (T-rectal), Vo(2) (indirect calorimetry), and activity were continuously measured in the incubator (60 min), during skin-to-skin contact (60 min), and back in the incubator (60 min) in wk 1 and 2 of life. In wk 1 the change in T-rectal during skin-to-skin contact was related to GA (r = 0.585, p = 0.0027): infants of 25-27-wk GA lost heat during skin-to-skin contact, whereas infants of 28-30 wk gained heat and their mean T-rectal during skin-to-skin contact was 0.3 degrees C higher than before (p < 0.01). No significant changes of Vo(2) or activity occurred. In wk 2 the infants' Vo(2) was higher than in wk 1, but Vo(2) during skin-to-skin contact was the same as in the incubator. Only small fluctuations in T-rectal occurred. In wk 2 all infants slept more during skin-to-skin contact than in the incubator (p < 0.02). We conclude that, for preterm infants of 28-30-wk GA, skin-to-skin contact was a sufficiently warm environment as early as postnatal wk 1. For infants of 25-27-wk GA skin-to-skin contact should be postponed until wk 2 of life, when their body temperature remains stable and they are more quiet during skin-to-skin contact than in the incubator.

AB Obesity is known to increase maternal morbidity and mortality. We describe a case of obstructive sleep apnea due to obesity and discuss our treatment of the resulting pulmonary hypertension. A patient was transferred to our hospital at 29 weeks' gestation with severe anasarca and more than a 100-pound weight gain during pregnancy, Pulmonary hypertension due to obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed. The patient was treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep and remained in the hospital, the remainder of her pregnancy, She had a massive spontaneous diuresis during her hospital stay and lost more than 100 pounds. She was delivered at term via cesarean section because of transverse Lie. Preoperative hemodynamic monitoring confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. This represents the first case in the literature of obstructive sleep apnea leading to pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy. This patient responded well to nasal CPAP as evident by the massive diuresis and good maternal outcome.

AB Stimulating cardiac beta(1)-adrenoceptors with oxyfedrine causes dilatation of coronary vessels and positive inotropic effects on the myocardium. beta(1)-adrenegic agonists increase coronary blood flow in nonstenotic and stenotic vessels.
   The main indication for the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors pamrinone, mirinone, enoximone and piroximone is acute treatment of severe congestive heart failure. Theophylline is indicated for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, apnea in preterm infants ans sleep apnea syndrome.
   Severe arterial occlusive disease associated with atherosclerosis can be beneficially affected by elcosanoids. These drugs must be administered parenterally and have a half-life of only a few minutes.
   Sublingual or buccal preparations of nitrates are the only prompt method (within 1 or 2 min) of terminating anginal pain, except for biting nifedipine capsules. The short half-life (about 2.5 min) of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) makes long term therapy impossible. Tolerance is a problem encountered with longer-acting nitric oxide donors.
   Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of vasodilating drugs can prevent a too sudden and severe blood pressure decrease in patients with chronic hypertension. In considering the administration of a second dose, or another drug, the time necessary for the initially administered drug to reach maximal efficacy should be taken into account.
   In hypertensive emergencies urapidil, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, hydralazine and phentolamine are the drugs of choice, with the addition of beta-blockers during catecholamine crisis or dissecting aortic aneurysm.
   Childhood hypertension is most often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium antagonists, primarily nifedipine. Because of the teratogenic risk involved with ACE inhibitors, extreme caution must be exercised when prescribing for adolescent females.
   The propagation of health benefits to breast-fed infants, combined with more women delaying pregnancy until their fourth decade, has entailed an increase in the need for hypertension management during lactation. Low dose hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, nifendipine and enalapril or captopril do not pose enough of a risk to preclude breastfeeding in this group.
   The most frequently used antihypertensive agents during pregnancy are methyldopa, labetalol and calcium channel antagonists. Methyldopa and beta-blockers are the drugs of choice for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Prazosin and hydralazine are used to treat moderate to severe hypertension and hydralazine, urapidil or labetalol are used to treat hypertensive emergencies. The use of overly aggressive antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy should be avoided so that adequate uteroplacental blood flow is maintained. Methyldopa is the only drug accepted for use during the first trimester of pregnancy.

AB The health, growth and development of a cohort of children (n = 59) aged 6 months to 4 years and born after oocyte donation (OD) was compared with that from a group of children born after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) (n = 126), The study was performed by questionnaire, and the response rate was 100% in the OD group and 95% in the IVF group. All OD children were healthy. Three IVF children had a neurological disorder. Surgical intervention had been carried out in 8% of the OD and 13% of the IVF children. Height and weight development were normal, and eating and sleeping disorders were uncommon in both groups of children. The IVF mothers more often expressed concern about the child's behaviour than did the OD mothers. Thirty-eight percent of the OD parents and 60% of the IVF parents intended to tell the child about the nature of its conception (P < 0.01), Although oocyte recipients appear to have more complications during their pregnancies than conventional IVF patients, the general health status of OD children aged <5 years is at least as good as that of IVF children. Growth and development in both groups of children is similar to that of the general population.

AB A link between prenatal malnutrition and hypertension in human populations has recently been proposed. Rat models of prenatal malnutrition have provided major support for this theory on the basis of tail-cuff measurements. However, this technique requires restraint and elevated temperature, both potential sources of stress. To determine the effect of prenatal protein malnutrition on blood pressure under nonstress conditions, 24-hour radiotelemetric measurements were taken in the home cage. Male rats born to dams fed a 6% casein diet for 5 weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy were studied in early adulthood (from 96 days of age). During the waking phase of their cycle but not the sleep phase, prenatal malnutrition gave rise to small but significant elevations of diastolic blood pressure and heart rate compared with well-nourished controls. Direct effects of stress on blood pressure responses were determined in a second experiment using an olfactory stressor. Prenatally malnourished rats showed a greater increase in both systolic and diastolic pressures compared with well-nourished controls during the first exposure to ammonia. A different pattern of change of cardiovascular responses was also observed during subsequent presentations of the stressor. These findings of a small baseline increase in diastolic pressure consequent to prenatal malnutrition, but an augmented elevation of both systolic and diastolic pressures after first exposure to stress, suggest the need to reevaluate interpretation of the large elevations in blood pressure previously observed in malnourished animals using the stressful tail-cuff procedure.

AB Evaluation of nonlinear heart rate (HR) dynamics has received considerable attention in the pediatric literature because such analyses not only provide insight into underlying control mechanisms, but may also help to differentiate between normal and abnormal infants. The purpose of this study was to determine, in eight low risk human fetuses, if nonlinear HR dynamics could be identified by analyzing the dispersion of interbeat intervals at slow (D-s) and fast (D-f) HRs. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a resolution of +/-1 ms. To test the null hypothesis, that the time series is the result of a linear stochastic process, D-s and D-f for the original time series were compared with the values calculated for three linear models. The linear models were constructed to preserve the major statistical properties of the original time series, including the mean, SD, and the Fourier power spectrum. For each fetus, there was no evidence of nonlinear cardiac dynamics based on analyses of D-s and D-f. In contrast, the distribution of adjacent R-R intervals and the pattern of change across three successive interbeat intervals both revealed significant nonlinearities in HR control in each fetus. If the difference between normal and abnormal infants is the result of aberrant control of nonlinear processes, then our findings indicate that parameters which describe the nonlinearity may be more useful then D-s and D-f in assigning a risk status.

AB Parturition is a multifactorial physiological process that involves multiple interconnected positive feedforward and negative feedback loops. Each of these loops is connected to others in a carefully time-regulated fashion. When parturition occurs normally. both fetal and maternal processes are involved. Recent reseal ch in pregnant sheep and nonhuman primates shows clearly that the fetus determines the duration of gestation and the mother determines the time of day at which labor begins. The fetal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a fundamental role in stimulating increased estrogen production in late gestation. Estrogen then activates maternal circadian rhythms that increase oxytocin secretion. As a result, uterine contraction patterns are switched from contractures to contractions.

AB Objective: To determine whether problems with childhood sleep behaviour are associated with either maternal sleep patterns and emotional status during the pregnancy period, or levels of maternal distress and depression during the postnatal period.
   Methodology: A case/control comparison study. Cases were families presenting for admissions to a mother/baby hospital in Brisbane with the major presenting problem being the child's sleep behaviour. The control group consisted of families presenting for well child health care to one of four child health centres in suburban Brisbane. Each participating mother provided information by way of a self-report questionnaire on social and demographic variables, children's sleep patterns, maternal emotional adjustment and maternal sleep pattern during the pregnancy, and current problem with child's sleep behaviour. Current level of maternal distress/depression, was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Cases were compared with controls on all these variables.
   Results: Significant differences were found between groups in childhood sleep parameters, degree of problem related to childhood sleep, maternal sleep variables during the entire pregnancy, and current levels of maternal distress/depression.
   Conclusion: The origins of problematic childhood sleep behaviour may lie in the pregnancy period. Levels of maternal distress and depression are associated with problematic childhood sleep behaviour. The issue of whether childhood sleep problem predisposes to maternal distress/depression needs exploration. Assessment of maternal mood disorder or childhood sleep problems should be comprehensive and involve both the maternal infant dyad and the family network.

AB Tenascin-C (TN), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein which reveals both neurite outgrowth-promoting and growth-inhibiting effects, is generated in the central nervous system. A previous study reported that TN-gene null mutant mice display hyperlocomotion and do not easily habituate to unfamiliar environments. Additionally, these mice display poor appetite, abnormal circadian rhythm and low pregnancy rate. The present study demonstrated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression is reduced in the limbic area of the TN gene-deficient mouse brain as compared to wild-type mice. NPY has been shown to affect emotion, circadian rhythm and food intake, and the present results suggest that the some behavioural abnormalities exhibited by TN-mutant mice may be in part due to the low level of expression of NPY mRNA in the limbic system.

AB The authors investigated risk profiles of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a function of age at death, A case-control study carried out in the Tyrol region of Austria enrolled 99 infants who died of SIDS between 1984 and 1994 and 136 randomly selected controls. Early and late SIDS (< 120 days of age vs. greater than or equal to 120 days) were defined according to the clear-cut bimodal age-at-death distribution, Inadequate antenatal care, low parental social and educational level, and the prone sleeping position were risk conditions that applied to both early and late SIDS. A marked seasonal variation (winter preponderance) was the most outstanding feature of late SIDS. A gestational age of < 37 weeks (odds ratio (OR) = 8.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-26.0), repeated episodes of apnea (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 1.2-27.0), low birth weight (< 2,500 g) (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-11.0), a family history of sudden infant death (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.5), and maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.5) were associated with early SIDS. This study identified two distinct subgroups of SIDS infants characterized by different risk conditions and ages at death. These results underline a multiple-cause hypothesis for SIDS etiology which involves a genetic predisposition, immaturity in the first months of life, and environmental factors acting at various ages.

AB Approximately 50% of infertile couples will become parents through pregnancy or adoption, but they experience major difficulties while working towards this goal. Infertility treatments are associated with physical pain and psychological distress, and adoption procedures are prolonged and emotionally stressful. The extent to which these stressors alter the parenting of these couples is not known. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the early parent-infant interactions in infertile couples who become parents through pregnancy or adoption. Two groups of infertile couples (30 who achieved pregnancy and 21 who adopted) and a group of 19 couples without fertility problems were observed interacting with their infants twice, 7 to 21 days after the infant's arrival and a week later, at a time when both parents were at home. Their babies were between 9 days and 5 months of age. Behaviours of the mother, father and infant: were recorded every 10 seconds, beginning when the baby was picked up and ending when the baby was put down asleep or 11/2 hours had passed. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare the three groups over the observations, there were no differences between fertile and infertile biological parents. Adopted infants showed more alertness, less sleeping, more smiles, and more looking than biological infants. Adoptive mothers spent less time as the sole interactor. Adoptive parents spent more time in playing with their infants and held and touched them less than did biological parents. Infertility, therefore, does not appear to affect early parenting. In general, the amounts of behaviours exhibited by infer the biological parents were very close to those of fertile parents. Differences in the behaviours of adoptive as compared to biological parents can best be explained as responses to the behaviours of their older infants, rather than as evidence of different parenting styles.

AB It has previously been reported that; active glottic adduction is present during prolonged apneas but absent during periods of breathing movements in fetal lambs in utero. The present study was aimed at examining the precise coordination between fetal breathing movements [diaphragm electromyographic (EMG) activity (Di EMG)] and glottic adduction [thyroarytenoid muscle EMG activity (TA EMG)]. Electrodes for electroencephalogram,, eye movements, TA EMG, and Di EMG and an arterial catheter were surgically implanted in fetal lambs 123-142 days postconception. Polygraphic recordings were performed without sedation while the ewe breathed room air (n = II) or various gas mixtures (hypoxia, n = 5; hyperoxia, it = 4; hypercapnia, it = 5; hypercapnia + hyperoxia, n = 5). Tonic TA EMC was observed throughout >90% of apneas (>6 s) in both non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep, and when Di EMG frequency decreased in rapid-eye-movement sleep. In all but two fetuses, TA EMG was immediately inhibited when Di EMG appeared. Altering blood gases did not modify these results. In conclusion, Di EMG and TA EMG are well coordinated in late gestation in fetal lambs, except in a few cases. These findings may have consequences for understanding the pathogenesis of mixed/obstructive apneas of prematurity.

AB The possible effects of a wide range of sociodemographic and environmental factors on the incidence and distribution of petechiae were investigated in 485 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases from the New Zealand Cot Death Study. The number (nil, fews, many) of macroscopic petechial hemorrhages in the visceral pleura, capsule of thymus, and epicardium was recorded in 458 of 474 autopsied SIDS cases. Other information was obtained from parental interview and obstetric records. Univariate analysis showed highly significant relationships (P less than or equal to 0.005) between the frequency of petechiae at one or more sites and socioeconomic status, parity, breast feeding, age at death, time of death, sleep position, and head covering at death and lesser but significant relationships (P less than or equal to 0.05) with Maori ethnicity, bir th weight, gestation, pacifier use, and bed sharing. After multivariate analysis, significant associations remained between increased frequencies of thymic petechiae and parity (P = 0.0001), age at death (P = 0.0003), Maori ethnicity (P = 0.0019), pacifier use (P = 0.0001), and head covering at death (P = 0.0032); between increased frequencies of epicardial petechiae and head covering at death (P = 0.008) and an estimated time of death between 00:00 and 05:59 h (P = 0.056); and between increased frequencies of pleural petechiae and maternal smoking (P = 0.058) and parity (P = 0.022). There was a decreased frequency of pleural petechiae in infants placed prone for their final sleep (P = 0.058). The distribution and frequency of petechiae are affected by environmental factors, including known risk factors fur SIDS, but these factors occur inconsistently across the three sites. The findings imply differences in the pathogenesis at each site but do not provide consistent support fur previous theories of causation of pctechiae.

AB Objective. To test the hypothesis that exposure to alcohol in breast milk affects infants' sleep and activity levels in the short term.
   Methods. Thirteen lactating women and their infants were tested on 2 days, separated by an interval of 1 week. On each testing day, the mother expressed 100 mt of milk, while a small, computerized movement detector called an actigraph was placed on the infant's left leg to monitor sleep and activity patterning. After the actigraph had been in place for similar to 15 minutes, the infants ingested their mothers breast milk flavored with alcohol (32 mg) on one testing day and breast milk alone on the other. The infants' behaviors were monitored for the next 3.5 hours.
   Results. The infants spent significantly less time sleeping during the 3.5 hours after consuming the alcohol-flavored milk (78.2 minutes compared with 56.8 minutes after feeding alcohol in breast milk). This reduction was apparently attributable to a shortening in the longest sleeping bout (34.5 compared with 56.7 minutes for sleeping after breast milk alone) and the amount of time spent in active sleep (25.8 minutes compared with 44.2 minutes after breast milk alone); the decrease in active sleep was observed in all but 2 of the 13 infants tested.
   Conclusions. Although the mechanisms underlying the reduction in sleep remain to be elucidated, this study shows that short-term exposure to small amounts of alcohol in breast milk produces distinctive changes in the infant's sleep-wake patterning.

AB A kinetic parameter (the V-m/K-m ratio), an index of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase catalytic efficiency, was studied in 36 women with normal pregnancies at 16-20 weeks' gestation. On each blood sample, determinations were achieved on enzyme extracted from maternal granulocytes by monitoring the phosphohydrolytic activity at 400 nm on a spectrophotometer equipped with software for computation of kinetic parameters, Infant sex was recorded at the delivery for all women included in this study. The recent introduction of NAP as a marker for some pathological pregnancies requires a better knowledge of the behaviour of that enzyme in physiological conditions. Data reported focus attention on fetal sex. It appears to be one of the factors involved in variations of kinetic parameters observed in maternal NAP. Sex-linked differences in placental maturation could explain these results. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Although the cause or causes of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remain unknown, the incidence of SIDS is on the decline in the United States and other countries. This decline has been accomplished largely through public education campaigns informing parents about several important factors associated with an increased risk of SIDS. These factors are prone and side infant sleeping positions, exposure of infants to cigarette smoke and potentially hazardous sleeping environments. Risk-reduction measures such as placing healthy infants to sleep in the supine position, avoiding passive smoke exposure both before and after birth and optimizing crib safety are beginning to lower the SIDS rate in this country. Through patient education, family physicians can further reduce the incidence of the number one cause of death in infants one week to one year old.

DE ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; preeclampsia; hypertension;

ID HYPERTENSION
AB OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring holds great promise as a useful tool in the management of hypertensive pregnancies and pregnancies considered "at risk" for development of preeclampsia. The purpose of this study was to define ambulatory blood pressure monitoring parameters throughout normal pregnancy, including women considered at risk for development of hypertension who continued to have a completely normal pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred seventy-six 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring studies were made cross-sectionally with use of a Spacelabs 90207 device (validated for use in pregnancy), at one or more of 9 to 17, 18 to 22, 26 to 30, and >30 weeks' gestation. Upper limits of normal were defined as the mean plus 2 SDs for awake and sleep ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results at each stage.
   RESULTS: Average awake upper limits of normal were 130/77, 132/79, 133/81, and 135/86 mm Hg at the four stages of pregnancy, respectively. Systolic blood pressure fell significantly by 12% to 14% (p < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure by 18% to 19% (p < 0.0001) during sleep at all stages of pregnancy. Awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring systolic measurements were 11 to 12 mm Hg higher than "clinic" measurements (p < 0.001) and diastolic measurements were 5 to 11 mm Hg higher (p < 0.0001) throughout pregnancy. Maximum blood pressure variability ranged from 8 to 13 mm Hg.
   CONCLUSIONS: The upper limits of normal ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived measurements rise slightly as pregnancy progresses. Awake measurements are higher than "clinic" measurements recorded under relaxed conditions by a clinical researcher. The diurnal blood pressure fall and variabilities are similar during pregnancy to those seen in nonpregnant subjects. These data should provide valuable references for further studies of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in high risk pregnancies.

AB Objective To assess objectively the fetal autonomic response to vibroacoustic stimulation and test the method in cases with and without prior exposure to narcotic analgesics.
   Methods Intrapartum fetal electrocardiographic recordings from 24 term pregnancies were analyzed by power spectral analysis of epochs of 256 consecutive beats. Recordings were taken before vibroacoustic stimulation, and 1 and 10 min after vibroacoustic stimulation both during periods of spontaneous and narcotic-induced fetal quiet sleep.
   Results Vibroacoustic stimulation caused a significant rise in fetal sympathetic tone documented by an increase in total power and a shift towards the very low frequency band (0-0.05 Hz). This response was observed during both types of fetal sleep. Spectral analysis was, however, able to elucidate the difference between spontaneous and narcotic-induced fetal sleep by showing a sustained rise in sympathetic tone versus a complete recovery to prestimulation values within 10 min in each group, respectively.
   Conclusions Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability provides an effective tool for quantifying the fetal response to vibroacoustic stimulation. This is shown by the ability to differentiate between spontaneous and narcotic-induced fetal sleep. The change in fetal state, but not the immediate 'startle response' is suppressed by narcotic analgesia.

The diurnal Variations in baseline FHR were recognized in all subjects (P < 0.01). In 3/4 subjects, the lowest values were at 00.00-06.00 h. The diurnal variation in baseline FHR might be caused by maternal factors because it was present even in the anencephalic fetuses that had no central nervous system having the oscillators of the circadian rhythm.

Sleep behavior by sleep log revealed that they woke more frequently during the course of their pregnancy and that their total sleep time decreased gradually toward the end of their pregnancy. According to their subjective evaluations, these shortages of night sleep could not be made up with the morning naps in the multiparas as was the case of the primiparas. These changes in sleep characteristics have been studied from biological, psychological and social factors view points.

AB We studied basic sleep changes in pregnant rats in order to understand how pregnancy alters sleep. In the rat, pregnancy increased nocturnal nonREM sleep across the entire period but increased REM sleep only in the early period. By the end of pregnancy, diurnal sleep was decreased, showing that pregnancy in rats causes biphasic sleep changes as it does in humans. Termination of pregnancy returned the enhanced sleep to baseline as in the estrous cycle. Therefore, significant changes in the pattern of sleep occurred during pregnancy in rats, suggesting that the animal model may contribute to understanding the mechanism of sleep disorders related to human pregnancy.

AB BACKGROUND: TO characterise the relationship between breast cancer and different aspects of the reproductive life, use of drugs and alcohol by family history of breast cancer,
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the cancer registry of Girona, Spain, 330 women were identified with histologically confirmed breast cancer during 1986-1989, For each case, a control women was selected from a random sample of the population living in the matched area to the case by age (+/- 5 yr.). The information was collected by a personal interview and included: family history of breast cancer, reproductive history, presence of acne during the teenage years, use of oral contraceptives and drugs for sleep and anxiety disorders, and alcohol consumption.
   RESULTS: 18.5% of breast cancer cases and 8.9% of all controls had a family history of breast cancer, Family history on a first degree relative (mother or sister) was present in 10.6% of the cases and 2.8% of controls, which represented an odds ratio for breast cancer of 3.7 (95% CI, 1.8-7.8) higher than the general population. Women with a first degree family history of breast cancer were at higher risk for breast cancer ii the had a history of acne during the teenage period (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2) and if they referred long menstrual periods in the early years of menarche (OR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.0), Women with no family history had a higher breast cancer risk if they had a late menarche, long menstrual periods, late first full term pregnancy, and history of acne during puberty, Alcohol consumption and use of drugs for anxiety and sleep disorders were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS: First degree family history of breast cancer seems to be the best risk indicator for developing breast cancer. Long menstrual periods and presence of acne during puberty may indicate hormonal imbalance that act independently of the family history in breast cancer development.

AB This study investigated the effects of an intervention for polydrug-using adolescent mothers. The program included educational, vocational, and parenting classes; social and drug rehab; and day care for their infants while they attended school half-day. The drug-exposed infants were similar to the nonexposed infants on traditional birth measures, although they had inferior Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale scores, including habituation, orientation, abnormal reflexes, general irritability, and regulatory capacity. The drug-exposed infants also spent less time in quiet sleep and more time crying and showing stress behaviors. Both the mothers and the infants in the drug groups demonstrated inferior interactions, and their dopamine and serotonin levels were significantly higher. As early as 3 months (following 3 months of intervention), the drug rehab mothers and their infants looked more like the nondrug group in their interactions; by 6 months, they looked similar on virtually every measure. At 12 months, the infants of drug rehab mothers (versus the drug control group) had superior Early Social Communication Scale scores and Bayley Mental scale scores, as well as significantly greater head circumference and fewer pediatric complications. The drug rehab mothers also improved on several lifestyle variables. They demonstrated a lower incidence of continued drug use and repeat pregnancy, and a greater number continued school, received a high school or general equivalency diploma, or were placed in a job. Thus, a relatively cost-effective high school based intervention had positive effects on both adolescent mothers who had used drugs and their infants.

AB The role of the period of the environmental cycle during gestation and infancy on the circadian period of adult hamsters was studied. Tau-mutant hamsters of all three genotypes (+/+, 24-h circadian period; +/tau, 22-h period; tau/tau, 20-h period) were conceived and raised under either a 20-h light-dark cycle or a 24-h cycle. The circadian period in constant darkness was determined at 2 months of age by inspection of records of running-wheel activity. Differences in circadian period of up to 1.2 h were observed. However, changes of the same magnitude were also observed in animals conceived and raised under a 24-h cycle and exposed to a 20-h cycle at 8 months of age. Therefore, it is concluded that the aftereffects of entrainment can account for the apparent influence of the early environment. The free-running period of the circadian pacemaker seems to be under complete genetic control and not to be influenced by the period of the environmental cycle under which the animal is raised.

AB Melatonin, an indole amine, primarily derived from the pineal gland is secreted during the hours of darkness. Melatonin acts as a hormonal transduction of photoperiod influencing the timing of seasonal and daily (circadian) physiological rhythms. Maternal melatonin crosses the placenta and enters the fetal circulation providing photoperiodic information to the fetus influencing the subsequent circadian and seasonal rhythms of the offspring. The function of melatonin in humans is more obscure. However, melatonin has attained prominence as a treatment for disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep patterns which occur as a result of transmeridian travel, shift work or blindness. The biological clock, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), possesses melatonin receptors, in both the adult and fetal human. This concurs with the reported influence of melatonin on human circadian rhythmicity and indicates that this influence may begin in utero. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the human fetus and occur in both central and peripheral tissue from early in fetal development. Thus, the influence of melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to entraining circadian rhythmicity. Considering the transplacental availability of melatonin to the fetus the ingestion of melatonin by pregnant women may be inadvisable.

AB Pulsatile PRL secretion undergoes diurnal variation, with maximal PRL release in the evening during sleep in both women and men. However, the impact of the menopause on PRL pulsatile dynamics are largely unknown. To characterize diurnal PRL pulsatile secretion in postmenopausal women, we performed frequent Venous sampling over 24 h every 10 min for serum PRL in 7 postmenopausal women (age, 56 +/- 4 yr) and in 2 control groups, 8 men (age, 25 +/- 8 yr) and 22 cycling women (age, 28 +/- 5 yr), at 3 phases of the menstrual cycle. Standard TRH tests (200 mu g, iv) were administered at 0900 h after completion of the 24-h sampling, and PRL levels were then obtained at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min in all subjects. PRL pulse characteristics were similar between the postmenopausal women and men. Mean serum PRL levels and PRL pulse frequency were significantly higher in the cycling women than in either postmenopausal women or men over 24 h and during either the day or night periods. Mean serum PRL levels and pulse frequency were significantly higher during the night compared to those during the day in all groups. Pulse amplitude was higher during the night vs. the day in all groups and was highest in the cycling women. PRL responses to TRK administration were greatest in cycling women. These data demonstrate that PRL pulse dynamics are significantly different between postmenopausal women and cycling women, and endogenous estrogen levels may have an important role in this difference. Pulsatile PRL secretion is similar between postmenopausal women and men, suggesting that estrogen levels modulate PRL dynamics across genders.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine if fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations periodically occur with uterine contractures during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia in goats.
   METHODS: In five chronically catheterized goat fetuses at 125-130 days' gestation, incidence of FHR decelerations was compared between 6 hours' control time and 6 hours' induced hypoxemia with two-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test. Three other fetuses were used as controls for circadian rhythm.
   RESULTS: Fetal PaO2 was significantly decreased from 26.1 to 16.3 mmHg without acidemia. During hypoxemia, 42 decelerations were induced along with 5 initial decelerations during the acute phase hypoxemia. Incidence of decelerations increased significantly from 0.07 +/- 0.15 per hour in 6-hour controls to 1.40 +/- 0.28 per hour during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia. Short-term variability and long-term variability of the 42 decelerations were significantly increased. These variabilities were also increased during the 5 initial decelerations. Frequency of uterine contractures did not change during hypoxemia. There was an observable association of FHR decelerations with uterine contractures during hypoxemia.
   CONCLUSION: Fetal heart rate decelerations occurred periodically in association with uterine contractures during induced 6 hours' hypoxemia, which were characterized by slow onset and recovery with increases in variability. (C) 1998 by the Society for Gynecologic Investigation.

AB Increased body temperature (fever or hyperthermia) is a physiological response to many different stimuli. In fact, fever (a 1-4 degrees C elevation of the body temperature) is not only a clinical symptom common to many infectious diseases but also a side effect of immunostimulating or antiviral therapies. Hyperthermic reactions, on the other hand, can be observed after treatment with antipsychotic drugs, 5-hydroxytryptamine-receptor agonists, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and as a reaction to anesthesia. Moreover, hyperthermic reactions can be related to particularly stressful emotional states, to the menstrual ovulatory cycle, and to pregnancy. Transient hyperthermia or fever is also a common consequence of cerebral ischemic events, and it is present during stress as well as intense physical exercise. This review focuses on fever, one of the main components of the systemic acute-phase reaction to external proinflammatory stimuli. Special emphasis is given to neuronal mechanisms of fever induction, in which the hypothalamus plays a crucial role in both control of the febrile response as well as other centrally mediated neurological signs of inflammation, such as increased sleep, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, anorexia, and sickness behavior. This review pays particular attention to the role of proinflammatory cytokines as endogenous pyrogens.

AB Fetal bladder volume and hourly fetal urine production (HFUPR) is calculated on the assumption that the fetal bladder is ellipsoid in shape. A recent validation study demonstrated a progressive overestimation at increasing bladder volumes. This may be due to changes in shape of the fetal bladder at increasing volumes. Two independent papers have shown increased HFUPR during fetal behavioural state 1F (S1F) when compared with S2F. The aim of the present study was to assess whether this increase of HFUPR during S1F, previously observed by others, could be the result of an error introduced by the method of volume calculation. A retrospective evaluation was performed in a series of 208 HFUPR measurements in 123 normal near term pregnant women attending a low-risk antenatal clinic. Adequate bladder filling in both states was identified in 43 recordings. Maximum fetal bladder volumes were greater (>10 ml) during S1F in comparison to S2F in 56% of these recordings and HFUPR was significantly greater during S1F only in these cases. Bladder volumes are usually lower during S2F as a result of fetal voiding, which occurred in association with 22 of 36 transitions from S1F to S2F, and only 1 of 13 transitions from S2F to S1F (P < 0.001). When disregarding calculated bladder volumes in excess of 20 ml for the purpose of calculating HFUPR, eleven recordings remained. HFUPR calculated in this way was significantly lower in comparison to measurements where larger bladder volumes were included and no difference was observed between states. This implies that the differences observed are the result of the greater error in calculating bladder volumes and HFUPR during S1F, where volumes are usually greater and that calculation of fetal bladder volume should not be performed on the assumption that the bladder is ellipsoid in shape. Alternative techniques include limiting measurements to a maximum volume of approximately 20 ml, when the bladder is usually ellipsoid in shape or basing volume calculation on the surface area of a series of sagittal views as suggested by Hedriana and Moore [Hedriana HL, Moore TR. Ultrasonographic evaluation of human fetal urinary flow rate: accuracy of bladder volume estimations. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1994;170:1250-1254; Hedriana HL, Moore TR.

AB OBJECTIVE: We quantified the presence of diurnal rhythms in various computerized fetal heart rate parameters in normal pregnancies to assess their clinical relevance.
   STUDY DESIGN: Modified cosine analysis was applied to the outcomes of computerized analysis of continuous 24-hour fetal heart rate recordings in 26 normal pregnancies,. Diurnal rhythms in maternal heart rate and plasma hormones were assessed in 15 and 17 pregnancies, respectively. Correlations between maternal and fetal rhythms were calculated.
   RESULTS: A significant diurnal rhythm in basal heart rate was present in 73% of the fetuses and was closely related to the maternal heart rate rhythm. Diurnal rhythms in heart rate variability, accelerations, and activity were present in only 30% to 50% of the fetuses.
   CONCLUSIONS: The mother entrains fetal diurnal rhythms. The normal variability in neural development may account for the absence of diurnal rhythms in some fetuses.

AB Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that underlie variation in female fertility in humans. Data on this topic are nonetheless vital to a number of pragmatic and theoretical enterprises, including population planning, infertility treatment and prevention, and evolutionary ecology. Here we study female fertility by focusing on one component of the interbirth interval: the waiting time to conception during menstrual cycling. Our study population is a Dogon village of 460 people in Mall, West Africa. This population is pronatalist and noncontracepting. In accordance with animist beliefs, the women spend five nights sleeping at a menstrual hut during menses. By censusing the women present at the menstrual huts in the study village on each of 736 consecutive nights, we were able to monitor women's conception waits prospectively. Hormonal profiles confirm the accuracy of the data on conception waits obtained from the menstrual hut census (Strassmann [1996], Behavioral Ecology 7:304 - 315). Using survival analysis, we identified significant predictors of the waiting time to conception: wife's age (years), husband's age (< 35, 35 - 49, > 49 years), marital duration (years), gravidity (number of prior pregnancies), and breast-feeding status. Additional variables were not significant, including duration of postpartum amenorrhea, sex of the last child: nutritional status, economic status, polygyny, and marital status (fiancee vs. married). We fit both continuous and discrete time survival models, but the former appeared to be a better choice for these data. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Purpose: Several studies demonstrated that circadian blood pressure profile is impaired in patients with preeclampsia. Aim of the study was to evaluate the circadian blood pressure profile in pregnant patients with HELLP syndrome. gaudy design: Noninvasive 24-hour-blood pressure measurement (SpaceLabs 90207) was performed in 16 pregnant patients with HELLP syndrome and in 10 healthy normotensive; pregnant controls. Results: The results indicate that the circadian blood pressure rhythm is disturbed in patients with HELLP syndrome as compared to normotensive healthy pregnant controls (p<0.05). Mean arterial blood pressure decreased in patients with HELLP syndrome for 106.6 mmHg during day to 99.2 mmHg during night. The decrease of mean arterial blood pressure of 7.7 mmHg (6.9%) was less extensive as compared to the controls (15.7%). The low nocturnal decrease of blood pressure did not correlate with the maternal heart rate, which decreased significantly during the night. The pathological change of circadian blood pressure profile was transitory and normalised within four months post partum. Conclusion: Results suggest that the circadian blood pressure profile is altered in patients with HELLP syndrome leading to the recommendation of careful blood pressure monitoring throughout the night.

AB In 21 pregnancies complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) which was treated by antihypertensive drugs (labetalol, nifedipine), fetal behavioural recordings (quiet state, CIF; active state, C2F; no coincidence, NOC) and Doppler measurements of blood how velocity in the umbilical artery (UA) (resistance index, RI) were made on two occasions (27-32 and 33-36 weeks of gestation). Data were compared to those of a control group of normally grown fetuses (n = 96); in 15 cases we were able to match fetuses from the study group for age(+/-1 week) and weight (+/-150 g) at birth with fetales from a control group. It was the aim of this study to investigate if there are disturbances in the development of fetal behavioural states and if possible disturbances are due to poor fetal growth or to antihypertensive therapy. Our results show that in PIH treated by antihypertensive drugs, there are disturbances' in the development of fetal behavioural states with higher percentages of NOC and C1F, lower percentages of C2F, and higher UA RI values. These disturbances are mainly due to coexisting placental impairment and poor fetal growth rather than to nifedipine or labetalol therapy, although these drugs may cause some redistribution of states.

AB Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression, also known as Ohtahara syndrome is one of the most severe forms of epilepsy, which occurs, in the neonatal period. This study describes the authors' experience with 3 cases with neonatal onset of intractable epilepsy that presented all the clinical and EEG features of Ohtahara syndrome. The 3 cases were born after a normal and uneventful pregnancy and delivery. At ages between 1-8 days seizures began; they consisted of tonic or tonic-clonic convulsions without myoclonus, that were recorded on videotape. Laboratory investigations were normal. EEG interictally showed the classical burst suppression pattern without wake-sleep cycling. All three of our patients died at ages ranged between 10-21 months preceded by a great development delay. This report is devoted to the rarity of the Ohtahara syndrome; the etiopatogenesis and prognosis of such cases are further discussed.

AB Administration of steroid hormones was demonstrated to modulate the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and sleep-associated hormonal secretion in specific ways. The present study was conducted to compare the effects of mifepristone (Mif), a mixed glucocorticoid (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist, and megestrol acetate (Meg), a PR agonist. Nine healthy men were pretreated with either placebo or 200 mg Mif or 320 mg Meg, or a combination of both. Changes in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and growth hormone concentrations were registered every 30 min; sleep EEG recordings were obtained continuously. Administration of Mif increased the morning plasma ACTH and cortisol surges, whereas Meg had the opposite effect. Growth hormone secretion was lowered by Mif pretreatment and enhanced by Meg. Simultaneous administration of both compounds led to largely compensated effects. The sleep EEG changes induced by Mif were a slight increase in the time awake and a delayed onset of slow-wave sleep. Meg led to a reduction of rapid-eye-movement sleep. Simultaneous administration of Mif and Meg showed a synergism in increasing time awake and shallow sleep: it therefore may be concluded that the sleep EEG effects are mediated by an interaction of GR and PR in unknown mechanisms.

AB The World Health Organization (WHO), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and the German and Austrian Governments jointly sponsored an international seminar in November of 1996 on the biological effects of low-level radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. For purposes of this seminar, RF fields having frequencies only in the range of about 10 MHz to 300 GHz were considered. This is one of a series of scientific review seminars held under the International Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Project to identify any health hazards from EMF exposure. The scientific literature was reviewed during the seminar and expert working groups formed to provide a status report on possible health effects from exposure to low-level RF fields and identify gaps in knowledge requiring more research to improve health risk assessments.
   It was concluded that, although hazards from exposure to high-level (thermal) RF fields were established, no known health hazards were associated with exposure to RF sources emitting fields too low to cause a significant temperature rise in tissue. Biological effects from low-level RF exposure were identified needing replication and further study. These included in vitro studies of cell kinetics and proliferation effects, effects on genes, signal transduction effects and alterations in membrane structure and function, and biophysical and biochemical mechanisms for RF field effects. In vivo studies should focus on the potential for cancer promotion, co-promotion and progression as well as possible synergistic, genotoxic, immunological, and carcinogenic effects associated with chronic low-level RF exposure. Research is needed to determine whether low-level RF exposure causes DNA damage or influences central nervous system function, melatonin synthesis, permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), or reaction to neurotropic drugs. Reported RF-induced changes to eye structure and function should also be investigated.
   Epidemiological studies should investigate: the use of mobile telephones with hand-held antennae and incidence of various cancers; reports of headache, sleep disturbance, and other subjective effects that may arise from proximity to RF emitters, and laboratory studies should be conducted on people reporting these effects; cohorts with high occupational RF exposure for changes in cancer incidence; adverse pregnancy outcomes in various highly RF exposed occupational groups; and ocular pathologies in mobile telephone users and in highly RF exposed occupational groups.
   Studies of populations with residential exposure from point sources, such as broadcasting transmitters or mobile telephone base stations have caused widespread health concerns among the public, even though RF exposures are very low. Recent studies that may indicate an increased incidence of cancer in exposed populations should be investigated further. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB We tested the hypothesis that the surge of norepinephrine at birth is associated with the establishment of continuous breathing. Therefore, we studied whether the administration of norepinephrine could enhance fetal breathing during administration of oxygen, or 100% O-2 plus cord occlusion, and if phenoxybenzamine would reverse these changes. Fetal sheep were instrumented in late gestation to measure electrocortical activity and diaphragmatic electromyography. These parameters and blood gases were measured before and during in utero administration of nitrogen. 100% O-2, 100% O-2 plus umbilical cord occlusion, and subsequently during umbilical reperfusion and recovery. Nine fetuses (14 experiments) received continuous norepinephrine (0.13 mu g/kg/min) throughout the experiment while 9 other fetuses (18 experiments) underwent the same treatment without the hormonal infusion. We found that norepinephrine inhibited the breathing induced by 100% O-2 plus cord occlusion, despite a significant increase in the duration of low-voltage electrocortical activity; phenoxybenzamine reverted these changes. The findings suggest that the surge of norepinephrine at birth is probably not the primary mechanism for establishment of continuous breathing.

AB To study the main predictors of childhood preschool headache. 1443 families expecting their first child were followed from the onset of pregnancy to the child's sixth year of life. Subject selection was based on stratified randomized cluster sampling. Of the children, 14.91 (144) suffered from headache disturbing daily activities at the age of 6 years. The mother's assessment of the infant's poor health (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.8) and feeding problems (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2) at the age of 9 months predicted later occurrence of headache. At 3 years. depression and sleeping difficulties (according to Achenbach's psychological test) and recurrent difficulties in falling asleep (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.2) were strong predictors. Headache in other family members (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 5.9). especially in the mother (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4), predicted preschool headache in the child. At the age of 5 years, travel sickness (OR 2.8, 95%:, CI 1.5 to 5.1), nocturnal enuresis (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0), and the presence of longterm disease (OR 1.8. 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0) were strong predictors of later headache. At the same age, concentration difficulties (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.2), behavioral problems (OR 2.7. 95% CI 1.1 to 6.4), unusual tiredness (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 13.5), and, conversely, high sociability (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.2) predicted headache. The three last-mentioned psychological factors seemed to be associated with concentration difficulties at the age of 5, which was found to be the strongest predictor. The parents of child headache sufferers often became aware of the child's problems long before the emergence of headache.

AB The objective was to study the impact of birth weight on the relationship between ambulatory blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion in children and adolescents. The study included 134 healthy children (61 boys), all Caucasians, who were born at term after a normotensive pregnancy. For each subject, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a complete urine collection were simultaneously performed according to the protocols designed, Average ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and the urinary excretion rates for sodium, potassium, and creatinine were calculated separately for 24-hour, awake, and sleep periods defined by a mini-diary. The excretion rate of sodium during sleep time was positively correlated with ambulatory systolic BP; such a positive relationship was not found for waking hours. Consequently, the impact of birth weight on the relationship between blood pressure and the urinary sodium excretion rate was analyzed during sleeping hours. Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that although current weight was the strongest predictor for the sodium excretion rate during sleep (P<.001), there was also an independent significant direct relationship for birth weight (P<.04) after controlling for age, sex, and the average of systolic BP during sleep. Adjusted for current weight, a significant difference in the regression slopes relating urinary sodium excretion rate and systolic BP during sleep exists between children in the lowest (<3.100 kg) and the highest tertiles (>3.500 kg) of birth weight (P<.02). Differences in sodium excretion rates, adjusted for current weight, between the two extreme tertiles of birth weight became significant at the highest systolic BP (P<.04). The children who had the lowest birth weight tended to excrete less sodium during sleep. The results of the present study show a blunted pressure natriuresis curve in children and adolescents with the lowest birth weight. Whether this abnormal renal sodium handling may be present as an initial or as an intermediate mechanism leading to higher BP values must be assessed in additional studies.

AB A prospective study documented the nutritional intakes of a large cohort of pregnant women living in Portsmouth and investigated the independent relationships of smoking, dietary intake and other maternal socio-economic factors on outcome and cardiorespiratory function of the child during sleep at home at three weeks and three months of age. Unattended overnight cardiorespiratory recording was performed and the data stored in local memory before transmission on demand via modem to Oxford next morning. The telemetry of the physiological data, entirely managed by part-time community nurses in Portsmouth, was very successful. Despite some losses, which included transmission failures, electrode or lead disconnection, and monitor malfunction, 92% of the physiological data were analysed at Oxford. Personalized physiological monitoring in the community provides an opportunity for new evidence bases that will enable a new level of individualized care.

AB In humans, prenatal stress can induce mental retardation and sleep disturbances in infants. In animals, dams stressed during pregnancy can bear offspring with reduced male sexual activity, enhanced emotional reactivity, increased propensity to self-administer drugs, and modifications of glucocorticoid secretion. We studied stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) secretion and hippocampal CORT receptors in adult male rats submitted to prenatal stress (PS). Repeated restraint of the dam during the last week of pregnancy has been used as PS. At 90 days of age, offspring were submitted to a 30-min restraint stress. We found that PS decreases hippocampal CORT receptors and prolongs stress-induced CORT secretion in adult rats.
   Then we tested if the stress-induced increase in maternal glucocorticoids, which cross the placental and blood-brain barriers reaching the foetus, may play a role. We investigated the effects of adrenalectomy and/or CORT injections to the mother on the outcome of PS on the activity of the hypothalamo pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of adult male offspring. We found that: (1) maternal adrenalectomy protected the offspring from the effects of PS on CORT-secretion receptors; and (2) injections of CORT to the mother had the same effects of PS.
   Prenatal and postnatal events affect different behaviors, but can also impinge differently on the same behavioral response, such that postnatal manipulations can reverse the behavioral effects of prenatal stress. For example, postnatal handling has been shown to reverse the increase in emotional reactivity induced by prenatal stress. To this end, we tested the interactions of prenatal and postnatal events on the activity of the HPA axis. Adoption at birth was used to perturb the postnatal environment. We found that: (1) adoption, independently of the stress experience of the foster mother, reverses the effects of prenatal stress on both corticosterone-secretion and corticosteroid receptors; (2) adoption per se increases maternal behavior and decreases the stress-induced corticosterone secretion peak in adult offspring.
   In conclusion, prenatal and postnatal manipulations can have opposite long-term effects on the activity of the HPA axis and adoption, probably by changing maternal behavior can protect against the effects of prenatal stress. Thus, changes in the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis may be one of the biological substrates of the long term effects of perinatal events.

AB Studies in both the human and ovine near-term fetus have identified the clustering of physiologic and behavioral parameters into states. In a recent study in the human fetus a considerable decrease was found in fetal urine production during nonrapid eye movement (non-REM) compared with REM sleep. Whether this decrease was caused by decreased renal blood flow or changes in urine concentration is not known. This prompted us to investigate the relation between fetal urine production rate and electrocortical activity in the near-term ovine fetus. We hypothesized that in the ovine fetus urine production and renal blood flow during REM [comparable to low voltage electrocortical activity (LV ECoG)] would be lower than during non-REM [(high voltage (HV) ECoG)]. In eight fetal sheep between 123 and 127 d of gestation (term 147 d), ECoG, renal blood flow, urine flow, and urine osmolality were measured continuously for 6 h on 2 consecutive days. Data were analyzed into HV ECoG and LV ECoG whereafter urine flow, urine osmolality, and renal blood flow data were averaged per state. We found no significant differences in urine flow, urine osmolality, or renal blood flow between the two behavioral states in the ovine fetus. Because these data are in sharp contrast to those found in the human fetus, we conclude that the observed dissimilarities in renal responses between the human and sheep fetus add to the already known differences in behavioral states between the two species.

TI Does the supine sleeping position have any adverse effects on the child?

SO PEDIATRICS

DT Article
DE sleeping position; infant development; motor development
AB Objective. To assess whether the recommendations that infants sleep supine could have adverse consequences on their motor and mental development.
   Design. A prospective study of infants, delivered before, during, and after the Back to Sleep Campaign in the United Kingdom, followed to 18 months of age,
   Subjects. The children were participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood born to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health districts of Avon, with expected date of delivery from April 1, 1991 to December 31, 1992. Questionnaires were completed on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of age and sets of standardized questions on development at 6 and 18 months.
   Main Outcome Measures. Social, communication, fine and gross motor, and total developmental scales based on the Denver Developmental Screening Test at 6 and 18 months.
   Results. After adjustment for 27 factors using multiple regression, 3 of the 10 scales and subscales significantly distinguished between front and back sleeping position. At 6 months of age, infants put to sleep on their front had a mean score 0.38 SD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.49) higher on the gross motor scale, 0.11 SD (95% CI: 0.00, 0.23) higher in the social skills scale, and a total development score 0.20 SD (95% CI: 0.10, 0.30) higher than those on their backs. These differences were no longer apparent at 18 months.
   Conclusions. There is some evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in a reduced developmental score at 6 months of age, but this disadvantage appears to be transient. Weighing this against the adverse health effects demonstrated with the prone sleeping position, these results should not change the message of the Back to Sleep Campaign.

ID ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; SURROGATE DATA; SLEEP
AB The fetal sheep brain develops cyclic electrocortical activity from approximately 0.8 gestation alternating between NREM and REM sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate developmental changes of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) after the occurrence of cyclic electrocortical activity as a measure of functional brain maturation. We used nonlinear analysis because it has been recognized superior to linear analysis for describing the complex properties of the ECoG. We developed a nonlinear algorithm which calculates a mean prediction error (RIPE) of the time series in the phase space. The ECoG of six chronically instrumented fetal sheep was recorded in utero at 124, 127, 131 and 135 day gestational age (dGA, term 146 dGA). The MPE of the ECoG was calculated for each animal at each investigated dGA from five 10 min epochs of REM and five 6 min epochs of NREM sleep. The MPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM sleep (p<0.05). With gestational age, the MPE of REM sleep increased and that of NREM sleep decreased significantly (p<0.05). These results suggest a further functional differentiation of both sleep states after transition to cyclic ECoG activity.

AB Dyspnea is so common during pregnancy that it is often referred to as "physiologic" dyspnea, Generally this dyspnea occurs with exercise rather than at rest, but it is not a cause of significant exercise limitation. Although the mechanical impediment of the gravid uterus is often blamed, hyperventilation due to increased progesterone levels probably is the most important mechanism. It is essential to distinguish this physiologic dyspnea from breathlessness caused by disorders complicating pregnancy or diseases that may coexist with pregnancy.
   Sleep-disordered breathing is a much less studied phenomenon. Obstructive sleep apnea probably occurs in 1.5 to 2% of the population of child-bearing age, Only few data are available suggesting that pregnancy may cause or exacerbate this disorder, and most cases may simply represent the coexistence of two common conditions. Pregnancy does not appear to cause central sleep apnea, Since hypoxemia can cause intrauterine growth retardation and adverse fetal outcome, sleep-disordered breathing should be treated when of significant degree.

AB To test for the presence in utero of diurnal periodicity in the amount of time spent in organized behavioral states, seven records of 24-hour duration were obtained from each of five chronically instrumented fetal baboons between 144 and 158 days gestation (term=175 days). Concordance of fetal breathing activity, heart-period variability, and electroencephalographic parameters were used to define two distinctive patterns of fetal physiological activities. One pattern was characterized as EEG activity dominated by trace alternant, reduced heart-period variability, and fewer breaths in epochs of fetal breathing. This fetal behavioral state (1FB) is analogous to quiet sleep in infants. A second pattern was characterized by the relative absence of trace alternant, increased heart-period variability, and fetal breathing activity. This fetal behavioral state (2FB) is analogous to active sleep. Cycles of these states were present 29% of time, with a duration of approximately 26 minutes and a 1.7:1 predominance of 2FB/1FB. Cosinor analysis across fetuses revealed a significant (p<.01) 24-hour periodicity of the time spent by the fetus in organized behavioral states, with a peak around 1400 (lights-on 0700 to 1900) and a peak-nadir fluctuation of 15%. These periodicities in the incidence of organized state were significant (p<.01) in three fetuses, and approached significance (<.09) in the two others. Data demonstrate a diurnal rhythmicity in fetal behavioral states, with less time spent in organized state at night than during the day.

Plasma samples assayed were taken from male and female cats of 8, 12, 17, 20, 26, 29, 40 and >52 weeks of age, from adult non-pregnant queens, and from queens in the ninth weeks of pregnancy and in the second and fifth week of lactation. Plasma aldosterone concentration was also measured in samples taken four times over a 24 h period (06:00-06:30, 11:00-11:30, 17:00-17:30 and 23:00-23:30) in a group of seven adult male cats. Neither age nor sex had a significant effect on the plasma aldosterone concentration. Also, queens had similar aldosterone concentrations in plasma whether they were non-pregnant, pregnant, or lactating. No circadian rhythm was observed in plasma aldosterone concentrations in adult male cats. The plasma aldosterone concentrations of 148 cats (87 males and 61 females, ranging in ages from 8 to >52 weeks) had a positive skew distribution with a median of 161 pmol l(-1). The upper value for plasma aldosterone concentration in healthy domestic cats as defined by the 95 percentile was 700 pmol l(-1).

AB Substance abuse in women of childbearing age is a global public health problem, The most common drugs of abuse are cocaine, diamorphine (heroin) and alcohol, Fetal drug exposure can be identified by maternal history (which is not always reliable). maternal and infant urine toxicology screening, and meconium and infant and maternal hair analysis.
   The opioids most commonly associated with withdrawal in neonates are diamorphine, morphine and methadone, Neonatal withdrawal or abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurs in 50 to 80% of infants exposed to opioids in utero, usually within the first 24 to 72 hours after birth. Only 5 to 20% of these infants will have severe symptoms and need pharmacotherapy.
   Signs of withdrawal include effects arising from the central nervous, vasomotor, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, The most serious problems are vomiting and diarrhoea resulting in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, bodyweight loss, aspiration pneumonia. respiratory alkalosis from tachypnoea, and seizures. There are a number of scales that can be used for assessing the need for pharmacotherapy in NAS, The goal of treatment is for the infant to be comfortable and able to sleep between feeds without bring deeply sedated.
   pharmacological agents used for treating opioid NAS include both opioid and non-opioid drugs. The most commonly used drugs are paregoric. diluted tincture of opium, and phenobarbital (phenobarbitone). Paregoric, a solution of opium alkaloids - morphine and codeine (analgesics), narcotine and papaverine (antispasmodics) - is used in doses of 3 to 6 drops every 4 to 6 hours, Tincture of opium alkaloids, for use in the neonate, must be reconstituted (25-fold dilution) by the hospital pharmacy to a concentration of 0.4% to reduce the content of morphine to that in paregoric (0.4 mg/ml). This avoids the adverse effects associated with the presence of other ingredients in paregoric. Phenobarbital is an analgesic and anticonvulsant. It has a prolonged half-life and is especially useful in reducing the hyperactive behaviour associated with NAS. It is important to closely monitor the efficacy of therapy by assessing patient response through the use of objective measures.
   The psychosocial aspects of drug abuse are important to keep in mind, as the infant continues to be at high risk for neglect, abuse and foster care placement.

AB Melatonin is the mammalian fetus's window to periodicity of the outside world. Through melatonin, the fetus ''knows'' what time of year it is and, in all likelihood, also knows the time of day. The best known function of melatonin during development is to communicate information about photoperiod and thereby adaptively regulate reproductive development. A second likely function of melatonin during development, which may be related to but more widespread than the first, is to entrain the developing circadian pacemaker. Prenatal maternal entrainment occurs in all of the eutherian mammals in which it has been examined, and in Syrian hamsters exogenous melatonin during development causes entrainment. The broader distribution and greater abundance of melatonin receptors during development, relative to mature animals, suggests that developmental effects of melatonin are greater and more diverse. The human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus expresses melatonin binding sites and is therefore Likely to be affected by both endogenous and exogenous melatonin with consequences for the prenatal and postnatal expression and entrainment of circadian rhythms. Caution is warranted, not only concerning the use of exogenous melatonin during pregnancy and lactation but also concerning behavior that might disrupt the mother's endogenous melatonin rhythm.

AB Objective: to identify key predictive variables of functional status after childbirth,
   Design: an investigative survey design,
   Setting: primary health care maternal child health centres in one large city in Victoria, Australia
   Participants: 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population, All were aged 20 to 35 years, had experienced normal pregnancies, labours, deliveries and delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation,
   Measures and findings: the Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett Tulman & Myers 1988) was used as the main outcome measure, Three variables predictive of functional states after childbirth were identified, namely, satisfaction with level of stamina and well-being, sleep pattern at night and perceived lack of support following childbirth,
   Key conclusions: return to full functional status as measured by IFSAC takes longer than physiological recovery after childbirth, Women who experience diminished well-being, interrupted sleep patterns and lacked support, appeared to be at greater risk of role congestion, overload and dysfunction,
   Implications for practice: to help women avoid the additive nature of assuming the motherhood role while also resuming past role responsibilities, practitioners could encourage pregnant women to develop a postnatal support plan, Women need to be proactive in negotiating specific and ongoing support from others with household responsibilities and some aspects of baby care.

AB Several recent trends in the vital statistics of the United States continued in 1996, including an increase in life expectancy and declines in infant mortality, births to teenage mothers, age-adjusted death rates, and death rates for children and adolescents.
   In 1996, there were an estimated 3914953 births in the United States. The preliminary birth rate remained unchanged at 14.8 births per 1000 population, and the fertility rate, births per 1000 women 15 to 44 years of age, was essentially the same at 65.7. Fertility rates rose slightly for most racial and ethnic groups except black women, for whom the rate hit a historic low of 70.8. Overall, fertility remains particularly high for Hispanic women, although there is considerable variation within this heterogenous group. For the fifth consecutive year, birth rates dropped for teenagers. Birth rates for women greater than or equal to 30 years of age continued to increase. The birth rate for unmarried women declined 1% in 1996 to 44.6 births per 1000 unmarried women, continuing the decline noted in 1995 for the first time in 2 decades.
   The percentage of women who began prenatal care in the first trimester rose in 1996 to 81.8%, whereas the percentage with late (third trimester) or no care dropped to 4.1%. The rise in timely prenatal care was greatest for black and Hispanic women.
   The percentage of low birth weight (LBW) infants reached 7.4% in 1996, its highest level since 1975. The very low birth weight rate remained unchanged at 1.4%. The rise in LBW occurred primarily among white women, whereas the LBW rate for black women dropped to 13.0%, the lowest rate reported since 1987. The rise among white women is only partially a result of increases in multiple births, because LBW rates have also risen among white singleton births. The multiple birth ratio rose again in 1996 by 2%, as it has since 1980. The rise was particularly large for higher-order multiple births.
   Infant mortality reached an all time low level of 7.2 deaths per 1000 births, based on preliminary 1996 data. Neonatal and postneonatal rates declined, as did rates for both black and white infants. National birth weight specific mortality rates are reported here for the first time. In 1995, 63% of infant deaths occurred to the 7.3% of the population that was born LBW. The four leading cause of infant death were congenital anomalies, disorders relating to short gestation and unspecified birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, and respiratory distress syndrome, accounting for more than half of infant deaths in 1996. Despite the declines in infant mortality, the United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality.
   Expectation of life at birth reached a new high in 1996 of 76.1 years for all gender and race groups combined. Age-adjusted mortality rates declined in 1996 for diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, accidents and adverse effects, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and suicide. They rose, as in the past several years, for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus, and pneumonia and influenza. For the first time since human immunodeficiency virus infection was created as a special cause-of-death category in 1987, death rates for human immunodeficiency virus infection declined from 15.6 in 1995 to 11.6 in 1996. The homicide rate also declined, as it has since 1991.
   Death rates for children between 1 and 19 years of age declined in 1996, with an estimated 29183 deaths to children. Unintentional injury mortality has dropped by similar to 50% among children and adolescents since 1979, although it remains the leading cause of death for all age groups of children from 1 to 19 years. Homicide was the fourth leading cause of death for children 1 to 4 and 5 to 9 years of age, the third leading cause for children 10 to 14, and the second leading cause for 15 to 19 year olds.

AB Although a relationship between reproductive factors and breast cancer risk has been known for long, there are many contradictions between different studies, and a connection with a biological mechanism has not yet been found. Recently, new details have been revealed about different effects of pregnancy on breast cancer risk. During pregnancy breast cancer risk is strongly reduced, while inversely,some years after giving birth the risk is increased. Furthermore, risk is strongly reduced in women whose consecutive births of four or more children occur after short intervals and are terminated before the age of 30. Recently, we have postulated rhythmicity in the occurrence of breast cancer in a subgroup of young women. By analogy with circadian rhythms it may be assumed that circannual rhythms too are influenced by synchronizers and masking effects. In circadian rhythms masking may be by external or internal periodic factors, such as the sleep/wake cycle, meal timing and activity. Over the year pregnancy may be such a periodic factor, with alternation of an empty uterus and one wich gradually enlarges as a consequence of a developing fetus. A masking factor is active only as long as present. Therefore the circannual rhythmicity of breast cancer is attenuated or nullified only during pregnancy. After giving birth, the temporal deficit of the rhythmic increase of tumor growth may be restored, leading to a rebound effect expressed as an increased clinical detection of malignancy some years later. When several consecutive pregnancies occur after short intervals the masking effect continues uninterruptedly, accompanied by a strong reduced breast cancer risk. The same biological mechanism may underly the remission during pregnancy in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease. The immune system, crucial in autoimmune disorders, is build up of several constituents which are clearly rhythmic, e.g the lymphocytes. Masking of one or more of these rhythmicities may lead to disease attenuation, followed by relapses as soon as the masking factor has been eliminated.

ID FOOD; HEALTH
AB Objective: This study assesses intrahousehold allocation of energy in rural Bangladesh and tests the hypothesis that, when daily energy intake is adjusted for energy expenditure, no age or gender bias will be apparent in intrahousehold energy allocation.
   Design: Data were collected at two-month intervals over a one year study.
   Setting: Four villages in Matlab Thana, rural Bangladesh.
   Subjects: Two hundred and seven children up to 5 y of age and their 145 mothers and 123 fathers.
   Interventions: Data included six measurements of observed 24 h dietary energy intake and physical activity recorded from waking to sleeping. Total daily energy expenditure was derived using the factorial method.
   Results: Women's energy intake ranged from 75-88% of the FAO/WHO recommended energy intake over the six periods of data collection, significantly less (P < 0.0001) than the men's (range 89-114%). Although the women had moderate levels of physical activity, frequent pregnancies and long lactation periods increased their energy needs. Among children no longer breast fed, energy consumption, unadjusted for energy expenditure, provided 86-108% of the FAO/WHO recommended energy intake by weight.
   Conclusions: Women consistently received less of their energy requirements than either their children or their husbands.

AB Objectives. To identify the risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SID
   Methods. For 2 years (October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1993) data were collected by community child health nurses on all infants born in New Zealand at initial contact and at 2 months.
   Results. There were 232 SIDS cases in the postneonatal age group (2.0/1000 live births) and these were compared with 1200 randomly selected control subjects. Information was available for 127 cases (54.7%) and 922 (76.8%) of controls.
   The previously identified modifiable risk factors were examined. The prevalence of prone sleeping position of the infant was very low (0.7% at initial contact and 3.0% at 2 months), but was still associated with an increased risk of SIDS. In addition, the side sleeping position was also found to have an increased risk of SIDS compared with the supine sleeping position (at 2 months: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 6.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71, 25.23). Maternal smoking was found to be the major risk factor for SIDS. Bed sharing was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS. There was an interaction between maternal smoking and bed sharing on the risk of SIDS. Compared with infants not exposed to either bed sharing or maternal smoking, the adjusted OR for infants of mothers who smoked was 5.01 (95% CI = 2.01, 12.46) for bed sharing at the initial contact and 5.02 (95% CI = 1.05, 24.05) for bed sharing at 2 months. In this study breastfeeding was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of SIDS.
   The other risk factors for SIDS identified were: unmarried mother, leaving school at a younger age, young mother, greater number. of previous pregnancies, late attendance for antenatal care, smoking in pregnancy, male infant, Maori ethnicity, low birth weight, and shorter gestation.
   Conclusions. After adjustment for potential confounders, prone and side sleeping positions, maternal smoking, and the joint exposure to bed sharing and maternal smoking were associated with statistically significant increased risk of SIDS. A change from the side to the supine sleeping position could result in a substantial reduction in SIDS. Maternal smoking is common in New Zealand and with the reduction in the prevalence of prone sleeping position is now the major risk factor in this country. However, smoking behavior has been difficult to change. Bed sharing is also a major factor but appears only to be a risk to infants of mothers who smoke. Addressing bed sharing among mothers who smoke could reduce SIDS by at least one third. Breastfeeding did not appear to offer a statistically significant reduction in SIDS risk after adjustment of potential confounders, but as breastfeeding rates are comparatively good in New Zealand, this result should be interpreted with caution as the power of this study to detect a benefit is small.

AB We performed a questionnaire survey about 42 patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 who were currently alive. Information was obtained on their age, sex, birth weight, gestation, parental consanguinity, other family members affected, age of onset of jaundice, neonatal and postneonatal bilirubin values, neonatal and postneonatal therapy, problems faced with phototherapy, liver transplantation, current growth status, current neurologic status, and the status of hearing. Patients were between 2 months and 21 years of age. There were 18 males and 24 females. Thirty-nine patients had been born at full term gestation and 3 had been preterm. Jaundice was noted on postnatal day 1 in 34%, between days 2 and 4 in 55%, and after day 11 of life in 11% of patients. In the neonatal period bilirubin values (mean +/- SD) were typically 19.8 +/- 4.5 mg/dL. Eighty-six percent of patients had neonatal peak bilirubin values of >20 mg/dL. Parental consanguinity was present in 44% and a history of Gilbert's disease in one parent was present in 10% of patients. Causes of exacerbations of jaundice reported were respiratory infections, febrile illnesses, vaccinations, fasting, surgery, emotional stress, and noncompliance with treatment. Neonatal therapy consisted of exchange transfusion in 28%, phototherapy in 79%, phenobarbitone in 20%, and cholestyramine, albumin, infusions, and plasmapheresis in one case each. The mainstay of postneonatal therapy was home phototherapy for 10 to 16 hours, primarily at night during sleep, using blue lights or a combination of blue and fluorescent lights. Some patients used innovatively designed phototherapy units. Problems reported with phototherapy were decreased effectiveness with age, poor compliance, restriction of activity and play, inability to travel or take vacations, irritation from eye shades, difficulty keeping eye protection on, difficulties in temperature maintenance, tanning of the skin, embarrassment from the need to be nearly nude during phototherapy, and difficulty in procuring phototherapy lamps. Other therapies that had been tried included oral agar, albumin infusions, antioxidants, acupuncture, bilirubin oxidase, calcium infusions, clofibrate, cruciferous vegetables, cholestyramine, chlorpromazine, flumecinol, plasmapheresis, tin mesoporphyrin, ursodeoxycholic acid, and urinary alkalinization. Fifteen children had undergone liver transplantation (5 auxiliary and 10 orthotopic). All 42 patients are reportedly of normal height and weight. Neurodevelopmental status is said to be normal in 77% of patients. Two patients have kernicterus, 4 have cerebellar symptoms, and 1 each has developmental delay, mild intention tremor, and mild speech delay. Hearing was reported to be normal in 94% of patients. The 2 children with hearing loss have conductive loss from otitis media. With home phototherapy prolonged, survival free of neurologic deficits is possible in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, but there are many problems associated with phototherapy. Avoiding exacerbations of jaundice is an important aspect of management Liver transplantation offers the prospect of cure but its risk versus benefit ratio is undetermined. Hearing loss was absent in the patients surveyed despite prolonged exposure to high bilirubin levels, which suggests that bilirubin may not be as ototoxic as is commonly believed.

AB Studies in rodents suggest the presence of a dopaminergic system that influences the function of a biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). To provide insights into mechanisms of dopamine action in the SCN, we studied transgenic mice that had either one allele (+\-) or both alleles (-/-) of the D1 dopamine receptor gene deleted, along with normal (+/+) littermates. As expected, receptor labelling autoradiography studies using [I-125] SCH 23982 showed a complete absence of D1 dopamine receptor binding sites in the SCN of -/- animals. When pregnant mice from +\- X +\- matings were injected with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393, or the dopamine reuptake blocker GBR 12909 at day 19 of gestation, c-fos mRNA expression was observed in the SCN of +/+ fetuses. In contrast, c-fos mRNA induction was not seen in -/- or +\- litter mates. Injection of cocaine into pregnant dams also resulted in robust SCN c-fos mRNA expression in +/+ mice. Increases in SCN c-fos mRNA expression were also seen in +\- and -/- mice suggesting that cocaine action in the SCN involves both D1 receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Collectively, our studies of transgenic mice deficient in D1 receptors support the presence of a functional dopaminergic system in the fetal SCN. We also identify D1 receptors as the prominent transducer of dopamine action in the fetal SCN. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Objective. Prone sleeping is a strong risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We investigated whether the combined effect of prone sleeping position and prenatal risk factors further increased the SIDS risk.
   Methods. In the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study, parents of SIDS victims in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden completed a questionnaire on potential risk factors for SIDS. Forensic pathologists verified the SIDS diagnosis. Four controls of the same gender, age, and place of birth were selected. This matched case-control study, which included 244 SIDS cases and 869 controls from 1992 to 1995, was analyzed by conditional logistic regression.
   Results. Odds ratios (ORs) for prone and side sleeping compared with supine sleeping for the last sleep were 13.9 (95% confidence interval 8.2-24) and 3.5 (2.1-5.7). Infants 13 to 24 weeks old had particularly high risk in prone and side sleeping, at 28.5 (7.9-107) and 5.9 (1.6-22). OR for prone sleeping was higher in girls, at 30.4 (11-88), than in boys, 10.3 (5.5-19). We found strong combined effects of sleeping position and prenatal risk factors (more than multiplicative). The OR for prone and side sleeping was increased for infants with birth weight <2500 g, at 83 (25-276) and 36.6 (13-107); for preterm infants, at 48.8 (19-128) and 40.5 (14-115); and for intrauterine growth retarded, at 38.8 (14-108) and 9.6 (4.3-22), compared with supine position in infants without these prenatal factors. The combined effect of nonsupine positions and intrauterine growth retarded was highest among 13- to 24-week-old infants. Effects of combined presence of nonsupine sleeping positions and each of the factors of smoking in pregnancy, young maternal age, higher parity, low level of maternal education, and single motherhood were more than additive. Attributable fractions in the population for prone and side sleeping were 18.5% and 26.0%.
   Conclusions. Both prone and side sleeping increased the risk of SIDS. The risk was increased further in low birth weight infants, preterm infants, and infants at the age of 13 to 24 weeks, suggesting that SIDS may be triggered by nonsupine sleeping in infants with prenatal risk factors during a vulnerable period of postnatal development.

AB Two studies were conducted to assess the potential long-term effects of prenatal stress on the cytokine-related inflammatory response in juvenile rhesus monkeys. Subjects were derived from two different pregnancy conditions. Study 1 involved endocrine activation of the pregnant female by daily adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) injection across a 2-week period (days 120-133 post-conception). Pregnant females in Study 2 experienced a psychological stressor, 10 minutes per day, for a 6-week period (days 106-147 post-conception). When the offspring from these pregnancies were 1.5-2 years of age, they were administered recombinant human interleubin-1 beta (rhIL-1 beta) to stimulate the release of endogenous cytokines, elicit fever, and activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured, as well as cortisol levels and body temperature. The prenatal ACTH treatment altered the postnatal response to IL-1 beta in juvenile offspring. These monkeys showed a significantly blunted response to the IL-1 beta, with smaller increments in blood and CSF levels of IL-6 and diminished temperature responses to the IL-1 beta. In contrast, the prenatal psychological stressor was not as potent and did not have lasting effects on this physiological response in juvenile monkeys. IL-1 beta also induced significant increases in cortisol secretion, but this adrenal response was comparable in all monkeys. These data suggest that differences in the prenatal environment could have a selective effect on cytokine physiology accounting for individual differences in the inflammatory response.

AB With the aim to describe the circadian pattern of noninvasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 759 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 71 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 28 with gestational hypertension, and 14 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group (complicated versus uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. A highly statistically circadian pattern is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P < .001 in all cases). Blood pressure decreases from the first trimester to the second and rises again in the third for healthy pregnant women. For women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, blood pressure is stable during the first half of pregnancy and then continuously increases until delivery. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (always P < .001). This study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable circadian variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Those differences are found when both systolic and diastolic blood pressures for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological range of blood pressure variability.

AB A theory is presented that a diet low in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the third trimester of pregnancy may delay myelination and brain maturation. This may underpin learning and behaviour disorders and sudden infant death (SIDS) after the first month, conditions that are associated with lower than average birthweight. Epidemiological evidence is reviewed showing an inverse relation between the proportion of heavy newborns (> 3500 g) and infant mortality rate. Same countries with a lower proportion of heavy newborns despite equally high standards of living and medical care have higher post-neonatal death rates. The higher rates are solely due to SIDS which has a peak mortality within 80-100 days. It is hypothesised that as this is a time when myelination peaks, SIDS may be due to maturational delay. Evidence of subtle CNS changes in brainstem structures and in the neuromuscular system supports an instability in brainstem control systems. Moderate iatrogenic dietary restriction predominates today, but a rising number of women favour a low-caloric low-fat diet especially in the third trimester when the foetus is most susceptible. This may lead to a depressed birthweight, delayed somatic growth and neuronal maturation, such as is observed in SIDS victims. The majority exposed to suboptimal conditions survive, but a few suffer SIDS, confirming post-neonatal susceptibility. Many, especially males, present minor CNS signs and learning/behaviour disorders that could be the sequelae of repeated hypoxic episodes, such as recorded in more than 80% of SIDS victims. To reduce learning/behaviour disorders and prevent death from SIDS after the first month, it is necessary to ensure optimal development by promoting foetal growth. It is advised to avoid unnecessary dieting and to favour a diet high in PUFAs, thus prolonging pregnancy and so increasing birthweight. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Objective: To compare the sleep patterns, mood states, and cognitive functioning of primiparous mothers during the first 3 weeks postpartum with those of a control group of nonpostpartum women and to assess the relationships among these variables.
   Methods: For the first 3 weeks postpartum, 30 primiparous women and 28 nonpostpartum mothers completed daily assessments of mood and recorded multiple aspects of sleep including time of retiring, occurrence and duration of sleep interruption, time of awakening, and morning alertness. Objective measures of memory, attention/concentration, and psychomotor performance were obtained on three occasions.
   Results: Postpartum women reported more evening awakenings, more time awake after retiring, and more naps than controls, but overall sleep time was similar. New mothers experienced a higher level of dysphoric mood during the first week than nonpostpartum controls; however, controlling for the effect of ''time awake'' at night eliminated the significant effect for dysphoric mood. Few differences were observed on the multiple assessments of cognitive function; however, performances of new mothers on memory and psychomotor tasks were likely to be influenced by sleep loss.
   Conclusions: Women must make important adjustments in their sleep patterns during the postpartum period. In the study group, these adjustments were largely successful, particularly after the first week postpartum, in avoiding the negative consequences of sleep disturbances such as dysphoric mood and impaired cognitive function. Nevertheless, the significant associations between sleep indices and mood and objective measures of cognitive function point to the importance of encouraging appropriate amounts of sleep for recently delivered women.

AB Women with (n=27) a history of late pregnancy loss(greater than or equal to 20 weeks) due to congenital anomalies who had completed the subsequent pregnancy with a live-birth were compared with a group of mothers with newborns without such a history (n=29) at 4 and 16 weeks post-partum. The following aspects were assessed: depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and mother-infant adaptation. The women with a previous pregnancy loss showed significantly more negative emotions than the women without such a history. In addition, they considered that their healthy baby experienced more problems with sleeping, crying, eating, and acquiring a regular pattern of this behaviour than the average baby. They also perceived their baby as being less ideal than the women without a previous pregnancy loss. These problems were particularly present 4 weeks post-partum and were significantly positively related to trait anxiety. The implications of this study are that in women with a history of late pregnancy loss, family physicians and welfare officers should be made aware of possible problems in the mother and in mother-infant adaptation shortly after a normal live-birth, particularly in those with high trail anxiety. They will then be able to arrange psychological support at an early stage. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The last decade has seen increased interest in the role of hormones, including oestrogens, not only in regulating growth, sexual development and reproduction but in maintaining a sense of psychological well-being, Episodes of change in oestrogen levels, whether increasing or decreasing, are high-risk periods for the emergence of psychological symptoms in some women, This may be due to a 'kindling effect' for women with previous psychological disturbance, an effect on circadian rhythm activity and therefore altered neurovegetative functions, or an effect on central rhythmic functioning between the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex, all mediated by effects on neurotransmitter systems, Data supporting these hypotheses come from animal studies as well as converging research in several areas including the study of psychological side-effects of oral contraceptives, the study of mood and cognitive disturbances related to the menstrual cycle, the studies of states of hormonal change such as pregnancy and the menopause and, of course, studies of women with psychiatric disorders such as major depression, seasonal affective disorder and dementia, Improvement in such symptoms via hormonal therapies or other interventions will probably lead to better quality of life for women and may actually impede the deterioration associated with ageing and certain medical illnesses, Current data support a relationship between oestrogen and psychological well-being.

AB After national intervention campaigns, considerable declines in incidence for both sudden infant death (SID) and prone position have been observed worldwide. In the following investigation, German data on postinterventional risk factor patterns are presented for the first time. We analysed data from a 2-year population-based case-control study on SID carried out in two German districts between 1993 and 1994. We confirmed Complete covering of the baby (OR = 44.9, 95%-CI 95, 291), prone sleeping position (OR = 11.7; 5.3, 26.2), heavy maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 8.5; 3.2, 33.2 for > ten cigarettes per day), non-breastfeeding(OR = 7.7; 2.7, 22.3) and missing maternal professional training (OR = 7.6; 3.6, 16.2) as risk factors for cot death. After adjustment for other major risk factors in a logistic regression model, sleeping on cushions lost statistical significance, whereas all other major risk factors remained relevant.
   Conclusions Despite intervention campaigns, complete covering of the baby, prone position and heavy maternal smoking are still major risk factors for cot death. Except for sleeping on cushions, all major epidemiological risk factors for cot death act independantly. Despite encouraging success in the reduction of risk factors for cot death, there is still substantial need for future endeavours towards a further reduction of modifiable risk factors for SID.

AB We studied 142 preterm infants (mean gestation 31 weeks, mean birthweight 1364 g) fed prospectively varied protein and energy intakes. Infants were grouped as either slow or rapid growers based on rate of weight gain. Rapid growers had increased heart rates (166 vs 160 beats/min), respiratory rates (55.7 vs 53.9 bpm), energy expenditure (64.8 vs 61.6 kcal kg(-1) day(-1)), urinary C-peptide levels (1.59 vs 0.79 ng ml(-1)) and time in active sleep (78.0 vs 75.2%), and decreased spectral edge frequency in the electroencephalogram (2.96 vs 4.45 Hz) compared to slow growers. We conclude that preterm infants growing at varying rates manifest physiological and behavioral differences, and that these patterns may reflect altered autonomic balance.

AB Postnatal depression is a common disease and its consequences are far-reaching and sometimes tragic. The first part of this paper offers an overview of this syndrome and its multiple facets, based on a case report and an extensive review of the literature. The various treatments are referred to, including the most recent advances in research, and the usefulness of a preventive strategy is endorsed. In the second part, the specificity of the diagnosis concept of post-partum depression is considered. The differences compared to major depression according to DSM-IV are pointed out and discussed. The discussion also covers electroencephalographic sleep, and particulary the possibility of a paradoxical Stage IV time increase during postnatal depression. If the reality of the diagnosis' specificity cannot be affirmed yet, evidence is constanly accumulating.

   Results Pregnancy was associated with a lower standard deviation of R-R intervals (P < 0.01), with reduced very low (P < 0.05), low (P < 0.01), and high frequency (P < 0.05) power spectral components of heart rate variability. The high frequency power was lower at night in pregnancy, but similar in the daytime in pregnant and nonpregnant women.
   Conclusions Pregnancy is associated with an overall reduction in heart rate variability, most markedly reflected in the low frequency component. This suggests altered baroreflex or sympathetic modulation of heart rate, and decreased vagal activation at night.

DE diagnostic specificity; EEG; postnatal depression; sleep
ID ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SLEEP; WOMEN
AB BACKGROUND. Numerous studies have been published on postnatal depression (PND) over the last 10 years. A controversy has arisen regarding the specificity of the diagnostic concept. It is based on 2 points : the hormonal environment and the course and recurrence of PND. EEG Sleep studies are also numerous, but this paper presents the first study on EEG sleep profile during PND. METHODS. 24 women suffering from major depression according to RDC were placed in 3 groups : 1) Group A (n = 8) : PND; 2) Group B (n = 8) : depression with a past history of PND,3) Group C (n = 8) : depression without a past history of PND. Women were agematched and according to the Hamilton 24 item severity score. Group A patients were delivered within less that 6 months, groups B and C within a minimum of 3 years. None were pregnant or alcoholic, and none were physically ill. RESULTS. There was no difference between groups B and C. Group A was characterised by a significantly longer stage IV sleep. There was also a strong tendency to a shorter stage I sleep and a better quality of sleep (total sleep time and number of awakenings) during PND. DISCUSSION. Our study shows that, even if similar to major depression, specific polysomnographic alteration can be found during post-partum depression. This finding is relevant to the hypothesis of PND's diagnostic specificity. The perfect similarity between groups B and C strengthens this evidence. Nevertheless the significance of SWS alterations ape difficult to explain and additional studies are required. CONCLUSION. The EEG Sleep profile during PND differs from major depression of the same severity. This appears to favour the specificity of the diagnostic concept.

DT Article
DE membranes; fetus; arginine vasopressin; amniotic fluid volume;

ID FETAL LAMB; SHEEP; FLUID; RESPONSES; VOLUME; FETUS
AB OBJECTIVES:. To determine whether physiological increases in fetal plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentration alter blood flow rates to the ovine chorion, amnion or placenta, and to determine whether these AVP-induced changes in flow are dependent on gestational age.
   METHODS: Colored microspheres (15.10 +/- 0.02 mu m (standard deviation)) were infused into the superior vena cava before and at 30, 75, and 125 minutes of an intravenous AVP infusion (3 ng/min/kg) in 9 chronically catheterized fetal sleep between 103 to 141 days gestation (term = 147 days). Chorion, amnion, and placental cotyledons were removed, and microspheres were counted to determine blood flow rates.
   RESULTS: Fetal arterial pressure (FAP) increased (analysis of variance, P < .0001) and heart rate (FHR) decreased (P < .0001) during the infusion, with responses greater in older (> 125 days) compared to younger (< 125 days) fetuses (P < .001). Chorionic blood flow rate increased by 19 +/- 7% at 30 min of the AVP infusion, and declined by 18 +/- 6% at 75 min, and 32 +/- 5% at 125 min (P < .0001). Similarly, fetal placental blood flow rate increased by 20 +/- 7% at 30 min of infusion, and declined, in parallel with chorionic blood flow rates, by 6 +/- 4% at 75 min, and 17 +/- 4% at 125 min (P < .0001). Amniotic blood flow rate did not change significantly during the infusion. The membranous and placental bloodflow rate responses to AVP infusion did not depend upon gestational age.
   CONCLUSIONS: Physiologic increases in plasma AVP concentration induce an early increase in chorionic blood flow followed by a gradual decrease which parallels similar changes in placental blood flow rate. Unlike FAP and FHR, these blood flow changes are not gestational age-dependent. AVP-induced blood flow changes could play an important role in determining abnormalities of amniotic fluid volume observed clinically in some stressed fetuses.

   Design. A prospective study of infants, delivered before, during, and after the Back to Sleep Campaign in the United Kingdom (UK), followed to 6 months of age. The children were part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC).
   Subjects. Singletons born to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health districts of Avon in the period June 1991 to December 1992, and for whom questionnaires were completed on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of age (n = 9777); for these infants 8524 questionnaires were also completed at 6 to 8 months of age.
   Main Outcome Measures. Subjective measures of health, the presence of specific signs and symptoms, duration of sleep at night, and calling the family doctor to the home.
   Results. Of 43 outcomes considered, after adjustment for 12 factors using logistic regression only 2 were associated with raised risk among infants put to sleep on their back (diaper rash and cradle cap). Infants put to sleep prone had increased risk of a number of health outcomes, including cough and possibly pyrexia.
   Conclusions. There is no evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in increased morbidity, although changes in prevalence of rare disorders would not have been identified.

ID DISEASE; HYPOTHESIS; MORTALITY; INFECTION; NETWORKS; SUPPORT; HEALTH;
   STRESS
AB Objective.-To examine the hypothesis that diverse ties to friends, family, work, and community are associated with increased host resistance to infection.
   Design.-After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg, spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a common cold.
   Setting.-Quarantine.
   Participants.-A total of 276 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor pregnant.
   Outcome Measures.-Colds (illness in the presence of a verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount of viral replication.
   Results.-In response to both viruses, those with more types of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus. These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index, education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more) types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence, low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being introverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and incidence of colds.
   Conclusions.-More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.

AB During recent decades much interest has been focused on the possibility of predicting and preventing atopic diseases during pregnancy. The idea of being able to detect a predisposition early and take suitable environmental measures in order to avoid overt allergy is an attractive position. Elevated cord IgE of around 1.0 IU/ml has been proposed as a predictor in western children. However, there remains no information about the effect of maternal lifestyle during pregnancy on these levels. Total IgE levels were therefore determined using Pharmacia CAP system and PRIST, with sensitivities of 0.01 kU/l and 0.25 kU/l, respectively, from serum samples taken from 1138 Japanese pairs of cord blood and pregnant women responding to a questionnaire regarding 17 health practices, intake of 32 food allergens and 5 environmental factors. Of these, 28 (2.5%) pairs of samples were excluded from further analysis because of high contamination of IgA (> 15.4 mg/ml) in cord blood. Median cord blood IgE was 0.286 kU/1 and geometric mean IgE was 66.25 kU/1 in maternal sera using CAP system; there was no significant correlation between maternal log (IgE) and cord blood IgE. Similar results were obtained from PRIST, whose correlation with CAP system was significant (r = 0.884, p < 0.001 for maternal and r = 0.765, p < 0.001 for cord blood). Multiple logistic analysis demonstrated that avoidance of simultaneous exposure to hens' eggs and cow's milk (relative risk = 1.3, p < 0.05) as well as soy beans (relative risk = 2.8, p < 0.01) should be advised to mothers with positive allergic histories and/or high total IgE (> 400 IU/ml), especially in women aged more than 35 years who are pregnant with a male child. However, maintenance of healthy lifestyles, especially taking proper exercise and sleeping, and avoidance of inhalant allergens during late pregnancy may be a more important strategy for the reduction of cord blood IgE levels.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL INVESTIGATION

DT Article
DE heart rate response; human fetus; orienting reflex
ID FETAL; SHEEP
AB Objective: The heart rate (HR) responses to high and low intensity sounds reflect different central nervous system processes. The HR acceleration evoked by high intensity stimuli is part of a defensive reaction to limit sensory intake, and the HR deceleration elicited by low intensity stimuli is a specific physiological correlate of cognitive processing. The fetal defensive reaction to vibroacoustic stimulation has been studied extensively, but little is known regarding the fetal response to low intensity sounds, This study was undertaken to evaluate the HR response to a low intensity speech sound in 58 human fetuses at 36-40 weeks gestation.
   Methods: The fetal cardiac electrical signal was sampled transabdominally at a resolution of 1 ms, and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing. A 30-s speech sound was delivered at an intensity of 83 dB while fetuses were in quiet sleep. For each fetus, the HR response was analyzed in consecutive 10-s periods (P-1, P-2, P-3) using very conservative statistical criteria; HR changes during stimulation were then compared with spontaneous changes in HR in a 10-s control period. The HR response was examined in terms of maternal (abdominal wall thickness, placental location, and amniotic fluid volume) and fetal (gestational age, prestimulus HR and HR variability, and prestimulus respiratory pattern) variables.
   Results: Compared with the control period, a HR deceleration occurred more often (38 (65.5%) versus 11 (19.0%), P < 0.001) and was of greater amplitude (-5.8 +/- 3.2 bpm versus -2.6 +/- 1.0 bpm, P = 0.003) during stimulation period P-1. More fetuses exhibited a HR deceleration in P-1 compared with either P-2 (P = 0.011) or P-3 (P = 0.017), although the frequency of a HR deceleration in these latter two periods was still significantly greater than in the control period (P-2 versus control: P = 0.038; P-3 versus control: P = 0.022). These results were independent of maternal characteristics. However, fetuses with increased prestimulus HR variability exhibited a greater decrease in HR than fetuses with relatively lower base-line variability (r = 0.591, P < 0.001>.
   Conclusions: Approximately two-thirds of low risk human fetuses exhibited a HR deceleration during the first 10 s following the onset of an 83-dB speech sound. The frequency and magnitude of the HR deceleration were independent of maternal factors, raising the possibility that the HR deceleratory response may provide a physiological measure of fetal cognition.

AB Preliminary data have suggested that female infertility due to corpus luteum insufficiency may be caused by subclinical hypothyroidism [exaggerated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation], L-Thyroxine supplementation has been recommended to achieve pregnancies in subclinical hypothyroid women, This controlled study was carried out in order to investigate the biochemical diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism as a possible infertility factor, Five infertile patients (aged 25-36 years) with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 4, stimulated TSH >20 mu U/ml) or primary hypothyroidism (n = 1) and five healthy controls (aged 22-39 years) with normal thyroid function (stimulated TSH <15 mu U/ml), regular cycles and no history of infertility were studied in the early follicular phase, In the pre-study evaluation, eight of 23 volunteers (34.8%) had to be excluded because of subclinical hypothyroidism with stimulated TSH values (TSHs) >15 mu/ml. Cycle function of patients and controls was compared by the method of LH pulse pattern analysis, Therefore blood samples were drawn every 10 min during a 24 h period, Sleep was recorded from midnight to 7 a.m. Repetition of the TRH tests at the end of the 24 h blood sampling period confirmed the difference in stimulated TSH values of the two study groups, Pulse analysis for luteinizing hormone (LH), TSH and prolactin showed no differences between patients and controls for pulse frequency, amplitude, height, length, area under curve (AUC) and the 24 h mean, Even the hypothyroid patient had a normal LH pulse pattern. Additional measurement of melatonin in pooled sera every 30 min gave the well-documented diurnal profiles during day and night for both groups, Patients had significantly higher melatonin values at seven time points during the night, Peaks for LH, TSH, prolactin and cortisol were correlated with the sleep stages wake, rapid eye movement, 1 + 2 and 3 + 4. We concluded that corpus luteum insufficiency in female infertility cannot be explained by subclinical hypothyroidism and thus should not be treated with L-thyroxine for fertility reasons.

AB OBJECTIVES. Parental and maternity leave policies are a popular fringe benefit among childbearing employed women and a benefit employers frequently are required to offer. However, few rigorous evaluations of the effect of maternal leave on maternal health exist.
   METHODS. Using a hybrid of the household and health production theories of Becker and Grossman and a sample of women identified from state vital statistics records, a nonlinear relationship between maternal postpartum health and time off work after childbirth was estimated.
   RESULTS. For women taking more than 12 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on vitality. With more than 15 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on maternal mental health, and with more than 20 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on role function. Subjects' mental health scores were comparable and vitality scores slightly lower than age-and gender-specific norms; 70% of women studied reported role function limitations.
   CONCLUSIONS. Findings suggest employed women experience problems in well-being at approximately seven months postpartum. Variables associated with improved health include: longer maternity leaves, fewer prenatal mental health symptoms, fewer concurrent physical symptoms, more sleep, increased social support, increased job satisfaction, less physical exertion on the job, fewer infant symptoms, and less difficulty arranging child care.

AB The objective was to determine the plasma levels of the triiodothyronine (T-3) and thyroxine (T-4), in six Ideal ewe sheeps during seasonal anoestrus, by radioimmunoassay. The blood samples were collected from the jugular vein catheter over a period of 24 hours, at 2-h intervals (12, 14, 16, IX, 20, 22, 24, OZ, 04, 06, OX, and 10 hours). II was used analysis of variance for data adjustments, and the decomposition of the collected periods in non-orthogonal polynomial. It was observed a crescent linear effect of the T-4 plasma levels, presenting lower level of 49.60+/-11.41 and higher level of 76.99+/-10.0 ng/ml, at fourth and last blood samples collection, respectively. T-3 plasma levels showed a significant cubic response during 24 hours, with the highest value of 0.94+/-0.20 ng/ml at the end of the the study. In conclusion, thyroidal hormones levels were lower in the first blood samples collection, increasing progressively during the night, reaching the highest levels at the morning period.

AB In a discordant anencephalic twin the hypothesis was tested that the fetal brain is necessary for the expression of a diurnal rhythm in fetal heart rate. Fetal heart rate recordings were made over a 24 h period in a discordant anencephalic twin pregnancy and in three normal twin pregnancies. Cosinor analysis was used to assess rhythmicity in fetal heart rate and maternal heart rate or activity. Correlations between maternal and fetal rhythms were calculated. A significant diurnal rhythm was found for the fetuses of the control twins, but in neither of the fetuses of the discordant anencephalic twin pregnancy. The maternal rhythm was 1-2 h in advance of the heart rate rhythms in all fetuses except the anencephalic one, whose heart rate did not show any correlation with the maternal diurnal rhythm. We conclude that the fetal brain contributes to the generation of the diurnal rhythm in fetal heart rate and synchronization of maternal-fetal rhythms. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB During gestation there is likely to be a constantly changing rate of protein synthesis in the brain that may exhibit regional specificity. With the use of the quantitative autoradiographic L-[1-C-14]leucine method for the determination of local rates of leucine incorporation into cerebral protein (lCPS(Leu)), we have sought to characterize this important process. lCPS(Leu) was measured in nine fetal sheep (118-139 days gestational age) and five newborn lambs (1-5 days of age). In other experiments, the fraction of leucine in the precursor pool for protein synthesis in the brain derived from the arterial plasma was determined to be 0.57 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SE) in one fetus and two lambs. This value was used in the calculation of lCPS(Leu) in 35 regions of the central nervous system, pineal body, and whole brain. Regardless of age, lCPS(Leu) was highest in the pineal body, brain stem, and hypothalamic nuclei and lowest in white matter. In sensorimotor cortex, corona radiata, pyramidal tracts, and whole brain, lCPS(Leu) was positively correlated with prenatal age (P less than or equal to 0.05). These increases in lCPS(Leu) probably reflect myelination in the cerebrum, which is known to occur in late gestation.

AB Pregnant Syrian hamsters with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) received single injections of melatonin or the D1-dopamine receptor agonist, SKF 38393 on day 15 of gestation (1 day before birth). Pups were weaned on postnatal day 20 and their freerunning activity rhythms recorded for 3-4 weeks. The pups' phases on the day of weaning were significantly clustered in both of the treatment groups, but the average phases differed by approximately 180 degrees. The results demonstrate that a single prenatal stimulus is sufficient to set the phases of the hamsters' rhythms and that the phase established depends on the stimulus. Both c-fos mRNA and Fos protein were expressed in the fetal SCN after SKF 38393 injection but neither were expressed after melatonin injection. Simulations showed that a single stimulus could produce the observed synchrony from a population of uniformally distributed phases if the phase shifts were three to four times the magnitude of the adult hamster light phase response curve (PRC). A light pulse PRC mimicked the effect of an SKF 38393 injection and a dark-pulse PRC mimicked the effects of a melatonin injection. Together these results suggest that dopamine and melatonin either are, or mimic, maternal entraining signals that represent day and night.

AB Children of substance abuse mothers have an increased risk of severe pathological disorders such as perinatal diseases (prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, infections) with their neurological and respiratory complications and sequelae, and transmission of drug addiction related infections, ie human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, syphilis. Many of these children present a drug withdrawal syndrome characterized by restlessness and jetteriness during the neonatal period. This is frequently followed by a post withdrawal period of several weeks duration with crying, excitement, sleep and feeding difficulties. Although these drug withdrawal manifestations have no incidence on the vital prognosis, it severely impairs the mother-infant interaction. Despite these disorders it appears that the outcome of these children is mainly related to their familial environment which is exposed to many risk factors: mother-child separation, violence, delinquency, precariousness, unhealthy housing, prostitution, drug dependency, parental death or imprisonment... Early medico-psycho-social intervention starting during pregnancy and a prolonged support for several years are the only way to improve their spontaneously poor outcome.

SO BIRTH-ISSUES IN PERINATAL CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; POSTPARTUM; WOMEN
AB Background: Although both expectant mothers and expectant fathers complain of fatigue during the last trimester of pregnancy, studies have focused exclusively on mothers. This pilot study examined parents' levels of morning or everting fatigue, number of uninterrupted sleep periods and length of sleep during the last trimester of pregnancy; and the relationship of sleep to parents' reports of fatigue. Methods: Data were collected from 24 midwestern, nulliparous couples, who completed the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue each morning and each evening on 4 consecutive days during the last trimester. Concurrently, the couples recorded sleep and wake periods in an activity diary Results: Expectant mothers but not expectant fathers reported increasing levels of fatigue, especially morning fatigue, as the pregnancy progressed. Expectant fathers did mothers did not differ either in the night-time mean number of minutes of sleep obtained, or in the mean number of night-time uninterrupted 90-minute sleep cycles obtained. Fatigue and sleep were not significantly related for either mothers or fathers. Conclusions: These findings support the multidimensional nature of fatigue and indicate a need for perinatal health caregivers to develop individualized interventions for mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. Fathers should also participate in future research of factors influencing the prenatal and postpartum experience.

AB Objective To assess the role of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement in the mid-second trimester as a predictive test for the development of hypertension in pregnancy.
   Design Prospective intervention.
   Setting The Rotunda Hospital, Dublin.
   Participants One thousand one hundred and two healthy primigravid women.
   Intervention 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement at 18 to 24 weeks of gestation.
   Main outcome measures The development of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension.
   Results A total of 1048 women had sufficient readings to be included in the final analysis. Of these, 23 (2.2%) developed pre-eclampsia, 64 (6.1%) developed gestational hypertension and 961 (91.7%) remained normotensive. Significantly higher ambulatory blood pressures were recorded in both the pre-eclamptic and gestational hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group. In addition, the gestational hypertensive group had significantly higher clinically measured blood pressure compared with the normotensive group. There were no differences between the preeclamptic and the gestational hypertensive group for any of the blood pressure parameters analysed. The best overall predictor for pre-eclampsia was 24-hour mean diastolic pressure which using a cutoff level of 71 mmHg gave a test with a sensitivity of only 22% and a positive predictive value of 15%.
   Conclusion Because the absolute differences are small and the overlap between the hypertensive and normotensive groups large, ambulatory blood pressure measurement, in a healthy primigravid population, between 18 and 24 weeks of gestation is not a useful predictor of hypertension.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of stimulus intensity on heart rate response in 18 low-risk human fetuses between 37 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated in quiet sleep with a 30-s voice sound at intensities of 80 dB and 90 dB. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal-processing techniques. We found that fetuses generally exhibited a 5- to 10-s decrease in heart rate following stimulus onset at an intensity of 80 dB. The response pattern changed from deceleratory to acceleratory when stimulus intensity was increased to 90 dB. Our findings suggest that a heart rate deceleration at low-stimulus intensity may be a component of the orienting reflex in the human fetus. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Placental progesterone synthesis exposes the fetus to high levels of progesterone and progesterone metabolites during late gestation which may influence fetal behaviour. To determine the role of maternal progesterone synthesis in the control of fetal arousal state and fetal breathing movements (FBM), the effect of raising and lowering maternal progesterone concentrations was examined in chronically catheterised fetal sheep. Fetal and maternal vascular catheters, fetal tracheal and amniotic fluid catheters as well as electrodes for recording fetal electrocortical (ECoG), electro-ocular (EOG) and nuchal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity were implanted between 118 and 122 days gestational age (GA). Progesterone, 100 mg, administered twice daily i.m. for 3 days (130-133 days GA) resulted in a marked elevation in maternal plasma progesterone concentrations (370 +/- 121%, n = 5, P < 0.05), but had no effect on fetal plasma concentrations. Fetal EOG episodes and the duration of fetal behavioural arousal were significantly suppressed throughout the progesterone treatment period (74.4 +/- 81.1% and 58-65% respectively, P < 0.05, n = 5). Four ewes received Trilostane (25 mg i.v.), a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, between 136 and 140 days GA. Maternal and fetal progesterone concentrations were significantly lowered by 60 min after treatment (19.8 +/- 8.0% and 39.5 +/- 24.3% respectively, P < 0.05). The incidence of fetal EOG activity increased from a pretreatment level of 26.8 +/- 1.5 min/h to 30.3 +/- 2.8 min/h at 1-6 h and to 35.0 +/- 1.7 min/h (P < 0.05) during the 7-12 h after Trilostane treatment. The duration of FBM episodes was significantly higher at 1-6 h and 7-12 h after Trilostane treatment (19.5 +/- 3.0 and 23.6 +/- 5.5 min/h respectively, P < 0.05) compared with pretreatment levels (11.2 +/- 1.2 min/h). We conclude that increasing maternal progesterone levels suppresses fetal EOG activity and behavioural arousal, whereas reducing maternal progesterone synthesis leads to an elevation of EOG activity and FBM.

AB The results of a direct radioimmunoassay (RIA) for porcine plasma melatonin, suggesting a relationship among plasma melatonin, feed intake and photoperiod, were investigated by comparison with the results of an extracted RIA. These findings were further examined by analysis of a small number of samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results identified inadequacies in the specificity of the direct RIA and failed to provide evidence for an effect of feed intake on melatonin secretion, Instead, it appeared that feed restriction exacerbated nonspecificity in the direct RIA. The cause of nonspecificity, and its effect on analysis of daily plasma melatonin profiles, were examined, The plasma component(s) responsible for nonspecificity was (were) not identified. However, the results suggest that characteristics of the antiserum used in the direct RIA are involved in the mechanism by which nonspecificity is induced. Results obtained using the extracted assay revealed that plasma melatonin concentrations in prepubertal gilts and pregnant sows exhibit a diurnal pattern, in which concentrations are low during daylight and modestly increased during darkness. Using the direct RIA, the same profiles exhibited highly variable melatonin concentrations showing little association with the light-dark cycle. Thus, assay specificity was identified as a factor contributing to inconsistencies in the literature describing plasma melatonin in the domestic pig and the importance of rigorous validation of RIAs was demonstrated. Furthermore, the results indicate that plasma melatonin concentrations in domestic pigs, as in other mammalian species, are entrained by the light-dark cycle.

AB An animal model was used to see if maternal genetic factors contribute to ethanol-induced fetal malformations. Susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mice were used in a reciprocal cross-breeding design. This design produced four fetal genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and SSSS litters and hybrid B6SS and SSB6 litters. Darns were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg of ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on day 18 of pregnancy and assessed for soft tissue and gross malformations. Results show different prenatal treatment effects on malformations depending on the fetal genotype. Mean percentage of total malformations in ethanol-treated groups were 61% (B6B6), 28% (B6SS), 3% (SSB6), and 16% (SSSS), respectively. Litters exposed to maltose-dextrin showed low (less than or equal to 4%) malformation rates regardless of fetal genotype. The difference in teratogenic response between genetically identical hybrid litters (B6SS and SSB6) suggests a maternal genetic contribution to susceptibility. Of the two major types of malformations, forelimb but not kidney malformations showed a pattern characteristic of a maternal genetic effect. It was concluded that maternal genetic effects can be distinguished from fetal genetic effects responsible for ethanol teratogenesis. Genetically based physiological responses to alcohol in the mother may confer varying degrees of risk for prenatal alcohol effects in the child.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of consistency in behavioral state organization for 30 low-risk human participants examined as fetuses at 38-40 weeks gestation and again as neonates at approximately 2 weeks postnatal age. Behavioral states were assigned similarly for fetuses and neonates in terms of heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. We found that the time spent in a sleep period was distributed among quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS), and indeterminate states in virtually identical proportions for fetuses and neonates. However, the only within-subject consistency between the fetal and neonatal periods was in the duration of complete QS epochs. Fetuses made fewer transitions between QS and AS, but neonates had shorter and more structured AS --> QS transitions. These findings suggest that, whereas central nervous system processes governing QS do not change appreciably, the control of AS undergoes significant changes in the 4 weeks spanning the fetal and neonatal periods. We believe that the duration of enclosed QS epochs provides the only stable measure of behavioral state development between the prenatal and postnatal periods.

AB At equivalent post-conceptional ages, prematurely-born infants have higher heart rates and reduced heart rate variability, relative to full-term neonates. premature birth might exert long-lasting effects on central and peripheral mechanisms that control cardiovascular activity. We assessed development of heart rate and heart rate variability in symptomatic preterm infants up to 6 months of age. Fifty 6.5-h evening recordings of EKG and breathing were obtained from prematurely-born infants (gestational ages: 24-35 weeks). Cardiac R-R intervals were captured with a resolution of +/-0.5 msec. One-min epochs were selected from three periods of regular respiration in recordings from premature infants and 72 recordings of full-term infants at comparable post-conceptional ages. Mean heart rate and heart rate variability were determined for each recording. At 40 weeks post-conception, prematurely-born infants with apnea of prematurity showed higher heart rates and reduced heart rate variability than did full-term neonates. These differences between premature and full-term infants persisted throughout the next 6 months in those infants born prior to 30 weeks gestation, and in those infants born at 30-35 weeks who experienced respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) during the neonatal period. The findings suggest that premature delivery, or complications thereof, exerts long-lasting effects on cardiac control.

AB Neighborhood citizens opposed a large-scale swine growing farm because of the release of agricultural odors. At this farm were facilities to house 50,000 animals together with three football-field size animal waste lagoons in a setting which includes a rural neighborhood with citizens living within a half-mile radius from the center of the farm. In addition to nuisance odors, some citizens also reported alleged farm odor-related health problems which included irritation of nose and throat, nausea, vomiting, headaches, sleep problems and breathing difficulties. The swine farms generally release highly odor-related compounds such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and butyric acid. (Hammond et al., 1979.) Steps taken to minimize the release of odor-related compounds included centrifugal separation and drying of solid waste, and injection of liquid waste into farm soils. An odor measurement study showed that most agricultural odors at this facility originated from gestation buildings, nursery buildings and field-sprinkling operations. The implementation of certain measures and maintenance of controls minimized the release of odor-related compounds. These management steps led to a significant decrease in the number of complaints.

AB Although thyroid fuction has been extensively investigated in pregnancy, the data have failed to identify clearly true changes in thyroid status mainly because various artefacts affect the results of several TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and free thyroid hormone assay techniques. To overcome the problem, serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured in 74 and 71 women in early and late pregnancy respectively and compared with those in 63 non-pregnant women using a highly-sensitive and specific immunoradiometric TSH assay (IRMA), free of any bias due to a pregnancy serum effect, and a two-step FT4 assay previously validated against an equilibrium dialysis reference method. In addition, the circadian changes of TSH in early and late pregnancy were studied in an effort to identify possible alterations related to fete-placental unit function. The median TSH level in early pregnancy (1.07, range: 0.27-3.76 mU/l) was found to be significantly lower than in late pregnancy (1.27, range: 0.26-3.57 mU/l, P<0.001) and in the control group (1.30, range: 0.35-3.38 mU/l, P<0.001). Conversely median FT4 level was found to be significantly higher in early (16.85, range: 11.0-24.20 nmol/l) than in late pregnancy (14.00, range: 10.60-20.40 nmol/l, P<0.001) and in the control group (14.50, range: 10.40-18.80 nmol/l, P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the median TSH or FT4 levels in the late pregnancy population and the control group. A normal TSH circadian rhythm was observed in both early and late pregnancy groups. In conclusion, a mild increase in thyroid activity is observed in early pregnancy, while the thyroid status in late pregnancy is unmodified.

AB The aim of this study was to describe the circadian pattern of non-invasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, and to compare sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis based on the average of the blood pressure series with the values obtained on the basis of casual measurements.
   We analyzed a total of 745 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours in each of several occasions in 189 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 71 with gestational hypertension, and 29 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP variation for each group (complicated vs. uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods.
   Highly statistically different circadian patterns are demonstrated for systolic, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P < 0.001 in all cases). Blood pressure decreases from the first trimester to the second and raises again in the third for healthy pregnant women, but continuously increases during gestation in women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in air trimesters (P < .001). Sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing gestational hypertension based on the circadian mean are 73% and 48%, respectively, too low for a proper individualized diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.
   This study confirms the predictable circadian variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy, but the use of the 24-hour mean BP does not provide a good approach for early diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

AB There are a variety of methodological problems with published studies of parental smoking and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), with over-control the most consistent and problematic. Nevertheless, even though this is likely to minimise the true magnitude of relationships, the results are consistent. There are five cohort studies with prospectively collected information on maternal smoking in pregnancy: all show strong and statistically significant relationships that were dose dependent-the more cigarettes the mother had smoked, the more at risk was the baby of SIDS. Similar results have been shown from the case-control studies in which information has been collected retrospectively from parents or birth certificates. There are data from several studies indicating that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is also important. Since it has not yet been possible to determine conclusively whether associations are with smoking (or ETS) during pregnancy or postnatally, it is concluded that both should be discouraged.

AB With the aim to describe the circadian pattern of non-invasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 759 BP series sampled for about 48 hours every four weeks after the first obstetric visit in 71 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 42 with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP variation for each group (complicated vs. uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. A highly statistically circadian pattern is demonstrated for systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (p<0.001 in all cases). The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (p always <0.001). This study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable circadian variability in BP during gestation. The differences in BP between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy. Those differences are found when both SEP and DBP for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiologic range of BP variability.(1).

AB The high rate of progesterone synthesis by the placenta in late gestation exposes the ovine fetus to high concentrations of progesterone and its metabolites that may affect activity of the fetal brain. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inhibiting maternal progesterone synthesis on sleep-wake activity in fetal sheep. Fetal and maternal vascular catheters, a fetal tracheal catheter, and electrodes for recording fetal electrocortical (ECoG), electro-ocular (EOG) and nuchal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity were implanted. At 128-131 days gestation, progesterone production was inhibited by an injection of trilostane (50 mg), a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor. Vehicle solution or progesterone (3 mg h(-1)) was then infused into the ewe between 6 and 12 h after the trilostane treatment. Maternal progesterone concentrations were significantly reduced from 1-24 h after trilostane treatment (P < 0.05) when followed by vehicle infusion. Fetal breathing movements (FBM), EGG, nuchal muscle EMG, and behavioural arousal increased 12 h after trilostane treatment (P < 0.05). In contrast, there was no change in fetal arousal, EGG, EMG or FBM activities when progesterone was infused after the trilostane treatment. These findings show that progesterone can influence fetal behaviour, and indicates that normal progesterone production tonically suppresses arousal, or wakefulness in the fetus.

AB A survey by telephone interviews has been carried out in 1993 in the canton of Geneva, in order to measure the prevalence of 3 risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and to evaluate the potential for SIDS prevention based on these factors: prone sleeping position, tobacco smoking by the parents during pregnancy, and no complete breast-feeding at 8 days of age. 278 families participated to the study, of 320 families who could be contacted by telephone in Geneva, from a random sample of 550 families having had a child in Geneva in the preceding 12 months. 40% of the infants had been put to bed in the prone position on the preceding evening. 18% of the mothers had smoked during pregnancy. Prevalence of low birth weight was 4.9% for 0 to 4 cigarettes per day during pregnancy, 17.2% for 5 cigarettes and more. At one week, 16.5% of children were not exclusively breast-fed. On the basis of these results, it can be estimated that an effective prevention programme, centred of prone sleeping position could decrease the incidence of SIDS by 50% or more. An even greater fraction of cases, up to 80%, could be avoided by the prevention of the 3 studied factors. These estimates show the need to develop a mother and child health programme in Switzerland.

AB The hormone melatonin is known to influence the circadian rhythm, and it probably also mediates some of the physiological changes that occur in the body at night. Inasmuch as uterine activity is greater during darkness, we investigated whether melatonin could modulate uterine contractility. Biopsies were performed during caesarean sections to obtain uterine tissue from women who had reached full term. The obtained samples were mounted in organ baths, and spontaneous contractions were recorded. Melatonin alone did not change myometrial contractility, whereas melatonin in combination with noradrenaline potentiated contractions. These results may indicate that melatonin plays a role in the timing of labour, since labour often begins late in the evening.

AB A two-site sandwich-type assay for human prostaglandin D (PGD) synthase (beta-trace) was developed with two monoclonal antibodies and using time-resolved fluorometry as the detection technique, The assay is precise (CVs <10%), accurate, and highly specific for PGD sythase and has a detection limit of 0.05 mu g/L. Using this assay, we measured PGD synthase concentrations in serum, urine, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), seminal plasma, breast cyst fluid, breast discharge fluid, breast milli, and breast tumor extracts. The highest concentrations were found in CSF, We identified proteolytic degradation of PGD synthase in amniotic fluid. Fetal tissues contained various amounts of the enzyme, with the highest values being found in brain and heart, In placental extracts, PGD synthase content was greatest at 11-28 weeks of gestation-in accordance with the concentrations measured in amniotic fluids for this gestational period. We conclude that PGD synthase is ubiquitous and is present in many fluids and tissues of adults and fetuses, This first quantitative and sensitive assay of PGD synthase should facilitate expansion of knowledge on this enzyme and possibly will have applications for diagnosis and monitoring of human diseases.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an over-the counter mechanical nasal dilator during sleep in pregnant women with nasal congestion.
   STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with symptoms of nocturnal nasal congestion not attributed to allergies or ''cold'' symptoms were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either a spring-loaded device or place: bo device without a spring. Each patient assessed breathing and sleep quality for a three-day baseline and three-day treatment period. A 10-question diary was utilized to assess breathing, ease of falling asleep, sleep quality, and continuity and depth of sleep. Averaged scores for each question were computed for baseline and treatment periods, and differences were calculated. Statistical analyses were by the sign test, Fisher's exact test and Student's t test.
   RESULTS: Thirty-four (21%) of 160 screened patients were enrolled into the study; 24 (15%) completed the study. All agreed to being assigned to receive either the spring-loaded device (n = 12) or a placebo (n = 12) device. Responses to 8 of the 10 questions favored the former as compared with the placebo (P = .05, sign test). Moreover, patients treated with the spring-loaded device gave more favorable responses to the question, ''Overall, compared with most nights, how easy was your breathing throughout last night?'' (P=.02, t test).
   CONCLUSION: Use of this drug-free external nasal dilator improved the ease of breathing among patients with pregnancy-related nocturnal congestion.

ID INFANT SLEEP POSITION; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; MORTALITY; SURFACTANT
AB Recent trends in the vital statistics of the United States continued in 1995, including decreases in the number of births, the birth rate, the age-adjusted death rate, and the infant mortality rate; life expectancy at birth increased to a level equal to the record high of 75.8 years in 1992. Marriages and divorces both decreased.
   An estimated 3 900 089 infants were born during 1995, a decline of 1% from 1994. The preliminary birth rate for 1995 was 14.8 live births per 1000 total population, a 3% decline, and the lowest recorded in nearly two decades. The fertility rate, which relates births to women in the childbearing ages, declined to 65.6 live births per 1000 women 15 to 44 years old, the lowest rate since 1986.
   According to preliminary data for 1995, fertility rates declined for all racial groups with the gap narrowing between black and white rates. The fertility rate for black women declined 7% to a historic low level (71.7); the preliminary rate for white women (64.5) dropped just 1%. Fertility rates continue to be highest for Hispanic, especially Mexican-American, women. Preliminary data for 1995 suggest a 2% decline in the rate for Hispanic women to 103.7.
   The birth rate for teenagers has now decreased for four consecutive years, from a high of 62.1 per 1000 women 15 to 19 years old in 1991 to 56.9 in 1995, an overall decline of 8%.
   The rate of childbearing by unmarried mothers dropped 4% from 1994 to 1495, from 46.9 births per 1000 unmarried women 15 to 44 years old to 44.9, the first decline in the rate in nearly two decades. The proportion of all births occurring to unmarried women dropped as well in 1995, to 32.0% from 32.6% in 1994.
   Smoking during pregnancy dropped steadily from 1989 (19.5%) to 1994 (14.6%), a decline of about 25%. Prenatal care utilization continued to improve in 1995 with 81.2% of all mothers receiving care in the first trimester compared with 78.92 in 1993. Preliminary data for 1995 suggests continued improvement to 81.2%. The percent of infants delivered by cesarean delivery declined slightly to 20.8% in 1995.
   The percent of low birth weight (LBW) infants continued to climb in 1994 rising to 7.3%, from 7.2% in 1993. The proportion of LEW improved slightly among black infants, declining from 13.3% to 13.2% between 1993 and 1994. Preliminary figures for 1995 suggest continued decline in LEW for black infants (13.0%). The multiple birth ratio rose to 25.7 per 1000 births for 1994, an increase of 2% over 1993 and 33% since 1980. Age-adjusted death rates in 1995 were lower for heart disease, malignant neoplasms, accidents, and homicide. Although the total number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection deaths increased sightly from 42 114 in 1994 to an estimated 42 506 in 1995, the age-adjusted death rate for HIV infection did not increase, which may indicate a leveling off of the steep upward trend in mortality from HIV infection since 1987.
   Nearly 15 000 children between the ages of 1-14 years died in the United States (US) in 1995. The death rate for children 1 to 4 years old in 1995 was 40.4 per 100 000 population aged 1 to 4 years, 6% lower than the rate of 42.9 in 1994. The 1995 death rate for 5- to 14-year-olds was 22.1, 2% lower than the rate of 22.5 in 1994. Since 1979, death rates have declined by 37% for children I to 4 years old, and by 30% for children 5 to 14 years old.
   For children 1 to 4 years old, the leading cause of death was injuries, which accounted for an estimated 2277 deaths in 1995, 36% of all deaths in this age group. Injuries were the leading cause of death for 5- to 14-year-olds as well, accounting for an even higher percentage (41%) of all deaths.
   in 1995, the preliminary infant mortality rate was 7.5 per 1000 live births, 6% lower than 1994, and the lowest ever recorded in the US. The decline occurred for neonatal as well as postneonatal mortality rates, and among white and black infants alike.
   Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rates have dropped precipitously since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations that infants be placed on their backs or sides to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. SIDS dropped to the third leading cause of infant death in 1994 after being the second leading cause of death since 1980. Infant mortality rates (IMRs) have also declined rapidly for respiratory distress syndrome since 1989, concurrent with the widespread availability of new treatments for this condition.

AB Autism, Asperger's syndrome and other autistic syndromes are developmental brain disorders that cause serious impairments in communication, social interaction, empathy, mood and play. In addition to such deficits, the autistic syndromes involve pathologically high levels of repetitive, stereotypic, ritualistic, compulsive or obsessive behavior, together with extreme resistance to change.
   According to the Crick-Mitchison theory of the biological function of rapid eye movement sleep, normal brain development in the fetus and infant depends on undisrupted function of a 'reverse learning' mechanism during rapid eye movement sleep. Could abnormalities in this hypothetical reverse learning during rapid eye movement sleep in the fetus explain some aspects of the autistic syndromes?
   Does the Crick-Mitchison theory suggest if a drug could interfere with rapid eye movement sleep and cross the placental barrier, then that drug might cause developmental brain disorders in the fetus? Should all pregnant women completely avoid caffeine or any agent that might disrupt serotonergic or cholinergic systems?

AB To investigate the effects of lung distension and oxygenation on umbilical blood flow (UBF) and plasma prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in relation to arousal and stimulation of breathing movements, we studied eight chronically instrumented, unanesthetized fetal sheep between 137 and 143 d of gestation. Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, nuchal and diaphragmatic electromyograms, arterial pH and blood gas tensions, Hb oxygen saturation, body temperature, and UBF were recorded in each fetus. Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, and nuchal electromyograms were used to define sleep states. No sooner than 4 d after surgery, fetal lungs were distended with 100% O-2 or N-2 in a randomized order via an in situ Y-endotracheal tube, PGE(2) concentrations were analyzed by RZA. A significant increase in fetal arousal and stimulation of breathing during nonrapid eye movement sleep was observed during lung distension with O-2 as compared with control periods and lung distension with nitrogen. In all sleep states, UBF significantly decreased during oxygenation as compared with the control values. However, no significant correlation was observed between the time of the onset of arousal and the decrease in UBF. Lung distension with N-2 resulted in increased plasma PGE(2) concentrations, whereas, no change was observed during oxygenation. Our data suggest that an increase fetal partial pressure of arterial O-2 leads to a decrease in UBF. However, the onset of arousal and stimulation of breathing during lung distension and oxygenation are not dependent on a decrease in plasma PGE(2) concentrations.

AB Introduction Infants of mothers who smoke have reduced respiratory function and are more likely to develop wheezing, Little evidence is available on the effect of inutero cigarette-smoke exposure as opposed to postnatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, We used a previously validated non-invasive method to measure the time to peak tidal expiratory flow (tPTEF) as a proportion of expiratory time (tE) in newborn infants soon after birth to examine the effects of a family history of asthma and in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure on the infants' respiratory function.
   Methods We collected respiratory-function data from 500 healthy infants of mothers taking part in the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort Study, During behaviourally defined quiet sleep, measurements were obtained a median of 58 h (range 26-159) after the infants were born, We used uncalibrated inductance plethysmography. The uncalibrated volume signal was differentiated to flow and used to calculate respiratory rate, total inspiratory time, tE, and tPTEF, Mothers answered questionnaires on demographic, medical, and pregnancy characteristics, including smoking history. Serum cotinine measurements were available to validate self-reported smoking history in a subset of mothers (238).
   Results Data suitable for analysis were obtained from 461 infants. In multivariate regression analysis, lower values of tPTEF/tE were independently associated with respiratory rate (beta coefficient per 10 breaths/min 0.018 [SE 0.005], p<0.01), age (beta coefficient per 10 h -0.008 [0.003], p<0.01), maternal smoking during pregnancy (>10 cigarettes daily; beta coefficient -0.049 [0.022], p<0.05), maternal hypertension during pregnancy (-0.037 [0.015], p<0.02), and a family history of asthma (-0.028 [0.014], p<0.05).
   Conclusions In-utero smoke exposure, a family history of asthma, and maternal hypertension during pregnancy are associated with reduced respiratory function after birth. We speculate that these factors adversely affect lung development in utero.

AB There is much evidence that progesterone has hypnotic anesthetic properties. In this vehicle-controlled study, we examined the effects of three doses of progesterone (30, 90, and 180 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally at light onset on sleep in rats. Progesterone dose dependently shortened non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) latency, lengthened rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) latency, decreased the amount of wakefulness and REMS, and markedly increased pre-REMS, an intermediate state between NREMS and REMS. Progesterone also elicited dose-related changes in sleep state-specific electroencephalogram (EEG) power densities. Within NREMS, EEG activity was reduced in the lower frequencies (less than or equal to 7 Hz) and was enhanced in the higher frequencies. Within REMS, EEG activity was markedly enhanced in the higher frequencies. The effects were maximal during the first postinjection hours. The concentrations of progesterone and the progesterone metabolites 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one, both positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptors, were determined at different time intervals after vehicle and 30 or 90 mg/kg progesterone. Progesterone administration resulted in dose-dependent initially supraphysiological elevations of progesterone and its metabolites in the plasma and brain, which were most prominent during the first hour postinjection. The effects of progesterone on sleep closely resemble those of agonistic modulators of GABA(A) receptors such as benzodiazepines and correlate well with the increases in the levels of its GABA(A) agonistic metabolites. These observations suggest that the hypnotic effects of progesterone are mediated by the facilitating action of its neuroactive metabolites on GABA(A) receptor functioning.

AB Sleep disorder during the course of pregnancy has been recently recognized in humans. However, the underlying mechanism of pregnancy-associated sleep disorder remains undetermined, and sleep changes even during normal pregnancy have not been fully understood. To describe the effects of pregnancy on sleep, sleep-wake patterns before and after fertile mating were compared in an animal model. Baseline recordings of sleep and brain temperature were made throughout a normal 4-day estrous cycle in female rats. After the rats became pregnant, the recordings continued across the entire pregnant period. Compared with baseline sleep before mating, both non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep increased significantly from the first night of pregnancy. Although rapid eye movement sleep returned to the baseline level from midpregnancy, nocturnal non-rapid eye movement sleep stayed enhanced during the entire pregnant period. Daytime sleep fluctuated toward the end of pregnancy. Brain temperature was elevated during the early period of pregnancy but did not correlate with enhanced sleep. The results suggest that physiological changes in different stages of pregnancy may contribute to the regulation of maternal sleep and temperature.
