N2  - Despite warnings regarding increased risks of infertility and poor pregnancy outcomes, more women are delaying childbearing past age 35 1. Limited empirical research has examined the factors underlying this demographic shift. This study explored views surrounding the timing of childbearing among childless women from North-West England and portrayals of older mothers in the British Media, which is recognised as a powerful influence on health-related behaviours. In-depth qualitative analyses were conducted of: (1) The views and experiences of six women aged between 18 and 24, six women aged between 25 and 34 and six women aged 35 or more and (2) Representations of pregnancy/birth in women over 35, in 839 newspaper/magazine articles and 35 television programmes published or broadcast over a calendar month. Data were managed manually and subjected to thematic analysis. Across groups, women suggested that they were living within boundaries, defined by themselves and others; they aspired to being a great mother or no mother; and had a desire to contribute to family and society, at multiple levels. Personal expectations and social factors contextualised decision making. Media discourses, dominated by celebrity coverage, promoted later motherhood as a means to reconcile expectations of economic and social productivity with being a 'good mother'. Medical risks were underplayed, reinforcing women's notions that later motherhood was achievable and acceptable. Effective communication of the risks associated with delayed childbearing challenges professionals and policymakers to expand the current restrictive framing of this issue.

N2  - Objective The aim of this study was to identify and verify plasma protein markers which may add to predictive algorithms for pre-eclampsia (PE) in asymptomatic nulliparous women. Methods We used a quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) approach to identify proteins with abundance changes in plasma (15 weeks) taken from women who subsequently develop PE recruited to the international SCOPE study. We developed a novel, targeted, label-free MS method, selective reaction monitoring (SRM) which enabled robust and reproducible verification of these proteins in a further 100 samples (16 early-onset PE, 42 late-onset PE, 42 controls). Results We identified and quantified >500 plasma proteins, and prioritised a set of candidate predictive markers. The two most promising, Platelet Basic Protein (PBP/NAP-2) and Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG)-9 were selected for further verification. The SRM method was validated extensively using dilution experiments for PSG proteins and by comparison to a commercial ELISA for NAP-2. NAP-2 was only elevated in a subset of women with PE, however, peptides unique to PSG-9 and PSG-5 were consistently elevated in women with subsequent early onset PE (p < 0.01; AUCs 0.72-0.75). Other PSG peptides were not different between groups. Conclusion This study has identified specific PSG proteins as being predictive of early-onset PE. Importantly, use of a highly specific MS method has enabled measurement of individual PSG family members which has not been possible using antibody-based techniques. Future work is needed to determine whether these proteins will improve current prediction algorithms for the identification of PE in low risk nulliparous women.

N2  - Background: Preterm infants are at increased risk for the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS may involve immature cardiovascular control leading to an uncompensated hypotensive episode in conjunction with a failure of arousal from sleep. Impaired cerebro-vascular control and reduced cerebral oxygenation may contribute to this failure of arousal. However, little is known about the effects of preterm birth on cerebro-vascular control during sleep at 2-3 months, the period of peak risk for SIDS. Method: 17 term and 22 preterm infants (27-36 weeks gestation) underwent daytime polysomnography at 2-3 months post-term age with continuous measurement of cerebral oxygenation (TOI) (NIRO-200, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) and blood pressure (MAP) (FinometerTM, FMS, The Netherlands). Cardiovascular challenges were presented as 15° head-up tilts (HUT) while the infants were both prone and supine and in active (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Significant difference between term and preterm infants was determined using two-way ANOVA. Results: When supine, the response of both MAP and TOI to a HUT was similar between term and preterm infants. When prone, preterm infants display a greater overall surge in MAP following the HUT in both QS and AS than term infants (p < 0.05). TOI increased following the HUT in both QS and AS in preterm infants while in term infants TOI only increased in AS. Conclusions: When prone, preterm infants display an exaggerated blood pressure and cerebral oxygenation response to a cardiovascular challenge. This may represent immaturity of systemic and cerebral circulatory control in preterm infants when SIDS risk is greatest.

N2  - The aims of this study were to systematically identify and summarize the literature examining the impact of physiologic and psychologic triggers on spasticity and discuss the evidence supporting various types of triggers. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases were searched using specific keyword combinations. Only studies using clinical tests or self-reports of spasticity were included. A total of 1152 articles were scanned for relevance, and of 44 relevant articles, 24 were reviewed. Pregnancy, posture, cold, circadian rhythm, and skin conditions increased spasticity and were measured using objective clinical tests. Self-reports of spasticity suggest that triggers such as bowel- and bladder-related issues, menstrual cycle, mental stress, and tight clothing can all increase spasticity. No literature evidence of increase in spasticity in response to heterotopic ossification, hemorrhoids, deep vein thrombosis, fever, and sleep patterns was found. Although self-reports indicate a strong possibility of increasing spasticity, without objective examination, the true effects of these triggers on spasticity remain inconclusive. Most studies reviewed here were performed in the spinal cord injury population; therefore, it is not known whether these triggers induce similar effects in persons with other neurologic etiologies.

N2  - Circadian clocks have been described in each tissue of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. Although a role for the clock in the timing of ovulation is indicated, the impact of diseases that disrupt fertility on clock function or the clocks' role in the etiology of these pathologies has yet to be fully appreciated. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a particularly devastating endocrinopathy, affecting approximately 10% of women at childbearing age. Common features of PCOS are a polycystic ovary, amenorrhea, and excess serum androgen. Approximately 40% of these women have metabolic syndrome, including hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperleptinemia. It has been suggested that excess androgen is a critical factor in the etiology of PCOS. We have examined the effects of androgen excess during puberty on the phase of circadian clocks in tissues of the metabolic and hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axes. Female period1-luciferase (per1-luc) rats were exposed to androgen (5α-dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) or placebo for 4-6 weeks (short term) or 9-15 weeks (long term). As expected, DHT-treated animals gained more weight than controls and had disrupted estrous cycles. At the end of treatment, tissues, including the liver, lung, kidney, white adipose, cornea, pituitary, oviduct, and ovarian follicles, were cultured, and per1-luc expression in each was recorded. Analysis of per1-luc expression revealed that DHT exposure increased phase distribution of multiple oscillators, including ovarian follicles, liver, and adipose, and altered phase synchrony between animals. These data suggest that excess androgen during puberty, a common feature of PCOS, negatively affects internal circadian organization in both the reproductive and metabolic axes.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to review neonatal SUDI deaths in a national cohort of perinatal deaths in New Zealand. Method: Deaths were included from Jan 1st 1997 to Dec 31st 2011. To ensure all possible cases were included deaths with a neonatal death classification (NDC) of 7.1 (SIDS), 7.3 (Trauma), 7.8 (Other specified) and 7.9 (Unknown/undetermined) were reviewed. Cases were included if the infants had died suddenly and unexpectedly without obvious cause. Demographic and perinatal data recorded in the national perinatal death dataset were collated and the autopsy reports, death scene information and inquest reports, if available, were reviewed. Results: There were 49 deaths assigned the selected NDC classifications. Of these 41 (22 male) were determined to be neonatal SUDI cases. There was an apparent decrease in deaths over time (11 in 2007 to 5 in 2011). Gestational age at birth varied from 34-42 weeks and age at death from 2-27 days of age. Maori infants were over-represented (73%) and most infants (85%) resided in the most deprived two quintiles. Maternal smoking in pregnancy was associated with 32/41 (78%) deaths. For 35/41 (85%) infants bedsharing was an associated factor. Autopsy diagnoses were SIDS (9 cases) diagnoses related to asphyxia or accidental suffocation (8 cases), undetermined or unascertained (8 cases), SUDI with or without qualification in regard to sleep situation (15 cases) and hypernatraemic dehydration (1 case). Conclusions: Maternal smoking and bedsharing are important modifiable factors associated with neonatal SUDI in New Zealand.

N2  - While there is a well-established link between depression and type 2 diabetes, depressive symptom clusters have received little attention in this literature. To begin to address this gap, we examined relationships among the somatic and nonsomatic clusters of depressive symptoms and insulin resistance, which is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Participants were 4,834 adults (mean age = 44.3 years, 50% female, 19% African American, 20% Mexican American) who participated in the 2005-2010 waves of NHANES - a survey of a large probability sample representative of the U.S. population. Participants with the following conditions were excluded: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver condition, kidney condition, or current pregnant. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; converted to z-scores), and somatic and nonsomatic subscale scores were computed based on results of a confirmatory factor analysis. Our index of insulin resistance was the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) score, which we computed from fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels. Separate regression analyses (adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, and the NHANES sample design) demonstrated positive relationships between PHQ-9 total (B=.25, SEB=.04, p<.001), somatic (B=.24, SEB=.04, p<.001), and nonsomatic (B=.20, SEB=.05, p<.001) scores and HOMA score. When the subscales were entered simultaneously into a regression model, the somatic score (B=.19, SEB=.05, p<.001), but not the nonsomatic score (B=.09, SEB=.06, p=.14), remained associated with HOMA score. The same pattern of significant results was observed after adjusting for body-mass index; however, effect sizes were attenuated. Our cross-sectional findings suggest that the relationship between depression and insulin resistance may be driven primarily by the somatic symptoms (low energy, appetite changes, and sleep disturbance) and raise the possibility that adults with the somatic symptoms of depression may be at an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes.

N2  - Background: In-Hospital neonatal falls occur, however literature is lacking. Rates of neonatal falls vary from 1.6-4.14/10,000 live births. Our study aims to review our rate of in-hospital neonatal falls. Method: Incidents of neonatal falls for any reason from June 2010 to June 2012 were audited using the hospital incident system to look for potential risk factors and common features. Results: We identified six incidents; five being term infants and a 23-week gestation baby, giving a rate of 16.8/10,000 live births. Five of the incidents were in the post-natal ward, with three in the first day and three occurring on day-two post-delivery. Demographic features included four out of six maternal smoking, three NZ Maori ethnicity, five were breastfeeding in bed without a support person, five occurred in the early morning, and five featured maternal opioids and/or surgical delivery. Conclusions: Of particular concern is the high rate of falls during breastfeeding in bed without a support person present, following a surgical delivery especially in the early morning when mothers are vulnerable due to lack of sleep. These are potentially modifiable risk factors and should be highlighted to staff caring for these infants and mothers.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Advances in diabetes technologies allow patients to manage their diabetes with greater precision and flexibility. Many recent studies show that continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can be used to tighten glycemic control safely and to ease certain burdens of diabetes self-management. Recent Findings: The following summary reflects the most recent findings in CGM and provides an overall review of who would most benefit from CGM use. Benefits of CGM may vary based on age, type of diabetes, pregnancy, health, sleep, or heart rate. Accuracy and reliability are critical in current uses of CGM and especially for new and future systems that automate insulin partially (e.g., low glucose suspend) or entirely (e.g., 'fully closed-loop' artificial pancreas). Clinicians are simultaneously testing available products in new patient groups such as the critically ill and type 2 diabetes patients not using mealtime insulin. Summary: In a widening set of circumstances, use of CGM has been shown to promote safer and more effective glycemic control than self-monitoring of blood glucose. Imperfections remain in certain scenarios such as hypoglycemia and in certain populations such as young children. Ongoing research on sensors and calibration software should translate to better systems. Copyright © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Napping is highly prevalent in pregnant women, but the relation between nighttime sleep and daytime naps in pregnant women is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the temporal association of nighttime sleep quality and quantity with subsequent daytime naps and the temporal association of daytime naps with sleep quality and quantity the following night in women during the third trimester of pregnancy in Taiwan. METHODS: Sleep was assessed in 80 Taiwanese nulliparous women aged 31.70 years (SD = 4.58 years) using actigraphy and diaries for 7 consecutive days. Subjective sleep quality was examined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multiple linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were used to examine the temporal associations of nighttime sleep and daytime naps. RESULTS: All women napped sometime during the study week, and mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score was 6.6, indicating poor sleep quality. Fewer weekly work hours and shorter sleep duration the preceding night were associated with longer nap duration the next day. More work hours, longer nap duration, and more intense fatigue were associated with shorter sleep duration the following night. DISCUSSION: Naps during pregnancy might indicate insufficient nighttime sleep, and longer daytime naps could compromise subsequent nighttime sleep. Further research is needed to determine if short sleep duration and longer daytime naps are associated with negative pregnancy outcomes. Copyright © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Rationale: Previous studies in female patients with epilepsy have largely focused on seizure status during pregnancy and on anomalies in children of patients on anti-epileptic drugs (AED). However, little is known about the influence of child-bearing on seizure recurrence after delivery in female epileptic patients in remission. We investigated the risk of seizure relapse after child-bearing. Methods: We retrospectively examined epileptic patients who had a delivery after at least two years of seizure remission. Patients had been followed for at least one year after delivery at the time of this study. We excluded patients who had a seizure recurrence following AED reduction. A total of 53 patients (72 deliveries) were included for further analysis. Patients were divided into two groups. The first group included 16 patients with long-lasting seizure remission group (five years or more), and the second group included 37 patients with relatively short seizure remission (2-5 years). The mean age at the time of the study was 44.5 years, and the mean follow-up duration was 8.4 years. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Results: A total of 17 of 53 patients had seizure recurrence during follow-up. Ten of 53 patients (18.9 %) had seizure relapse within one year after delivery, and seven patients (13.2 %) had a relapse more than one year after delivery. In the long-lasting remission group, 21.6 % (8 out of 37) had seizure recurrence. Six of these patients (16.2 %) had a seizure within one year of delivery, and two were in the longlasting remission group (five years or more). In the group with relatively short remission, 25 % (four out of 16 patients) showed seizures within one year after delivery, and 31.3% (five out of 16 patients) had seizure relapses more than one year after delivery. Short seizure remission was a risk factor for seizure relapse after childbearing (p<0.05). The epilepsy classification, the gender of the child, the time between marriage and pregnancy, or number of AEDs did not show any significant correlation with the risk of seizure relapses. Conclusions: It is well known that the risk of seizure relapse is relatively low in patients who have been in remission for two years or more, without a change in AED treatment. Our result showed that seizure relapse within one year after delivery is not rare, even in patients who have been seizure free for two years or more. Seizure recurrence after delivery may pose a danger not only to the patients but also to their babies. After child-bearing, patients are at risk as a result of sleep deprivation, life style changes, and dynamic changes in hormone levels. Our results may suggest that doctors should also be aware of the risk of relapse in patients who have been seizure free for years, and that they should provide lifestyle guidance to patients and their families.

N2  - Purpose: This study examined the patterns and psychosocial predictors of sleep quality in Taiwanese pregnant women. Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used. A convenience sample of 400 pregnant women from two urban hospitals in Taiwan participated in this study. Data were collected using six self-report measures: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Attitude to Body Image Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. Results: Our findings revealed that the prevalence of pregnancy-associated sleep disturbance (PSQI score >5) was 65.5%. The mean score of the global PSQI was 7.25 ± 3.43, indicating that participant pregnant women in general reported mild sleep disturbance. Trend analyses of PSQI score indicated a linear trend, with a gradual decline in the sleep quality as the pregnancy progressed. Sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality scores differed significantly by trimesters. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the best subsets to predict sleep quality were prenatal depression, prepregnancy sleep quality, current body image, and week of gestation for Taiwanese pregnant women. Clinical Implications: These findings offer evidence that healthcare professionals should provide sleep counseling to pregnant women, and incorporate depression and body image into a supportive model of sleep-related prenatal care. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant acting as an MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. Because of its peculiar pharmacological profile, this drug caters the potential to correct the abnormalities of circadian rhythms associated with mood disorders, including abnormalities of the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we examined the effect of chronic agomelatine treatment on sleep architecture and circadian rhythms of motor activity using the rat model of prenatal restraint stress (PRS) as a putative 'aetiological' model of depression. PRS was delivered to the mothers during the last 10 d of pregnancy. The adult progeny ('PRS rats') showed a reduced duration of slow wave sleep, an increased duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increased number of REM sleep events and an increase in motor activity before the beginning of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. In addition, adult PRS rats showed an increased expression of the transcript of the primary response gene, c-Fos, in the hippocampus just prior to the beginning of the dark phase. All these changes were reversed by a chronic oral treatment with agomelatine (2000 ppm in the diet). The effect of agomelatine on sleep was largely attenuated by treatment with the MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor antagonist, S22153, which caused PRS-like sleep disturbances on its own. These data provide the first evidence that agomelatine corrects sleep architecture and restores circadian homeostasis in a preclinical model of depression and supports the value of agomelatine as a novel antidepressant that resynchronizes circadian rhythms under pathological conditions. © CINP 2012.

N2  - Purpose: This study was intended to evaluate the attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by a sleep questionnaire to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant women. Berlin questionnaire was employed for symptom-based OSA screening during the third trimester and obstetric outcome data were obtained in 276 deliveries. The relationship between symptom-based OSA and outcomes were explored using SPSS version 18.0 and stratified by obesity (BMI strata <30 and ≥30). Our primary outcome was the compound occurrence of SGA (fetal) or preeclampsia (maternal). Multivariate models were applied in controlling for potential confounders. Results: The overall prevalence of OSA was 32.2 % and it was significantly related with the higher maternal BMI, more body weight at delivery, and weight gain during pregnancy (p = 0.007, p = 0.003, p = 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences in the primary outcomes according to the positivity of OSA by screening, regardless of the stratification by obesity. The cesarean delivery rate was significantly higher in the OSA positive group (36.0 vs 22.5 %, p = 0.018), but it was not significant in the each strata of obesity. In multivariate analysis, the outcomes of birth weight, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and small for gestational age were also not different according to the positivity of OSA. Conclusions: It seems that the prevalence of OSA by a sleep questionnaire is overestimating OSA in Korean pregnant women. Polysomnography might be needed to diagnose OSA and to evaluate the relationship between OSA and the occurrence of SGA or preeclampsia. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objective: The goal was to study the differential development of fetal cardiac time intervals (fCTI) in low-risk and high-risk pregnancies. Methods: A total of 441 recordings from fetuses between 27-39 weeks gestational age (GA) were examined. Of these, 232 were classified as highrisk (HR) based on maternal conditions, such as pregnancy-induced/chronic hypertension, that have impact on normal fetal development. The HR group was subcategorized into: Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR; 66); and “abnormal tests” (39; biophysical profile (BPP) </= 6, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler values, abnormal fetal middle cerebral artery values and/or nonreactive nonstress test (NST)). The remainder of the HR group was classified as high-risk normal (HR-OK). The 209 studies that were not HR were considered low risk (LR). Magnetocardiogram (MCG) recordings were performed at a sampling frequency of 312.5 Hz. FCTI was calculated with averaged values by oneminute windows. Further we determined the fetal states quiet sleep (1F) and active awake (2F) based on Nihjuis crietira. Results: The time interval for P, PQ, PR, QRS and RR intervals were computed for all the groups and plotted against GA. We did not observe any statistically significant trend in any of the intervals except an increasing trend in RR intervals (0.992, p<0.05) with gestation. Comparing these variables in the high-risk group to low-risk we found statistically significant differences in the P and PR interval in each of the high-risk sub-groups. The correlation with fetal states did not show any observable effect of state (quite/active sleep) on cardiac time intervals. Conclusions: Study of the development of fetal cardiac time intervals in relation to GA between fetuses classified as low-risk and high-risk gives us insight into the electrophysiological trends in fetal cardiac development.

N2  - Gene disruptions, point mutations, and microdeletions of GRIN2A on chromosome 16p13 have been reported in a small number of patients with epilepsy and a highly variable cognitive development (MIM 613971). This gene codes for a subunit of the excitatory neuronal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Here, we report on the clinical phenotype of a family with microdeletion 16p13 involving GRIN2A. The two affected siblings were referred for the first time at the age of 3 and 4 years, respectively, because of developmental delay affecting in particular speech and fine motor skills. Pregnancy and birth were unremarkable, growth measurements and cranial MRI in both children were normal, and there was only minor facial dysmorphism. Both children had already in the initial EEG recordings frequent centrotemporal spikes/sharp-waves with activation and secondary generalization in sleep, corresponding to continuous spike and waves during sleep. Both children received a pulsatile corticoid therapy, which improved the EEG but only lead to limited developmental progress. In both children, clinically no seizures were seen. Intellectual disability with or without epilepsy was reported in several paternal family members. Molecular karyotyping revealed a 773 kb microdeletion in chromosome band 16p13 in both children. The deletion contains 11 genes, including GRIN2A, and overlaps with the deletions in three previously described patients with intellectual disability and seizure disorders of the rolandic region. FISH confirmed that the deletion was inherited from the father. This is the first report of the familial occurrence of a microdeletion 16p13 including GRIN2A. Our observation corroborates the clinical value of molecular karyotyping in patients with apparently monogenic epilepsy associated with variable developmental delay.

N2  - Alcohol exposure during pregnancy results neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities and affects 1/100 deliveries. Neuroprotective proteins (NAP,SAL) have been shown to prevent some of the alcohol-induced sequelae including learning abnormalities and growth restriction. Previous work has demonstrated that when evaluated at 30min, 60min and 10days after exposure, phosphorylation of the JNK and p38 cell signaling pathways were affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Given the acute changes in phosphorylation we sought to evaluate the impact of alcohol and NAP+SAL after 5 and 10 minutes of exposure, in cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) and those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation (STAT, MAP/ERK, CREB). We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol, alcohol+NAP,SAL (20ug IP) or placebo(saline) were administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 5 or 15min. Cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects phosphorylation in the embryo at 5 and 15min with alterations in JNK in the embryo at both timepoints compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 15min. Phosphorylation of other pathways although significant at 5min, was not dramatically different, however at 15min a persistent pattern of alterations with alcohol treatment decreasing levels (all P<.01) with no improvement with the peptides, these included CREB, IL1b, p38, p70 and STAT3. Alcohol exposure stimulates the cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) decreases those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation. Targeting these pathways may provide an intervention for alcohol induced damage in pregnancy. (Figer Presented) .

N2  - Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of children under the age of 15, making it a very common neurological disorder in the pediatric population (Russ et al., 2012 [1]). In addition, ~. 0.4-0.8% of all pregnant women have some form of epilepsy (Hauser et al., 1996a,b; Borthen et al., 2009; Krishnamurthy, 2012 [2-5]). Despite the potential deleterious effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the developing brain, their use is still required for seizure control in pregnant women (Krishnamurthy, 2012 [5]), and they represent the standard approach for treating children with epilepsy (Chu-Shore and Thiele, 2010; Quach et al., 2010; Verrotti et al., 2011 [6-8]). Even when AEDs are effective, there are potential side effects, including cognitive and affective changes or altered sleep and appetite. The consequences of AED exposure in development have been studied extensively (Canger et al., 1999; Modi et al., 2011a,b; Oguni, 2011 [9-12]). Despite intensive study, there is still debate about the long-term consequences of early life AED exposure. Here, we consider the evidence to date that AED exposure, either prenatally or in early postnatal life, has significant adverse effects on the developing brain and incorporate studies of laboratory animals as well as those of patients. We also note the areas of research where greater clarity seems critical in order to make significant advances. A greater understanding of the impact of AEDs on somatic, cognitive and behavioral development has substantial value because it has the potential to inform clinical practice and guide studies aimed at understanding the genetic and molecular bases of comorbid pathologies associated with common treatment regimens. Understanding these effects has the potential to lead to AEDs with fewer side effects. Such advances would expand treatment options, diminish the risk associated with AED exposure in susceptible populations, and improve the quality of life and health outcomes of children with epilepsy and children born to women who took AEDs during pregnancy.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "The Future of Translational Epilepsy Research". © 2012.

N2  - Background: Cell phones represent an opportunity to address health inequalities given that they are nearly ubiquitous in the US and can be used to reach populations at highest risk for poor health outcomes with vital health information and resources. Text4baby is a free mobile service that provides timely health information to pregnant women and moms with babies under one year old. By texting “BABY” (or “BEBE” for Spanish) to 511411 women receive texts about a range of topics, including prenatal and infant care, immunization, nutrition, breastfeeding, and sleep safety.Text4baby content also includes alert messages and interactive enhancements Objective(s): To describe: • The text4baby content development and review process, including the new content council which includes professional organizations, such as ACOG and AAP • Current user engagement and service adoption • How providers can promote text4baby and access resources to assist in their efforts Materials/Methods: Text4baby recently implemented data collection and analysis efforts to examine: enrollment and cancellation rates, type of user, referral sources, and response to interactive features. Results: Since program launch in 2010 more than 450,000 individuals have enrolled and 850 outreach partners are promoting the service nationwide. Results from a poverty-level zip code analysis of text4baby enrollees and those who have cancelled suggest that participation and retention are higher in low-income areas. The majority of users are pregnant women (71%) and new mothers (25%); the remaining 4% are observers. Descriptive data on user-reported referral source and from the new interactive enhancements will be presented. Results from the 2011 influenza module suggest users are engaged and willing to respond to text surveys: 31% (29,316 of 96,070) responded to a text asking about their intention to get a flu shot. Conclusions: Text4baby is an important tool for healthcare providers, researchers, policymakers and public health professionals, especially because it is free to the end user and to partners. Text4baby has a rigorous content development process and providers can be assured that the messages are clinically accurate. Program enhancements are based on lessons learned on user engagement and adoption.

N2  - Aims: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia Type 2 (PCH2) is a rare inherited condition defined on MRI by a small cerebellum and ventral pons. Clinical features have not been detailed exhaustively. The aim of this study is to describe the phenotype of PCH2. We present our preliminary results. Methods: Patients were recruited by contacting German patients' organizations. Inclusion criteria were imaging findings of PCH2 and/or a pathogenic mutation. Data from 32 patients were collected using physicians' reports and a questionnaire, which was checked with each family in a telephone interview. Results: Pregnancy: Neither MRI at a gestational age of 21 weeks (n = 1) nor cranial ultrasonography (n = 28) could detect PCH2. Ultrasonography revealed microcephaly in two cases. Symptoms: The presence of abnormalities was noticed in the neonatal period (n = 31). Reported symptoms were feeding difficulties (n = 31), seizures (n = 28), choreic movements (n = 29), dystonic attacks (n = 10), and sleep disorders. Presentation symptoms usually persisted in most cases. Dystonic attacks ceased later in 50% of affected children. All children aged 28 months or more had epilepsy, which was mostly not treatable (n = 26). Neurodevelopment: All children had a severe mental retardation and a dyskinetic or/and spastic movement disorder. They made progress at a rudimentary level: moderate head control (n = 24), rolling prone to supine (n = 19), sitting without support (n = 2), attempting to grasp objects (n = 25), ability to produce sounds to express approval/disapproval (n = 18), social smile (n = 23), ability to recognize familiar people (n = 30), fixing his eyes on an object or person (n = 25), and following an object with his eyes (n = 24). Anthropometric measurements: Average weight, length, and head circumference were in the normal range at birth and became abnormal, especially head circumference (-5.58 SD at the age of 5). Conclusion: Prenatal imaging does not detect PCH2. Microcephaly is progressive but not obligatory at birth. Typical symptoms are present very early. PCH2 is histopathologically a degenerative disorder, but affected children make some progress.

N2  - Gene disruptions, point mutations and microdeletions of GRIN2A on chromosome 16p13 have been reported in a small number of patients with epilepsy and a highly variable cognitive development ranging from learning disabilities to severe mental retardation (MIM 613971). This gene codes for a subunit of the neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor involved in excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Here, we report on the clinical phenotype of a family with microdeletion 16p13 involving GRIN2A. The affected siblings were referred to the department of neuropediatrics because of mild developmental delay affecting in particular speech and fine motor skills. Pregnancy and birth were unremarkable, growth measurements and cranial MRI in both children were normal, and there was only minor facial dysmorphism. However, both siblings showed an abnormal EEG pattern. The 11 year old girl had continuous subclinical sleep-induced spikes and waves in the centro-termporal region with secondary generalization corresponding to ESES (electrical status epilepticus in sleep). Her 4 year old brother showed continuous spikes/sharp-waves in the centro-temporo-occipital region without any difference between sleep and awake periods. Their father reported that he had epileptic seizures until the age of 11 years. He had learning difficulties and visited a school for children with special needs. Molecular karyotyping (HumanCytoSNP12 v2.1, Illumina) revealed a 773 kb microdeletion in chromosome band 16p13 in both children. The deletion contains 11 genes, including GRIN2A, and overlaps with the deletions in three previously described patients with intellectual disability and seizure disorders of the rolandic region. FISH confirmed that the deletion was inherited from the father; intellectual disability with or without epilepsy was reported in several paternal family members. This is the first report of the familial occurrence of a microdeletion 16p13 including GRIN2A. Our observation corroborates the clinical value of molecular karyotyping in patients with apparently monogenic epilepsy associated with variable developmental delay. Typical features of GRIN2A deficiency include epilepsy of the rolandic region which may spontaneously improve during the first 2-3 decades of life.

N2  - Objective: Our goal was to investigate interburst interval (IBI) and burst duration (BD) as quantitative indices for fetal neurological maturation and compare them between normal pregnancies and ones at risk for adverse neurological development. Methods: Using non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) the brain activity was examined. There were 23 low-risk along with 148 high-risk and 72 IUGR recordings with gestational age (GA) from 27-38 weeks. The discontinuous patterns in the brain activity were characterized by BD and IBI and plotted against GA. Further we determined the fetal states of quiet (1F) and active sleep (2F) and studied their variation with burst parameters. Results: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (-0.19 sec/wk, P=0.02) in low-risk fetuses; no significant change was observed in either the IUGR or the high-risk fetuses. The changes over GA were then compared between the groups. The trend in the low-risk group was significantly different from the IUGR (P=0.03) but there was no trend in the high-risk group (P=0.10). With respect to BD, no significant trend difference was detected. When fetal states were included the low-risk fetuses showed decreases in IBI with GA in the 1F state (-0.23 sec/wk, P=0.02) but not in 2F state. The high-risk and IUGR fetuses did not show any statistically significant changes. Comparing changes over GA revealed a difference between low-risk and IUGR (P=0.04) and marginal between low-risk and high-risk (P=0.06) for 1F state. No significant differences among IBI trends were noted in 2F state. No trends were observed in BD for either 1F or 2F between the groups. Conclusion: The mean IBI and the length of discontinuity decreased in the lowrisk fetuses over GA(5.3s;38 wk GA). In the case of IUGR the IBI is already as low as 5.6s at GA 27 weeks, which may point towards an early maturation/ dysmaturation. Further the high-risk group has a lower mean IBI at 27 weeks compared to low-risk but are higher than the IUGR. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Current knowledge suggests that laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are involved in the occurrence of certain neonatal apneas/bradycardias, especially in the preterm newborn. While caffeine and/or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) are the most frequent options used for treating apneas in preterm newborns, their effects on LCR-related apneas/bradycardias are virtually unknown. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that caffeine and/or nCPAP decreases LCR-related cardiorespiratory inhibition in a preterm ovine model. Seven preterm lambs were born vaginally on gestational day 133 (normal gestation: 147 days) after intramuscular injections of betamethasone and mifepristone. Five days after birth, a chronic surgical instrumentation was performed to record states of alertness, electrocardiogram, systemic arterial pressure, and electromyographic activity of a laryngeal constrictor muscle, as well as to insert a transcutaneous supraglottal catheter. LCR were induced in quiet sleep under four conditions: 1) control (without caffeine or nCPAP); 2) nCPAP (5 cmH2O, without caffeine); 3) caffeine (10 mg/kg infused intravenously for 30 min, without nCPAP); and 4) nCPAP + caffeine. Our results showed that nCPAP consistently blunted LCR-related cardiorespiratory inhibition vs. control condition, contrary to caffeine whose overall effect was nonsignificant. In addition, nCPAP condition was characterized by a more consistent and rapid arousal after HCl injection. No significant differences were observed between all tested conditions with regard to swallowing and cough. It is concluded that nCPAP should be further assessed for its usefulness in treating neonatal apneas linked to LCR. Copyright © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

N2  - Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy is a key contributor to offspring diseases that develop in adult life. To explore the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy in primates, we exposed pregnant capuchin monkeys to constant light (eliminating the maternal melatonin rhythm) from the last third of gestation to term. Maternal temperature and activity circadian rhythms were assessed as well as the newborn temperature rhythm. Additionally we studied the effect of daily maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy on these rhythms. Ten pregnant capuchin monkeys were exposed to constant light from 60% of gestation to term. Five received a daily oral dose of melatonin (250 μg kg/body weight) at 1800 h (LL+Mel) and the other five a placebo (LL). Six additional pregnant females were maintained in a 14:10 light:dark cycles and their newborns were used as controls (LD). Rhythms were recorded 96 h before delivery in the mother and at 4-6 days of age in the newborn. Exposure to constant light had no effect on the maternal body temperature rhythm however it delayed the acrophase of the activity rhythm. Neither rhythm was affected by melatonin replacement. In contrast, maternal exposure to constant light affected the newborn body temperature rhythm. This rhythm was entrained in control newborns whereas LL newborns showed a random distribution of the acrophases over 24-h. In addition, mean temperature was decreased (34.0±0.6 vs 36.1±0.2°C, in LL and control, respectively P<0.05). Maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy re-synchronized the acrophases and restored mean temperature to the values in control newborns. Our findings demonstrate that prenatal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the newborn temperature rhythm and supports normal body temperature maintenance. Altogether these prenatal melatonin effects highlight the physiological importance of the maternal melatonin rhythm during pregnancy for the newborn primate. © 2013 Seron-Ferre et al.

N2  - Background: Induction of labour is a common intervention in obstetric practice. Traditionally, in most hospitals induction of labour with medication starts early in the morning, with the start of the working day for the day shift. In human and animal studies spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm with a preference for start of labour in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous labour starts in the evening, the total duration of labour and delivery shortens and fewer obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one might assume that starting induction of labour in the evening, in harmony with the circadian rhythm of natural birth, is more beneficial for both mother and child. Objectives: To assess whether induction of labour starting in the evening, coinciding with the endogenous circadian rhythm, improves the outcome of labour compared with induction of labour starting in the early morning, organised to coincide with office hours. Search methods: We contacted the Trials Search Co-ordinator to search the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to 16 February 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 16 February 2012). Selection criteria: We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We excluded trials that employed quasi-random methods of treatment allocation. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. Main results: The search resulted in 2693 articles that we screened on title and abstract for eligibility.Thirteen studies were selected for full text assessment. We included three randomised trials involving 1150 women. Two trials compared the administration of prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening in women with an unfavourable cervix, and one trial compared induction of labour in the morning versus the evening in women with a favourable cervix and/or ruptured membranes with intravenous oxytocin. Because of the different mechanism, we have reported results for these two comparisons separately. In the two trials comparing prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening there were few clinically significant differences between study groups for maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a statistically significant preference by women to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the morning. In the trial examining induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin, the number of neonatal admissions was statistically significantly increased in the group of women that started induction in the morning. This finding was unexpected, and while the trial authors offered some possible explanations for this, it is important that any future trials examine neonatal outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Taking into account women's preferences that favoured administration of prostaglandins in the morning, we conclude that caregivers should preferably consider administering prostaglandins in the morning. There is no strong evidence that induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is more or less effective than induction in the morning. Consideration may be given to start induction of labour with oxytocin in the evening when indicated.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep. Methods: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen. Results: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS >20 and 100% had a PSQI >5. Hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS. Conclusion: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Pregnancy and postpartum period are characterized by distinct changes in sleep including increased sleep fragmentation and decreased sleep efficiency. Sleep changes can persist up to several months postpartum. Therefore, a considerable fraction of pregnant women (PW) as well as young mothers (YM) can be considered as chronically partial sleep-deprived. Partial sleep deprivation is known to detrimentally affect, e.g., stress axes, immune system, and wellbeing. The present study aimed to investigate consequences of partial sleep deprivation in PW and YM concerning those systems. In total, 166 PW and 154 YM participated in the study. According to their sleep efficiency objectively measured via actigraphy over 7 consecutive nights, we divided PW as well as YM in a group of poor and well sleeping individuals. We obtained a fasting blood sample in order to quantify basal levels of interleukin-(IL-)6. Cumulative longterm cortisone levels were analyzed in hair and well-being was estimated via questionnaires. Sleep of poor sleeping PW and YM was characterized by decreased sleep efficiency and increased sleep fragmentation compared to well sleeping women. We found significant higher basal IL-6 concentrations, cortisone levels, and depression scores in poor sleeping PW (all p-values below 0.041) but not in poor sleeping YM. Data provide evidence that poor sleeping PW, but not YM, are negatively affected by partial sleep deprivation. Altered hormonal status in pregnancy, physiological habituation to partial sleep deprivation over time postpartum, or compensating mechanism through pleasure about the child might explain diverse results in both groups.

N2  - Purpose: Depression, anxiety, and poor sleep are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between negative emotion and retinal microvascular changes among adults, yet no study has been done in pregnant women so far. This study aims to examine the association of antenatal mental health and retinal vascular caliber among Asian pregnant women. Methods: Nine hundred and fifty two Asian pregnant women aged 18 to 46 years were included in this study, who were recruited from two Singapore cohort studies, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study and the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) study conducted from 2009 onwards. A total of 835 Asian pregnant women underwent retinal photography at 26 weeks follow up, of whom 800 had gradable photographs. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality were assessed with self-administered questionnaires. Results: In multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, ethnicity, household income, pregnancy outcome history, means of conception, hypertension history, diabetes history, cigarette smoking history, mean arterial blood pressure, body mass index, and spherical equivalent, each standard deviation (SD) increase in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (4.49 scores) and in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (2.90 scores) was associated with a 0.80 μm (P = 0.03) and a 1.22 μm (P = 0.01) widening in retinal arteriolar caliber, respectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates relationships of antenatal depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality with retinal arteriolar widening in pregnant women. Translational Relevance: We speculate that this might possibly indicate an effect of antenatal depression and poor sleep on the microcirculation during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in pregnancy. The cause is multifactorial, including a decreased or transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and gastrointestinal motility disturbances. Aims: Evaluate the incidence of GERD in pregnancy and assess predictors and predisposing factors. Method: This is a secondary analysis of a survey of postpartum women regarding symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and GERD performed at a large tertiary care center. Patients rated heartburn frequency during pregnancy as either never, occasionally/sometimes, or frequently/always. Pregnancy outcomes and newborn information was collected. Categorical variables were compared by Fisher's exact test and continuous variables were compared by Anova or Kruskal-Wallis test. Multinominal logistic regression was also performed. Results: Information regarding 1000 mothers and 1025 newborns was reviewed. The majority of mothers were Caucasian (68.8%) with mean age 29±6.1. years. A total of 56.7% had GERD frequently/always; and 25.5% had none. GERD symptoms correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), BMI at delivery, maternal age, smoking and symptoms of SDB. There was no significant correlation between fetal weight and maternal weight gain with GERD symptoms. Symptoms were more frequent in white non-Hispanic women than in other racial groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that GERD symptoms correlate with pre-pregnancy BMI and BMI at delivery, but not with the amount of weight gain during pregnancy. Maternal age, smoking, race, and SDB are also associated with GERD. Interestingly, fetal weight/uterine size did not seem predictive of developing GERD in pregnancy. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Ninety-two prenatally depressed pregnant women were randomly assigned to a tai chi/yoga or a waitlist control group at an average of 22 weeks gestation. The tai chi/yoga group participated in a 20-min group session per week for 12 weeks. At the end of the treatment period the tai chi/yoga group had lower summary depression (CES-D) scores, as well as lower negative affect and somatic/vegetative symptoms subscale scores on the CES-D, lower anxiety (STAI) scores and lower sleep disturbances scores. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The objective of this study was to investigate the morphology of the common iliac artery and vein (CIA&V) comparing right and left sides in females versus males. Pregnant women favour lying on one side at rest and during sleep. The reason for this may be due to the morphology and orientation between the CIA&V. Virtually all women during their pregnancy suffer from lower limb swelling. This study provides an anatomical explanation for the propensity to lie consistently on one side, for lower limb swelling, and offers prevention measures. A literature search was conducted on anatomical texts, atlases, journals, and websites regarding the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA&V, lower limb oedema, and sleeping positions during pregnancy. Measurements from 15 dissected cadavers were conducted on the right and left CIA&V. The literature search revealed very limited studies on the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA&V with no studies relating this orientation to lower limb oedema or sleeping positions during pregnancy. Cadaver dissection revealed a relatively direct anterior to posterior orientation left CIA&V and an oblique lateral to medial right CIA&V. This study suggests an explanation of why women lie on their left side when resting and sleeping during the third trimester due to the clinically relevant anatomy between the CIA&V.

N2  - Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not always been assessed. Aims: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy. Study design: Exposed and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and neurobehavioral factors and exposure status. Subjects: 67 infants (61 controls and 6 exposed to SRIs). Outcome measures: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale, APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference. Results: Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development, lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to unexposed infants. Conclusion: Results of this study show differences in autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness. Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and unexposed infants of depressed mothers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The role of SirT1 in reproduction is poorly understood. During times of caloric restriction, protein levels of SirT1 increase and reproductive functions such as LH pulses and ovulation cease. We hypothesize that the increased SirT1 levels regulate these changes somewhere along the HPG axis. To evaluate this, we have developed two mouse models containing altered neuronal SirT1 levels. The first model over-expresses SirT1 (OX) to mimic times of caloric restriction (CR), and the second model expresses a catalytically-inactive mutant form of SirT1 (MUT). We have observed that OX males weigh slightly less than control littermates, whereas there is no difference in MUT male weights versus control littermates. We do not see a difference in female weights, age at vaginal opening, or age at first estrus in either the OX or MUT lines. Food intake and insulin sensitivity by IP-ITT are unchanged in both male and female OX and MUT mice, however OX males, but not females, are glucose intolerant by IP-GTT. We are currently evaluating the effects of CR on these mouse models. At the reproductive level, we observe an increase in the number of days spent in estrus in OX females, but do not detect any difference in MUT females when compared to control littermates. We are currently evaluating plasma LH and FSH levels from each stage. Despite the prolonged estrus, when females in proestrus are paired with wild-type males, there is no change in the number of days to plug, number of days to first litter, or the number of pups at birth. Male OX or MUT mice do not show a reproductive defect as pairing with wild-type females resulted in the same number of pregnancies and litter size. We have also found that during a 3-day metabolic cage experiment OX females show increased physical activity during the dark phase and lost more weight than control littermates with no difference in food or water intake, RER, heat generation, or VO2 and VCO2. This difference in physical activity was confirmed in a circadian rhythm assessment with normal light dark cycles, a skeleton photoperiod or complete darkness, although there was no change in circadian rhythm. We are currently evaluating activity of the MUT mouse and preliminary evidence indicates that MUT females are less active than their control littermates. Taken collectively, elevated neuronal SirT1 increases physical activity and impairs ovulatory cycles, but mice are fertile when ovulation occurs.

N2  - Introduction: Initiation of continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy (CSII) requires an appropriate basal insulin-rate profile (BIR). Different approaches have been described, one of these proposed by Renner who suggests a circadian BIR profile. Objective: [i] To evaluate the features of the BIR in optimal glycemic control patients. [ii] To compare the BIR profile of these patients with the theoretical circadian distribution proposed by Renner. Materials and methods: Inclusion criteria:T1DM on CSII for at least one year with Hba1c <7% in absence of severe hypoglycemia. Pregnant patients were excluded. The hourly distribution of the BIR in the last 4 weeks was evaluated.BIR requirement and distribution were evaluated and compared with the model proposed by Renner. Results: Of the 53 patients screened, 14 (26%) met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The mean age 37.5 ± 7.75 yr, mean diabetes duration 17 ± 8.12 yr and mean HbA1c-levels 7.75 % for all patients and 6.6% in the optimal subgroup. The total daily insulin dose 37.4 ± 9.74 U/d (0.6 ± 0.12 U/kg/d) with 49.3% prandrial and 50.7% basal insulin. The number of self-monitored plasma glucose 7.6 ± 3.47 per day and the mean glucose level 138.9 DS 61.4 mg/dL. There was no correlation between the hourly BIR pattern monitored in these patients and the BIR circadian rhythm proposed by Renner, except in the middle hours of the day (12-19h). Conclusions: According to these results the initiation of CSII with circadian distribution of BIR is probably not indicated. The BIR profile should be programmed in hourly intervals, according to each patient, showing a bimodal profile with higher in the early morning (5-9 h) and in the afternoon (18-20 h) and a reduction 1-2 hours after breakfast.

N2  - Rational: Depression is prevalent among women of childbearing age and is frequently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). As some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Flx), can cross the placenta, it is possible that the neurodevelopment of the fetus may be affected, leading to altered behavior in adulthood. Objectives: In this study, we examined the effects of perinatal Flx exposure on the subsequent expression of circadian rhythms in adult mice. Methods: Dams were treated with 25 mg/kg/day Flx in their drinking water from embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 12. Circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed in the offspring starting at 6 weeks of age. Results: We found that perinatal Flx exposure led to larger light-induced phase advances (1.19 ± 0.51 vs. 0.55 ± 0.25 h), smaller phase advances to the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the mid-subjective day (0.44 ± 0.15 vs. 0.70 ± 0.17 h), and a shorter free-running period in constant darkness (23.47 ± 0.13 vs. 23.64 ± 0.13 h). Conclusions: These results suggest that perinatal exposure to SSRIs may have consequences for the functioning of the circadian system later in life. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objective: Using two cohorts born 29 years apart in Dunedin, New Zealand we aim to examine changes in risk factors and their associations with body mass index (BMI) at ages 3 and 7 years, and estimate their contribution to the secular changes in BMI at age 7 years. Methods: Birth weight and anthropometric measures at ages 3, 5 and 7 years were obtained for 974 participants in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS), born in 1972-1973, and 241 in the Family Lifestyle, Activity, Movement and Eating Study (FLAME), born in 2001-2002. Information about maternal age, education and smoking in pregnancy, as well as breastfeeding, children's television time and time in bed, was obtained by questionnaire. Results: The increase in BMI over the 29-year period was 0.84 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06) kg m-2 at age 7. A 1-unit difference in the mother's BMI was associated with a 0.06 (0.03, 0.08) kg m-2 difference in offspring in both studies; the 3.4 (2.8, 4.0) kg m-2 increase in the mothers' BMIs accounts for a change of 0.19 kg m-2 in the children's BMI. The much smaller generational increase in fathers' BMI (0.7 kg m-2) correspondingly had a more limited effect on change in child BMI over time (0.06 kg m-2). Although smoking in pregnancy decreased by 15% (8, 21) its association with BMI increased from 0.20 (-0.01, 0.42) in the DMHDS cohort to 1.24 (0.76, 1.71) kg m-2 in the FLAME cohort, contributing 0.18 kg m-2 to the increase in children's BMI. Conclusions: Societal factors such as higher maternal BMI and smoking in pregnancy contribute most to the secular increase in BMI, with changes in behavioural factors, including sleep and television viewing, having little effect in this setting. © 2012 International Association for the Study of Obesity.

N2  - Background: Physical symptoms are common in pregnancy and are predominantly associated with normal physiological changes. These symptoms have a social and economic cost, leading to absenteeism from work and additional medical interventions. There is currently no simple method for identifying common pregnancy related problems in the antenatal period. A validated tool, for use by pregnancy care providers would be useful. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory for use by health professionals. Methods: A list of symptoms was generated via expert consultation with health professionals. Focus groups were conducted with pregnant women. The inventory was tested for face validity and piloted for readability and comprehension. For test-re-test reliability, the tool was administered to the same women 2 to 3 days apart. Finally, midwives trialled the inventory for 1 month and rated its usefulness on a 10cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: A 41-item Likert inventory assessing how often symptoms occurred and what effect they had, was developed. Individual item test re-test reliability was between .51 to 1, the majority (34 items) scoring ≥0.70. The top four " often" reported symptoms were urinary frequency (52.2%), tiredness (45.5%), poor sleep (27.5%) and back pain (19.5%). Among the women surveyed, 16.2% claimed to sometimes or often be incontinent. Referrals to the incontinence nurse increased > 8 fold during the study period. Conclusions: The PSI provides a comprehensive inventory of pregnancy related symptoms, with a mechanism for assessing their effect on function. It was robustly developed, with good test re-test reliability, face validity, comprehension and readability. This provides a validated tool for assessing the impact of interventions in pregnancy. © 2013 Foxcroft et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Disrupting maternal circadian rhythms through exposure to chronic phase shifts of the photoperiod has lifelong consequences for the metabolic homeostasis of the fetus, such that offspring develop increased adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia and poor glucose and insulin tolerance. In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by which these poor metabolic outcomes arise, we investigated the impact of chronic phase shifts (CPS) on maternal and fetal hormonal, metabolic and circadian rhythms. We assessed weight gain and food consumption of dams exposed to either CPS or control lighting conditions throughout gestation. At day 20, dams were assessed for plasma hormone and metabolite concentrations and glucose and insulin tolerance. Additionally, the expression of a range of circadian and metabolic genes was assessed in maternal, placental and fetal tissue. Control and CPS dams consumed the same amount of food, yet CPS dams gained 70% less weight during the first week of gestation. At day 20, CPS dams had reduced retroperitoneal fat pad weight (-15%), and time-of-day dependent decreases in liver weight, whereas fetal and placental weight was not affected. Melatonin secretion was not altered, yet the timing of corticosterone, leptin, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations were profoundly disrupted. The expression of gluconeogenic and circadian clock genes in maternal and fetal liver became either arrhythmic or were in antiphase to the controls. These results demonstrate that disruptions of the photoperiod can severely disrupt normal circadian profiles of plasma hormones and metabolites, as well as gene expression in maternal and fetal tissues. Disruptions in the timing of food consumption and the downstream metabolic processes required to utilise that food, may lead to reduced efficiency of growth such that maternal weight gain is reduced during early embryonic development. It is these perturbations that may contribute to the programming of poor metabolic homeostasis in the offspring. © 2013 Varcoe et al.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes. METHODS: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168) at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events. RESULTS: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (<7 hours) was associated with higher interleukin (IL)-8 across time (β = 0.506, p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (<85%) was associated with higher IL-6 (β = 0.205, p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor α (β = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values <.053). Among depressed women, interferon-γ increased risk for preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.175, p = .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (β = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-γ and lower birth weight (β = -19.92, p < .069), and increased IL-8 and babies weighing less than 4000 grams (odds ratio = 0.72, p < .083) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships. Copyright © 2013 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disorders have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth (Okun et al., Sleep 2011). We sought to validate observations of sleep disturbance through pregnancy with preterm birth as it may represent a modifiable factor for some women. STUDY DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis from a prospective multi-center study. Pregnant women with singleton gestations were recruited in the first trimester and interviewed in three periods: 5-13, 14-26, and 27-36 weeks gestation. Participants completed a psychosocial questionnaire including The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Multiple demographic and birth outcome variables were assessed. Statistical analyses including logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: We enrolled 179 women in the 1sttrimesterand174and163 completed assessments in the second and third trimesters, respectively. Sleep disturbance scores increased progressively through pregnancy and were significantly higher in the 3rd vs. 1st and 2nd trimesters (p = .005). Twenty-five women delivered preterm (14%) at a mean gestational age of 34.3 ±0.35 wks (p<0.001). The number of women rating sleep as »very poor« in the first trimester was predictive of preterm delivery (p=0.025) as was the mean sleep disturbance score (p = .04). Logistic regression analyses showed the 1st trimester score was predictive of preterm delivery (OR=1.12, 95% CI [1.003-1.230]). Every unit increase in score yielded a 12% increase in risk of preterm birth. Second and third trimester PSQI scores were not associated with preterm birth. Depression scores were correlated with sleep disturbance at each time point. However, the depression screen, BMI, and smoking status were not correlated with preterm birth in this cohort. CONCLUSION: First trimester sleep disturbance is associated with preterm birth in multiple prospective studies. Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which poor sleep may contribute to preterm birth in order to develop potential interventions.

N2  - Background: 79% of the pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders and 70% of pregnant women have some of the depression symptoms. These disorders are the result of physiological changes, hormonal, physical, pregnancy which occur from different causes and can affect disorders before, during and after childbirth be involved in causing depression and may be aggravated by disregarding health behavior. Health behavior education may be useful for the management of depression among pregnant women. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of behavioral health sleep education on the improvement of depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders. Materials and Methods: This study is a randomized clinical trial on 96 pregnant women with sleep disorder (according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Question-naire).Tools for data collection included demographic questionnaire and Beck's Depression Inventory Questionnaire through which sampling was done in an easy and accessible, after sampling was randomly (simple) divided into control and case groups. The case group, health behavior sleep education were presented During a four-hour session in weeks 22, 23, 24 and 25 then followed up by fll out the Beck's Depression Inventory Questionnaire in the first meeting on the one month after intervention in week 29 of pregnancy and the second follow-up session two months later at 33 weeks by the subjects. The control group received no intervention, only routine prenatal care was provided to them. The results were assessed by Chi-square tests, independent t test and Fischer by SPSS version 18. Results: A statistically significant change was reported in the depression of pregnant women with sleep disorders in the intervention group (case) in comparison to the control group [29 week (p ≤ 0.024), 33 week (p≤ 0.026)]. Conclusion: Behavioral health sleep education improves the depression in pregnant women who are experiencing insomnia. Findings from this study add support to the reported effectiveness of behavioral health sleep education in the prenatal care and clinical management of insomnia in pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Objective assessments of the association between sleep apnea (SA) and glucose metabolism in pregnancy are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between objectively assessed SA in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a cohort of high risk pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: This was a planned subgroup analysis of data from a SA and preeclampsia study. Women with chronic hypertension, obesity, twin gestation and/or a history of preeclampsia (i.e., those at high risk of preeclampsia) who were between 6 and 20 weeks were recruited to participate in an overnight SA evaluation with a validated portable monitor. Women with pregestational diabetes were excluded. SA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > 5. The diagnosis of GDM was abstracted from the medical record and confirmed by a review of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) by study personnel blinded to the sleep study results. The relationship between SA and GDM was explored using univariable and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: AHI and OGTT results were available for 75 of the 80 women recruited. The mean gestational age at the sleep study was 17.1 ± 4.2 weeks. Twenty-six (35%) women had SA and 20 (25%) developed GDM. Women with SA differed from those without SA according to various demographic characteristics (Table). Women with SA were more likely to develop GDM (46.2% vs. 14.3%p = .003). After controlling for possible confounding factors including BMI, maternal age, and a history of chronic hypertension, SA remained independently and positively associated with the development of GDM (OR 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1, 13.3). CONCLUSION: Among high-risk women, SA during the first half of pregnancy is an independent risk factor for the development of GDM. Further research is needed to determine whether screening for and treatment of SA during pregnancy can lessen the frequency of GDM. (Table Presented).

These disorders are the result of physiological, hormonal, physical changes, that occur in pregnancy due to different causes including fetal sex and maternal blood group. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between fetal sex and maternal blood group with sleep disorders during pregnancy in the second and third trimester. Materials and Methods: This study was cross-sectional and data was collected with continuous sampling method, from 312 pregnant women with sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality based on standard questionnaires) in second and third trimester referring to two elected health centers in order to get prenatal care by the city of Maku in the Persian month Azar Bayjan Western University of Medical Sciences (University) and with using the personal and prenatal information forms completed by units research, and statistical methods to analyze data and analysis (frequency tables, Pearson, Spearman, ANOVA and Chi-squear) was used. Results: There was significant association between subjective sleep quality (p ≤ 0.000), sleep duration (p ≤ 0.04), sleep efficiency (p ≤ 0.025), sleep disturbance (p≤ 0.045) and sleep quality score (p ≤ 0.015) with maternal blood group. But among the sleep components only Subjective Sleep Quality (p = 0.21) and day time Say time dysfunction (p = 0.06) did not have relationship with fetal sex. Conclusion: Fetal gender is independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Although the added risk is relatively small, further investigation of the mechanisms underlying this association may contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications such as sleep disorders.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are prevalent due to physical and hormonal changes. Insufficient sleep causes metabolic and neuroendocrine alterations that may contribute to impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. There is little information about association between insufficient sleep and glucose metabolism during pregnancy. So, this study was done to investigate the relationship between sleep duration and results of glucose challenge test in pregnancy. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 177 pregnant women who referred to Iran, Mashhad health center n:3 in 2012. Participants were selected through available sampling method. All participants completed demographic questionnaire, depression, anxiety, stress scale 21 and Pittsburgh sleep quality index during 26-30 weeks of their pregnancy, then they undergo glucose challenge test. Short sleep duration was defined as less than 7 hours of sleep per night. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 11.5 and Pearson correlation test, Mann-whitney, independent t test and chi-square tests. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: 87 women (49.2%) had short sleep duration. Variables such as stress, anxiety, diet and exercise had no significant differences between two groups (p>0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between sleep duration and results of glucose challenge test (r=-0.19, p=0.01). Impaired glucose challenge test was significantly more prevalent in participants with short sleep duration (p=0.01). Conclusion: Short sleep duration is associated with impaired glucose metabolism in pregnancy and health care providers are advised to screen for sleep duration and quality.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to induce fetal brain growth deficits at different embryonic stages. We focused this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis at midgestation using activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)-9, a peptide (SALLRSIPA) derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, and NAP, a peptide (NAPVSIPQ) derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein. We used an established fetal alcohol exposure mouse model. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) group with 25 % (4.49 %, v/v) ethanol-derived calories, (2) pair-fed (PF) control group, (3) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9) group, (4) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of NAP (ALC/NAP) group, (5) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of ADNF-9 (PF/ADNF-9) group, and (6) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of NAP (PF/NAP) group. On day 15 (E15), fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ADNF-9 or NAP was administered daily from E7 to E15 alongside PF or ALC liquid diet exposure. Our results show that NAP and ADNF-9 significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of fetal brains. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP or ADNF-9 administration alongside alcohol exposure significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium of the cingulate cortex and ganglionic eminence. These findings may pave the path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during pregnancy stages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) are significant public health problems that lead to an increased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Decreased sleep duration is associated with increased rates of obesity in non-pregnant populations as well as with prolonged weight retention in postpartum women. We sought to determine if there is an association between decreased sleep duration and excessive GWG. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of non-diabetic women with singleton gestations from Feb 2011-Mar 2012. Maternal weight gain, 3rd-trimester sleep habits (collected over 7 days), and fetal/neonatal biometry were collected. Cohorts were defined as sleeping <7 and >7 hours/night on average. Student's T-test, Mann-Whitney U, and Chi-square analysis were used to compare groups. RESULTS: 35 women sleeping <7 hours/night were compared with 124 women sleeping >7 hours/night in the 3rd trimester. The average nightly sleep duration was 6.2 hours and 8.7 hours, respectively (p<0.001). Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups. There were no significant differences in overall weight change (38 vs. 32 lbs, p=0.15) or incidence of weight gain exceeding that recommended by the IOM (65.7% vs. 61.3%, p=0.63). Those sleeping <7 hours/night had a higher percentage of total weight gain in the 1st trimester (23.6% vs. 14.2%, p=0.03), however the percentages of total weight gained in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters were similar. There were no differences in estimated fetal weight, birthweight, or gestational age at delivery. CONCLUSION: Unlike non-pregnant populations, sleep duration during pregnancy, when measured in the 3rd trimester, is not associated with excessive GWG. This is likely due to altered physiology in pregnancy and additional factors contributing to sleep disruption. Additional data, especially sleep characteristics in the 1st and 2nd trimesters, is needed to further evaluate a possible association between sleep duration and weight gain in pregnancy.

N2  - Background: 79% of the pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders. Sleep disorders before, during, and after childbirth can affect the quality of life of pregnant women. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of pregnant women with sleep disorders in the second trimester. Materials and Methods: This study was cross-sectional study. Data was collected with continuous sampling method, from 100 pregnant women with sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality based on standard questionnaires) in second trimester referring to two elected health centers in order to get prenatal care at Maku (Western Azarbayjan University of Medical Sciences). Data was collected by using the personal information forms and the questionnaires summarized in the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL: BREF). Statistical methods (frequency tables, Pearson, Spearman and ANOVA) were used for data analysis. Results: The results indicate that mean of sleep quality was 8.62 ± 2.81 in pregnant women with sleep disorders or poor quality of sleep in the second trimester. Quality of life and four domains include: physical health, psychological health, social and environmental health related quality of sleep. Conclusion: Given that a large percentage of pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders, particularly in the second trimester, Hope this period, in addition to usual care, special programs for research, diagnostics and troubleshooting the cause of the disturbance takes place.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), marked by recurrent hy-poxemia-reoxygenation cycles with resultant systemic inflammation and oxidative vascular injury is independently associated with cardiovascular disease in the general population. We aim to estimate the incidence of cardiovascular disease among pregnant and reproductive aged women with OSA. STUDY DESIGN: 1008 consecutive women aged 15-40 who met criteria for OSA based on Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) during nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) from 2005-2012 at a tertiary care center were included. Sleep lab data and individual transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reports were reviewed. RESULTS: Among the cohort, 551 of 1,008 women (55%) had mild (AHI 5-15), 235(23%) had moderate (AHI 15-30), and 222(22%) had severe (AHI >30) OSA. Those with mild-moderate and severe OSA were similar in age, race, and body mass index. During PSG, the severe OSA group had higher AHI scores (62 ±31 v. 12 ±6), lower O2 nadirs in desaturation (SaO2 78±12 v. 83±9 mmHg), and more frequent percent of total respiratory time below 90% SaO2 (10 ±18 v. 3 ±12 %), p<.001 for each. The frequency of cardiac arrhythmias during PSG increased with OSA severity (20% mild-moderate v. 29% severe, p = .006). Of 250 who underwent TTE, 64 (26%) had evidence of heart disease: 22 had left ventricular hypertrophy (LV mass index >110g, 9%), 15 had pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure >40 mmHg, 6%), 13 had valve disease (5%), 8 had heart failure (ejection fraction <40%, 3%) and 50 (20%) had systolic or diastolic dysfunction. TTE abnormalities were similarly frequent within OSA severity groups (26% mild, 23% moderate, 28% severe OSA, p = .8). Among the 84 pregnant women, 38 had an echocardiogram. Pregnant and non-pregnant women had similar rates of severe OSA (19 v. 22%), cardiac arrhythmias (23 v. 22%) and abnormal TTE (28 v. 25%) (p>.5 for each). CONCLUSION: Pregnant gravidas with OSA have a 26% incidence of cardiac dysfunction. Echocardiogram should be considered during the clinical management of these women.

N2  - Objective To investigate the effects of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on the reproductive capability of the offspring. Design Using a sleep loss model or control home-cage group (male and females rats) to evaluate sexual behavior and hormonal profile in males and females F1 offispring. Setting Laboratory. Animals(s) First experiment: Pregnant females were exposed to sleep restriction (SR) protocol and the F1 generation was evaluated. Second experiment: male rats were submitted to SR or paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) protocol and the F1 generation was evaluated. Intervention(s) Male and female rats were subjected to sleep restriction (SR) for 21 days or paradoxal sleep-deprived (PSD) for 96 hours. Main Outcome Measure(s) Sexual behavior and hormonal levels during the adult phase were analyzed in F1 offspring of female and male rats submitted to sleep loss. Result(s) F1 male offspring of SR females had lower motivation for sex and reduced progesterone concentrations. In contrast, F1 female offspring displayed significantly enhanced proceptivity compared with control offspring. F1 female offspring also demonstrated hypersexuality by mounting the males in the absence of any significant hormonal alterations. F1 male offspring of SR or paradoxically sleep-deprived (PSD) males presented a decline in the sexual response, accompanied by a reduction in testosterone concentrations. Proceptivity was significantly increased among F1 female offspring of PSD and SR males compared with control offspring. Conclusion(s) SR in progenitors may alter sexual behavior of the F1 offspring in adulthood. These findings reveal far-reaching consequences of sleep deprivation, and suggest that parental sleep influences the reproductive capability of subsequent generations. © 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: While polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for diagnosis of OSA, it is cumbersome and expensive to perform. Several questionnaire-based scales for diagnosis have been developed and validated in non-pregnant subjects, namely the Berlin (BQ) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). We sought to ascertain the validity of these scales in pregnancy in order to establish the true prevalence of OSA in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Following sample sized estimation based on pilot data, the BQ and ESS were administered to low and high-risk gravidae at initial presentation. Screen positive subjects were referred to a certified sleep lab for PSG, and incentivization reimbursement was provided. All subjects were tracked and, if admitted for antepartum care, underwent a modified sleep study (ResMed ApneaLin (AL) recording continuous pulse oximetry and nasal airflow). RESULTS: 1507 subjects were enrolled (results summarized in Fig.). The prevalence of subjects who screened positive varied by method (15.1% BQ, 19.0% ESS, and 30.1% by either BQ or ESS); screening positive on the BQwas significantly associated with screening positive on the ESS (p<0.05). Neither the BQnor ESS were reliable diagnostic measures for OSA by either AL or PSG (ROC 0.45 for BQ, ROC 0.55 for ESS). Despite incentivization, written and verbal contact, andflex-bile scheduling, 86.8% of subjects did not undergo diagnostic testing. Among 13.2% received PSG or AL, neither the BQ nor ESS were predictive of OSA and a higher than expected AL-negative rate was observed (92.6%). Among those screen positive subjects undergoing PSG or AL testing, 14.5% ultimately met OSA diagnostic criteria for an estimated point prevalence of 4.35%. CONCLUSION: In the largest reported prospective trial on OSA to date, we have observed that while screening by either Berlin or Epworth scales maybe validated measures in non-pregnant subjects, it is poorly predictive among gravidae. These findings raise concern for studies which report OSA-linked outcomes without corroborating PSG diagnostic criteria having been met. (Graph Presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of pregnancy related diabetes and hypertensive disease associated with obstructive sleep apnea. STUDY DESIGN: This study used data from the 1998-2009 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS). Among hospital discharges for women who were pregnant or gave birth, we used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify discharges with and without a diagnosis of OSA. The outcomes of interest were gestational diabetes (n = 2,489,181), pre-eclampsia (n = 1,798,066), eclampsia (n = 56,395), gestational hypertension (n = 1,798,066), and preterm labor (n=4,889,853). We assessed trends in OSA-related discharges among maternal discharges using jointpoint regression. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), using SAS survey procedures to account for the NIS sampling design. RESULTS: During the study period, there were a total of 55,781,965 pregnancy-related discharges. The rate of OSA from 1998-2009 was approximately 3.0 discharges per 10,000. However, the 1998 rate of 0.73 per 10,000 climbed to 7.3 per 10,000 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for age, race, and household income, women with OSA demonstrated an increased odds of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and preterm labor. Even after further adjustment for selected clinical conditions, including maternal obesity, OSA still remained risk factor for each outcome, except preterm labor. CONCLUSION: The rate of OSA-related discharges among pregnancies has increased over the decade. OSA is independently associated with increased risks of pregnancy related gestational diabetes, and hypertensive diseases, including preeclampsia and eclampsia. Given public health implications of OSA complicating pregnancy, attention should be paid to reversing the trend of increasing OSA in women of reproductive age. (Table Presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In a number of cross sectional and retrosprective studies, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been reported to bear a possible association with gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. We sought to explore the association of OSA (as determined by diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) and questionnaire-based screening) with adverse perinatal outcomes in a large, population-based prospective cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Two screening measures (Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)), were administered to enroll 1507 eligible gravidae. Screen positive subjects were referred to a sleep lab for PSG, or administered ResMed ApneaLin testing if admitted to the antepartum unit. Primary (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and birthweight) and secondary outcomes (gestational age and neonatal outcome) were measured in univariate and multivariate analysis. Stratified analysis and logistic regression models controlling for potential confounders were used to estimate the odds ratio of associations (STATA and SPSS). RESULTS: 1156 subjects delivered at the study hospitals and were eligible for outcome analysis. As demonstrated in the table, screening positive on either questionnaire was associated with preeclampsia but only among overweight and obese subjects (adjusted odds ratio of 8.05 (95% CI 2.5-25.9) for overweight subjects and 2.04 (95% CI 1.2-3.4) for obese subjects). Paradoxically, testing positive for OSA by PSG or AL was negatively associated with adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: This is the largest prospective trial on OSA in pregnancy identified to date. Of particular interest, stratified and logistic regression modeling suggest that only among overweight and obese gravidae do OSA screening measures demonstrate significant association with an adverse pregnancy outcome. Taken together, our results suggest that the risk of adverse outcomes arises from the combination of habitus and symptoms, indicating a far more complex relationship which will require further study.

N2  - Objective To investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and to evaluate factors associated with RLS in a population of Iranian pregnant women. Methods In the present cross-sectional study, 443 consecutive pregnant women admitted for delivery underwent an interview within 2 days of parturition. The diagnosis of RLS was established by the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The severity of RLS was assessed through the IRLSSG Rating Scale. Results Seventy-nine (17.8%) women met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with most (74.7%) having RLS of moderate severity. The mean RLS duration before delivery was 3.1 ± 2.1 months among 69 (87.3%) women; 10 (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Sleep disturbances including insomnia and early awakening were significantly more common among women with RLS than among those without (P < 0.001), and the frequency of cesarean delivery was also significantly higher (58.2% versus 44.5%, P = 0.027; odds ratio 2.4). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, number of pregnancies, folate and iron supplementation, hemoglobin level, and neonatal anthropometric data. Conclusion Restless legs syndrome is common during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep and an increased risk of cesarean delivery.

N2  - Objective To assess sleep practices, and investigate their relationship with maternal and fetal outcomes, among pregnant Ghanaian women. Methods In a cross-sectional study conducted at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana, between June and July 2011, postpartum women were interviewed within 48 hours of delivery about sleep quality and practices during pregnancy. Interviews were coupled with a systematic review of participants' medical charts for key outcomes including maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Results Most women reported poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Snoring during pregnancy was independently associated with pre-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.5; P = 0.007). The newborns of women who reported supine sleep during pregnancy were at increased risk of low birth weight (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-20.2; P = 0.025) and stillbirth (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.5-43.2; P = 0.016). Low birth weight was found to mediate the relationship between supine sleep and stillbirth. Conclusion The present findings in an African population demonstrate that maternal sleep, a modifiable risk factor, has a significant role in pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, and subsequently stillbirth. © 2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We previously reported an increased risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity associated with maternal sleep disorders but the mechanism of the finding is unknown. We sought to evaluate the effect of severe sleep disturbance on umbilical cord plasma biomark-ers of hypoxia and inflammation. STUDY DESIGN: A nested prospective cohort study was performed of term pregnancies enrolled in a sleep disorders protocol. Subjects completed validated sleep questionnaires to assess for sleep duration; hy-persomnolence and symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (Ep-worth Sleepiness Scale and Berlin Sleep Questionnaire). Severe sleep disturbance (SSD) was defined as <5 hours per night of sleep along with an abnormal sleep survey. Neonatal respiratory morbidity was defined as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Umbilical cord blood at delivery was collected and erythropoietin (Epo), highly sensitive C-reactive peptide (hs-CRP) and Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sV-CAM-1) levels were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using chi square and Wilcoxon test; P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The cohort included 57 women. Comorbid conditions included obesity (30%), gestational diabetes (6%) and chronic hypertension (8%). Among the cohort, 12% had SSD. Women with SSD compared to those without had a similar delivery gestational age (38±1.2 weeks vs. 39±1, p=0.21) and birthweight (3141±491 vs. 3330±429gm p=0.36) but had more neonatal respiratory morbidity (50 vs. 7.6%, p=0.003). They also had similar levels of umbilical cord s-VCAM-1 (2783 ±685 vs. 2892 ±330ng/ml,p=0.82) and Epo (45 ±7 vs. 31±14,p=0.94 mIU) but had a higher level ofhs-CRP (177±75 vs. 61±50 ng/ml, p=0.02) compared to women without SSD. CONCLUSION: Severe sleep disturbance was associated with more neonatal respiratory morbidity and higher umbilical cord hs- CRP levels. Further investigations are needed to identify the mechanisms linking neonatal respiratory morbidity and maternal sleep disturbance.

N2  - Study Objectives: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. Design, Setting, and Participants: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP. Intervention: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure. Measurements and Results: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). Conclusions: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have reported a decrease in fetal growth associated with sleep disruption. We sought to evaluate the effect of severe sleep disruption on neonatal birthweight. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was performed. Women with term pregnancies completed validated sleep questionnaires assessing hypersomnolence and symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Berlin Sleep Questionnaire). Severe sleep disturbance (SSD) was defined as <5 hours per night of sleep along with an abnormal sleep survey. After delivery neonates underwent anthropometric measurements within 72 hours of birth. Statistical analysis was performed using chi square, Student t-test for normal distribution and Wilcoxon test for non-parametric distribution; Forward stepwise regression was performed to control for factors that affected birthweight and ponderal index. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The cohort included 57 women and 38% of the women were classified as obese. Comorbid conditions included gestational diabetes (6%) and chronic hypertension (8%). Amongthe cohort, 12% had SSD. Women with SSD compared to those without were more likely to have prepregnancy obesity (71 vs. 31%, p=0.04) but had a similar delivery gestational age (38±1.2 weeks vs. 39±1, p=0.21), similar birthweight (3330±429 vs. 3141±491,p=0.36) and similar ponderal index (2.8 ±0.3 vs. 2.84 ±4, p = 0.8). Obese women when compared to normal weight women had neonates with similar birthweight (3416 ± 646 vs. 3251±386gm, p=0.2) but higher ponderal index (2.9 ±0.3 vs. 2.7±0.3, p = 0.02). Neonatal birthweight was predicted by gestational age (β =0.53,p<0.001) and prepregnancy obesity (β =0.28,p=0.02) but not SSD (β = -.121,p=n.s.) After controlling for comorbid conditions, prepregnancy obesity (β=0.32, p=0.02) but not SSD (β = -.117, p = n.s.) was predictive of neonatal ponderal index. CONCLUSION: Obesity is associated with severe sleep disturbance. In this cohort of full term neonates, it is obesity rather than sleep disturbance that appears to affect neonatal adiposity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol affects 1 in 100 births in the United States resulting in neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities. Development of the nervous system, including myelination and differentiation, are dependent on soluble and membrane bound receptors. Alterations in these may underlie abnormal development due to in-utero alcohol exposure. Prenatal therapy with neuropeptides (NAP + SAL) prevents some of the developmental and behavioral abnormalities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of alcohol and NAP + SAL in cellular signaling pathways. STUDY DESIGN: We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol (0.03mL/kg IP), alcohol+NAP+SAL (20fxg IP) or control (saline) was administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 30 minutes, 60 minutes or 10 days. MAP kinase, SRC and STAT cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Milli-pore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol increased phosphorylation of JNK in the embryo at 30 and 60min compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 60min (Figure). Similarly alcohol increased phosphorylation ofp38 at 30min and NAP + SAL returned levels to control. These findings persisted at 10 days. No differences were found in the phosphorylation of ERK. The levels at these timepoints were undetectable for the SRC and STAT pathways. CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation of the JNK andp38 cell signaling pathways are affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Targeting cell signaling pathways, such as with NAP+SAL, should have a significant impact on prevention of alcohol-induced abnormalities. (Graph Presented).

N2  - A 31-year old pregnant female complained skin itching and sleep disturbance at 14 weeks of her second pregnancy. At 20 weeks of the pregnancy, jaundice was noted and she was admitted to our hospital. Despite of intensive examination, including assays for viral infections and auto-antibodies such as anti-nuclear antibody, etiology of the jaundice-causing hepatitis was not determined. Since hepatoprotective therapies did not improve her liver function or fetal ascites diagnosed by ultrasonography, termination of pregnancy was performed at her and her family's desire at 21 weeks and 6 days of her pregnancy. Immediately after the termination, her liver function turned to be improved. Two weeks after the termination, however, serum levels of transaminases were sharply re-elevated (i.e., 367 IU/mL in ALT). Based on the histological diagnosis for AIH, predonisolone therapy (40 mg/body) was started, showing favorable response to ameliorate her liver function immediately. Although trigger for both maternal AIH and fetal ascites was unclear, breakdown of maternal-fetal immune tolerance might be involved. © 2013 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Postpartum depression (PPD) is common and screening recommended as part of obstetric care. This abstract identifies other health risks from PPD in addition to concern for the new mother's mental health. STUDY DESIGN: The sample of 822 women with depression screening at 1 yr postpartum (PP) by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was drawn from 2510 participants in the NIH Community Child Health Network (CCHN), a national five-site, mixed urban, suburban and rural study of women 18-40 years of diverse backgrounds. CCHN was conducted according to principles of community-based participatory research to better understand multi-level sources of parental stress and resiliency on pregnancy outcomes. Participants were enrolled primarily in-hospital immediately following delivery. They were interviewed at 1, 6, and 12 mo PP. Medical records provided preconception and delivery information. A score > 13 on the EPDS was considered high risk for PPD. RESULTS: The average EPDS score was 5 at each interview in the first year PP. 4.6% of women scored > 13 at 1 mo, 5.2% at 6 mo, and 6.4% at 1 yr PP. Of women high risk on the EPDS at 1 mo, 20.5% remained high risk at 6 mo and 23.5% were still high risk at 1 yr. However, women who were > 13 at 6 mo or 1 yr, had a higher score at 1 mo compared to women who stayed screen negative (8 vs. 4) (p<0.001). Median EPDS at 6 and 12 mo PP were persistently higher for those who screened positive at 1 mo PP (9 vs 4 at each time point). Contrary to prior reports, being high risk for PPD at 1 mo was not associated with PP weight retention at 1 yr. However, high risk EPDS scores at 1 mo were associated with less maternal sleep at 6 mo PP, a higher likelihood of smoking (p<.05), not using birth control (p<.01), and becoming pregnant again by 6 mo PP (p<.05). CONCLUSION: Postpartum depression signals a series of risks to the mother, including ongoing depression, inadequate sleep, smoking, and rapid repeat pregnancies. All are of high relevance to obstetric providers and demand additional focus and intervention.

N2  - Itching is a common complaint in pregnancy, occurring in up to 14 to 23% of women. Pruritus may be so severe that it affects sleep and quality of life. It has a prevalence of 0.7 to 5% in different populations.1 Prevalence is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and varies between populations worldwide. In Chile, 2.4% of all pregnancies are affected with a 5% prevalence in women of Araucanian-Indian origin.1 Obstetric cholestasis (OC) (also referred to as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy) is a multifactorial condition of pregnancy characterized by pruritus in the absence of a skin rash with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), neither of which has an alternative cause and both of which resolve after delivery.2 Investigations to exclude other causes of pruritus and of abnormal LFTs should be performed. Obstetric cholestasis has a potential for fetal risks, which may include spontaneous preterm birth, iatrogenic preterm birth and fetal death. Intense pruritus causes. Maternal morbidity and sleep deprivation. An interdisciplinary management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy by dermatologists, hepatologists, gynecologists and pediatricians is absolutely mandatory.

N2  - Background. Shift-work is suggested to affect fetal development negatively. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm changes may disturb fetal growth or lead to complications during pregnancy. Exposure to constant light is an environmental stressor that can affect the circadian system and has been shown to induce neurochemical and behavioral changes when used during the prenatal and/or postnatal period in experimental animals. However, studies investigating long-term effects of constant light in the offspring are sparse. Methods. An accidental power outage resulted in pregnant females being housed under constant light (LL) conditions for seven days of the offspring perinatal development (embryonic day 20 to postnatal day 4). The long-term effects of constant light on the behavior in the adult offspring were assessed by means of open field, object recognition, and water maze tests. Results. In adulthood, LL-animals displayed an intact recognition memory and no deficits in spatial learning or memory. In the open field test, LL-animals exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior, observed as significantly more thigmotaxis and less ambulation. These results were confirmed in the other behavioral tests as the LL-animals spent less time exploring the objects in the object recognition test, and showed thigmotactic behavior also in the water maze test. Conclusion. The results confirm that early life experience can cause changes in brain development that shape brain function and add to the sparse literature on long-term effects of constant light conditions during perinatal development on specific behaviors in adulthood. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - There are increasing data about the association between bronchial asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important contributor to asthma control and can aggravate asthma exacerbation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which is the main line of treatment in OSA can improve asthma outcomes. Aim of the present study: To assess the prevalence of OSA in patients with stable uncontrolled asthma and to study the effect of CPAP treatment on the asthma condition. Subjects and methods: Sixty subjects with uncontrolled bronchial asthma were included in the study, mean age was 46. ±. 13. years, there were female predominance (75%), all patients were not smokers, pregnancy and patients in acute exacerbation were excluded, after detailed history taking and physical examination pulmonary function tests and asthma control test were applied to all patients to assess the asthma control, then polysomnography was done to all patients and those proved to have OSA were offered CPAP treatment and followed up for 6. weeks then assessed again for asthma control test, pulmonary function tests and day - time sleepiness. Results: Fifteen patients out of the 60 patients included in the study proved to have OSA, Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) was 23.5. ±. 10.9/h of sleep, CPAP treatment improved significantly the AHI (from 23.5. ±. 10.9 to 2.3. ±. 2.1/h of sleep, p<. 0.01), but there was no significant improvement in asthma control test or in the pulmonary functions (ACT was 13.97. ±. 3.52 before CPAP and became 14.1. ±. 3.97, p>. 0.05 after CPAP, FEV1% pred. was 60.1. ±. 6.9 before CPAP and became 61.2. ±. 6.2, p>. 0.05 after CPAP. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea should be screened for in all patients with uncontrolled bronchial asthma, CPAP treatment may improve asthma quality of life but not improving the pulmonary function tests. Larger studies are needed to fully address the impact of CPAP on asthma condition in patient with both asthma and OSA. © 2013 The Egyptian Society of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis.

N2  - Introduction: Sexual dysfunctions are highly prevalent among men and women. Pregnancy is one of the predisposing factors of sexual dysfunctions and it is associated with a wide variety of physical and psychological causes as well. The aim of this study was to compare sexual dysfunctions of men before and during pregnancy of their wives. Methods: This study was a descriptive-analytical and cross sectional and retrospective study in which, 100 men whose wives had experienced recent pregnancy were surveyed. Subjects were selected through multi stage sampling and they were given a researcher-made questionnaire measuring sexual dysfunctions in men before and during their wives' pregnancy. Collected data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical tests using SPSS software version 16. P value less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Results: Remarkable numbers of men have experienced at least one of the sexual dysfunctions before and during their wives' pregnancy. Dysfunctions included premature ejaculation, sleep ejaculation, masturbation, impaired erection, altered sex drive and inability to reach orgasm, respectively. Wilcoxon test also revealed a significant relationship between altered sex drive, inability to reach orgasm and premature jaculation in subjects before and during their wives' pregnancy (p<0.01). Conclusion: Intensity of some sexual dysfunctions increase in men during their wives' pregnancy. So, it is suggested that education about sexual issues should be considered for couples particularly for men during their wives' pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To present a patient with a novel mutation in the SLC6A5 gene encoding the presynaptic glycine transporter-2 (GlyT2) confirming hyperekplexia mimicking severe, early onset, medically refractory epilepsy. Methods: Retrospective case note analysis. Results: An 11-month-old female presented with focal seizures 6 hours after birth. At 3 months old, she was described to have daily focal tonic seizures, generalised tonic vibratory seizures with cyanosis and myoclonic jerks refractory to anti-epileptic drugs prior to paediatric neurology review. She was born to third degree consanguineous parents at 36 weeks gestation with good apgars. Pregnancy was complicated by abnormal ('knockin') foetal movements, maternal hypertension, Takayasu's arteritis and obstetric cholestasis. Family history was not contributory. She had feeding difficulties and exaggerated startle responses with whole body rigidity triggered by unexpected loud noise, movement and touch. She demonstrated no habituation to glabellar tap with exaggerated head retraction reflex with repetitive tapping of the tip of the nose. A tonic vibratory episode with rigidity and cyanosis was triggered in the prone position. She had moderate motor delay, good cognition and a large umbilical hernia. Detailed neurometabolic investigations, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and an electroencephalogram were normal. Tonic cyanotic episodes resolved with 30 lg/kg/day of clonazepam. Parents were taught the forced flexion manoeuvre. Anti-epileptics were discontinued. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of exon 1-16 later revealed a novel homozygous c.808C>T p.Gln270X mutation in exon 4 of the SLC6A5 gene. Currently, she has periodic limb movements during sleep, hypnagogic myoclonus and has made good developmental progress. Conclusions: Sequence analysis may identify novel mutations to confirm hyperekplexia which may mimic epilepsy or rarely present in combination with epilepsy. Mutations in the SLC6A5 gene may increase the risk of cyanotic episodes with increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Clonazepam is the drug of choice.

N2  - Background: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders. Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population. Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women's Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS. Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach's alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1. α= 754; Factor 2. α= 524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established. Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: Narcolepsy is a rare disorder classified as hypersomnia of central origin. Its core symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. Associated symptoms, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, automatic behavior, and sleep fragmentation, are unspecific. Genetic, autoimmune, and environmental factors contribute to hypocretin deficiency. Areas covered: This article focuses on therapies for narcolepsy symptoms and comorbid disorders. Despite the enormous increase of knowledge about narcolepsy's pathologies no substance has been developed that can cure the disease. So far hypocretin substitution is not available. Substances targeting the autoimmune mechanism have failed to show objective improvement despite subjective improvement. The standard medication in adults comprises stimulants and anticataplectics. Only few substances are capable of improving core and associated symptoms. Within the last years, only modafinil and its enantiomer armodafinil and sodium oxybate have been approved as new substances. Expert opinion: The choice of stimulants to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy needs to be expanded and anticataplectic medication needs to be approved for the indication. Head-to-head comparisons between the established medications, studies of high evidence in older non-evidence-based medications, in children, pregnant women, and of behavioral therapy need to be performed including the long-term effects on metabolic and cardiovascular risks. Narcolepsy is a model disease for so many sleep disorders, among which it has the most severe daytime sleepiness. New insights into its etiology have advanced sleep medicine immensely. Still it stays an orphan in terms of treatment options which are challenging because narcolepsy covers so many symptoms from neuropsychological metabolic-, cardiovascular-, endocrinological-, movement disorders, and parasomnias to name a few. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Aim: To describe the prevalence of paediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms in extremely low gestational age infants and identify neonatal risk factors, including early exposure to hypoxia and hyperoxia. Methods Patients: <28weeks gestation were monitored with high-resolution pulse oximetry. Hypoxia/hyperoxia variables were defined as percentage time of first 4weeks of life that SaO2<80% or SaO2>98%, respectively. Parents completed part of the OSA-18 questionnaire for symptoms of SDB at 18-22months. Logistic regression was used to test the association between risk factors and sleep symptoms. Results: Of 182 patients recruited, 138 (76%) completed the questionnaire. The mean gestation was 26weeks, and mean birth weight 887 grams. Loud snoring (21%) and restless sleep (24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of loud snoring (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.13-6.5). Prolonged mechanical ventilation, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged caffeine use, however, were inversely correlated with loud snoring. Neither neonatal hypoxia nor hyperoxia were associated with sleep symptoms. Conclusions: While the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms is similar to reported rates, we found a sex difference not previously reported. Interestingly, markers for severity of illness show a pattern of being protective against loud snoring. © 2012 The Author(s)/Acta Pædiatrica.

N2  - Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested. © 2013, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2013, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects not only mothers, but also entire families. Postpartum follow-up should address emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and child-related factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother's lack of satisfaction with the baby's sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of visual impairment in the diabetic population. Its multifactorial pathogenesis, including metabolic abnormalities such as chronic hyperglycemia, hypertension, and other systemic and ocular risk factors, is believed to damage the blood-retinal barrier, thereby lending to increased fluid extravasation and accumulation within the macula. Inflammation and vascular dysfunction compromises the state of retinal neurons, thus causing loss of visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively and systematically review the literature for the clinical risk factors in persistent DME. Methods Used: A literature search was performed using PubMed to look for risk factors and treatment response in persistent DME. Selected relevant studies were interpreted and classified according to pathophysiology or clinical relevance for inclusion in this review. Priority was given to large, randomized studies; single case reports, editorials, and non-English articles were excluded. Summary of Results: A total of 65 studies and articles were included in this review. Systemic factors found to increase the incidence and risk of DME were: race and ethnicity, glycemic control (including duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, pregnancy, and insulin treatment), hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy and proteinuria, anemia, sleep apnea, and the use of glitazones. Ocular risk factors found included: leaking microaneurysms, peripheral ischemia, retinal inflammation, and vitreoretinal adhesion. Conclusions: While the precise etiology of DME has yet to be fully elucidated, there is a wide array of factors that may cause and/or exacerbate retinal damage from macular edema. In turn, modifying these risk factors may lead to better outcomes in DME management. As new therapies for persistent DME emerge, it is important to consider these risk factors in the future treatment of diabetic patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed potential early-life factors and their interrelationships with obesity among young Canadian children. METHODS: Data from a nationally representative sample of children aged 6 to 11 years in the Canadian Health Measures Survey were analyzed. The associations of perinatal and early childhood behaviours and socio-economic factors with overweight or obesity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PARFs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 968 term-born children, 21% were overweight and another 13% were obese. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.15) was positively associated with obesity. This association was mediated by birth weight (suppression effect); once controlled, the strength of the association between smoking and child obesity increased by 12%. Birth weight per 100 g (1.05; 1.005-1.09) was significantly associated with obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (0.44; 0.31-0.61), adequate sleep hours (0.39; 0.16-0.94) and being physically active (0.50; 0.26-0.93) were found to be protective. Breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, significantly reduced obesity risk among children whose mothers never smoked in pregnancy. PARFs indicated that 24.4%, 11.5%, 11.3% and 6.0% prevalent cases of child obesity might be prevented by exclusive breastfeeding, smoking cessation during pregnancy, adequate sleep during childhood, and avoiding high birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified multiple perinatal and childhood factors associated with obesity in young Canadian children. Effective prevention strategies targeting four modifiable maternal and child risk factors may reduce childhood obesity by up to 54% in Canada. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2013.

N2  - Leucorrhea also spelled leucorrhoea, flow of a whitish, yellowish, or greenish discharge from the vagina of the female that may be normal or that may be a sign of infection. It is mucous discharge which represents desquamation of vaginal epithelial cells because of the effects of estrogen on the vaginal mucosa. It is important to distinguish leucorrhea from pathologic discharge. Leucorrhea usually does not cause irritation but some adolescents worry that it may represent an infection. A total health building scheme is essential for the removal of the systemic toxicity which is primarily responsible for the disease Leucorrhoea. The study aimed to examine whether women presenting with a primary complaint of vaginal discharge is more likely to be normal or infectious. We have done a survey in women of Karachi (sample size n=200 and age group= 14-40) presented at clinics, hospitals, colleges and other different public places with and without a primary complaint of vaginal discharge. Survey was scrutinized using common language of General Health Questionnaire and general Interviews. Women presenting with a primary complaint of vaginal discharge were significantly more likely due to extreme fatigue, not performing healthy lifestyle (eating disorder, never exercise, sleeplessness), dirty environmental sanitation, during pregnancy, before and after normal menstrual cycle, a marker of poverty, and low social integration. It is a domain of gender disadvantage, psychosomatic and women who live under severe stress and worries develop leucorrhea were associated with vaginal discharge in the multivariate model. Pakistani women presenting with vaginal discharge by virtue of unhealthy lifestyle. This research highlights the need for training of medical professionals and council to maintain hygiene. A total health-building scheme is essential for the removal of the systemic toxicity which is primarily responsible for the disease leucorrhoea. Such a scheme should consist of correct dietary habits, proper sleep, exercise, fresh air and sunshine. © 2010 IRJP.

N2  - Background: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder affecting multiple systems with many manifestations relating to hypothalamic insufficiency. Clinically significant central hypoventilation has been described in older children with PWS, but has not been reported in infancy. Case report: We report a male infant with PWS presenting with recurrent apnoeas, starting in the neonatal period. The infant was born at term, normal delivery following an uneventful pregnancy to non-consanguineous, Caucasian parents. Birth weight was 3100g. He required admission to Special Care Baby Unit following a dusky episode at 8 hours of age and had a full septic screen which was negative. Clinically he exhibited weak cry, poor suck, generalised hypotonia with normal deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral undescended testicles. On further investigations, microsatellite analysis established the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome due to an imprinting defect. On day 15 of life, he was discharged home on bottle feeds. At 4 weeks of age he was re-admitted to hospital after a blue episode at home. He was noted to have frequent episodes of apnoea followed by shallow breathing with desaturation. Polysomnography showed prolonged periods of episodic breathing and episodic apnoea during sleep. ECG, cranial MRI scan, 48 hours EEG, video telemetry and neurometabolic work up were all normal. Genetic test for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (PHOX2B) was negative. Treatment with caffeine was ineffectual. Low flow nasal cannula oxygen significantly reduced the periodic breathing and apnoea. He was discharged on home oxygen and apnoea monitor. His recurrent apnoeas represents a severe phenotype possibly due to the rare genetic imprinting mechanism of his PWS. Conclusion: This case report highlights the importance of central hypoventilation as a possible respiratory problem in young infants with PWS. Early assessment and continued support for these children and families are vital to prevent any further complications.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Some professional associations advocate bedsharing to facilitate breastfeeding, while others recommend against it to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and suffocation deaths. A better understanding of the quantitative influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration is needed to guide policy. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal data were from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, which enrolled mothers while pregnant and followed them through the first year of infant life. Questionnaires were sent at infant ages 1 to 7, 9, 10, and 12 months, and 1846 mothers answered at least 1 question regarding bedsharing and were breastfeeding at infant age 2 weeks. EXPOSURES: Bedsharing, defined as the mother lying down and sleeping with her infant on the same bed or other sleeping surfaces for nighttime sleep or during the major sleep period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival analysis to investigate the effect of bedsharing on duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding. RESULTS: Longer duration of bedsharing, indicated by a larger cumulative bedsharing score, was associated with a longer duration of any breastfeeding but not exclusive breastfeeding, after adjusting for covariates. Breastfeeding duration was longer among women who were better educated, were white, had previously breastfed, had planned to breastfeed, and had not returned to work in the first year postpartum. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Multiple factors were associated with breastfeeding, including bedsharing. Given the risk of sudden infant death syndrome related to bedsharing, multipronged strategies to promote breastfeeding should be developed and tested.

N2  - Background: After the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection has turned into a chronic disease and the patient's profile has changed dramatically. We are now treating patients that are active both socially and professionally, in whom virological response has already been achieved and quality of life has become of utmost importance, directly correlated with the management of drugassociated adverse reactions. To describe this new patient profile, we present the management of a young family, living with HIV for more than 7 years. Case report: A family was referred to our clinic in the summer of 2012, by the Italian HIV Clinic where they had been under medical evaluation for over 7 years. They had tested positive at the routine pregnancy test 7 years back, when the mother was started on lopinavir/r, lamivudine +zidovudine. She gave birth to a healthy HIV-negative girl, who received postpartum prophylaxis for 3 months (as per Italian protocol). After delivery the mother was switched to efavirenz plus lamivudine +zidovudine, the same therapy as her husband's, a regimen they would both take for 7 years. In 2012 they moved to Romania and started attending our clinic. Both had undetectable viral loads and high CD4 counts (>700 cells/cmm), consistent with their medical history. However, both complained of lipodystrophy. The female also complained of peripheral neuropathy, sleep disturbance, vivid nightmares while the male presented increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, irritability and sleep disturbance. Because their quality of life had started to decrease, after psychological evaluation and support, therapy was changed to raltegravir, abacavir +lamivudine (both had negative HLA-B∗5701). This regimen was well tolerated, the symptoms improved, the CD4 count remained high, the male's lipid profile returned to normal, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) evaluation at 3 months showed an almost normal lipid distribution for both patients, with a slight tendency toward android abdominal lipid distribution for the female patient. She remained undetectable (data available for 1 year follow-up), however, in the case of the male patient HIV-RNA rose to 320 copies/mL at 3 months, possibly associated with the impact of the drug regimen on viral reservoirs. At 6 months, the viral load became undetectable and remained that way to date. Conclusion: Correct and prompt management of adverse reactions is an important aspect in patients on antiretroviral therapy, since this may lead to improved quality of life and better social and professional integration of patients.

N2  - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman's ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4-15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≥9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m(2) ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≥9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

N2  - Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem in developing countries. We investigated possible risk factors for cervical cancer in rural areas of Wuhan China using a matched case-control study with 33 women diagnosed with cervical cancer and 132 healthy women selected from the same area as matched controls. A questionnaire, which included questions about general demography conditions, environmental and genetic factors, the first sexual intercourse, first marriage age, age at first pregnancy, pregnancy first child's age, female personal health history, social psychological factors, dietary habits, smoking and alcohol status and other living habits was presented to all participants. At the same time, HPV infection of every participant was examined in laboratory testing. Results showed HPV infection (P<0.000, OR=23.4) and pregnancy first child's age (P<0.000, OR=13.1) to be risk factors for cervical cancer. Menopause (P=0.003, OR=0.073) was a protective factor against cervical cancer. However, there was no indication of associations of environmental (drinking water, insecticide, disinfectant) genetic (cancer family history), or life-style factors (smoking status, alcohol status, physical training, sleep quality), including dietary habits (intake of fruit and vegetable, meat, fried food, bean products and pickled food) or social psychological factors with cervical cancer. The results suggest that the risk of cervical cancer in Chinese rural women may be associated with HPV infection, menopause and the pregnancy first child's age.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder that is often seen in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the association between RLS and multiple sclerosis (MS) is still unclear and RLS is not considered as one of the MS symptoms. This study was conducted to assess the frequency of RLS and its associated factors in patients with MS. This was a cross-sectional study conducted during January and April 2010. A total of 205 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (164 females, 41 males, mean age 32.8 ± 8.9 years) were enrolled in the study and underwent a medical history interview and a neurological examination. The diagnosis of RLS was based on International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Criteria. 57 patients (27.8 %) met the RLS diagnostic criteria. In 90.1 % of the patients, the onset of RLS was simultaneous with or followed by MS onset. There was no significant difference between patients with and without RLS in respect of age, gender, disease duration, and MS pattern. There was an increased incidence of leg jerks before sleep in patients with RLS (P = 0.04). In patients suffering from RLS, there is greater complaint of insomnia (P = 0.03). Body mass index, history of anemia, excessive day-time somnolence, consuming caffeine-containing beverages, pregnancy numbers, smoking, and alcohol consumption were not associated with the presence of RLS. This study revealed high prevalence of RLS in MS patients. Screening of RLS in these patients should always be considered to improve management of MS. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors transduce low arterial O(2) tension into increased action potential activity on the carotid sinus nerves, which contributes to resting ventilatory drive, increased ventilatory drive in response to hypoxia, arousal responses to hypoxia during sleep, upper airway muscle activity, blood pressure control and sympathetic tone. Their sensitivity to O(2) is low in the newborn and increases during the days or weeks after birth to reach adult levels. This postnatal functional maturation of the CB O(2) response has been termed "resetting" and it occurs in every mammalian species studied to date. The O(2) environment appears to play a key role; the fetus develops in a low O(2) environment throughout gestation and initiation of CB "resetting" after birth is modulated by the large increase in arterial oxygen tension occurring at birth. Although numerous studies have reported age-related changes in various components of the O(2) transduction cascade, how the O(2) environment shapes normal CB prenatal development and postnatal "resetting" remains unknown. Viewing CB "resetting" as environment-driven (developmental) phenotypic plasticity raises important mechanistic questions that have received little attention. This review examines what is known (and not known) about mechanisms of CB functional maturation, with a focus on the role of the O(2) environment. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite free distribution of insecticide treated nets in Nigeria, the use it as a means of malaria prevention and control has not been fuIly embraced.
AIM: The aim of this survey was to determine the level of awareness, ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets among residents of Abavo community, Delta State Nigeria
METHOD: It is a descriptive cross-sectional survey conducted among 250 heads of households.
RESULT: One hundred and seventy five (70%) respondents were aware of insecticide treated net as a means of prevention against malaria, 111 (44%) claimed to own insecticide treated nets. On further inspection of houses of those who claimed to own ITNs, seventy four (66%) actually had theirs hanged, the rest were either in their packs or not seen. Ninety five (38%) respondents out of the total sleep under insecticide treated net. About 92 (70%) households having under-five and 39 (81.3%) of households having pregnant women claim to use ITNs. It was observed that the level of education (chi2 = 48.35, p = 0.001), presence of under 5 children in a household ?2 = 7.229, p = 0.027) influenced ownership of Insecticide treated nets. In conclusion despite a high level of awareness about ITN found in this survey, ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets were low.

N2  - The present study was designed to identify the association between work hours and obesity in Korean adult manual and nonmanual workers, and to determine whether there is a gender difference in this association. Methods: The study was conducted using Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected between 2007 and 2010. Individuals aged below 25 or over 64 years, pregnant women, part-time workers, soldiers, housewives and students were excluded. The total number of individuals included in the analysis was 8,889 (5,241 male and 3,648 female subjects). The outcome variable was obesity, defined as body mass index ≥25 kg/m2. Variables considered in the model were age, education, income, marital status, alcohol drinking, smoking, daily energy intake, physical activity, sleep hours per day, the type of job, work hours, and work schedule. Work hours were categorized as <40, 40-48 (reference), 49-60, and >60 hours per week. Results: In the multiple SURVEYLOGISTIC regression analyses, the adjusted odds ratio of obesity for long work hours (>60 hours per week) in male manual workers was 1.647 (95% confidence interval 1.262-2.151). Long work hours did not significantly increase the odds ratio for obesity in male nonmanual workers and female manual and nonmanual workers. Conclusions: More than 60 work hours per week increased the risk of obesity in Korean male manual workers. This result might be helpful in preventing obesity in Korean adult workers, especially male manual workers.

N2  - Objective To explore the status of women's quality of life and analyze risk factors related diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Methods We applied the method of convenient sampling to investigate 61 patients with DOR (DOR group) and 60 women with normal ovarian reserve function (control group) who visited a reproductive centre of a Triple-A hospital from February to May 2013, using a questionnaire which included basic information table, Menopausal Quality of Life Scale (MENQOL) and SF-36 Health Survey for quality of life, and Kupperman Index Scale (KI) for the degree of clinical symptoms. Ten, statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 software. Results Compared with the control group (43.60±16.82), the level of women's quality of life in the DOR group (73.42±24.15) was significantly lower (P<0.01), while the degree of clinical symptoms was significantly higher (P<0.01). There were positive associations between quality of life and degree of clinical symptoms. Te risk factors related to DOR were various such as age, weight, quality of sleep, menstrual disorders, number of abortion, age of the first pregnancy, gynecologic surgery, economic income, education, family relationship, unsatisfactory sexual life, and psychological factors. Conclusion In order to improve women's quality of life, effective treatment should be conducted to relieve clinical symptoms of women with DOR. Good life style, harmonious family relationship, healthy mind and avoiding the risk factors, which could effectively help the prevention and treatment of the disease. © 2013 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

N2  - This paper describes the importance of diabetic retinopathy in the loss of visual function. We exposed the most important risk factors, such as diabetes duration, poor metabolic control, pregnancy, puberty, hypertension, poor control of blood lipids, renal disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. We describe the pathogenesis of the disease, small retinal vessel microangiopathies which produce extravasation, edema and ischemia phenomena. We put special emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its pathogenic importance. They are also described the main clinical symptoms as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard and soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), venous disorders, formation of new vessels and diabetic macular edema (the latter being the most common cause of vision loss). Finally we describe the latest diagnostic techniques and eye treatment, with special emphasis on obesity surgery importance as more important preventive factor to eliminate the predisposing and precipitating disease symptoms.

N2  - Menopause means a definitive end of the generative ovarian function and mostly occurs in women aged 40-58. It is well-known that the sooner it occurs the more serious consequences may result, even in the case of early menopausal hormone therapy. The most serious short-term consequences of menopause are menopausal symptoms (depression, hot flushes, sleep disorders, loss of libido), while long-term estrogen deficiency leads to osteoporosis, cardiovascular system diseases, depression, neurodegenerative diseases, urogenital area atrophy, skin and sense organ disorders. Therefore, an important task is to select women at risk of premature termination of the ovarian function. An important issue thus appears to be identification of factors influencing the age of the last natural menstrual period. Analysis of heritability results has brought the conclusion that the age of menopause is a multifactorial trait. The proportion of the impact of environmental and genetic factors, however, was not precisely estimated. Among environmental determinants the influence of many factors is being considered, including reproductive factors (related to the reproductive period), such as age of menarche, number of pregnancies and children, socio-economic factors, such as education, economic status, health determinants, such as the use of oral contraceptives or lifestyle-related factors, such as physical activity and the use of stimulants. Among the genetic factors, a genetic polymorphism of genes encoding enzymes of the estrogen biosynthesis pathway and other independent markers scattered throughout the genome (linkage studies and genome-wide association studies - GWAS) is taken into consideration.

N2  - Background: There is a high association between disturbed (poor quality) sleep and depression, which has lead to a consensus that there is a bidirectional relationship between sleep and mood. One time in a woman's life when sleep is commonly disturbed is during pregnancy and following childbirth. It has been suggested that sleep disturbance is another factor that may contribute to the propensity for women to become depressed in the postpartum period compared to other periods in their life. Post Natal Depression (PND) is common (15.5%) and associated with sleep disturbance, however, no studies have attempted to provide a sleep-focused intervention to pregnant women and assess whether this can improve sleep, and consequently maternal mood post-partum. The primary aim of this research is to determine the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational sleep intervention compared with a control group to improve sleep management, with a view to reduce depressive symptoms in first time mothers.Method: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 214 first time mothers during the last trimester of their pregnancy. Participants will be randomised to receive either a set of booklets (control group) or a 3hour psychoeducational intervention that focuses on sleep. The primary outcomes of this study are sleep-related, that is sleep quality and sleepiness for ten months following the birth of the baby. The secondary outcome is depressive symptoms. It is hypothesised that participants in the intervention group will have better sleep quality and sleepiness in the postpartum period than women in the control condition. Further, we predict that women who receive the sleep intervention will have lower depression scores postpartum compared with the control group.Discussion: This study aims to provide an intervention that will improve maternal sleep in the postpartum period. If sleep can be effectively improved through a brief psychoeducational program, then it may have a protective role in reducing maternal postpartum depressive symptoms.Registration details: This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register under the registration number ACTRN12611000859987. © 2012 Kempler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbances in late pregnancy are common. This study aimed to survey sleep problems in third trimester pregnant women and to compare sleep in the pre-pregnancy period with the third trimester.Methods: Third-trimester women (n=650) were sent a postal survey containing questions relating to sleep experience, including perceived sleep quality, sleep difficulties, night waking, sleep environment, snoring, daytime tiredness and daytime napping. Time periods reported on were before pregnancy and in the last week. Results: Respondents numbered 244 (38%). Before pregnancy, the mean reported duration of night-time sleep was 8.1 (SD 1.1) hours; in the last week this had decreased to 7.5 (SD 1.8) hours (p<.0001). Only 29% rated their sleep quality in the last week as very good or fairly good, compared with 82% rating their sleep this way before the pregnancy. The main reasons for sleeping difficulties were discomfort (67%) and pain (36%). Snoring increased significantly over the course of the pregnancy, with 37% reporting snoring often or every night in the last week. Those with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of greater than 25 were significantly more likely to snore (p=.01). Only 4% of women had an abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (i.e. >10) prior to pregnancy, whereas in the last week 33% scored in the abnormal range. Likewise, 5% had regularly napped during the daytime before pregnancy, compared with 41% in the last week. Conclusions: Sleep problems are common in women in late pregnancy, and increase markedly compared with before pregnancy. © 2012 Hutchison et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to prospectively examine the impact of chronic vs pregnancy-onset habitual snoring on gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Study Design: Third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a large, tertiary medical center from March 2007 through December 2010 and screened for the presence and duration of habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep-disordered breathing. Clinical diagnoses of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes were obtained. Results: Of 1719 pregnant women, 34% reported snoring, with 25% reporting pregnancy-onset snoring. After adjusting for confounders, pregnancy-onset, but not chronic, snoring was independently associated with gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-3.77; P <.001) and preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.37; P =.024) but not gestational diabetes. Conclusion: New-onset snoring during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In view of the significant morbidity and health care costs associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, simple screening of pregnant women may have clinical utility. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Acupuncture for tension-type headache in pregnancy: a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Aim: This study was undertaken to test, under real-life conditions, the effects of acupuncture on headaches during pregnancy and compare this with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone. Methodology: Forty-three conventionally treated (lifestyle modifications and stretching) pregnant women were randomly allocated into two groups to routine care or acupuncture. The severity and disability caused by this pain and its affect on mood, sleep and work were assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The main end-point was the mean difference between the first and the last interview after eight weeks of treatment. Secondary end points were the changes over time in the NRS assessments of pain intensity, disturbances in mood, sleep and working and the use of medications.Differences between initial and final sessions were analyzed by a two-sample test. Changes over time in the NRS assessment were analyzed by the Fisher exact test. Mood's test for medians was used and a p-value < 0.05 indicated a significant difference. Results: All women completed the treatment. No important adverse effects related to acupuncture treatment or to pregnancy's outcome were reported. Significant improvements were demonstrated for pain at the end of the trial in the study group, 3.9 vs 1.7 difference in favor to acupuncture group (p< 0.05). This group also used less medication and had a greater improvement in mood and sleep when compared with the control group. Conclusions: This study suggests acupuncture alleviates tension-type headaches during pregnancy. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

N2  - This archival cross-sectional investigation examined the impact of mood, reproductive status (RS), and age on polysomnographic (PSG) measures in women. PSG was performed on 73 normal controls (NC) and 64 depressed patients (DP), in the course of studies in menstruating, pregnant, postpartum, and peri-and postmenopausal women. A two-factor, betweensubjects multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test the main effects of reproductive status (RS: menstrual vs pregnant vs postpartum vs menopausal) and diagnosis (NC vs DP), and their interaction, on PSG measures. To further refine the analyses, a two-factor, between subjects MANOVA was used to test the main effects of age (19 to 27 vs 28 to 36 vs 37 to 45 vs 46+ years) and diagnosis on the PSG data. Analyses revealed that in DP women, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage was significantly elevated relative to NC across both RS and age. Significant differences in sleep efficiency, Stage 1%, and REM density were associated with RS; differences in total sleep time, Stage 2 percentage, and Stage 4 percentage were associated with differences in age. Both RS and age were related to differences in sleep latency, Stage 3 percentage, and Delta percentage. Finally, wake after sleep onset time, REM percentage, and REM latency did not vary with respect to RS or age. Overall, this investigation examined three major variables (mood, RS, and age) that are known to impact sleep in women. Of the variables, age appeared to have the greatest impact on PSG sleep measures, reflecting changes occurring across the lifespan. © 2012 LLS SAS.

N2  - Purpose of review: This article aims to draw together recent thinking on pregnancy and obesity, with a particular emphasis on prevention strategies and emerging clinical complications. Recent findings: New studies including a large meta-analysis have highlighted that weight reduction strategies are not associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes, and there are suggestions that an approach of dietary modification alone may be associated with reduction in gestational weight gain. These findings are critically discussed with reference to future planned trials. New literature regarding hitherto under-reported complications of obesity in pregnancy such as ischaemic heart disease, schizophrenia and sleep disorders is highlighted. Summary: There will be a need to focus on obesity prevention in the pregnant population as resources will not be adequate to the increasing incidence of the problem. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Introduction: Across a 24-hour day, time is disproportionately distributed between sleep, sedentary time (sitting or lying with low energy expenditure), light-intensity activity, and moderatevigorous intensity activity (MVPA). Individually, physical activity and healthful sleep (∼8 hr/night) are beneficially associated, while sedentary time is detrimentally associated, with health outcomes. The relationship between these behaviors may also be important, with preliminary evidence suggesting physical activity and healthful sleep are related. However, the magnitude and direction of these relationships, and their impact on health outcomes, are unclear. This study explored the impact of alternating the time spent in these different behaviors (sleep, sedentary time, light-intensity time, MVPA time) on chronic disease biomarkers. Methods: Data from the cross-sectional, 2005-2006USNational Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed, adjusting for the complex sampling design. Adults aged 30 to 74 years with 4 + days of accelerometer data and selfreported sleep duration were included in analyses (N = 3,238). Adults with sleep disorders and pregnant/lactating women were excluded. Cardiovascular (Framingham Risk Score and homocysteine levels), adiposity (body mass index and waist circumference), inflammatory (C-reactive protein), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR and HOMA-B), and hyperinsulinemia biomarkers were examined. Isotemporal substitution methods were used to estimate replacement effects for accelerometer-derived activity (MVPA: > 1951 cpm; light-intensity: 100-1951 cpm; sedentary: < 100 cpm) and reported sleep time (duration, sleep onset latency) variables on selected biomarkers. Results: After adjustment for study covariates (age, gender, ethnicity, income, smoking, depression, and energy intake) and time spent in other activities, replacing 30 min/day of sedentary time with 30 min/day of MVPA was associated with improved levels for all biomarkers (p < 0.02 to 0.0001) with the exception of homocysteine. Replacing 30 min/day of sedentary time with 30 min/day of extended sleep duration was associated with improved cardiovascular (p < 0.04 to 0.01), insulin resistance (p < 0.05 to 0.0004), and hyperinsulinemia (p = 0.03) biomarkers, but not adiposity or inflammatory biomarkers. Light intensity activity and sleep onset latency replacement effects were equivocal across biomarkers. Discussion: On average, replacing sedentary time with accelerometer-derived MVPA or self-reported sleep duration, even after controlling for other activities, was associated with improvements in a range of important biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Future research should explore these replacement associations longitudinally using objective methods to assess sleep parameters.

N2  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. Study Design: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P <.05 considered significant. Results: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P <.003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P <.003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1β were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - The objective of this study was to examine which factors during pregnancy and postpartum predict pelvic girdle pain (PGP) at 12 weeks postpartum among working women. A total of 548 Dutch pregnant employees were recruited in 15 companies, mainly health care, child care, and supermarkets. The definition of PGP was any pain felt in the pelvic girdle region at 12 weeks postpartum. Participants received questionnaires at 30 weeks of pregnancy and at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum with demographic, work-related, pregnancy-related, fatigue, psychosocial, PGP-related and delivery-related questions. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Almost half of the women experienced pain in their pelvic girdle at 12 weeks postpartum. However, the level of pain and the degree of disability due to postpartum PGP was low. Pregnancy-related predictors for PGP at 12 weeks were history of low back pain, higher somatisation, more than 8 hours of sleep or rest per day, and uncomfortable postures at work. The pregnancy and postpartum-related predictors were: more disability at 6 weeks, having PGP at 6 weeks, higher mean pain at 6 weeks, higher somatisation during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum, higher birth weight of the baby, uncomfortable postures at work and number of days of bed rest. Based on these results, it is concluded that extra attention should be given to women who experience PGP during pregnancy to prevent serious PGP during late pregnancy and postpartum. More research is needed to confirm the roles of hours of sleep, somatisation, and bed rest in relation to PGP. © 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Chiari I malformation (CM-I) manifests with tonsillar herniation below foramen magnum. These patients are at high risk of respiratory depression and bulbar dysfunction in the perioperative period with underlying obstructive sleep apnea. However, the safe use of both general and regional anaesthesia has been documented in a known CM-I parturients. We describe the successful management of a patient who had hypercapnic respiratory failure in the post-anaesthetic care unit following an uneventful subarachnoid block for left knee replacement surgery. This patient was retrospectively diagnosed with occult CM-I and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in the postoperative period.

N2  - Objective: To examine the continuity and discontinuity of trouble sleeping behaviors (TSB) from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood in a community-based prospective birth cohort study. Methods: The original study comprised 7223 mother-offspring pairs who were followed prospectively at pregnancy, 6. months, 5, 14 and 21. years post-delivery. Participant numbers differ by follow-up stages. There were 3184 offspring for whom we have consistently collected information on TSB retrospectively at 2-4. years, and prospectively at 14 and 21. years of age. Results: These comprised maternal-reported offspring TSB at 2-4. years and 14. years, and offspring-reported trouble sleeping at 14 and 21. years. One in two children had persistent trouble sleeping from 2-4 to 14. years and two-thirds from 14 to 21. years. In the adjusted analysis, compared with 2-4-years-old children with no trouble sleeping, those who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.44) times more likely to have trouble sleeping at 21. years. Similarly, adolescents who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.27) times more likely to experience trouble sleeping at 21. years. Conclusions: There is a continuity of TSB from early childhood through adolescence and young adulthood, although the persistence of TSB is strongest from adolescence to young adulthood. Interventions improving sleep in young children may prevent longer term difficulties in adolescents and young adults. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - This narrative review explains the development of excess weight gain in babies and children. It takes a life course approach which includes genetics, pre-conception, pregnancy, infancy and childhood. The paper focuses on feeding behaviours, physical activity, parental influences and the wider social and environmental context. Risk factors which can cumulatively lead to excess childhood weight gain include: under- or overweight during pregnancy; the presence of diabetes during pregnancy; low or high birth weight; having obese parents; early weaning; prolonged formula feeding; rapid weight gain in the first year; disinhibited eating patterns and the consistent availability of energy dense food at home; feeding practices which are not responsive to the child's cues; insufficient sleep among preschool children; sedentary parents; low parental education; living in poor socio-economic circumstances; absence, or perceived absence, of safe play areas; parents who lack time or confidence to authoritatively parent; environments where there is poor access to affordable lower energy dense foods; and parents who do not accept that excess weight is a health problem. Recommendations for health professionals are made. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Research shows that obesity prevention has to start early. Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2-6 years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity. Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n = 5,902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n = 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 11/2 year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements. If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.

N2  - Doxylamine succinate, an H1-antihistamine drug, is commonly used as sleep-inducing agent as well as therapy for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. At usual doses, it may cause impairment of cognitive and psychomotor performance, anticholinergic effects, agitation and postural hypotension. Besides, since this drug is frequently involved in either accidental or intentional overdoses, it seems relevant to bear in mind other possible toxic effects. We report a case of acute severe hyponatremia in the setting of a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), an apparent new adverse effect linked to doxylamine overdose. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship between doxylamine intake and SIAD development. SIAD may be considered as a potential, serious adverse reaction of doxylamine overdose. Clinicians should consider this aetiological possibility when attending patients suffering from hyponatremia.

N2  - Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Afar Region. Distribution of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (LLINs) has been one of the major interventions to combat malaria. However, ownership and utilization of these nets are not well known. A community based cross-sectional study was conducted using interviewer-administered questionnaires to study LLIN coverage. After systematic random sampling of the study population, data on utilization of LLINs and factors influencing this utilization were collected. Analysis of these data was done using SPSS software. Household possession of at least one LLIN in the surveyed households was found in 648(86.1%) households. Ownership of at least two nets was found among 419(55.6%) surveyed households. The proportion of children under 5 years of age who slept under treated nets during the night preceding the survey was 728(82.0%) and 676 (76.1%) in the surveyed households for reported and observed respectively. Likewise, the proportion of pregnant women who slept under treated nets was 166 (79.1%) and 147(70.0%) for reported and observed respectively. Among the potential determinants explored regarding utilization of LLINs, age, occupation, and radio possession were found to be significantly associated with LLIN utilization. Households that did not possess radio were 0.38 times (95%CI= 0.25-0.59) less likely to let their children under five and pregnant women sleep under LLIN. The LLINs coverage and utilization among the pastoralist community are promising. Strengthening of the primary health care unit and timely replacement of LLINs are critical for improved outcomes.

N2  - Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.

N2  - In many cultures and countries alcohol is an integral part of the social lifestyle and cultural celebrations. Once the legitimate age for alcohol consumption is reached there are few reasons for the complete abstinence of alcohol consumption, with the exception of pregnancy. The detrimental effects of alcohol consumption during this time are well documented and policy recommendations are clear in their abstinence message. Based on these directives it is apparent that education campaigns to reduce alcohol consumption antenatally have been effective. Internationally policy direction for alcohol consumption in the postnatal period is unclear and often non-existent despite that postnatal alcohol consumption in lactating women also has the potential to cause harmful effects in the new born infant. Alcohol enters the breastmilk within 30 - 60 minutes after maternal ingestion and if transferred to the infant through the breastmilk can result in immediate changes in sleep-wake patterning behaviours. Research surrounding recommendations for lactating women is limited due to ethical reasons, however with correct timing alcohol consumption during the period of lactation is a possibility. There have been recommendations for caution in consuming alcohol while breastfeeding for some years however these have often not been discreet from the recommendations for pregnancy. Currently alcohol policy differs considerably both internationally and within the same country. Unlike the universal adoption of public health policy for abstinence during pregnancy the implementation of policy for breastfeeding women has been less progressive. It is anticipated that the universal adoption of congruent alcohol policy will help support the safe consumption of alcohol and promote the extended duration of breastfeeding. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Active fragments of neurotrophic factors release by astrocyte under the stimulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) respectively, have shown therapeutic potential for developmental delay and learning deficits. Previous work demonstrated that NAP+SAL prevent developmental delay and glial deficit in Ts65Dn that is a well-characterized mouse model for Down syndrome. The objective of this study is to evaluate if prenatal treatment with these peptides prevents the learning deficit in the Ts65Dn mice. Pregnant Ts65Dn female and control pregnant females were randomly treated (intraperitoneal injection) on pregnancy days 8 through 12 with saline (placebo) or peptides (NAP 20 μg +SAL 20 μg) daily. Learning was assessed in the offspring (8-10 months) using the Morris Watermaze, which measures the latency to find the hidden platform (decrease in latency denotes learning). The investigators were blinded to the prenatal treatment and genotype. Pups were genotyped as trisomic (Down syndrome) or euploid (control) after completion of all tests. Statistical analysis: two-way ANOVA followed by Neuman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons, P<0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. Trisomic mice who prenatally received placebo (Down syndrome -placebo; n = 11) did not demonstrate learning over the five day period. DS mice that were prenatally exposed to peptides (Down syndrome-peptides; n = 10) learned significantly better than Down syndrome -placebo (p<0.01), and similar to control-placebo (n = 33) and control-peptide (n = 30). In conclusion prenatal treatment with the neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) prevented learning deficits in a Down syndrome model. These findings highlight a possibility for the prevention of sequelae in Down syndrome and suggest a potential pregnancy intervention that may improve outcome.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and maternal and neonatal morbidities in a cohort of obese gravid women. Methods: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to screen for OSA and describe the possible risk factors for and outcomes of OSA among obese (body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]] 30 or higher) pregnant women. Women underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor. Studies were manually scored by a central masked sleep reading center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea hypopnea index of 5 or more was considered diagnostic of OSA. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women with and without OSA. Results: Among 175 women, OSA prevalence was 15.4% (13 mild, 9 moderate, 5 severe). Compared with no OSA (apnea hypopnea index less than 5), the OSA group had a higher BMI (46.8±12.2 compared with 38.1±7.5; P=.002) and more chronic hypertension (55.6% compared with 32.4%, P=.02). Maternal complications included maternal death (n=1, amniotic fluid embolus [no OSA group]) and cardiac arrest (n=1, intraoperative at cesarean delivery [OSA group]). One previable birth and two stillbirths occurred in the no OSA group. Among live births, OSA was associated with more frequent cesarean delivery (65.4% compared with 32.8%; P=.003), preeclampsia (42.3% compared with 16.9%; P=.005), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (46.1% compared with 17.8%; P=.002). After controlling for BMI, maternal age, and diabetes, OSA (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-11.3), previous preeclampsia (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.09-7.19), and hypertension (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.67-10.77) were associated with development of preeclampsia. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea among obese pregnant women is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and cesarean delivery. © 2012 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Growing interest has been driven by the discovery of a tight relationship between prenatal manipulations and development of health disorders. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and behavioral deficits in adolescents and adults that have experienced prenatal exposure to adverse conditions.1,2 It is known that sleep deprivation leads to many physiological alterations, 3 which could result in other consequences if they happen during pregnancy. There is evidence that sleep deprivation triggers oxidative processes in various organs and tissues, including specific brain regions.4 Thus, our objective was to analyze developmental programming effect of maternal sleep deprivation on physiological, behavioral and oxidative metabolic processes in adult male mouse offspring. Pregnant female Swiss mice aged 3 months were distributed into five groups: one group was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 0-3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for 6 hr on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3); and a last group which could sleep normally (CT). After sleep deprivation, homocysteine, cysteine, corticosterone, estrogen and progesterone concentrations were measured from the experimental mothers and time-matched controls. Interestingly, we found a loss in the maintenance of pregnancy in all experimental groups compared to CT animals. The sizes and weights of the male pups were measured at various stages throughout the experiment. At the 3rd month of age, behavioral parameters (locomotor activity and anxiety) of male offspring were assessed. After, they were euthanized, blood was collected for biochemical analysis and the hypothalamus dissected for molecular evaluation. Real time PCR assays were used to measure levels of mRNAs encoding methyltransferases and antioxidant enzymes. Dams plasma progesterone concentrations decreased in the PSD 72 group, and the levels of plasma estradiol increased in GH 2. Corticosterone levels were found to increase after all sleep-deprivation procedures. Dams homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 but decreased in the PSD 72 group. The offspring of GH 1 mothers exhibited decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Although no behavioral changes were observed, exposure to sleep deprivation had a long-lasting impact on tissue weight; in particular, there was a decrease in hemilateral epididymal fat weight in mature animals from the PSD 72 group. We found no alteration in the expression of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1 and 3a as well as in the antioxidant enzymes (catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase) expression. Although some of the alterations observed in the mothers (elevated estrogen and corticosterone levels and decreased progesterone) might have played a role in the permanent alterations in the adult offspring, probably they were not the main cause. We found no differences in the DNMTs expression in the hypothalamus of the offspring, but epigenetic alterations could have important implications for development of health disorders.5,6 The homocysteine changes detected in the sleep-deprived dams may contribute to redox changes, controlling gene expression and shaping epigenetic development.7,8,9 Moreover, the role of maternal exposure to environmental issues such as sleep deprivation could interfere in the establishment of adult diseases.

N2  - This study assessed the links between maternal sleep and mothers' perceptions of their attachment relationship with their infant among women at risk for postpartum depression by virtue of having been depressed during pregnancy. Sixty-two mothers completed sleep diaries and questionnaires at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Regression analyses, controlling for depression severity and infant temperament, revealed significant prospective correlation between maternal shorter total sleep time at 3 months and lower scores on a mother-infant attachment questionnaire at 6 months. At 6 months, the longer time mothers were awake tending to their infants the lower were their attachment scores. The findings suggest that improving sleep of mothers who suffered from prenatal depression may have a positive effect on mothers' self-reported relationship with their infants. © 2012 The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Review recent research on the roles of gender, race/ethnicity, residential socioeconomics and age in obstructive sleep apnea syndromes (OSA) and their treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Men have a higher prevalence of OSA than women and require higher continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressures for treatment, given similar severity of OSA. When comparing age, women have less severe apnea at all ages. Menopause, pregnancy and polycystic ovarian syndrome increase the risk for OSA in women. Neck fat and BMI influence apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) severity in women; abdominal fat and neck-to-waist ratio do so in men. Obesity, craniofacial structure, lower socioeconomic status and neighborhood disadvantage may better explain ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA. Ethnicity was no longer significantly associated with OSA severity when WHO criteria for obesity were used. SUMMARY: OSA has a male predominance; women have a lower AHI than men during certain stages of sleep; women require less CPAP pressure for treatment of similar severity of OSA, and there are ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA but these may be due to environmental factors, such as living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

N2  - Despite scaled-up coverage of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) in malarious areas of sub-Saharan Africa, proper and regular ITN use remains inadequate. An understanding of what determines ITN use could help improve effectiveness. In early 2011, a household-level, questionnairebased survey of ITN practices was conducted following a mass distribution program. The goal was to assess post-intervention Plasmodium infection, and whether households used ITNs to protect target groups such as pregnant women and children. Following a complete enumeration of all households (∼3,340), each one was censused for all residents and surveyed. Pre-school children were tested for presence of parasites using PCR methods. Questions of household heads involved who slept under what ITN the previous night, as well as age and sex. Data analysis involved spatial methods and regression models tailored to account for nonlinear patterns in age-related ITN use. GIS methodologies were used to determine spatial patterns of ITN use and malaria cases. Information on 12,095 individuals aged 90 years old was gathered, of which ∼25% were <5 years of age. More than half (56%) of people reported not sleeping under an ITN the previous night. Age was an important determinant of ITN use. Adults over 30 and infants sleep under ITNs more than children and young adults. The distribution of age and ITN use followed a significant (p <0.001) nonlinear pattern, decreasing from birth to age 18, increasing to and remaining constant after age 30. This pattern was significant even when accounting for confounding factors. Differences in gender were not significant for any age group, but women between the ages of 15 and 30 tended to use ITNs more than males. Household-level clusters of Plasmodium infections were associated with fewer children sleeping under nets, and were geographically located in wet, low lying areas closer to the lake, despite high levels of net use and possession. Though ITNs were found to be effective in reducing Plasmodium infections, spatially, evidence suggests that net possession and use were highest in areas prone to nuisance mosquitoes and possible perception of high malaria risk. Results suggest that ITN use may be high among some members of higher-risk groups, however there is inadequate coverage among young and school-age children. Efforts to further scale up ITN possession and programs to focus messages regarding proper use remain necessary.

N2  - Purpose: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data from routine well-child assessments at ages 0-4 years. Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11-17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0-4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories. Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43). Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

N2  - Obesity in men is associated with infertility in numerous studies, and the temporal trend for a decline in semen parameters parallels the increasing prevalence of obesity in the developed world. In addition to impaired semen quality, fertility among obese men may be affected by decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. This spectrum of expression of hypogonadism among obese men originates from multiple interacting factors including reduced levels of gonadotropins and testosterone, altered androgen-to-estrogen ratios, insulin resistance, and sleep apnea. No evidence-based treatment that increases the likelihood of pregnancy for the infertility associated with male obesity has been demonstrated to date. Interventions associated with improvement of intermediate outcomes that include the endocrine profile, semen parameters, and sexual function may be appropriately selected based on history, physical findings, as well as endocrine and metabolic evaluation. Among these interventions are weight loss through lifestyle change, relief from sleep apnea, use of aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin administration, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and insulin-sensitizing agents.

N2  - Background Average annual fertility rates in industrialised countries have been below two children per woman for the past 3 decades. The reasons behind women's childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of awareness regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome the 'biological clock' may be contributory factors. Objective A narrative review guided by the research question: What do women need to know about the consequences of delayed childbearing in order to make informed decisions about their fertility? Discussion There are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing and; some women's ideas about their fertility don't match the 'the scientific facts'. General practitioners are well placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research is needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.

N2  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a non-pregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in brain regions known to regulate the sleep/wake cycle and body temperature might reflect altered rhythms in these overt functions. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS in early pregnant and diestrous rats in the medial septum (MS), vertical and horizontal diagonal bands of Broca (VDB and HDB), perifornical lateral hypothalamus (LH), and ventrolateral, medial, and median preoptic areas (VLPO, MPA, and MnPO, respectively). In the pregnant animals, FOS expression was reduced and the daily rhythms of expression were lost or attenuated in the MS, VDB, and LH, areas known to support wakefulness, and in the MPA, a brain region that may coordinate sleep/wake patterns with temperature changes. However, despite the well-documented differences in sleep patterns between diestrous and pregnant rats, reproductive state did not affect FOS expression in the VLPO or MnPO, two brain regions in which FOS expression usually correlates with sleep. These data indicate that plasticity in sleep/wake patterns during early pregnancy may be driven by a reduction in wakefulness-promotion by the brain, rather than by an increase in sleep drive. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Purpose: Identify epilepsy-associated factors and calculate measures of impact, stigma, quality of life (QOL), knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) and treatment gap in Prey Veng, Cambodia. Methods: This first Cambodian population-based case-control study had 96 epileptologist-confirmed epilepsy cases and 192 randomly selected matched healthy controls. Standard questionnaires, which have been used in similar settings, were used for collecting data on various parameters. Univariate and multivariate regression was done to determine odds ratios. Jacoby stigma, 31-item QOL, KAP etc were determined and so were the factors associated with them using STATA software. Treatment gap was measured using direct method. Key findings: Multivariate analyses yielded family history of epilepsy, difficult or long delivery, other problems beside seizures (mainly mental retardation, hyperthermia), and eventful pregnancy of the subject's mother as factors associated with epilepsy. There was high frequency of seizure precipitants esp. those related to sleep. Population attributable risk (%) was: family history (15.0), eventful pregnancy of subject's mother (14.5), long/difficult birth (6.5), and other problem beside seizures (20.0). Mean stigma (1.9±1.1, on a scale of 3) was mainly related to treatment efficacy. Mean QOL (5.0±1.4 on a scale of 10) was mainly related to treatment regularity. Cause or risk factor could be determined in 56% of cases. Treatment gap was 65.8%. Significance: Factors in pre- and perinatal period were found to be most crucial for epilepsy risk in Cambodia which inturn provides major prevention opportunities. A global action plan for treatment, stigma reduction and improvement of QOL should be set-up in this country. © 2012 Bhalla et al.

N2  - In the search of the sleep substance, many studies have been addressed for different hormones, responsible for sleep-wake cycle regulation. In this article we mentioned the participation of steroid hormones, besides its role regulating sexual behavior, they influence importantly in the sleep process. One of the clearest relationships are that estrogen and progesterone have, that causing changes in sleep patterns associated with the hormonal cycles of women throughout life, from puberty to menopause and specific periods such as pregnancy and the menstrual cycle, including being responsible for some sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and insomnia. Another studied hormone is cortisol, a hormone released in stressful situations, when an individual must react to an extraordinary demand that threatens their survival, but also known as the hormone of awakening because the release peak occurs in the morning, although this may be altered in some sleep disorders like insomnia and mood disorders. Furthermore neurosteroids such as pregnanolone, allopregnanolone and pregnenolone are involved in the generation of slow wave sleep, the effect has been demonstrated in experimental animal studies. Thus we see that the sleep and the endocrine system saved a bidirectional relationship in which depends on each other to regulate different physiological processes including sleep. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors transduce low arterial O2 tension into increased action potential activity on the carotid sinus nerves, which contributes to resting ventilatory drive, increased ventilatory drive in response to hypoxia, arousal responses to hypoxia during sleep, upper airway muscle activity, blood pressure control and sympathetic tone. Their sensitivity to O2 is low in the newborn and increases during the days or weeks after birth to reach adult levels. This postnatal functional maturation of the CB O2 response has been termed "resetting" and it occurs in every mammalian species studied to date. The O2 environment appears to play a key role; the fetus develops in a low O2 environment throughout gestation and initiation of CB "resetting" after birth is modulated by the large increase in arterial oxygen tension occurring at birth. Although numerous studies have reported age-related changes in various components of the O2 transduction cascade, how the O2 environment shapes normal CB prenatal development and postnatal "resetting" remains unknown. Viewing CB "resetting" as environment-driven (developmental) phenotypic plasticity raises important mechanistic questions that have received little attention. This review examines what is known (and not known) about mechanisms of CB functional maturation, with a focus on the role of the O2 environment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Psychiatric disorders have been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints and disorders among pregnant women with psychiatric disorders.Methods: A cohort of 1,332 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We ascertained psychiatric diagnosis status and collect information about sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Approximately 5.1% of the cohort (n=68) reported having a physician-diagnosis of mood or anxiety disorder before interview. Compared with women without a psychiatric diagnosis, the multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) for short sleep duration in early pregnancy (≤6 hours) were 1.95 (1.03-3.69). The corresponding OR (95%CI) for long sleep duration (≥9 hours) during early pregnancy was 1.13 (0.63-2.03). Women with psychiatric disorders had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR=2.41; 95%CI 1.46-4.00) and elevated perceived stress (OR=3.33; 95%CI 1.89-5.88). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight/obese women.Conclusions: Women with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to report short sleep durations, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent mood/anxiety-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women. © 2012 Qiu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Orexins play a role in many biological functions include sleep, feeding, and energy balance. They also regulate circadian rhythms and the way that we feel pain. Orexins have been identified in a variety of tissues including the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, hypothalamus, spinal cord, sensory ganglion, enteric nervous system, pituitary, adrenal, salivary and lacrimal glands, testis, vestibular gland, and skin. Orexins play a role in a variety of biological functions including arousal, sleeping, food and fluid intake, pain, memory, perception of odor, and sexual activity. Orexins have also been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism. The expression of orexin is induced by hypoglycemia, low food, pregnancy, and hemodialysis. In contrast, factors that inhibit the expression of orexins include obstructive sleep apnea, aging, depression, obesity, traumatic brain injury, and inflammatory molecules such as liposaccharide. In conclusion, orexins are widely distributed and involved in a large variety of biological activities. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by upper airway collapse and obstruction during sleep. It is estimated to affect nearly 5% of the general female population. Obesity is often associated with OSA. The physiological changes associated with pregnancy may increase the severity of OSA with a higher risk of maternal and fetal morbidity. However, very few parturients are diagnosed during pregnancy. These undiagnosed parturients pose great challenge to the attending anaesthesiologist during the perioperative period. Parturients at risk should be screened for OSA, and if diagnosed, treated. This review describes the anaesthetic concerns in obese parturients at risk for OSA presenting to the labor and delivery unit.

N2  - Study Objectives: We compared sleep problems during pregnancy and sleep dissatisfaction 18 months after pregnancy in pregnant women with binge eating disorder (BED) symptoms and pregnant women without an eating disorder. Design: Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Patients or Participants: Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent). Measurements and Results: Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01). Conclusions: BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.

N2  - Introduction: Women experience profound changes to their sleep during pregnancy. However, there is currently no information about the sleep of pregnant women in New Zealand. The aim of this study was to compare characteristics of sleep before and during pregnancy in a large sample of New Zealand women. Method: The E Moe, Mama: Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand study is a questionnaire-based project designed to investigate sleep changes across the perinatal period and the relationship with maternal health and mood. A total of 1091 women aged 16-46 yrs completed the first questionnaire between 35-37 wks gestation at which time they were asked about their pre-pregnancy and current sleep habits. Participants were asked their usual sleep duration across a 24-hour period and to report the number of nights/week they experienced a good night's sleep; loud snoring; breathing pauses during sleep; and legs twitching/jerking during sleep (0-7 nights, where ≥3 nights/week was considered frequent). Differences between mean sleep in pre-pregnancy and at 35-37 wks were compared using paired t-tests. Results: Participants reported significantly shorter usual sleep duration (mean ± SD, 7.41 ± 1.82 vs. 8.23 ± 1.23, t = 14.02, p < 0.0001) and fewer good nights of sleep per week (2.63 ± 1.86 vs. 5.23 ± 1.48, t = 40.14, p < 0.0001) in late-pregnancy compared with pre-pregnancy. Twenty two percent of women reported snoring ≥3 nights/week in late pregnancy compared with 15% of women prior to pregnancy (t = -6.46, p < 0.0001). There was very little change in the proportion of women who reported breathing pauses during sleep in late pregnancy compared with pre-pregnancy (4% vs. 3%, t = -1.68, p = 0.09). Legs twitching or jerking during sleep was reported by 14% of women in late pregnancy and 16% prior to pregnancy (t = 2.67, p = 0.008). Conclusion: Compared with pre-pregnancy, self-reported sleep in late pregnancy is shorter and of poorer quality and loud snoring is more common. Future research should investigate the impact of sleep disturbances associated with pregnancy on maternal health and wellbeing and determine whether or not post-partum sleep duration and quality recovers to pre-pregnancy levels.

N2  - Introduction: Although changes to sleep during pregnancy are well recognised and widely reported, there is still limited information available on what constitutes 'normal' sleep at this time and how sleep compares with that of the general population. Method: As part of the E Moe, Ma-ma-: Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand study, 1091 women (16-46 yrs) completed comprehensive questionnaires on sleep, health and mood between 35-37 weeks gestation. Self reported usual sleep duration in 24-hrs and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) of women in late pregnancy was compared with identical measures from a large, representative sample of 1,063 New Zealand women of the same age1,2. Results: Average sleep duration in 24-hrs is similar in pregnant women compared to the general population. However, at least twice as many pregnant women obtain ≤6 hrs sleep in a 24-hr period compared to the general population, and the proportion of pregnant women obtaining ≥9 hrs is also greater. Nearly 20% of pregnant women report ESS scores >10, although sleep duration was not related to daytime sleepiness in this population (χ2(2) = 4.33, p = 0.16). (Table presented) Conclusion: These findings suggest that more extreme sleep durations (both short and long) are common in late pregnancy. Although sleep duration was unrelated to daytime sleepiness in pregnant women, further investigation of the consequences of short and long sleep for health and mood during pregnancy is necessary.

N2  - Objectives: To explore the maternal-fetal outcome of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) patients diagnosed during pregnancy. Materials: OSAHS cases diagnosed in pregnancy. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the maternal-fetal outcome of OSAHS patients diagnosed by nocturnal blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) monitoring and polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Results: 12 patients were made the diagnosis of OSAHS from May 2008 to Oct 2011 at Peking University People's Hospital during the pregnancy. All were snorers, one with OSAHS family history, one with hypothyroidism, the other 10 with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy (HDCP). 8 cases with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 before pregnancy. Ten patients received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment with good compliance under informed consent. The mean SaO2 (MSaO2 %) and the lowest SaO2 (LSaO2 %) during sleep after treatment had significantly increased than that of before treatment 96.29±0.63 % vs 94.32±1.14 %(P < 0.001), 89.5 ±5.28 % vs 80.85±9.42 % (P = 0.017); while the number of oxygen desaturation ≥4% per hour (DI4) significantly decreased (0.96± 1.00 vs 11.16±12.06, P = 0.029). Two cases ended before 28 gestational weeks due to exacerbated HDCP. The case number of preterm labor, concurrent gestational diabetes and postpartum hemorrhage were 5, 6 and 2 respectively. The average weight of 10 live births were 3062 (1500-4070) grams, nine patients had taken CPAP therapy after the diagnosis of OSAHS, there were no fetal growth retardation nor neonatal asphyxia, 5 premature newborns and one term newborn with hypoglycemia were transferred to NICU. Conclusions: Pregnant women who have OSAHS risk factors should be paid attention to during the perinatal care and nocturnal SaO2 monitoring or PSG should be performed in the suspected OSAHS patients. The incidence of HDCP, gestational diabetes mellitus and preterm labor were relatively high in OSAHS patients. CPAP was a safe and effective treatment to OSAHS patients in pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the effects of obesity as denoted by prepregnancy body mass index in kg/m2 and rate of weight gain in kg/week on central aortic systolic and pulse pressures derived from radial artery pulsewave forms. Materials: A prospective cohort study of 1248 pregnant women with viable singleton pregnancies without Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, on chemotherapy, psychotropic drugs or mixed marriages, and attending antenatal clinic at less than 14 weeks gestation. Subjects for this study were recruited from two public institutions, that provided tertiary maternity care to the Singapore population. Methods: Eligible pregnant women were recruited and followed up at 26 weeks gestation for measurements of central aortic pressures, height, weight, sleep and psychometric evaluations. Information on prepregnancy weight, socio-economic and past medical history was obtained using structured interviewer administered questionnaire during study recruitment was obtained at study recruitment. Classifications of body mass index were based on Asian cut-offs, whereby obesity is classified as body mass index at 23 kg/m2 and above. Manual backward linear regressions on central pressures for prepregnancy body mass index and rate of weight gain were performed to achieve the best fit model respectively. Results: Among 889 pregnant women, controlled for preexisting hypertension and other confounders, prepregnancy BMI and rate of weight gain were linearly associated with central aortic pulse and systolic pressures at 0.26 95% CI (0.12, 0.41) and 0.98 95% CI (0.77, 1.19); 5.28 95% CI (1.81, 8.75) and 13.83 95% CI (8.45, 19.21) respectively. Consistently in women who had BMI >23 kg/m2, central aortic pressures were greater than those of normal weight. Associated increase were greatest in obese pregnancies at 3.28 95% CI (1.37, 5.19) and 10.53 95% CI (7.72, 13.34) in central aortic pulse and systolic pressures respectively. Conclusions: Findings from this study support the emerging role of central pressures as measures of vascular compliance i.e. arterial stiffness in pregnancy. More importantly, it unravelled important central haemodynamic changes in obese pregnancies which are less well described in literature. Measurement of central pressures reinforces the importance of preconception weight control and pregnancy weight gain.

N2  - Introduction: Disruption to sleep during pregnancy is not uncommon. In the third trimester factors including having to go to the bathroom and discomfort associated with the increasing size of the foetus and uterus, as well as pain, being too hot or cold, restless legs syndrome, leg cramps, heartburn and carpal tunnel pain have been associated with disturbed sleep1,2,3. The current study investigates sleep disruption in New Zealand women during late pregnancy. Method: As part of the E Moe, Mama: Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand study investigating sleep across late pregnancy and early post-partum, questionnaires were completed by women (n = 1091; 16-46 yrs) between 35-37 weeks gestation. Participants identified the number of nights in the last week that potential sleep-disrupting factors occurred (scale 0-7 nights), with ≥3 nights/week considered as frequent. Results: The majority of women (89.3%) reported going to the bathroom disturbing sleep ≥3 nights in the previous week. The next most common factors (≥3 nights) were not being able to get comfortable (68.6%), pain in back/neck/joints (66.0%), and baby moving around (baby kicking) (59.3%). Other frequently cited reasons (≥3 nights) included feeling too hot or cold (51.0%), thinking or worrying about things (48.5%), just can't get to sleep (46.7%), dreams (36.4%), and heartburn (35.9%). In the National Sleep Foundation Poll (NSF, 2007) women in their 3rd trimester most often identified sleep being disturbed by needing to go to the bathroom (92%), pain in the back, neck or joints (66%), leg cramps (54%) and/or heartburn (51%), whilst Mindell and Jacobson (2000) reported women had difficulties falling asleep and staying asleep at 35-38 weeks of pregnancy due to factors including needing to go to the bathroom (94.6%), uncomfortable position (78.4%), aching/one position (54.1%), thoughts (45.9%), and sleeping not in a usual position (45.9%). Discussion: Needing to go to the bathroom and pain commonly disturb sleep in late pregnancy, as well as other physical and psychological factors that may vary in prevalence across populations. As there is a high likelihood that sleep quality will be compromised in the third trimester of pregnancy due to sleep disruption, it is important that women are informed of this and supported to prioritise sleep.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is strongly associated with hypertension [1]. Chronic arterial hypertension pre-existing in pregnancy or new-onset discovered during pregnancy could be complicated by pre-eclampsia or eclampsia [2]. Snoring and obesity, as independent predictive factors for hypertension, are considered risk factors for OSA in pregnant normo or hypertensive. With no prospective population studies, the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy is not known. CASE PRESENTATION: Young white caucazian woman 32 years aged, with hypertensive mother at young age, Known with obesity first degree (BMI=32Kg/m2), previous untreated arterial hypertension stage III (max. 220/100 mmHg), task with an 8-weeks interrupted by therapeutic abortion due to high blood pressure resistant to antihypertensive treatment and for iminent eclampsia, shows suggestive symptoms for OSA, with an Epworth score =7. Polygraphy results: severe OSA. Holter monitoring revealed elevated systolic-diastolic blood pressure diurnal and nocturnal, with non-dipper pattern.All causes of secondary hypertension's etiology were excluded. DISCUSSION: Recently studies showed that OSA is an independent risk for onset of hypertension and may contribute to a higher risk of hypertension during pregnancy and doubles the risk for preeclampsia and preterm birth [3]. Snoring increases in frequency during pregnancy. So, any hypertensive pregnant woman with symptoms suggestive for OSA must be investigated by polysomnographia and, if itâ€™s necessary, treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Any pregnant hypertensive woman with nocturnal hypoxemia must benefit of CPAP administration in order to control better of arterial hypertension. In the same time, CPAP administration permits to reduce antihypertensive medication doses. Literature review revealed a better control of blood pressure in the third quarter of pregnancy in hypertensive women with associated OSA by CPAP. Even in the cases of pre-eclampsia, CPAP is well tolerated by pregnant women and is effective for both mother and fetus. Future studies are needed to provide answers to questions about hypertensive women at the first prenatal visit for diagnosis and treatment for OSA and prevent fetal complications associated (intrauterine growth retardation, fetal hypotrophy) by placental ischemia secondary intermittent hypoxemia. CONCLUSIONS: Wrong decision of abortion was determined by insufficient informations about OSA as a possible cause of high resistance to antihypertensive therapy. An earlier diagnosis of OSA and CPAP therapy could saved fetus' life before the onset of preeclampsia.

N2  - Background: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Taiwanese women. Methods: We enrolled 461 pregnant women (18-45. years) admitted at Mackay Memorial Hospital for delivery from September 2010 to May 2011. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included assessment of RLS diagnostic criteria, and questions related to RLS. Results: The overall prevalence rate of RLS among the study participants was 10.4%; 2.8% were categorized as having chronic RLS. Participants without RLS reported higher folate and iron supplement consumption than those with RLS. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations of RLS with anemia and peptic ulcer disease. Participants with transient RLS during pregnancy reported more regular coffee consumption before pregnancy, and better sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, than those with chronic RLS. Overall, 81.2% of RLS sufferers reported sleep disturbances. Conclusions: Our study revealed highly prevalent but poorly recognized RLS among Taiwanese pregnant women. The identification of predictors such as medical comorbidities, and protectors such as folate and iron supplements, is warranted for obstetric RLS. In most cases, symptoms began during the second or third trimester and resolved within a week after delivery. Restricted coffee consumption before pregnancy is encouraged, but further evidence is needed to support this recommendation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objectives: Medical access to the foundation of chronomedicine is merely feasible through the cognition of the specificity of chronologic structure. Since 1978 K. Chachava Institute of the Perinatal Medicine, OBGYN has been engaged in the investigation of the processes underlying the interdependence of maternal and fetal biological clock. It has been established that alteration of “increase” and “decrease” in physiologic functioning takes place in healthy fetus. The objectives were to study biologo-astronomic principles of daily rhythms in human fetus. Materials: Pregnant women and their fetuses were studied to determine biologo-astronomic principles of daily rhythms in human fetus. Methods: Daily oscillations of fetal heart rate and locomotor activity as well as maternal endocrine system were studied with the poly somnographic recordings of maternal nocturnal sleep done. Mathematical analysis of the sinusoidal curves. Results: The curve depicting the dynamics of functioning change levels of the fetal physiologic systems has a biphasic character, complies with the state of maternal organism but runs within a reverse phase. Mathematical analysis of the sinusoidal curves at interpretation of daily fetal and maternal CTGs suggests that the uterine development of the fetus requires the availability of a relatively persistent homeostasis, which is obtained by fetal activation under decreased maternal physiologic functioning and the decline of the fetal physiologic processes when maternal functions are intensified. Thus, a basic principle of self-regulation of two autonomous, though interdependent functional systems has been deduced. The mechanism of the functional self-regulation of fetal-maternal physiologic functions in a feedback form has been proposed. The fundamental Law of Nature - the unity and struggle of opposites - implies the existence of one opposite in the other, even at maximal expression of one of them. Conclusions: Given that biological rhythms represent a fundamental trait of the organic world ensuring its ability to adapt and survive in the given environment, it is obvious that the movement of the planets has been influencing living organisms, stipulating synchronization of physiological rhythms of living beings on the Earth. Hence, we are supposedly standing at the edge of understanding of biology-astronomic and medical meaning of the sequel of these patterns.

N2  - Objective: Fetal behavioral states develop during gestation. Studies concerning fetal behavioral states are of special interest to fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) and fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG). To date it is unknown if fetal states have a circadian rhythm which needs to be taken into account. According to Nijhuis [1] four fetal behavioral states can be defined (quiet and active, asleep and awake) after 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) based on fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) patterns and fetal movement. Between 25 and 32 weeks of gestation, active and passive states can be distinguished. Magnetography is a non-invasive technique to investigate fetal brain activity (fMEG) or fetal heart activity (fMCG) with high temporal resolution. Further, fetal movement can be detected by fetal heart vector changes. fHRV and fetal movement can be combined in an actocardiogram, which allows to classify fetal behavioral states. The aim of this study was to use fetal magnetography to investigate the occurrence of fetal behavioral states at two different daytimes (morning and afternoon) in a longitudinal study between 25 and 40 weeks of gestation. Materials and methods: A 156-sensor magnetograph dedicated for fetal recordings was used for this study. One healthy pregnancy was assessed weekly between 25th and 40th weeks of GA at 10 am and at 3 pm. The duration of each recording was 30 min and was performed without any stimulation. A template matching approach was used to detect fetal heart signals to construct actocardiograms. Fetal behavioral states were classified visually according to Nijhuis criteria. Results: No significant differences of fetal state distribution were found between morning and afternoon recordings: Prior 32 weeks the fetus was in the morning in 26 % passiv and in 74 % active versus 25 % passiv and 75 % active in the afternoon. After 32 weeks the fetus was in the morning in 17 % quiet asleep, in 61 % quiet awake, in 2 % active asleep and in 19 % active awake. In the afternoon the fetus was quiet asleep in 24 %, in 62 % quiet awake, no active sleep was seen and in 12 % active awakeness. Conclusion: This is the first report that daytime does not influence the distribution of fetal states in fMCG and fMEG-recordings. The results imply that at least normal daytime recordings can be combined without a bias.

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether hyperglycemic disorders have any influence on urinary incontinence (UI) and lower urinary tract symptoms, as well as to assess the impact of UI on the quality of life of incontinent pregnant women. Materials: This cross-sectional study included pregnant women were normoglycemic (NG group) or had hyperglycemia/gestational diabetes mellitus (HG group) at ≥24 weeks of gestation according to GDM screening. Exclusion criteria were GDM diagnosed during a previous pregnancy, pre-gestational diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension or gestational hypertensive disorders, age under 18 years, refusal to participate in the study. Assuming a type I error of 5% and a type II error rate of 20%, the minimum sample size was estimated as 33 individuals per group, based on the proportion of incontinent women among diabetics and the probability of diabetes occurrence among pregnant women. Methods: During interviews, the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ) was administered. This instrument, designed to evaluate quality of life among incontinent women, comprises 21 questions divided into eight domains: general health perception, IU impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, and sleep/energy. It also contains two independent subscales for the evaluation of UI severity and presence and intensity of lower urinary tract symptoms. Results: Of the total 102 study participants, 69 were NG (67.6%) and 33 were HG (32.4%). By excluding continent pregnant women, who were not asked to respond to the questionnaire, it was observed that 37 (53.6%) in NG and 20 in HG (60.6%) reported UI. Although UI was highly prevalent, this difference in the proportion of UI occurrence did not reach statistical significance. The HG group had the poorest KHQ scores. However, significant differences were found in general health perception, incontinence impact, personal relationships, emotion, and sleep/energy (p < 0.05). No significant differences in lower urinary tract symptoms were observed. Conclusions: The high prevalence of UI during pregnancy and its impact on quality of life are good arguments in favor of implementing practices that allow UI assessment, prevention and treatment during gestation in order to reduce its occurrence and negative impact on the quality of life of hyperglycemic pregnant women.

N2  - Background: The physiological changes in pregnancy and the postpartum may affect symptoms of depression. This may impact diagnostic judgments in the peripartum and influence which symptoms discriminate depressed and non-depressed women. Second, the sharp fall in cortisol and CRH after childbirth suggests that the HPA axis characteristics of postpartum depression are different from melancholic depression the latter being characterized by high cortisol levels. Methods: With 892 consecutive childbearing women a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) was used to assess all symptoms of depression and of the melancholic and atypical subtypes of depression in pregnancy and the postpartum period. In a second study we investigated the diurnal output of saliva cortisol in women with symptoms of depression postnatally in 21 depressed and 30 non-depressed women at 7.5 weeks postpartum, and 21 non perinatal controls, collected saliva at waking, 30 minutes, and three and twelve hours post waking. Results: 1. 132/892 (14.8%) women were categorized as a DSM IV case of depression during the 9 month pregnancy period, and 38/892 (4.3%) in the 6 week postnatal assessment period. The antenatal symptom pattern of depression was different from the postnatal. Loss of appetite was not associated with depression either ante or postnatally. The sensitivity of the symptoms ranged from 0.7% to 51.6%, and specificity from 61.3% to 99.1%. The best discriminating symptoms were motor retardation/agitation and concentration antenatally, and motor retardation/agitation, concentration and fatigue postnatally. Depression in pregnancy and postpartum depression show significantly different symptom profiles. Appetite is not suitable for the diagnosis of depression in the perinatal period. In a subgroup of this sample (n = 449) 17% of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression (2.4%), atypical depression (4.4%), and non specified depression (10.2%). Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. 2. There was no difference in overall cortisol levels between depressed and non depressed postnatal participants, however a significant difference in diurnal pattern, due to a difference in the first two time points (waking and +30 min): compared to the other two groups who each had a significant increase in cortisol levels from waking to +30 min, the depressed women had significantly higher cortisol levels at waking and no increase at +30 min. The lack of a morning rise in the depressed women is similar to that reported for posttraumatic stress disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome and may reflect a response, in vulnerable women, to the marked cortisol withdrawal that occurs after delivery. Discussion: These findings suggest that perinatal depression has some different biological and diagnostic characteristics from depression at other times.

N2  - The dramatic increase in obesity rates worldwide is associated with changes in diet and physical activity, but this rapid escalation could include an element of transgenerational inheritance, independent of genetic predisposition. Thus it is suggested that exposure to the metabolic influences of maternal obesity in fetal life may directly influence the risk of obesity in the child. Investigations in mother-child cohorts certainly suggest that maternal obesity during gestation is an independent determinant of obesity risk in the child and a reportedly greater influence of maternal versus paternal BMI argues against an important influence of genetic inheritance. Most recently, several publications have uniformly described that excessive gestational weight gain (by USA Institute of Medicine criteria) is a determinant of offspring obesity. However, causation is difficult to prove, even following adjustment for known confounders such as maternal smoking, breast feeding duration, childhood sleep patterns, physical activity and diet. Lifestyle or pharmacological intervention clinical trials in obese pregnant women designed to improve pregnancy outcome and/ or reduce gestational weight gain provide, through childhood followup, an exciting opportunity to test this theory, sometimes known as the 'fetal overnutrition hypothesis'. Ongoing studies, including trials in Australia and the UK, are prospectively designed to assess the relative roles of gestational and postnatal determinants of childhood obesity and thereby to evaluate whether maternal obesity/gestational weight gain, through persistent influences on the fetus may contribute to the global epidemic of childhood obesity.

N2  - The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background. Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design. This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods. Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21-40years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results. Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion. When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Materials: Setting, Norway. The sample consisted of 41,236 Norwegian speaking nulliparous women. Recruited during the period 1999-2008. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Data were collected by a questionnaire in week 17 of pregnancy. The distribution of descriptive variables in relation to age was investigated. Women of advanced (33-37 years) and very advanced (≥38 years) age were compared with women 25-32 years of age, by means of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Outcome measures. Womes age. Results: Women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age differed from the younger women with regard to a wide range of background characteristics, and this difference was most pronounced for the very advanced group. Problems related to physical ageing were more common (infertility, physical health problems, sleep problems, depression and fatigue). Of the socio-demographic factors; high annual income and low level of education were most strongly correlated to high maternal age, followed by single status, unemployment, unsatisfactory relationship with partner and unplanned pregnancy. Conclusions: Besides having more age related reproductive and physical health problems, women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age constituted a heterogeneous group characterized by either socioeconomic prosperity or vulnerability.

N2  - The composition of the biological clock defining the duration of human pregnancy remains a central question in reproductive biology. Our goal is to understand the molecular signals comprising this biological clock to prevent preterm birth. We have generated and analyzed mice with defects in prostaglandin biosynthesis, prostaglandin catabolism, circadian clock molecules, and oxytocin production in efforts to begin to define the key physiological pathways. These genetic studies in mice reveal essential functions for cyclooxygenase- 1-generated prostaglandin F2 alpha for labor onset and the degrading enzyme hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in the maintenance of pregnancy. While these studies have elucidated the pathway for parturition timing in rodents, the findings have resulted in limited understanding for mechanisms of human parturition. In this presentation, data that genetic factors contribute to human preterm birth will be summarized. We have analyzed DNA from families with recurrent preterm birth and control families without preterm infants through genome-wide association and whole exome sequencing. These efforts have identified potentially interesting new contributors to birth timing from the maternal genome, such as the follicle stimulating hormone receptor gene, novel phospholipase isoforms, and pathways harboring rare, predicted deleterious mutations. New data regarding contributors to birth timing from the fetal genome will also be discussed.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if reproductive experience is associated with cumulative effects on human memory performance during pregnancy and if these effects persist into the postpartum period. Methods: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The data indicate that the previously documented adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality. Conclusions: Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence as well as clinical and anthropometric predictors of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) among the middle-aged urban community of Bangladeshi. METHODS: The study was a prospective two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study, performed in an Urban Community of Dhanmondi, Dhaka. About 2500 citizens, aged 30-60 years residing in the Dhanmondi, Dhaka were the study population. Person with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class iii/iv congestive heart failure, pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, systemic steroid treatment and hormone replacement therapy were excluded. Stage 1 of the study consisted of the administration of the sleep questionnaire and brief anthropometric measurements were performed in 2,500 subjects. They were screened by means of a sleep questionnaire, a modified version of the Wisconsin sleep cohort questionnaire which included questions about demographics, sleep symptoms, medical history, and medications. Total 2250 subjects returned the questionnaire. The respondents were divided as per their snoring habits in to habitual snorers and non-habitual snorers. Among them 495 were habitual snorers and 1755 were non-habitual snorers. In stage 2 of the study, 60 habitual snorers and same number of non-habitual snorers were randomly selected for standard overnight PSG. RESULTS: The prevalence of OSAH in habitual snorers was 48.33% (239/495), and that in non-habitual snorers was 1.66% (29/1755). So, the overall prevalence of OSAH in the screened population was 11.91%, and that of OSAHS was 3.29%. Likewise, the prevalence of OSAH and OSAHS in the men was 17.37% and 4.49%, respectively. The prevalence of OSAH and OSAHS in women was 6.25% and 2.14% respectively on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age, obesity (defined by a high body mass index), wait/hip ratio were significant risk factors for OSAHS. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk factors and prevalence for OSAHS in urban population of Bangladesh are similar to those in the Western studies.

N2  - Background Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Methods An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA1c levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses. Results Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA1c (p=0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p=0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Conclusions Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA1c and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

N2  - Fulminant Type 1 diabetes is a subtype of Type 1 diabetes characterized by (1) abrupt onset of diabetes, (2) very short duration of hyperglycaemia with mildly elevated HbA1c (<69mmol/mol, 8.5%), (3) rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis, (4) very low C-peptide level, and (5) often associated with elevated serum pancreatic enzymes, and absence of diabetes-related autoantibodies. We encountered a case of fulminant Type 1 diabetes that developed with an initial manifestation of the insulin autoimmune syndrome and rapidly progressed to diabetic ketoacidosis during pregnancy. A 31-year-old Korean woman presented with recurrent sudden onset of sweating and change of consciousness during sleep at 19weeks gestation. During a 72-h fasting test, hypoglycaemia (1.72mmol/l) occurred at 4h after the start of the test. At that time, there was a high insulin level (370.2μU/ml), a paradoxically low C-peptide level (0.01nmol/l) and a positive insulin autoantibody test. An oral glucose tolerance test revealed postprandial hyperglycaemia. She was initially diagnosed as the insulin autoimmune syndrome. On the day 5 of admission, she developed diabetic ketoacidosis. Her HbA1c was 62mmol/mol (7.8%). The rapid progression of diabetic ketoacidosis altered the diagnosis to fulminant Type 1 diabetes. This case differed from typical fulminant Type 1 diabetes because it presented with hypoglycaemia, and positive insulin and anti-phospholipid antibody tests. Her HLA typing was HLA-DQA1*0302, 0501, HLA-DRB1*0301 (DR3), 0901(DR9). Her glucose level was subsequently very well controlled with multiple insulin injections and she successfully delivered a healthy baby. © 2012 The Authors. Diabetic Medicine © 2012 Diabetes UK.

N2  - Nowadays amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is registered in the young more often. Therefore, perhaps in the future neurologists and obstetricians-gynecologists will have to deal with pregnancy in patients with ALS more often. We describe a case of pregnancy in ALS, registered in the Ukraine, and the peculiarities of ALS course during this period. The female patient (32 years old), who has 2 children (14 and 4 years old), was admitted in INPN NAMSU with ALS diagnosis in March 2012 for a planned dynamic observation. A verified ALS (24 points on ALS FRSR) was diagnosed in INPN NAMSU in October 2011. The first signs of the disease appeared in September 2011 after discontinuation of breast feeding. The patient ' s height is 162 cm and weight is 49.5 kg. From 2010 to 2011 her weight loss was > 10 kg. The patient ' s complaints included speech changes, periodical choking, episodes of night difficulties of breathing, weakness in extremities (uses wheelchair and constant assistance of other person), menstrual disorders, twitches in all the body. In the neurological status a mild facial hypomimia, atrophy of tongue muscles with fibrillations, dysarthria, tetraparesis, fasciculations without sensory impairments was registered. The vital lung volume (VLV) was 24%. Patient ' s abdomen was increased although the patient did not attach any importance for that. An urgent gynecological consultation and ultrasound examination of the uterus confirmed a pregnancy at the term of 20 weeks. The family denied a proposal of a justifiable abortion. According to a psychological examination the patient ' s cognitive functioning was normal. Hematology and blood biochemistry parameters were normal. Results of viral hepatitis and herpetic infection markers analyses were negative. The patient is under dynamic observation by a neurologist, gynecologist, and anesthesiologist. Since 21 week of pregnancy she uses “ Bipap ST ” for 10 - 15 min before sleep and takes NeuroAid medication with unproven efficacy in ALS nor in pregnancy. Ultrasound examination on 21 st week of pregnancy demonstrated no pathological changes in the fetus. During the period of observation the patient ' s weight gain was 6 kg, VLV increased up to 40%, SpO2 was 96%. A range of movements has raised and the patient is able to move with assistance. The patient has no complaints concerning choking and her dysarthria becomes milder. In the neurological status tetraparesis with amyotrophic set of symptoms and fasciculations are registered. The term of delivery (probably 37 - 38 weeks) will be determined in accordance with the patient ' s conditions (VLV and SpO2 ). The method of delivery management (Cesarean or vaginal) is not defined yet. If necessary, usage of an infiltrative anesthesia will be planned.

N2  - Overview: We recently showed a role for maternal obesity (MO) in developmental programming of offspring NAFLD, through an unknown mechanism. The biological circadian clock is a transcriptional mechanism that synchronises physiological and behavioural processes to co-ordinate daily rhythms in rest/activity and energy utilisation within a 24 hour light/dark cycle. Alterations in circadian rhythmicity can have profound effects on central and peripheral metabolic pathways. Here we hypothesise a central role for alterations in the hepatic core clock machinery in developmental programming of offspring NAFLD. Methods: Female C57BL6 mice, were fed standard or obesogenic diet (OD) how, for 6 weeks prior to pregnancy and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Litters were standardised to 8 pups and offspring then weaned onto standard or OD to produce 4 groups. At 6 months animals were studied at 4-hourly intervals over a 12:12hr LD period. Locomotor activity was assessed. Blood and tissue were collected for biochemical and histological assessment of liver phenotype and expression analysis of canonical clock genes. Results: Offspring exposed to MO and a post-weaning OD (OffOb-OD) developed profound NAFLD compared to those exposed post-partum (OffCon-OD) or in the control group (Off- Con-SC), as evidenced by raised ALT (p<0.001), NAFLD Activity Score (p<0.01) and hepatic triglycerides (p<0.001). Nocturnal locomotor activity was reduced by 10-15% with significant attenuation in total activity per day in OffOb-OD and OffCon-OD (p<0.01). Circadian rhythmicity of canonical clock genes was observed in the liver, although exposure to MO induced phase advances in CLOCK, BMAL1 and Per2 mRNA transcripts (p<0.01) and a biphasic circadian pattern in CLOCK (p<0.05). An OD independent of MO induced a phase delay of 1.1-1.8 hours in REV-ERB-α (p<0.01). Up-regulation of BMAL1 and Cry2 mRNA transcripts were observed in offspring with programmed NAFLD (p<0.05). Moreover, a higher baseline constitutive expression of CLOCK, BMAL1 REV-ERB-α and Cry1 was observed from greater than control values for minima as determined by cosinor analysis (p<0.05). Additionally, rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators, IL-6 and TNF-α and α-SMA, TGF-β and collagen, respectively, were disrupted in OffOb-OD (p<0.05). Conclusion: MO and a post-natal hyper-calorific diet profoundly disrupted hepatic molecular circadian circuitry in offspring. Mechanistically, this may contribute to programmed NAFLD with fibrosis development.

N2  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e. g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause. © 2012 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

N2  - Background. The fetal bradycardia (FB) is often an indication for emergency caesarean section. Usually FB is related to a benigne arrhythmia, such as blocked atrial bi/trigeminy, or a malignant one, such as complete atrioventricular block (AVB). Our clinical case suggests that this arrhythmia has to be regularly monitored in pre- and post-natal life, since it may cause paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Case report.We present the case of a 34 years old Caucasian patient G1P0 that was referred to our department for “blocked atrial bigeminy with pseudobradycardia” detected elsewhere at 33 weeks gestation. The patient was scanned at our Department at 37 weeks gestation. An echocardiography showed during all the examination an arrhythmia that in M-mode resulted to be a blocked atrial trigeminy with a mean fetal heart rate (FHR) of 100 bpm. A female was born at 38 weeks. An ECG performed at birth revealed blocked supraventricular extrasystoles. An ECG the day after did not register any extrasystole. A day 3, an ECG showed no atrial extrasystoles and a QTc interval at upper limits of normal. An echocardiography performed the same day showed a small patent FO with moderate left to right shunt and a trivial tricuspid regurgitation. To our surprise, at day 11, ECG revealed supraventricular trigeminy and episodes of PSVT. Therapy with sotalol hydrochloride 2 mg/kg twice a day was started. At day 18, an episode of PSVT that needed a “diving reflex” maneuver was registered. The same day, a cardiomonitoring showed extrasystoles and episodes of bradycardia with a heart rate of 80 bpm. A 24hr ECG/Holter monitoring at day 20 recorded sinus rhythm with a mean heart rate at lower limits for age, some blocked supraventricular extrasystoles and 3 isolated and monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles. Actually, the little girl is administered sotalol hydrochloride 2 mg/kg twice a day and she is doing well. Conclusion. Although most cases of fetal bradycardia verified during obstetrical ultrasound examination are due to vagal stimulation because of fetal compression by the transducer, attention should be paid in case of sustained bradycardias, trying to evaluate simultaneously atrial and ventricular contraction for evidence of nonconducted ectopic atrial beats causing low ventricular contraction rate or AVB. Furthermore, blocked atrial bi/trigeminy can present with bradycardia during the FHR monitoring leading erroneously to emergent preterm delivery. Consequently, in cases when an atypical bradycardia is registered at FHR monitoring, a fetal echocardiography should be done to determine if it is the case of blocked atrial bigeminy or trigeminy, because these arrhythmias do not represent an obstetrical emergency. In our case, in the first hours of life the fetal bradycardia due to atrial trigeminy has been confirmed and three subsequent postnatal ECGs until day 3, showed no evidence of atrial extrasystoles, confirming the well-known frequent regression of this kind of benign arrhythmia. But at day 11 recurrence of supraventricular trigeminy and development of episodes of paroxystic supraventricular tachycardia were observed. Although our case represents a single evidence, it denotes the risk of development of more serious arrhythmia in postnatal life in cases of fetal blocked atrial ectopic beats. This seems to occur when the underlying mechanism is an accessory AV conduction pathway that appears occult even at basal ECG. On the basis of this observation, we recommend that fetuses with complex atrial ectopic beats should be closely monitored before and after birth for evidence of new arrhythmias. Since time period for monitoring is unknown, parents should be advised to verify baby's heart beat during feeding, quietness or sleep and refer both low and high frequencies.

N2  - Background: Blood pressure (BP) varies according to the circadian cycle, showing a physiological decline during sleep (dipping pattern). Several studies are showing that the absence of the nocturnal fall of BP (non-dipping pattern) can be linked to worse cardiovascular prognosis and increased insulin resistance. Objective: To evaluate the metabolic parameters and insulin resistance in women with hyperandrogenism, correlating with the nocturnal fall of blood pressure. Methods: We assessed 38 women, 18 to 45 years old, with clinical and/or laboratorial hyperandrogenism. As exclusion criteria, we adopted: kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver failure, congestive heart disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, Cushing's syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, pregnancy, previous history of hypertension and chronic use of corticosteroids. The following parameters were evaluated: presence (dipping pattern) or absence (non-dipping pattern) of nocturnal blood pressure decrease during ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure (AMBP), lipid profile (total Cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides assessed by automated enzymatic method, Roche, German; LDL cholesterol calculated by Friedewald formula), fasting insulin and blood glucose (ECLIA and enzymatic method, respectively, Roche, German), HOMA-IR [Fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) x Fasting insulin (mU/L)] / 22.5. The dipping pattern was characterized as the fall of > 10% of the systolic BP during sleep. Results: The results are presented in the table 1 (mean + SD). Conclusions: We found no statistically significant difference in any of the parameters evaluated among patients with or without nocturnal fall of blood pressure. (Table presented).

N2  - Background and aims To determine the association between screen time and child outcomes. Methods 706 mothers who were part of a longitudinal pregnancy cohort were mailed a questionnaire when children were 6 to 8 years of age. Mothers reported the amount of time children spent with computers, television, and video games on an average school day (screen time), BMI, child behavior, and physical activity. Using Pearson chi-square tests or independent sample t-tests, children who had more than 2 hours screen time on an average school day were compared to those who had 2 hours or less. Results 450 mothers completed the questionnaire (response rate 64%). 30% of children had more than 2 hours of screen time during school days, and these children were more likely to take longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep (25% vs. 15%, p=0.006) and less likely to exhibit prosocial behavior (mean 12.88 vs. 13.71, p=0.028). There was no association between screen time and BMI or time spent in physical activity. Compared to mothers of children had 2 hours or less of screen time, mothers of children who had more than 2 hours of screen time were less likely to be satisfied with their child's level of physical activity (76% vs. 89%, p<0.001). Conclusions The Canadian Paediatric Society guideline recommends no more than 2 hours of screen time per day. More than a third of children exceed this limit on school days, and this may have important implications for children's sleep and behavior in childhood.

N2  - Energy drinks have become very popular, yet they present health concerns and workplace safety issues related to mental and physical effects of the drinks, which are mainly related to the central nervous system and include heightened alertness, altered sleep patterns, arrhythmias and, rarely, seizures. In the workplace, any pharmacologic agent or substance, such as energy drinks, may present a risk to the delivery of health care, and the use energy drinks during pregnancy and lactation are a concern and patient education is warranted. © 2012 AWHONN.

N2  - Circadian rhythm disorders represent an important component underlying the pathology of depression. One of the subtypes of depression, in which these disorders may play a crucial role, is the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The bright light therapy (BLT) has been reported as a novel, promising treatment method for SAD since 1984, and most of the data revealing its efficacy has been referred to adult patients, without comorbid disorders. However, in the recent years, more and more reports have been presented, which confirm the usefulness of BLT in some specific subpopulations of patients, including children, adolescents and pregnant women. The present review summarizes the applications of BLT in antepartum depression, childhood and adolescence depression as well as in patients suffering from eating disorders. Although the body of evidence is still too small to recommend the use of BLT as the first line of treatment for the depression or eating disorders in these patient subpopulations; it appears that BLT may be a useful alternative or adjunctive therapy for these diseases. However, the specific clinical applications of BLT in these areas need further investigation. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Accidental dura mater puncture is a potential complication during epidural block, and may be associated with multiple factors. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of accidental dural puncture in a university hospital, evaluating the differences in the number of complications during different working hours. A prospective observational study was conducted on all women who requested regional anaesthesia in the Epidural Analgesia Unit between 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2011, and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The technique employed to control labour pains was epidural analgesia. A total of 12,480 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of accidental dura mater puncture was 0.4% (50 patients). Of these, 28% were due to medical residents. More accidental dura mater punctures were observed during September and in the afternoon shift. The prevalence of accidental dura mater puncture is similar to other patient series. In ours, tiredness or lack of sleep did not influence the incidence of complications in analgesia for labour pains in a 24 hour care unit. This may be due to the distribution of on-call shifts not exceeding more than 6 hours. Copyright © 2011 Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor.

N2  - Having the right care is essential for the wellbeing of all people with diabetes. There is a minimum level of health care that every person with diabetes should expect. In 2010, Diabetes UK produced a list of 15 essential checks and services that people with diabetes should expect to receive. We wanted to assess whether we were adequately achieving all of these targets in our own diabetes service and assess whether the targets were themselves adequate and appropriate. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 200 randomly selected patients attending the diabetes review clinic in a district general hospital. We recorded whether the parameters outlined in the Diabetes UK '15 health care essentials' had been achieved in the last 12 months and then collated the data. The data showed that we scored well in terms of monitoring HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, retinal screening and cholesterol. However, we scored sub-optimally in terms of the following parameters: smoking cessation, pregnancy planning, structured education, measurement of waist circumference and psychological assessment. In conclusion, the Diabetes UK 'essentials' checklist may be viewed as mechanistic, but it provides a useful starting point to assess the effectiveness of a diabetes service in providing the basics of patient care in much the same way as the WHO surgical checklist reduces adverse outcomes. We have been able to see where the deficiencies in our own service lie and have made amends to ensure that these areas are covered in future. One issue that arose is that there are certain other 'essentials' that would be good to include in such a checklist, such as: erectile dysfunction (as suggested by the NICE guidelines), obstructive sleep apnoea, vitamin D deficiency, neuropathy screening and monitoring of liver function to rule out incipient steatohepatitis/fatty liver disease.

N2  - Caffeine is widely consumed by people of all ages. In the last period a market of caffeine-containing products, particularly energy drinks and food supplements increased. Caffeine for years is under discussion, whether has positive whether adverse impact on health. Children are a group of special anxieties. Caffeine is a stimulant of central nervous system and therefore is probably the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world. The physiological effect of caffeine and the lack of nutrition value causes a great interest its impact on health, especially with reference to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Results of scientific research are not clear. The influence of caffeine on the human body is conditioned with the individual metabolism of caffeine which also depends on many endogenic and environmental factors. According to the current knowledge moderate caffeine intake by healthy adults at a dose level of 400 mg a day is not associated with adverse effects, but it also depends on other health determinants of a lifestyle. Excessive caffeine consumption can cause negative health consequences such as psychomotor agitation, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal complaints. Adverse effect of caffeine intoxication is classified in World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Metabolism of caffeine by pregnant woman is slowed down. Caffeine and its metabolites pass freely across the placenta into a fetus. For this reason pregnant women should limit caffeine intake. Children and adolescents should also limit daily caffeine consumption. It results from the influence of caffeine on the central nervous system in the period of rapid growth and the final stage of brain development, calcium balance and sleep duration. Average daily caffeine consumption in European countries ranging from 280-490 mg. The highest caffeine intake is in Scandinavian countries what results from the great consumption of the coffee. As far as caffeine consumption by Polish population is concerned there is very few data in this subject so far. In the nineties of the previous century it was 141 mg per day, whereas according to recent survey daily caffeine intake by women from the Warsaw region was 251 mg and 15% of examined women consumed an excessive quantity of caffeine (> or = 400 mg). Smokers consume more caffeine than nonsmokers, similarly to persons with mental illnesses. With reference to the caffeine consumption it should be underline that caffeine content in coffee and tea beverages varies greatly depending on the method of brewing whereas the content of caffeine in many brands of energy drinks can much vary. This should be taken into account in the daily caffeine intake.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep disorders are often underdiagnosed during pregnancy. Our aim is to describe their prevalence, type, time of appearance and related factors. Methods: Observational descriptive prospective study during 4 months in full term pregnant women attending Fetus Physiopathology Office (n = 290). Measures: self-filled questionnaires about daylife and sleep habits, sleep disorders symptoms, pregnancy features and socio-demographic data. Clinical criteria: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) for insomnia, Epworth scale for Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS), and Walters 1995 and International Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group 2002 for RLS. Statistic analyisis: Descriptive measures, Pearson's chi quadrat and Fisher's exact test. Level of statistical significance: P < 0.05. Results: Prevalence: 86.6% of studied women reported changes in sleep quality, quantity or habits. Only 12% of our sample had spontaneously complained about sleep disorders without being asked. Most of them complained to midwives. The most prevalent sleep disorders are insomnia symptoms (up to 95.5%), RLS symptoms (67%), breathing disorders during sleep (snoring 50.7%, sleep apnea 5.9%), and EDS (35%). Sleep disorders are more prevalent during 3rd trimester (80.6%) followed by the 1st one (9.9%). In order of frequency, the reported related causes are polyuria, gastroesophagic reflux, muscle discomfort and fetus movements. Sleeping habits: Increase of frequency and duration of daytime naps (78.2%), insufficient nocturnal sleep hours (48.2%), changing of usual sleep position (46.6%) and higher need of sleep-inducing techniques such as reading or watching television (37.3%). Socio-demographic data and daily habits: negative relation between sleep disorders and regular exercise. Positive relation with workload, overweight, multiparity and age. No relation found between treatment with iron supplements and RLS symptoms. Conclusion: 1. Sleep disorders are highly prevalent during pregnancy, due to physiological changes and other social and behavioural factors. The most prevalent is insomnia. 2. They are usually not reported by women nor Health professionals. Both must be aware about them and pay attention to their importance on quality of life and fetus' wellness. 3. Treatment with iron supplements is not effective on RLS symptoms during pregnancy; therefore they are not necessary.

N2  - Sleep disturbances and changes in pregnancy may impair glucose mechanism. This study aimed to examine associations of sleepdisordered breathing, sleep and nap duration with 1-h glucose challenge test levels in pregnant women after controlling for known risk factors for gestational diabetes. Pregnant women (n = 104) who underwent full polysomnography and a glucose challenge test (GCT), and completed the Multivariable Apnoea Prediction and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Indexes were studied. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Over 13% participants reported habitual snoring in the first-trimester. Only 9.3% women with normoglycaemia (GCT < 135) were habitual snorers, whereas 45.5% women with hyperglycaemia-(GCT ≥ 135) had habitual snoring (P < 0.001). Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (loud snoring, snorting/gasping and apnoeas), (odds ratio (OR) 2.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-5.41; P = 0.001) and total nap duration (OR 1.48; 95%CI 0.96-2.28; P = 0.08) were associated with hyperglycaemia. After adjusting for confounders, sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (OR, 3.37; 95%CI, 1.44-8.32; P = 0.005) and nap duration (OR, 1.64; 95%CI, 1.00-2.681.02; P = 0.05) continued to be associated with hyperglycaemia. However, the primary outcome measure, the apnea/hypopnea index in the firsttrimester was not significantly associated with hyperglycaemia (OR 1.03; 95%CI 0.83-1.28; P = 0.77). Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms and nap duration are associated with hyperglycaemia. We found no association between sleep duration and hyperglycaemia. Research is needed to determine whether women with sleep-disordered breathing and/or daytimenapping are at risk for gestational diabetes.

N2  - Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of short term sleep deprivation (SD) on the sleep pattern in pregnant and non-pregnant rats. Methods: Polysomnogram consisting of cortical electroencephalogram, hippocampal theta-activity and locomotor activity was recorded 24 h in 18 female Wistar rats in the “disk-over-water” paradigm. Animals were kept under 12/12 h light-dark schedule; 8:00 lights on. Before the experiment rats were adapted to experimental situation to be able to move across the rotating disk without falling in water. After the adaptation period polysomnogram was recorded during three consecutive days in 12 animals without disk rotation (control group 1). From the next day 6 rats underwent SD procedure with pre-set program of disk rotation from 11:00 to 14:00 during three consecutive days (experimental group 1). Another group of 6 rats were subjected to SD during 5-7th days of pregnancy (experimental group 2). Polysomnogram was also constantly recorded during three SD days. In rats forming control group 2 (n = 6) polysomnogram was recorded during 5-7th days of pregnancy on the immobile disk over water. Results: Data analysis revealed that the degree of SD was the same in pregnant and non-pregnant animals. However only in pregnant rats sleep intensity increased during the first hours after SD with respect to the control values. In addition this time period was also characterized by the presence of REM sleep rebound in pregnant but not in non-pregnant rats. Conclusion: It is concluded that homeostatic compensation of SD effects on sleep pattern works more effective in rats during the first week of pregnancy than in non-pregnant rats.

N2  - Introduction: It is estimated that 10% of pregnancies are affected by hypertension worldwide and one-half of all are due to preeclampsia. An association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension has been observed, but large studies are lacking in this field. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of reported preeclampsia among women when they later were diagnosed with OSA. Material and methods: The OSA women (n = 156) were a part of the Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort. They were newly diagnosed with moderate or severe OSA, mean AHI 42.6(±20.0), mean ODI 32.0 (±20.0). They all answered a questionnaire including questions about health, sleep, symptoms of OSA and preeclampsia. Those who answered that they had been diagnosed with preeclampsia (PE) or pregnancy induced hypertension (HT) were defined as having had PE and HT. Results: Among the 156 OSA women 146 reported having been pregnant. Among them 31% reported that they had during pregnancy been diagnosed with preeclampsia and 37% that they had pregnancy induced hypertension. This is much higher when compared to reports about same disorders from women in the general population. When the OSA women reporting preeclampsia were compared to OSA women not reporting PE, they were more likely to be more obese (BMI 35.6 m2, (±6.3) versus 32.5 m2, (±5.3), P = 0.002), be younger (mean age 56.1 versus 59.6 years, P = 0, 01), be current smokers (29% versus 13%). In a multivariate logistic regression, they are also more likely to report nocturnal sweating and morning headaches after adjusting for significant demographic factors. No significant differences were found in OSA severity, insomnia, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obstructive lung diseases, restless legs syndrome between OSA women reporting PE and those who did not. Conclusion: In a prospective cohort of female patients with obstructive sleep apnea one third of them reported having had preeclampsia or hypertension during pregnancy which is three times more often than reported in the general population. These women were compared to other OSA women more obese, younger, more often smokers and reporteted night time sweatening and headache upon wakening more often. These findings show an association between OSA among women and preeclampsia/pregnancy induced hypertension and raise the question how these conditions are related to each other.

N2  - Present actigraphic and subjective data on the sleep of a pair of identical twins and a pair of fraternal twins, at 3 months postpartum. A pair of monozygotic twins (boys) and a pair of dizygotic twins (girls) wore an actiwatch, on their ankle, for a period of respectively seven and six consecutive days and nights to measure their sleep-wake patterns. Actiwatches (Cambridge Neurotechnology) were set to record activity in 1-min intervals. Several sleep parameters were calculated: sleep efficiency, mean activity score, among others. Mothers answered questions regarding weeks of gestation when the babies were born and their's babies sleep. Both pairs were born at 35 weeks of gestation. Identical twins (Jo and A) and fraternal twins (L and Ju) presented, respectively, a sleep efficiency of 64.86 and 66.00, and of 75.14 and 80.29. Jo and A and L and Ju mean activity scores were, respectively, of 43.43 and 46.14, and 22.43 and 32.29. Jo and A and L and Ju actual sleep time were, respectively, of 06:30 and 06:37 and of 08:29 and 07:56. Regarding actual wake time, Jo and A and L and Ju showed the following values: 02:40 and 02:36; 01:21 and 01:46. Jo and A. presented 63.57% and 63.71% of immobile time; L and Ju of 81.86% and 78.86%. Finally, Jo and A and L and Ju showed, respectively, a moving time of 35.57% and 35.29%, and 17.29% and 20.29%. According to the mothers, J. and A. had none to one and one to two night awakenings, respectively at 06:00 am (half an hour) and 03:00 and 06:30 am (40 min); L. and Ju. had none to one night awakenings at 07:00 or 08:00 (10 min). Concerning daytime naps, J. and A. presented three naps (2:45 and 2:30 h, respectively), at 7:30, 11:30 and 15:30; L. and Ju presented three naps (45 min to 1 h, respectively), at correspondingly, 10:00, 13:30 and 17:00 and 9:30, 13:00 and 18:00. Twin studies show that sleep is extremely similar in identical twins, while in fraternal twins, it seems only to exist familial relatedness. Using actigraphic data, in only a pair of identical and a pair of fraternal twins, we found greater similarity in all sleep parameters in the identical pair, comparing with the fraternal pair.

N2  - Introduction: Insufficient restorative sleep can have profound effects of biological processes including neurocognitive and emotional processing. Sleep disturbance during pregnancy is common and has been variably reported as affecting both expectant parents. Methods: We explored the utility of a number of mechanisms of assessing sleep quality and the effects of sleep disturbance in 26 primigravid mothers and their partners at 20 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy. We subsequently reviewed 10 patients at 3 months postpartum to determine whether sleep disturbance or antenatal materno-fetal attachment was associated with future attachment to the newborn baby and the incidence of postnatal depression. Results: Sleep disturbance, both subjective and objective, as assessed by actigraphy, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, increased in expectant mothers between the two time points. No changes in partner sleep quality or characteristics were identified. Depression scores (HADS) increased in mothers in late pregnancy (P = 0.02) as did materno-fetal attachment scores (MAAS questionnaire). No correlations were identified between quality, quantity or deterioration of sleep and depression or attachment quality scores. Ten patients utilised a commercially available neuro-cognitive battery (CogState). No change in detection, identification or recall was noted between the two time points. Ten patients completed a postnatal attachment questionnaire. High levels of attachment were noted. Strong correlations were identified between 'time spent in attachment Mode' at 20 weeks and quality of attachment at 3 months postdelivery (R2 = 0.46). This effect weakened at 36 weeks (R2 = 0.17). Surprisingly strong associations were noted between the global attachment score at 20 weeks and the degree of postnatal hostility toward the child at 3 months (R2 = 0.58). This association weakened at 36 weeks of pregnancy (R2 = 0.13). Only 1/10 patients attained a clinical diagnosis of postnatal depression (PND). Prenatal questionnaire scores were unable to predict the development of PND. Conclusions: Sleep quality deteriorates in expectant mothers as pregnancy progresses but not in partners. Maternofetal attachment increases throughout pregnancy as do depression scores. Neurocognitive function is preserved. Antenatal attachment questionnaires do not predict postnatal depression symptoms but did predict postnatal attachment.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy has been associated with adverse maternal outcomes. We reported previously an increased incidence of hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) associated with sleep disordered breathing. This study further investigated the placental findings in OSA. Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study of pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The control group consisted of women with a negative screen for OSA. Gestational age at delivery, placental weight percentile, findings of gross and microscopic examinations of placenta were collected. Placental findings were further classified into four categories. Frequency of pathological findings in OSA and control groups was compared by Fisher's exact test with P<0.05 as significant. Results: Fifteen placentas (10 term and 5 preterm) were available from women with OSA. There was one preterm stillbirth due to uteroplacental insufficiency. Forty-five placentas (32 term and 13 preterm) were randomly selected from the control group. There was one preterm stillbirth with no cause of death determined. Significant pathological findings in placentas from women with OSA included decidual vasculopathy (7/15 vs 8/45, P<0.05), abruption (3/15 vs 1/45, P<0.05), increased syncytial knots (8/15 vs 8/45, P<0.05). Significantly more “delayed villous maturity” was identified in term placentas with maternal OSA (3/10 vs 1/32, P<0.05). All above findings are related to maternal underperfusion. There were no significant differences in small-for-gestational age placentas or preterm birth. Conclusions: Significant changes related to maternal underperfusion were found in the placentas with maternal OSA. Decidual vasculopathy is often seen in hypertensive disorders and GDM and is regarded as underlying causes leading to infarct and abruption. Delayed villous maturity in term placenta is often seen with maternal GDM. These findings are consistent with clinical outcome findings and suggested a potential relationship between altered sleep patterns and placental underperfusion and reaction.

N2  - Clock-gene proteins are expressed in mammals in neurons of the hypothalamus suprachiasmatic nucleus and of other CNS structures, in muscles, viscercal organs, and vessels, and form circadian rhythms of many functions. Little is known about the factors of formation of the circadian mechanism at the prenatal period. In rats the E20 stage is characterized by a high level of oxytocin and selective expression of the first protein of the clock-genes PER1. The foal of the present study was to check the suggestion about the positive feedback between PER1 and oxytocin at the prenatal period as well as to elucidate a possible role of PER1 in regulation of interactions between oxytocin and GABA at the period of formation of the cerebral circadian mechanism of clock-genes. With aid of western-blotting, we analyzed the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from anterior hypothalamus homogenate in pregnant females and embryos of rats (E20). The retinol metabolites through their nuclear receptor RORalpha are known to be bound to promoters of genes of oxytocin and per 1. Next day after administration of retinol to the females, a rise of PER1 content was noted in their cytoplasm, whereas in their embryos the PER1 content was elevated in the nucleus. In the embryo cytoplasm there was a significant rise of production of oxytocin receptors and a decrease of the level of enzymes of GABA synthesis (glutamate decarboxylases 67 and 65). The results indicate the oxytocin- and retinol-dependent increase of the PER1 expression and the subsequent change of ratio of efficiency of oxytocin and GABA at the prenatal stage of formation of the circadian clock-mechanism of the rat embryo anterior hypothalamus.

N2  - Objectives: Polysomnography (PSG) often fails to find differences between individuals with sleep complaints and good sleepers. However, sample size and representativity may be issues involved in this lack of relation. The present study investigated the relation between subjective sleep quality and PSG in a large sample of women. Methods: Ambulant PSG recordings were obtained on one occasion in 400 non-pregnant women (randomly selected from a representative sample, oversampling of snorers). Sleep quality was rated on a visual analogue scale the morning after the recording. Three groups with high (HSQ), intermediate (ISQ), and low sleep quality (LSQ)(cutoffs at 33 and 66 mm on the VAS) with N = 88, 126, and 170, respectively, were built. Three hundred eighty-four women (mean age 50 years, SD 11, Min 22, Max 73) with complete data were included. To investigate if PSG measures (total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), number of awakenings (>60 s) (NoA), sleep efficiency,%sleep stages) differed with respect to sleep quality (categorical) and age (continuous), multiple linear regressions were applied (reference group: high sleep quality). Analyses were adjusted for AHI. An additional model including an interaction between age and sleep quality group was fitted and compared to the regression without the interaction (significance level P < 0.05 for all analyses). Results: TST was significantly (sig) lower in the groups with intermediate and low sleep quality (marginal means: HSQ: 414 min; ISQ: 389 min; LSQ: 371 min) and decreased with age. SL (HSQ: 15 min; ISQ: 23 min; LSQ: 25 min), NoA (HSQ 6.7; ISQ: 7.7; LSQ: 8.2), WASO and % S1 sleep were sig. higher with low and intermediate sleep quality, and increased age. % S2 was slightly reduced only in the intermediate sleep quality group; % REM and sleep efficiency (HSQ: 89%; ISQ: 86%; LSQ: 83%) were sig. reduced in the LSQ group and with increasing age. No sig. effect of age and sleep quality was observed on%SWS. Adding an interaction between age and sleep quality groups did not improve the model fit. Conclusions: In a large sample of women, PSG measures differed significantly in groups with different sleep quality. In particular sleep continuity, initiation and length appear to be impaired when subjective sleep quality is low. The relation of subjective sleep quality to PSG measures did not significantly change with increasing age, but age was, as expected, significantly related to differences in most PSG parameters.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the links between prenatal environmental factors on sleep patterns during the first 18 months of life. The Autonomic Baby Evaluation and Sleep development (AuBe) study is a prospective study on the maturation of sleep and autonomic nervous system during the first 2 years of life. The newborns were enrolled at birth and were followed every 6 months with questionnaires, polysomnographic (birth-6 months) and holter ECG recordings (12-18-24 months) and neuropsychological evaluation (WPPSI-III) at 30 months. Only the questionnaires data until 18 months were reported here. Results: Two hundred and ninety-six newborns (56% boys) were involved in this study. Nineteen babies were small for gestational age. There were 31 preterm infants (10.4%) with a gestational age of 35.92 ± 0.73 weeks. Forty-three mothers were overweight (14.5%) and 23 were obese (7.7%). There was no alcohol consumption during pregnancy but 74 mothers smoked (25%), 14 smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day. Twenty-two mothers were depressed on the HAD and Mini evaluation but only 2 were on SSRI treatment. There was a decrease in daytime sleep duration from 6 to 18 months (P < 0.001) but only a decrease in night sleep time between 6 and 12 months (P = 0.025). A negative correlation was found between total sleep duration and weight (P = 0.035), especially at 18 months (P = 0.048). Sleep problems (sleep onset problems or disruptive night waking) were found in 51.8% of 6-month-olds, 33.6% of 12-month-olds and 34.4% of 18-month-olds. No statistical changes for sleep disorders were found with maturation. Sleep onset problems (10.1%), night waking (37.8%), short sleep duration (11.6%) and sleep problems (42.4%) were reported by parents. 9.1% parents were present at time of sleep onset and 6.6% parents bed shared with their children. We did not find a relation between sleep problems and the parental presence or bedsharing. Breastfeeding decreased total sleep time (P = 0.003). Maternal depression during pregnancy increased the risk of night waking at 6 months (P = 0.009). At 18 months, there was a relation between gestational age and sleep onset problems (P = 0.001), night waking (P < 0.001), sleep problems (P = 0.013) and noisy breathing (P = 0.017). SGA was correlated with sleep onset difficulties (P = 0.017). No effects of maternal obesity, gestational HTA (n = 12) or diabetes (n = 14), pre or postnatal exposure to tobacco were found.

N2  - Background: Obesity is highly related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Research has shown that one potential cause of obesity may be short sleep duration. Aim: The aim was to assess how sleep duration and obesity is related over a 10 year period, in a population-based sample of women. Methods: A total of 5,003 non-pregnant women (response rate 80 %) >=30 years, answered a 10-year follow-up questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions on sleep duration, weight, height, waist circumference, snoring and life style factors. Regression analysis was performed to analyze independent associations between sleep duration and measures of obesity. Results: In the whole population 31% (n=2,127) of the women had increased their weight by at least 15 kg, 37% (n=2,549) had a BMI>=30 kg/m2 and 52% were centrally obese (waist circumference ≥88cm). Both short (<6h) (OR=1.38; 95%CI 1.06-1.80) and long sleep duration (≥9h) (1.86; 1.32-2.62) showed to be risk factors for general obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) after controlling for confounders. When dividing the women by age both short and long sleep duration were risk factors in the younger age group (age at baseline <40 years). In women above age 40 years at baseline only long sleep duration remained as a risk factor for general obesity after controlling for confounders. In addition, short sleep duration was shown as a risk factor for central obesity after adjustments (1.46; 1.002-2.14) in younger women, whereas long sleep duration was a risk factor in women age ≥40 years (1.86; 1.17-2.96). Conclusion: Both short and long sleeping women had a greater risk of general obesity compared with normal sleepers (6-9h). Young short sleepers were also more at risk for central obesity.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy and the post-partum period mark a significant increase in both sleep disturbance and risk for major depressive disorders (MDD). Women with a prior history of MDD are particularly vulnerable to developing post-partum depression. Recent studies have shown insomnia and fragmented sleep are strongly associated with maternal depression. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate actigraphy measures of sleep in the post-partum period in two groups of women: those at high and low risk of developing postpartum MDD, expecting that women at high risk for MDD would show more disturbed sleep throughout the first 6-8 months post-partum. Methods: Twenty-three women participated in study, 8 with no history of depression and defined as low risk, and 15 in the high-risk category: eight women with a past history of MDD and seven women with current symptoms. Sleep was measured from light and motionsensing actigraphs (AW2) and sleep diary for 1 week every month starting at 2 weeks post partum, and continuing until 30 weeks post partum. Depression symptoms were assessed by self-report using Beck II depression inventory (BDI-II). Results: No sleep differences were evident between the groups with a past and current MDD and thus, the 15 women were combined into a single high-risk group. At 2 weeks post-partum, high-risk women showed longer sleep latency and higher sleep fragmentation than the low-risk women (P < 0.02) with differences persisting at 30 weeks (P < 0.05). At 2 weeks post-partum, high-risk women showed better sleep efficiency than low-risk women, an effect that reversed by 30 weeks (P < 0.004). Total sleep time did not differ between risk groups and did not show a significant change across the post-partum period. Sleep measures predicted BDI-II scores with the most disturbed sleep among those with the worst depression (F = 3.1; R2 = 0.41; P < 0.04). Sleep latency was the best predictor of depression symptoms overall (P 0.007),accounting for more than 30% of the variance. Finally, those women with the highest BDI-II scores at Week 30 had the longest sleep latency and the shortest total sleep time (P < 0.008). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that women at high risk for post-partum depression have poor sleep throughout the postpartum period, compared to low-risk women. These findings identify the need for management strategies to reduce the sleep-related risks of post-partum period depression.

N2  - We present a rare case of catathrenia in a 37 years old, healthy female patient with a frequent, unremitting episodes of purely expiratory nocturnal groaning (NG) sound appearing several times every night exclusively during sleep. NG first appeared at the age of 21 years and persisted even during pregnancy with the patient unaware of nocturnal sounds. A full video-polysomnography (v-PSG; digital video/EEG/time/sound synchronized recording with Nicolet One, Viasys Healthcare system) was performed on two consecutive nights from 09 pm to 08 am next morning. v-PSG included: full longitudinal bipolar montage to detect EEG activity with additional recordings from O2/A1, O1A2, C4A1 and C3A2; right and left electro-oculogram, right and left surface submental EMG and right and left periodic limb movements; thoracic and abdominal respiratory movements; microphone for sound recording; body position; one electrocardiogram derivation (modified V2 lead) and oxygen saturation. v-PSG of two consecutive nights showed on average 16 episodes of NG sound during NREM sleep. The episodes were initialized by a short awakening, followed by immediate cessation of respiratory movements and nasal airflow (central sleep apnea, CSA) accompanied by a morose sound. The longest NG episode consisted of 40 s CSA and 17 s NG; the shortest consisted of apnea and groaning each lasting 1 s. NG consisted of monotonous vocalization frequently interrupted by 2-3 inhalations with CSA always being longer than NG. On the first night, total duration of 13 NG episodes was 5.81 min. Mean duration of CSAs was 26.83 s, and total and mean duration of a NG was 3.49 min and 16.11 s, respectively. The sound was persistent, frequently discontinuous, of different volume and pitch. We also noticed a high number of CSAs with a pattern similar to catathrenia but with no NG or with only a short initial (up to 1 s) NG sound. In full wakefulness we noticed a high number of CSAs during prolonged periods of pre-sleep placid lying down. No oxygen desaturation was noticed. In a patient with catathrenia CSA breathing was present both in wakefulness and sleep. However, only in sleep it contained NG. The presence of different disturbed breathing patterns (catathrenia with NG; CSA but without NG vocalization; CSA in full wakefulness) suggest that catathrenia itself is a specific clinical entity with an underlying disturbance of breathing drive both in sleep and wakefulness.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as increased motor activity and elevated anxiety, that may last a lifetime. Persistent sleep disruption may underlie these problems. Using a rat model, we investigated long-term alterations of sleep-wake behavior following AE during a critical early developmental period. Male rats received 2.6. g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group), or were sham-intubated (S group). On PD52-80, they were instrumented for tethered electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram recording and habituated to the recording procedures. Sleep-wake behavior was then recorded during one 24. h-long session. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored in 10. s epochs during 6. h of the lights-on (rest) and 6. h of the lights-off (active) periods. During the active period, REMS percentage was significantly lower (4.7. ±. 0.9 (SE) . vs. 8.2. ±. 0.9; . p<. 0.02) and the percentage of SWS tended to be lower (p=0.07) in AE than S rats (N=6/group). During the rest period, sleep and wake amounts did not differ between the groups, but AE rats had longer latency to both SWS and REMS onset (. p=. 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). Our data demonstrate that, in a rat model of prenatal AE, impaired sleep-wake behavior persists into the adulthood. Disordered sleep may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral disorders seen in human victims of prenatal AE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) are of increasing use in pregnant women, but their long-term effects on the child are largely unknown. Such putative effects on sleep regulation were examined in the adult progeny of mice treated with SSRI during gestation. Methods: C57/BL/6 gestating females were treated from the first until the last day of gestation with fluoxetine (18 mg/kg/day in drinking water). Control animals drank plain water. Polygraphic sleep recordings were made at 8-16 weeks of age in the progeny exposed to prenatal fluoxetine treatment (FLX) or water (Control). Vigilance states (wakefulness, slow wave sleep and REM sleep) were analyzed in basal conditions, and after a restraint stress challenge of 90 min duration. Results: In basal conditions, both male and female FLX mice exhibited an increase in the duration of wakefulness (+16% and +10% of that in the control groups, respectively), and a concomitant decrease in slow wave sleep (-16.8% and -11%) associated with enhanced beta/delta ratio in the EEG spectral power. REM sleep (REMS) duration was not modified. After 90 min of restraint stress, control mice displayed an increase of REMS amounts appearing 2 h after the end of the stress period and lasting for 6 h (+54% and +135% of no stress conditions for males and females, respectively). In the FLX groups, females exhibited the same sleep modifications as controls. FLX male mice presented a smaller and non significant increase of REMS amounts (+22%), but this increase was delayed so as to begin 4 h after the end of stress period and to last for about 8 h thereafter. In conclusion, in utero exposure to fluoxetine in mice promotes persistent disturbances in sleep organization and EEG activity that evoke those of chronic insomnia and seem to be gender-dependent, since only the male progeny is strongly affected. These modifications are associated with a delayed response of sleep to stress.

N2  - Objective: To assess characteristics of short sleepers and long sleepers and to assess association between sleep duration and central obesity in a population-based sample of women. Method: Non-pregnant women 20. years that were randomly selected from the population-registry of Uppsala, Sweden, answered a questionnaire (n= 6461) including questions on sleeping habits and somatic disorders. Results: There was a U-shaped association between sleep duration and waist circumference. Short sleeping women (<5. h) had a waist circumference of 89.2. ±. 14.9. cm (mean. ±. SD) decreasing to 82.9. ±. 11.9. cm for women sleeping 7-<8. h and increasing to 89.0. ±. 16.7. cm for women sleeping 10. h. Both short sleepers and long sleepers were more often physically inactive, smokers, ill or taking medication, and psychologically distressed than normal sleepers (6-<9. h). In women <50. years both short and long sleep duration were risk factors for central obesity. Short sleep duration remained a risk factor for central obesity, whereas the association with long sleep duration did not reach statistical significance after adjustments. Conclusions: Short sleepers and long sleepers showed differences in characteristics compared to normal sleepers. Furthermore, we showed an independent association between short sleep duration and central obesity, which was strongest in younger women. It is important to identify short sleepers, especially in younger women. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is increased in women with gestational hypertension (GH). SDB severity is measured by the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) and oxyhaemoglobin desaturation. Previous findings from research into GH and SDB have found that, although subtle changes in the inspiratory flow profile i.e. flow limitation, were present in polysomnography, the AHI was low and oxygen desaturation minor. We therefore measured overnight blood pressure, snoring and polysomnography in pregnant women to ascertain the relationships between various components of SDB and blood pressure during sleep. Methods: Thirty pregnant women (12 with GH) were studied in their own homes. Polysomnography (EEG, EOG, EMG, airflow using nasal cannula, respiratory movement using inductive plethysmography and oxyhaemoglobin saturation) was performed using the EmblettaTM device. Snoring was recorded using a SonoMatTM, a thin mattress in which sensors measure and record sound and movement. Overnight blood pressure was recorded using SpaceLabsTM, which uses an arm cuff that inflates every 20-30 min. Results: There were no relationships between AHI or mean and minimum SaO2 and blood pressure (r2 < 0.15 in all measurements). However, snoring was associated with an increased overnight blood pressure. Higher percentages of snoring were associated with higher average and maximum sleeping blood pressure. Women who snored for >30% of the night had significantly higher overnight BP than women who snored for <20% of the night. These findings were true for women with and without gestational hypertension. Conclusion: Overnight snoring, but not AHI or oxygen desaturation, is associated with increased overnight blood pressure in pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Variety of stressors can potentially exacerbate spasticity; however, the scientific evidence to support this notion is unclear. The purpose of this study was to systematically identify and summarize literature examining the impact of physiological and psychological stressors on spasticity and discuss the evidence supporting various types of stressors. Methods: Electronic databases were searched using specific keywords. Reviews and reference lists were handchecked to find relevant articles. Over 1200 articles were scanned for relevance and a list of 42 relevant articles was included. After excluding reviews and studies on healthy controls 32 articles were reviewed. Results: We found varying degrees of evidence (ranging from case studies and self-reports to controlled trials) suggesting that spasticity may exacerbate in response to stressors such as bladder infection and distension, pregnancy, posture, cold weather, circadian rhythm, menstrual cycle, mental stress, and skin conditions. No evidence was found in the literature for increase in spasticity in response to changes in bracing, humidity, sleep, deep vein thrombosis, wounds, ulcers, haemorrhoids, fever, and ingrown toe nails. Conclusions: Majority of the stressors were studied using self-reports (except bladder and posture). Although selfreports indicate a strong possibility that these stressors might exacerbate spasticity, without objective data, the effect of these stimuli on spasticity remains inconclusive. Finally, the role of these physiological and psychological stressors in different neurologic conditions that lead to spasticity is unclear. Future studies need to systematically examine the effect of these stressors on spasticity in different neurologic conditions.

N2  - Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk for anxiety and depression (1). In patients with CF, elevated levels of depression and anxiety have been associated with lower quality of life, respiratory function, and reduced therapeutic regimen adherence (2-5). As the survival of patients with CF has improved, there is an increasing adult population and issues around pregnancy have become important. Postpartum depression, the most common complication of childbearing, occurs in 13 percent of women after delivery (i.e., one of every eight). In postpartum depression, anxiety is more common than major depression occurring at other times (6). Patients with CF who are postpartum therefore represent a unique population at risk for depression and anxiety. Many new moms experience a transient 7-10 day depression referred to as the postpartum blues, which commonly includes sadness, mood swings, tearfulness, and worry. Symptoms occur during the first few days after childbirth and quickly fade within one to two weeks. As these symptoms do not impair maternal functioning and are time limited they can be treated with reassurance and emotional support. Women should be encouraged to increase their psychosocial supports and obtain help caring for the infant during this time. Some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression (PPD). An episode of depression with postpartum onset, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), begins within 4 weeks after delivery. However, many epidemiologic studies define depression occurring within 3 months postpartum as PPD. The pattern of symptoms in women with PPD are indistinguishable from the characteristic major depression that can occur at other times in a woman's life. The symptoms of PPD can include depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, insomnia, fatigue, decreased appetite, feelings of worthlessness, poor concentration, and thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Untreated, PPD can have negative consequences for the infant including an increased risk of insecure attachment and cognitive and behavioral problems (7,8). Additionally, for the mother with CF, a postpartum depression can not only interfere with caretaking for the infant but may interfere with the new mom's ability to care for her CF. Addressing maternal depression is essential to ensure the healthy early brain and child development of the newborn (9) and also may promote adherence and ultimately improve maternal health outcomes. Rarely, an extreme form of postpartum depression known as postpartum psychosis develops after childbirth. Mothers with postpartum psychosis are severely impaired and may have paranoia, hallucinations and delusions. Careful assessment for the presence of suicidal and homicidal thoughts and plans is important. This is a serious condition that requires immediate psychiatric attention. Screening: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item questionnaire completed by the mother that can be easily administered in less than 5 minutes (10). It is in the public domain and is freely downloadable. This screen has been found to be a reliable indicator of the presence of postpartum depression in women in the United States (11) and has been adapted and validated in many languages. Items of the scale correspond to various clinical depression symptoms, such as guilt, sleep disturbance, low energy, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation. Overall assessment is done by total score, which is determined by adding together the scores for each of the 10 items. If a woman has a total score on the EPDS of 10 or higher or has an affirmative response to questions 10 (a suicide indicator) this constitutes a positive screen and requires a follow-up evaluation and treatment if indicated. Although formal screening tools are available asking two questions about mood and anhedonia may be as effective as using longer instruments in adults (12) and better fit the clinical practice. For example, “Since your baby was born, have you felt down, depressed or hopeless? Since your baby was born, have you had little interest or pleasure in activities most of the day nearly every day for the past two weeks?” If the woman answers in the affirmative to either question, it is a positive screening result. The level of impairment and distress can be explored with the question, “Has the depression made it hard for you to do your work, take care of things at home, or get along with people?” Treatment: PPD screening improves recognition of the disorder, but improvement in clinical outcomes requires care that ensures adequate treatment and follow- up. Responses to a positive postpartum depression screening range from providing reassurance to supportive strategies for postpartum blues and mild depression, to referral for specific interventions for moderate to severe depression (Edinburgh score >13). Education is always important and lets the mother know she is not alone, she is not to blame, and that she will get better. Non-pharmacological interventions are useful in treating PPD, especially in mild illness, as an adjunct to antidepressant medication in more severe depression, and in women reluctant to use medications, for example during breast-feeding. Evidence exists for the use of both cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy in the treatment of PPD (13). Antidepressants are often prescribed to treat PPD; however, few studies have systematically assessed the treatment specifically of PPD. For evidence based guidelines on the pharmacologic treatment of depression in adults, including PPD, see the American Psychiatric Association's practice guidelines at http//www.psych.org/guidelines/mdd2010 (14). When concerns are significant to warrant referral mothers may be referred to their obstetricians for follow- up and to mental health providers for therapy and/or medication management. If suicidality or psychosis is a concern, or the score on the Edinburg scale is greater than 20, accessing crisis intervention services are necessary.

N2  - Background: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a relatively common multisystem disorder with a prevalence estimated in several studies to be in a range of 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 individuals. The main beneficial effect of GH therapy in PWS is promoting growth and muscular trophism, with consequent improvement in body composition, strength, agility, physical activity and cardiorespiratory function. Case: We describe the case of a female, born at term from a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus, treated with insulin therapy from the 34th week of gestation. At the age of three years, for persistence of hypotonicity, genetic test confirmed the diagnosis of PWS (deletion). At the age of five years, after performing a sleep study and blood tests, including oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and HbA1c which resulted normal, the child started GH therapy. Blood tests performed 4 months after the beginning of GH therapy showed a normal OGTT, with HbA1C in the upper normal range (6%). The following control showed an increase in HbA1C (6,3%). Consequently, GH therapy was reduced; for impaired glucose tolerance and persistent high values of HbA1C, GH therapy was therefore interrupted after 14 months. Despite two years of treatment interruption, the child still presents impaired glucose tolerance and HbA1C levels of 6,2%. Patient's impaired glucose tolerance and history in first degree relatives for impaired glucose metabolism, suggested a genetic analysis of Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) 2, which resulted positive. Conclusions: Coexistence of PWS and MODY, presented here for the first time to our knowledge, is a peculiar situation with managing difficulties arising from the fact that the only treatment available for the former is potentially dangerous for the latter. Moreover, the lack of studies on the effects of GH on glucose tolerance in patients affected by MODY make it difficult to determine whether the risks of GH are balanced by benefits of the same therapy on PWS.

N2  - Objectives: The main objective of the study was to explore the efficacy of an online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) programme. Methods: A web-based system was developed consisting of an actigraph (Actiwatch, Philips Respironics), a personal webpage, and the protocol-based coaching of a sleep expert. The webpage first presented assessment questionnaires to identify the nature and severity of insomnia as well as the behavioural and cognitive factors associated to it. Moreover, it allowed viewing the sleep efficiency (SE) and total sleep time measured by the Actiwatch, filling in a sleep diary, reading weekly modules with standard components of CBT-I (including sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention - sequenced according to the specific needs of the participant), goal setting and reporting on daytime functioning and adherence to these goals. Participants received coaching by weekly progress reports and other messages (reminders, motivation). Participants were recruited via an online questionnaire. They had to indicate at least mild insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index ISI > 7). Pregnancy, shift work, sleep disorders, chronic pain and/or psychiatric conditions were excluded. The screening was followed by a telephone interview checking on motivation and practical aspects (e.g. holidays during testing period). The treatment group (N = 25, 18 females, mean age 38.1) engaged in the online coaching programme for 7 weeks on average. The control group with no treatment (N = 24, 16 females, mean age 38) completed a sleep diary for 2 eeks at the beginning and the end of the intervention period. Analyses of variance were conducted on ISI and standard sleep parameters from the sleep diary before and after treatment. Results: Thirty-seven participants (23 treatment, 14 control) were included in the analyses. In the treatment group the ISI significantly improved from 14.2 to 8.4 (CI 95% for mean difference [4.11, 7.46], P < 0.001) but did not change for the control group [10.8-11.3, CI 95% (-1.45, 0.45)]. Participants of the online coaching also achieved significant increases in SE from 76.1% to 84.7% (CI 95% for mean difference [-11.4, -5.1], P < 0.001). Conclusion: Participants who received the online coaching programme significantly improved their sleep, whereas sleep in the control group did not change. This study confirms that online delivery might improve the accessibility of CBT-I.

N2  - Background: Prenatal smoking exposure disrupts the development of the central nervous system in neonates and could lead to disturbances in the control of autonomous functions necessary to maintain their homeostasis. Objectives: Here, we have evaluated the influence of in utero exposure to smoking on autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in sleeping preterm neonates. Methods: Overnight polysomnography (EEG, ECG, eye and body movements) was performed at thermoneutrality in preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 ± 6.0 week, study weight: 1.94 ± 0.49 kg) born to non-smoking (control group, n = 18) or smoking (smoking group, n = 16, mean consumption: 14 ± 5 cig/ day) mothers during pregnancy. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used to evaluate ANS activity. Absolute and normalized values of low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) band powers, as well as the sympathovagal balance (LF/HF ratio) were assessed during active (AS) and quiet (QS) sleep stages. Results: Heart rate was not modified by prenatal smoking exposure. In both sleep stages, absolute and normalized HF values were significantly lower in the smoking group than in the control group (AS: P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively; QS: P = 0.004 and P = 0.022, respectively). Inversely, normalized LF power and the LF/HF ratio were significantly higher in the smoking group than in the control group (AS: P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively; QS: P = 0.022 and P = 0.006, respectively). Discussion: Our results point out a shift in the vagal-sympathetic balance with a decrease in the vagal tone in preterm neonates exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This effect does not depend on sleep stages. The present observations suggest an altered maturation of ANS in these infants, whose development is classically characterized by a progressive increase in vagal activity. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these ANS disturbances - at what is a critical stage in development - on these infants' vulnerability.

N2  - Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of night awakenings in infants with 5-8 months of age and its association with maternal and infant's characteristics. Methods: A subgroup of 1363 singleton infants from the Portuguese birth cohort, 'Generation XXI, was evaluated at the 6 months followup. At birth, interviewers collected data on maternal and pregnancy characteristics, and neonatal data and anthropometry retrieved from medical records. With structured questionnaires, data regarding infant's health and care, particularly sleeping habits, were obtained. Presence of night awakenings was considered if occurring at least three times per week and two or more times per night. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of night awakenings was 26% (24% in girls; 28% in boys, P = 0.078), with no significant differences across the age span (P = 0.718). In girls, night awakenings were associated with higher maternal age (≥35 versus <25 years: OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.1), family income 1001-1500€/month: OR = 0.5, 95% CI:0.3-0.9), current breastfeeding at request or at fixed schedule (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 2.9-7.2; OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-3.8, respectively), sleep all night in parents' bed (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4-3.9) and need of parental intervention or physical proximity to fall asleep (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.2-3.7; OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 2.3-7.7, respectively), and inversely associated with grandparents or nursery care during day (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2-0.6; OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1- 0.7,respectively). In boys, night awakenings were associated with higher maternal age (≥35 versus <25 years: OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0-3.6), current breastfeeding at request or at fixed schedule (versus never/not currently breastfeeding: OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 2.3- 5.2; OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.8-4.5, respectively), difficulties in feeding (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.3-3.2) and calming the child when crying (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.3), move to parents' bed during night or sleep in parents' bed all night (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.6-10.3; OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.2-3.4), and need of parental intervention or physical proximity to fall asleep (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1-3.0; OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 2.2-6.7, respectively). Conclusion: At a mean of 6 month of age, gender, falling asleep and sleep habits, and feeding habits during the night, are significantly related to awakenings from sleep.

N2  - Introduction Morbid obesity is now achieving epidemic proportions throughout the world, and consequently a larger number of female patients in the reproductive age group are seeking bariatric surgery. The association of obesity with infertility and PCOS has been well established. While the role of bariatric surgery in controlling or even completely resolving obesity related co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, etc has been well established, the effect of weight loss through bariatric surgery on fertility and childbirth outcomes has not yet been fully demonstrated. Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of data from 217 patients of morbid obesity operated by a single bariatric team from 2007 to 2011, revealed 64 female patients under the age of 45. of these, 28 patients had documented PCOS as per Rotterdam Criteria, with 12 of them having previously taken infertility treatment. Results All patients showed improvements in one or more of the assessed parameters for PCOS - oligo or anovulation, hirsutism, acne, free testosterone levels and fasting insulin levels. 5 patients in the PCOS group conceived after surgery. Discussion Bariatric surgery is not so much a treatment aimed at achieving weight loss as it is a treatment for metabolic disturbance. There is clear evidence of improved outcomes in fertility and reduced risk of pregnancy related complications after bariatric surgery and weight loss. We suggest that there is a case for considering bariatric surgery for treatment of morbidly obese patients with PCOS.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the relationship of anxiety and quality of life and sleep variables to recurrent miscarriages (RMs) in patients during two stages of their treatment in an RM-dedicated clinic - before and after the evaluation and determine what factors could aggravate anxiety and worsen global well-being outcomes. Study design: Thirty-nine women who had experienced two or more RMs were measured before and after their evaluation and investigation in the RM clinic. A battery of questionnaires including the STAI scale and various instruments were administered to record anxiety, mental, and physical components of quality of life and sleep quality. Several statistical tests including canonical correlation were performed. Results: All the patients revealed a mild to moderate level of anxiety, low numbers of physical and mental health but reasonably normal values of the global quality of sleep. The evaluation in the RM clinic and investigation for possible causes accounting for RM did not significantly change anxiety levels. The children-to-pregnancies ratio introduced into the analysis proved to correlate significantly with the sleep quality and mental health. Summarized anxiety in a given RM woman could be predicted based on the set of the variables, characterizing the woman's reproductive status and her psychological health. Conclusions: This study establishes anxiety as a common response in RM patients, and suggests factors that predict it. Knowing these factors may help clinicians to identify more accurately those RM patients who would be prone to a high level of anxiety and therefore need more attention and reassurance. © by Walter de Gruyter.

N2  - Background Cannabinoid are involved in Huntington's disease (HD) and cannabinoid stimulation improves the deficits in models of HD, suggesting promising effects in HD. Methods We conducted a double blind, cross over, placebocontrolled, phase II trial of SATIVEX∗ (a combination of plant extracts enriched in D9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) in patients with HD. SATIVEX and placebo were dispensed as an oral spray, up to 12 sprays/day. The primary end point was safety, evaluated as (a) absence of severe adverse events and (b) no greater deterioration of motor, cognitive, behavioural and functional UHDRS scales during the phase of active treatment. Secondary end points included the levels of neurotrophic factors, citokines, pro-and antiapoptotic proteins in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, the proteasome function, autophagy and resistance to neurotoxins in patients' fibroblasts. Results 26 patients were screened and 25 randomised. One patient withdrew the consent due to lack of improvement. 24 patients completed the trial. No serious adverse events were considered related to the medication. One patient developed anaemia related to gastrointestinal bleeding and got pregnant after completing the active treatment. Another patient had asymptomatic spinal fluid leucocytosis. The majority of the subjects reached the maximal recommended daily dose with good tolerance. Although still blinded, 19 patients had a differential score of more than 4 points in the Motor-UHDRS scale during the two trial phases. The sleep quality and anxiety improved in most patients in one phase of the trial. We obtained hundreds of aliquots of blood, lymphocytes, cerebrospinal fluid and fibroblasts for biomarker analysis. Conclusions The treatment with Sativex is safe for patients with HD and appears to have beneficial effects on patients symptoms. The significancy of these effects and the effects on biomarkers will be studied in the next months.

N2  - Purpose: To research the atypical for child benign partial epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (Rolandic epilepsy) and to define the treating tactics. Method: A clinical case of child benign partial epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes at the girl. Result: The child is from second pregnancy, which occurred with CMV, HSV in early period. The neonatal period - restless sleep and regurgitation. The first seizures occurred at 1 year and 10 months, the second episode - was after the affective-respiratory paroxysm; the third - was triggered by negative emotions. Seizures proceeded by an aura - an abdominal pain and depressed mood. Later they were joined by the partial attacks - “the numb” or the weakness in the left half of the face, left hand, also the speech disorder during the attack, finished with the subsequent generalization. Neuropsychological development was not affected. EEG (at the 2 years old) - benign epileptiform patterns of childhood in the right temporal region. MRI of the brain - no significant changes. She was appointed to the drug valproic acid, which is replaced by topiromat, because of the lack of effect. In the dynamics the attacks were held, became more frequent. The EEG pattern was persisted, which was corresponded to rolandic epilepsy. After correction therapy (sul'tiam 5mg/kg) convulsions were managed. Catamnesis has demonstrated control of seizures and improvement of health during 4 years. Conclusion: The presented clinical case shows an atypical variant of Rolandic epilepsy: early age of onset, debut with affective seizures, generalized seizures, abdominal sensory aura, necessity to use the classic antiepileptic drugs.

N2  - Introduction. Methylxanthines and doxapram have been widely used for the treatment of apneas of prematurity and are known for their effect on the central nervous system. While there are data available concerning the use of caffeinecitrate even proposing a positive effect on neurodevelopmental outcome, there are data which suggest a negative effect of doxapram on longterm neurodevelopmental outcome. Nevertheless concerning the effect of both medications on brain activity of very preterm infants, only scarce data are available until now. Aim. The aim of this study was the assessment of the effect of caffeine and doxapram on brain activity of preterm infants <30 weeks of gestation. Methods. Brain activity was measured by amplitude-integrated EEG. The percentage of different background patterns, the occurrence and duration of sleep-wake-cycling and seizure activity was assessed and analysed. Neurodevelopmental outcome will be assessed at one and two years of corrected age by assessment of Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. Two groups (1: caffeinecitrate; 2: caffeinecitrate + doxapram) were analysed. Results. Only presented for group 2 (see . Tab. 1). Conclusion. Doxapram therapy lead to significantly more continuous pattern as well as to more seizure activity. Regarding to caffeine given alone, no significant difference, but also a tendency to a higher percentage of continuous patterns could be observed.

N2  - Background: Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a highly malaria endemic country in the South-West Pacific with a population of approximately 6.6 million (2009). In 2004, the country intensified its malaria control activities with support from the Global Fund. With the aim of achieving 80% ownership and usage, a country-wide campaign distributed two million free long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). Methods: In order to evaluate outcomes of the campaign against programme targets, a country-wide household survey based on stratified multi-stage random sampling was carried out in 17 of the 20 provinces after the campaign in 2008/09. In addition, a before-after assessment was carried out in six purposively selected sentinel sites. A structured questionnaire was administered to the heads of sampled households to elicit net ownership and usage information. Results: After the campaign, 64.6% of households owned a LLIN, 80.1% any type of mosquito net. Overall usage by household members amounted to 32.5% for LLINs and 44.3% for nets in general. Amongst children under five years, 39.5% used a LLIN and 51.8% any type of net, whereas 41.3% of pregnant women used a LLIN and 56.1% any net. Accessibility of villages was the key determinant of net ownership, while usage was mainly determined by ownership. Most (99.5%) of the household members who did not sleep under a net did not have access to a (unused) net in their household. In the sentinel sites, LLIN ownership increased from 9.4% to 88.7%, ownership of any net from 52.7% to 94.1%. Usage of LLINs increased from 5.5% to 55.1%, usage of any net from 37.3% to 66.7%. Among children under five years, usage of LLINs and of nets in general increased from 8.2% to 67.0% and from 44.6% to 76.1%, respectively (all p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: While a single round of free distribution of LLINs significantly increased net ownership, an insufficient number of nets coupled with a heterogeneous distribution led to overall low usage rates. Programme targets were missed mainly as a result of the distribution mechanism itself and operational constraints in this very challenging setting. © 2012 Hetzel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - A recent meta-analysis reported the most important and potentially modifiable risk factors for stillbirth [1]. Approximately half of these risk factors are likely influenced by maternal sleep disruption. Poor sleep occurs for many reasons although the most common sleep problems include: • sleep restriction (short sleep duration), which is often self-imposed because of busy lifestyles; • sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a term which describes a spectrum of breathing problems during sleep from habitual snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, resulting in oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation; and • poor sleep quality. Emerging literature now suggests that sleep disruption during pregnancy is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes for both mother and infant [2]. There are emerging associations between maternal sleep and several major risk factors for stillbirth: maternal obesity, gestational hypertension/ pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). In recent years, sleep duration has drastically fallen and has been paralleled by a rise in the prevalence of obesity. Chronic sleep restriction (such as self-imposed short sleep duration) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of overweight and obesity via the modulation of neuroendocrine function. Sleep disruption, including short sleep duration and sleep fragmentation, has emerged as a major determinant of metabolic health, independently of weight and is implicated in poor glucose control [3] and possibly gestational diabetes. Of note, approximately half of all Western women of childbearing age are overweight or obese and obesity can lead to increased risk for sleep disorders such as SDB. Habitual snoring is the main symptom of SDB and its frequency reaches a peak in the third trimester, affecting approximately one third of pregnant women in general, and the majority of those with preeclampsia. Habitual snoring is independently associated with gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia [4]. Although the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not completely understood, the biological pathways include endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The pathogenic process likely originates in the placenta during early pregnancy with abnormal implantation and vasculature development. This leads to oxidative stress and inflammation with subsequent release of anti-angiogenic factors and widespread endothelial dysfunction. Sleep disruption, including poor sleep quality, in early pregnancy has been suggested to adversely impact implantation [5] which has the potential to accelerate the cascade of inflammation and oxidative stress described above. Notably, the mechanisms of sleep disruption that affect cardiovascular morbidity are remarkably similar to the biological pathways for pre-eclampsia. Poor sleep quality during pregnancy is already evident in the first trimester and has been associated with increased risk for longer labors and Caesarean section delivery [6], as well as preterm delivery [5], likely via its impact on neuroendocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways. In women with SDB, case reports have shown that maternal obstructive apneas are associated with fetal heart rate decelerations, perhaps due to uteroplacental hypoperfusion, a mechanism implicated in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In summary, maternal sleep disruption is emerging as a significant factor in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Future research should consider maternal sleep when investigating stillbirth.

N2  - Stillbirth research is hindered by a lack of a uniform definition and a lack of an internationally agreed protocol for the investigation of a death. However, the major issue is that not all stillbirths have an autopsy [1], and many are not investigated at all. Mortality reviews (case series) are descriptive and hypothesis generating. In New Zealand the Perinatal and Maternal Mortality Review Committee reviews all deaths from 20 weeks gestation to 28 completed days after birth, or weighing at least 400g if gestation is unknown [2]. In 2009 the stillbirth rate was 6.3/1000 births. 25% were unexplained, and half of these occurred at term. 22% were not investigated. Maori and Pacific mothers were at higher risk and rates were increased in the most deprived socioeconomic quintile. Teenage mothers and those 40+ years were also at higher risk. Maternal obesity, multiple pregnancy and maternal medical conditions were also associated with risk of stillbirth. Only 15% of stillbirths were potentially avoidable. Although much can be learnt from examining national mortality databases, these do not allow examination of risk factors which are operating close to the demise of the fetus. Case control studies are an efficient way to examine such risk factors. A small number of studies have been completed [3,4] or are still collecting data. The Auckland Stillbirth Study, a three year case-control study, had a particular focus on modifiable risk factors, including that related to maternal sleep [3]. We found an increased risk of stillbirth with non-left sleep position, regular sleep during day-time, more than 8 hours of night-time sleep and getting up to the toilet once or less per night [5]. The prevalence of non left sided sleep position in this study was 57.3% and the population attributable risk for non-left sided sleep position was 37%. Therefore, if there is a causative pathway between maternal sleep position and late stillbirth, over a third of late stillbirths (in high income countries) could be attributable to maternal sleep position. Further studies need to be conducted as soon as possible to determine whether this finding is reproducible and if confirmed, it would then be appropriate to instigate public health campaigns to encourage women to go to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy. Research is needed to show how best to implement the findings. One testable hypothesis is that sleeping on the left side of the bed encourages mothers to sleep on their left side. A survey in Auckland is currently underway to examine this. Furthermore, physiological studies of the pregnant mother and the fetus are required, such as examining the effect of maternal body position on cardiac output, uterine blood flow and on fetal wellbeing. There needs to be sleep studies of normal pregnant mothers in late pregnancy as well as longitudinal studies over the last trimester and possibly beginning at 20 weeks gestation. (Figure presented) .

N2  - Obesity is an established risk factor for stillbirth, however the reason for this is not known. There are several possible mechanisms which have not previously been investigated, such as maternal and fetal hypoxia from adverse maternal sleep position or sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We hypothesised: 1. that obesity is an independent risk factor for stillbirth, 2. that after adjustment for established risk factors for stillbirth, the higher rates in Maori and Pacific Island babies are no different to that of European babies, and 3. that sleep disordered breathing is a risk factor for stillbirth, and that this (at least in part) explains the increased risk with obesity. The Auckland stillbirth study was a case control study conducted in Auckland, New Zealand between 2006 and 2009 [1]. In this study, we explored potentially modifiable risk factors for late stillbirth, including maternal position on going to sleep [2]. We found that maternal non-left position on going to sleep (on the last night prior to stillbirth, or prior to interview) was associated with a two fold increase in late stillbirth adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2 to 3.3) [2]. The greatest effect was when the mother went to sleep on her back (aOR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.0 to 6.2) and intermediate when on the right (aOR 1.7 95% CI: 1.0 to 3.0). These findings remained significant after adjustment for known confounders such as maternal body mass index, age and smoking. Although we could not establish an association between SDB (measured using self reported snoring and daytime sleepiness) and risk of stillbirth, these symptoms are common in pregnancy and may not identify true SDB. This is the first time that an association between maternal sleeping position and risk of late stillbirth has been described and therefore the finding should be interpreted with some caution until further studies have confirmed or refuted it. There is, however, some evidence that may support the biological plausibility of such an association, as maternal body position has been found to impact on maternal and fetal physiological parameters. Specifically it has been shown that maternal cardiac output in late pregnancy is greatest in the left lateral position, intermediate in the right lateral position and lowest when the mother is supine [3]. Similar graded effects have been found between fetal oxygenation in labour and maternal position, with optimum oxygen levels recorded with the mother on her left side [4]. This is speculated to be due to the anatomy of the lower abdomen and the potential compression of the aorta and inferior vena cava caused by the weight of the uterus and growing fetus when the woman is in either the supine position or in the right lateral position. The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their left side was 1.96/1000 and was 3.93/1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their left. This study identified a potentially modifiable risk factor for stillbirth, but confirmatory studies are needed before public health recommendations can be made.

N2  - The Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network recently reported on the probable or possible cause of death of 512 stillbirths whose mothers consented to complete postmortem examination [1]. Umbilical cord accidents (UCA) represented 10% of stillbirths [1]. In Caucasians the UCA associated stillbirth rate was 13% and 4% in non-Hispanic black. 9% of stillbirths were due to hypertension and 8% due to other maternal medical disorders. A literature review places the UCA associated stillbirth rate at 15% [2]. These data bases do not include stillbirth due to several UCA pathologies such as: torsion, multiple cord entanglement and abnormal placental cord insertion. The main reason for these absences is the belief by some that these abnormalities do not cause actual death or recurrent stillbirth. One of the first published accounts of an UCA in western medical writings was by William Smellie his Treatise on Midwifery in 1750, London, England: a nuchal cord associated stillbirth. One of the first published drawings of an UCA was by Andrew Bell in the Encyclopedia Britanica 1st edition 1769 Edinburgh, Scotland, depicting a fetal death with a combination of one nuchal cord, a body loop and a true knot (currently on the cover of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (UK) brochure). As UCA is a significant cause of death, JC argues it is now time for the focus to be on screening for UCA, managing UCA prenatally and delivery of the baby in distress defined by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as a heart rate of 90 beats per minute for 1 minute on a recorded non-stress test. The ability of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize UCA is well documented. The 18-20 week ultrasound review should include the umbilical cord, its characteristics and description of its placental and fetal attachment. The American Association of Ultrasound Technologists has defined these parameters for umbilical cord abnormalities: • Abnormal insertion • Vasa previa • Abnormal composition • Cysts, hematomas and masses • Umbilical cord thrombosis • Coiling, collapse, knotting and prolapse Umbilical cord evaluation with sonography includes the appearance, composition, location and size of the cord [3]. A normal cord has a single vein and 2 arteries that have a twisted, rope-like appearance. Absence of twisting often is associated with a decrease in fetal movement and a poor pregnancy prognosis. Umbilical cord pathology is separate from placental pathology [4]. Developmentally the umbilical cord is fetal in origin not placental [5]. The umbilical cord originates from the “primitive ridge” of the embryo. There are paternal genetic elements influencing growth and development. To date there have been no reports of mosaicism in the human umbilical cord. The Human Genome Project has not reviewed cord genetics. There are eight different umbilical cord designs. None of these issues have been incorporated into a detailed prospective study of pregnancy and outcomes. Our current knowledge of the human umbilical cord and its influence on the fetus is limited. Interactions between the fetus and umbilical cord are becoming apparent due to studies of fetal behavior. Hyperactivity is a fetal response associated with umbilical cord compression risk factors [6]. This fetal behavior may be related to intrauterine umbilical blood flow disturbance which stimulate the fetus to react reflexively and excessively. Animal studies (in rats and sheep) have reproduced forms of hyperactivity with cord compression. Hyperactivity may be a prenatal behavior capable of repositioning the fetus and relieving the compression. In the rat model, umbilical cord compression triggered lateral trunk curls, head tosses and foreleg extensions. In the sheep model intermittent umbilical cord compression triggered fetal hiccups. Hiccups occurring daily after 28 weeks, and greater than 4 times per day requires fetal evaluation. UCA should be looked for no matter how trivial it seems on ultrasound. Fetal body movements have been studied with ultrasound over 24 hour periods [7]. These movements are unique between midnight and 6 a.m. Time of fetal behavioral observation (bedtime and midnight to 6 a.m.) may need to be included in any future stillbirth study. Fetal jerking movements and fetal hiccups may also be related to fetal blood flow disturbances especially cord compression. These maternal observations should be taken seriously and prompt an ultrasound review of the fetus looking for UCA. Recent research into circadian rhythms may help explain why UCA stillbirth is an event between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. Melatonin has been described as stimulating uterine contractions through the M2 receptor [8]. Melatonin secretion from the pineal gland begins around 10 p.m. and peaks to 60 pg at 3 a.m. Serum levels decline to below 10 pg by 6 a.m. Uterine stimulation intensifies and may be overwhelming to a compromised fetus, especially one experiencing intermittent umbilical cord compression due to UCA. Pregnancy Institute has documented over 1000 UCA stillbirths through patient interview that occurred during maternal sleep. UCA are an important cause of stillbirth. It is now possible to identify UCA on ultrasound and test for the compromised fetus. As with gestational hypertension, screening for UCA is needed to possibly avoid thousands of stillbirths worldwide. If UCA is detected, the mother should be hospitalized and evaluated with ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring for at least 24 hours. If fetal behavior or the fetal heart rate is abnormal, the observation period should be extended and if necessary deliver the baby.

N2  - It is estimated that over 3.6 million babies are stillborn each year [1]. Although the majority of these occur in low-income countries, stillbirth continues to place a significant burden on maternity services in highincome settings where approximately 1 in 200 infants born after 24 weeks gestation is stillborn [1]. Despite advances in ultrasound detection of lethal fetal anomalies and widespread access to antenatal care, the stillbirth rate in many high-income countries has not decreased in over two decades. Stillbirth remains an enigma, in part due to lack of research investigation, but also due to a failure to accurately identify causes and understand how they lead to stillbirth. Recent meta-analyses resulting from international collaborations have highlighted the need to expand the understanding of stillbirth. To this end, a meeting, the Stillbirth Summit, presented by the Star Legacy Foundation and supported by various organizations, was held in October 2011, Minneapolis, MN (USA) to discuss emerging ideas in the field of stillbirth research and management. In particular the focus was on the placenta, cord, infection and inflammation, reduced fetal movements and maternal sleep. Attendees were invited researchers, stillbirth advocates and parents. The aim of this supplement is to briefly summarise the scientific aspects of the meeting.

N2  - Study Objective: The Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are commonly used to screen for sleep apnea in non-pregnant populations. We sought to evaluate the Berlin and ESS in pregnancy and to determine whether an alternative screening approach could better detect sleep apnea in pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women at high risk for sleep apnea (women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) completed a sleep survey composed of the Berlin and ESS, and participated in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch- PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted device designed to diagnose sleep apnea, defined as an apnea hypopnea index ≥ 5. Using multivariable statistics, demographic, clinical, and subjective symptoms that were independently associated with sleep apnea were determined and a prediction rule for the presence of sleep apnea was developed. The predictive capacity of this newly developed system was compared to that of the Berlin and ESS using receiver-operating curve (ROC) statistics. Results: Of the 114 women who participated and had a valid WP100 study, 100 completed the Berlin and 96 the ESS. The Berlin and ESS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this high-risk pregnancy cohort, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.54 (p = 0.6) and 0.57 (p = 0.3), respectively. Conversely, a model incorporating frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, age, and body mass index performed significantly better (AUC 0.86, p > 0.001). Conclusion: The Berlin and ESS are not appropriate tools to screen for sleep apnea in high-risk pregnant women. Conversely, our four-variable model more accurately predicts sleep apnea in pregnancy.

N2  - Thalidomide and its one analogue, lenalidomide (CC5103 or revlimid) are recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by an overproduction of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. The journey of thalidomide was started in 1956 when it was marketed as a non-barbiturate sedative agent. It was considered as a "wonder drug" that provided safe and sound sleep and hence, used to cure morning sickness in pregnant women. Later, in 1961, it was withdrawn from the world market due to its serious side effects, i.e., teratogenic activity. However, the recent decade has witnessed a true renaissance in interest in its broad biological activity. In particular, thalidomide was reevaluated and attracted significant attention due to its selective inhibitory activity of tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α), which is a clinically important activity against serious diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, leprosy, AIDS, and various cancers. The comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Recently, the drug has got FDA approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the last few years, number of thalidomide analogues have been synthesized and are in clinical development as a class of immunomodulatory drugs. Among these, lenalidomide is more potent than thalidomide, and is also non-neurotoxic. It was shown in vitro studies to induce apoptosis or arrest growth even in resistant multiple myeloma cell lines, decrease binding of the cells to bone marrow stromal cells, and stimulate host natural killer cell immunity. It also inhibits tumour growth and decreases angiogenesis. Earlier reviews have described the pharmacological aspects of thalidomide and a review has focused only on synthetic aspect of thalidomide. However, review focusing on chemistry and metabolism and mechanism of biological activity is still lacking. In this review, we will concisely describe the therapeutic aspects, metabolism and synthesis of thalidomide. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Surprisingly, in our modern 24/7 society, there is scant information on the impact of developmental chronodisruption like the one experienced by shift worker pregnant women on fetal and postnatal physiology. There are important differences between the maternal and fetal circadian systems; for instance, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master clock in the mother but not in the fetus. Despite this, several tissues/organs display circadian oscillations in the fetus. Our hypothesis is that the maternal plasma melatonin rhythm drives the fetal circadian system, which in turn relies this information to other fetal tissues through corticosterone rhythmic signaling. The present data show that suppression of the maternal plasma melatonin circadian rhythm, secondary to exposure of pregnant rats to constant light along the second half of gestation, had several effects on fetal development. First, it induced intrauterine growth retardation. Second, in the fetal adrenal in vivo it markedly affected the mRNA expression level of clock genes and clock-controlled genes as well as it lowered the content and precluded the rhythm of corticosterone. Third, an altered in vitro fetal adrenal response to ACTH of both, corticosterone production and relative expression of clock genes and steroidogenic genes was observed. All these changes were reversed when the mother received a daily dose of melatonin during the subjective night; supporting a role of melatonin on overall fetal development and pointing to it as a 'time giver' for the fetal adrenal gland. Thus, the present results collectively support that the maternal circadian rhythm of melatonin is a key signal for the generation and/or synchronization of the circadian rhythms in the fetal adrenal gland. In turn, low levels and lack of a circadian rhythm of fetal corticosterone may be responsible of fetal growth restriction; potentially inducing long term effects in the offspring, possibility that warrants further research. © 2012 Mendez et al.

N2  - Background: Obstetrical interventions, including caesarean sections, are increasing in Canada. Canadian women's psychological states, fatigue, and sleep have not been examined prospectively for contributions to obstetric interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes.Context and purpose of the study: The prospective study was conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada with 650 low-risk pregnant women. Of those women, 624 were included in this study. Women were recruited through providers' offices, media, posters, and pregnancy fairs. We examined associations between pregnant women's fatigue, sleep deprivation, and psychological states (anxiety and childbirth fear) and women's exposure to obstetrical interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes (preterm, admission to NICU, low APGARS, and low birth weight).Methods: Data from our cross-sectional survey were linked, using women's personal health numbers, to birth outcomes from the Perinatal Services BC database. After stratifying for parity, we used Pearson's Chi-square to examine associations between psychological states, fatigue, sleep deprivation and maternal characteristics. We used hierarchical logistic regression modeling to test 9 hypotheses comparing women with high and low childbirth fear and anxiety on likelihood of having epidural anaesthetic, a caesarean section (stratified for parity), assisted vaginal delivery, and adverse neonatal outcomes and women with and without sleep deprivation and high levels of fatigue on likelihood of giving birth by caesarean section, while controlling for maternal, obstetrical (e.g., infant macrosomia), and psychological variables.Results: Significantly higher proportions of multiparas, reporting difficult and upsetting labours and births, expectations of childbirth interventions, and health stressors, reported high levels of childbirth fear. Women who reported antenatal relationship, housing, financial, and health stressors and multiparas reporting low family incomes were significantly more likely to report high anxiety levels. The hypothesis that high childbirth fear significantly increased the risk of using epidural anaesthesia was supported.Conclusions: Controlling for some psychological states and sleep quality while examining other contributors to outcomes decreases the likelihood of linking childbirth fear anxiety, sleep deprivation, and fatigue to increased odds of caesarean section. Ameliorating women's childbirth fear to reduce their exposure to epidural anaesthesia can occur through developing effective interventions. These include helping multiparous women process previous experiences of difficult and upsetting labour and birth. © 2012 Hall et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - RATIONALE: Gestational diabetes (GDM) occurs in 2-9% of pregnancies with increased risk for adverse maternal and offspring outcomes. Questionnaire-based studies in pregnancy have pointed to links between gestational diabetes and short sleep duration, as well snoring and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. However there is little data evaluating these associations using objective sleep recordings. The aim of this case-control study was to examine the association of maternal sleep and breathing disorders with the occurrence of GDM using complete polysomnography (PSG). METHODS: Consecutive healthy pregnant women (with no co-morbidity and a BMI <35 Kg.m-2) were eligible if diagnosed with GDM by 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the same period, BMI-, age-matched controls (with normal 50g OGTT) were recruited. One night of home complete (Level II) PSG was performed in cases and controls between 24 and 32 wks of gestation. Subjective sleep quality was assessed via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which includes self-reported snoring and sleep time (RST). RESULTS: To date, the study included 23 cases and 21 controls. Subject characteristics, including mean pre-pregnancy BMI, were similar for the two groups (see Table). Recorded total sleep time (TST) by PSG and RST in the PSQI did not differ in cases versus controls. Objective (PSG) and subjective (PSQI) sleep quality measures were also similar for the 2 groups. Epworth scores tended to be higher in cases. Minimum O2 saturation was the same in both groups, while the data show a trend for desaturation index to be higher in cases compared to controls. Proportions of cases and controls with snoring ≥3 times/wk, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) values, minimal O2 saturation and TST, RST, sleep efficiency, and total PSQI scores were not significantly different between groups. Pre-pregnancy BMI was negatively correlated with RST (r=-0.3; p=0.02) but not with TST. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest that there are no significant differences in either objective or subjective measures of sleep duration or quality or sleep-disordered breathing between women with and without GDM. The trend for desaturation index to be higher in cases will need to be confirmed in a larger study sample. (Table Presented).

N2  - Rationale Prior research has shown differences between men and women patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Women have a lower overall incidence of sleep apnea appearing to benefit from hormonal effects during child-bearing years. Men have consistently higher apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) on polysomnogram (PSG). We sought to broaden our understanding of gender differences in the subjective presentation of OSA using validated questionnaires for particular symptoms among patients with a laboratory diagnosis of OSA. Methods Sequential patients diagnosed with OSA by a type-1overnight polysomnogram were asked to complete a series of validated questionnaires including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Visual Analog Scale, and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ). Demographic and polysomnographic data were also collected and analyzed by gender using 2-sample t-tests and Pearson product-moment correlations. Results Among 49 subjects, women (n=2) were somewhat older, but gender comparisons were similar for race, marital status, education (p=.41), income (p=.9) and polysomnographic variables (see Table). (Table Presented) Women more commonly complained of fatigue (18/3, 59%, p=.3) and sleepiness (14/25, 54%, p=.3). Female gender correlated moderately strongly with fatigue (Pr=.4942) and ESS (Pr=.3661). Of patients reporting both sleepiness and fatigue, the majority was women (12/19, 63%, p<.1). FOSQ questions regarding sleepiness while driving short (p=.1) and long distances (p=.46) showed no differences in response scores between men and women. Conclusion Even when controlling for differences in race, marital status, educational level, and income level, patients exhibited statistically significant gender differences in terms of age, subjective sleepiness, fatigue, and selected FOSQ scores. There were no significant gender differences in severity of OSAS by polysomnographic variables (PSG AHI and minutes less than 9% O2 saturation). Despite a lower overall incidence of OSA in younger women, a variety of symptoms appear to be more severe in women with OSA. The increased severity of symptoms provides an opportune target for therapy of OSA in women.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN. A cross-sectional, multicenter study. OBJECTIVE. To determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnant Spanish women and to identify the factors associated with a higher risk. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors for LBP and PGP have shown inconsistent results. METHODS. Sixty-one clinicians across 5 regions in Spain recruited 1158 women with a median (interquartile range) pregnancy of 35 (range, 31-38) weeks. Validated methods were used to gather data on the prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP, anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics, history of LBP, obstetrical history, physical activity before and during pregnancy, mattress and sleep characteristics, disability, anxiety, and depression. Separate multiple logistic regression models were developed to identify the variables associated with LBP, LP, and PGP. RESULTS. The 4-week prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP was 71.3%, 46.2%, and 64.7%, respectively. Main factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting pain for LBP were history of LBP related and unrelated to previous pregnancy and postpartum, pain augmenting with time spent in bed, and anxiety. Previous lumbar surgery was associated with a lower risk. The factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting LP were reporting LBP, lower academic level, younger age, depression, a lower number of hours of sleep per day, and a higher BMI, and for PGP were higher score for depression, a higher body mass index, and a more advanced stage of pregnancy. CONCLUSION. Factors associated with a higher risk vary between LBP and PGP. History of LBP, related or not to previous pregnancy or postpartum, LBP surgery, and anxiety were the factors more strongly associated with pregnancy-related LBP. When these variables are taken into account, obstetrical data from current or previous pregnancies and other variables do not show a significant association with LBP. Stage of pregnancy and depression were associated with PGP. © 2012, Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.
