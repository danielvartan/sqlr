N2  - OBJECTIVE: Short sleep duration, a proinflammatory state, is associated with the subsequent development of gestational diabetes. We sought to evaluate the ability of biomarkers of inflammation and sleep duration to predict the subsequent onset of gestational diabetes (GDM) in a population of women who are high risk for developing GDM. STUDY DESIGN: Participants in a prospective observational cohort of obese pregnant women (BMI >30 kg/m2) underwent overnight sleep studies testing for sleep apnea using a portable [polysomnography (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA). Women completed sleep questionnaires detailing sleep duration and sleep habits. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod). Serum was collected between 10 and 19 weeks', stored at -70C, and analyzed in duplicate for levels of IL-6r, TNFalpha, hsCRP, galectin-3 and sICAM. Short sleep duration was defined as <6 hours of total sleep per night. Women underwent routine prenatal care with 2 step screening for gestational diabetes. Data were analyzed using chi square, student T and Mann Whitney U tests; p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Among the 182 participants, 39% had short sleep duration and 13.2% had gestational diabetes. Women with GDM when compared to women without GDM, were similar in age (26±5 vs 26±4 years, p=.6), BMI (40±10 vs, 42±7 kg/m2, p=.7), body fat (43±6 vs 45±6%, p=.47) and gestational weight gain (8.6±8.1 vs 9.6±6.8 lbs, p=.45). Serum CRP was higher among women with GDM but the levels of TNF alpha, IL-6sr, sICAM and galectin-3 were similar. Among all the biomarkers, CRP was the only biomarker predictive of GDM (OR 2.1[1.2-3.5]). CRP was a fair predictor of gestational diabetes (AUC=.72) and was not improved by adding any of the other biomarkers of inflammation. CONCLUSION: In a high risk population, hsCRP and not sleep duration was a predictor of GDM. Further studies can elucidate its role in the early detection of GDM. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background: Physiological changes during pregnancy make both a woman and her fetus more vulnerable, often compounding psychosocial risks like depression, problematic sleep, and intimate partner violence. However, to implement interventions, these risks must be accurately detected. Standard psychosocial measures provide well-understood data by putting risks into generally understood terms, but new information emerges when people express concerns using the words most meaningful to them. Prior natural language processing work in health has focused on automated detection of issues. We seek results applicable to clinical practice, where language tone and emphasis or avoidance of conversational topics could give a clinician additional cues about a patient's level of risk. Methods: We present a survey with open-ended and multiple choice questions, created to test potential 'proxy' items for risks otherwise requiring more burdensome measures. Respondents took validated measures for depression, sleep quality, and emotional and physical intimate partner violence. Analysis used two natural language processing tools, topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to extract content and tone from written responses. We tested all feature subsets to model best fit between text features and proxy psychometrics against scores on those measures. Collecting this data from a baseline population of partnered, non-pregnant women of childbearing age laid groundwork for ultimately testing a combination measure with pregnant women. Results: The best fitting models for all measures examined used both proxy multiple-choice responses and topic models, and the two for abusive relationships also used sentiment findings. Correlation coefficients of the best feature sets with measured risks were 0.63 for depression, 0.61 for disrupted sleep, 0.38 for emotional abuse, and 0.36 for recent physical or sexual abuse. Linguistic features from topics and sentiment explained 6%-16% of the data's variance, depending on the modeled risk, and added information that had not been captured by short psychometric questions. In responses collected in late December, for instance, respondents who had experienced recent partner violence were less likely to bring up holiday or vacation plans. Conclusions: Pairing psychometric measures with natural language processing may improve detection, allowing clinicians to inform their risk assess-ments with conversational questions alongside short psychometric items. Of multiple-choice questions, asking whether a person had had recent relationship conflict was particularly versatile, positively correlating with every risk that was measured. Recent intimate partner violence proved very difficult to predict based on the features tested- only 7% of variance was explained by the multiple-choice questions- and yet topics raised this statistic to 13%, its highest influence on any of the measures. Future work will expand language processing tools to find information that is not captured by psychometric questions.

N2  - Purpose: The Sleep Apnea Symptom Score (SASS) has been commonly used to assess obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the SASS and the predictive value of SASS incorporating bedpartner-reported information in identifying OSA in pregnant women. Methods: A cohort of healthy pregnant women completed the SASS and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Participants underwent overnight laboratory polysomnography (PSG) monitoring. Reliability and validity of the SASS were evaluated. A multivariable predictive model, incorporating the SASS score along with BMI, age, and bedpartner-reported information, was developed to assess the risk for OSA (AHI ≥ 5 events/h). Receiver operating characteristic curves for OSA were constructed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model. Results: A total of 126 and 105 participants completed the PSG during the first and third trimester, respectively. The SASS demonstrated adequate validity and acceptable reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.72 during the third trimester). When the combined model consisting of SASS, age, BMI, and bedpartner-reported information was used, the area under the curve for AHI ≥ 5 for the first and third trimester was 0.781 (95%CI 0.648, 0.914) and 0.842 (95%CI 0.732, 0.952), respectively; the sensitivity/specificity was 76.9%/72.4% and 82.4%/78.0%, respectively. Conclusions: The SASS alone has acceptable reliability and validity, but limited predictive values. A new tool, combining the SASS and other patient characteristics (i.e., age, BMI, and bedpartner-reported snoring and breathing pauses), demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity, and thus may have greater utility in clinical practice for predicting OSA in pregnant women.

N2  - Purpose: Preeclampsia–eclampsia remains one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence suggests that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which has been linked to hypertension in the general population, may play role in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, including preeclampsia–eclampsia. However, little research has been conducted in Asia (no data in Thailand) on the effects of OSA on preeclampsia–eclampsia. We aimed to examine the association between OSA and preeclampsia–eclampsia among Thai pregnant women. Methods: We conducted a large prospective cohort study among Thai pregnant women who were in the second trimester of singleton pregnancy. The Berlin Questionnaire was administered to evaluate the risk for OSA. Preeclampsia–eclampsia was diagnosed by standard clinical assessment. Multivariate models were applied in adjustment for confounding factors. Results: Enrolled were 1345 pregnant women. The overall prevalence of high risk for OSA was 10.1% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 8.5–11.7), and it was significantly associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index and score on the Perceived Stress Scale. An adjusted odds ratio (OR) for preeclampsia–eclampsia in women with high risk for OSA was 2.72 (95% CI 1.33–5.57). Conclusions: Pregnant women with high risk for OSA are at increased risks for preeclampsia–eclampsia compared to those with low risk for OSA. Our results support a role for screening for OSA by BQ during antenatal care.

N2  - Introduction and objectives: Sleep disorders commonly occur in pregnancy and during post-partum. The aim of our study is to investigate the physiopathology of these disturbances and their putative role in the psychopathology of pregnant and puerperal women, in particular analysing their relationship with mood disorders. Methods: Trough a revision of relevant literature, we reported the most significant evidence regarding the relationship between sleep disorders and psychopathology in pregnancy and post-partum. Results: Pregnancy modifies sleeping both qualitatively and quantitatively. Sleep disorders are evolutionary, frequently reported during perinatal period and associated with the hormones variations of pregnancy. Pregnant women complained of a low sleep quality. Endocrine origin was the most frequent cause in the first quarter of pregnancy. While during the third quarter, the sleep disturbance was associated to physical concerns related to the body's modification (such as: abdominal growth, gastric burns, muscle cramps, urgency urinary and polyuria. The dreams, nightmares are more frequents in pregnancy period, the mechanisms of the increase of dreams is unclear, the hormonal and physical modifications during pregnancy as well as the psychological processes of becoming a mother seem to play a role. The unpleasant dreams and nightmares increase the distress and damage the quality of sleep Impact of sleeping disorder on the mood of pregnant women varies from irritability to depression. Their relation with characterized depressive episode remains difficult to estimate. Let us note the association between a poor sleep and an arisen of a likely depression. (The bad quality of the sleep precedes the appearance of a depressive signs). The prenatal stress participates in the insomnias. Moreover, lack of sleep, in the last days of pregnancy is associated with a longer work, one felt painful increased, and a difficult delivery. A spontaneous release of the premature work was also noticed. Finally it can favour the rise of one intense baby blues this a risk factor of evolution towards a maternal depression. Sleeping repair during post-partum is difficult because of the rough hormonal modifications, baby blues, the feeding and the rhythm of the baby. The quantitative lack sleep is accompanied with tiredness, diurnal slumber, and difficulties to concentrate, what increases the painful real-life experience of its disturbances. Unfortunately the exploration of sleeping disorders is difficult and the realization of randomized studies turns out to be challenging. The coverage of sleeping disorders during the pregnancy remains complex and difficult. The etiological factors of these disturbances are multiple, which limits the efficiency of the therapeutic answer besides the difficulties to the medicinal prescription. A premature intervention allows to warn the psychiatric complications at the mother and to protect the interactions mother-baby. Conclusion: Sleeping disorders are underestimated in the follow-up of pregnant women, they must be looked for and taken care of when they are invalidating to warn the arisen of the disorders of the mood and their consequences on the link between mother-child.
U1  - Introduction: Les troubles du sommeil sont présents pendant la grossesse et pendant le post-partum. L'objectif de notre travail est de comprendre la physiopathologie de ces troubles et leurs rôles dans la psychopathologie de la femme enceinte et de prévoir le risque de survenue de troubles psychiatriques. Méthode: Nous avons réalisé une revue de la littérature sur les troubles du sommeil en période périnatale. Nous avons retenu les articles qui font le lien entre le sommeil et la psychopathologie pendant cette période. Résultats: La grossesse affecte le sommeil sur le plan qualitatif et quantitatif. Les perturbations du sommeil sont évolutives et sujettes aux variations physiologiques propres à la grossesse, si bien qu'elles deviennent plus accentuées. Les répercussions sur l'humeur sont variables, elles peuvent aller de l'irritabilité à l’épisode dépressif caractérisé. Le retour à un sommeil réparateur après l'accouchement est difficile, favorisant les décompensations psychiatriques précoces du post-partum. Les facteurs étiologiques de ces perturbations sont multiples, ce qui limite l'efficacité de la réponse thérapeutique en plus des difficultés à la prescription médicamenteuse. Conclusion: Les troubles du sommeil sont sous-estimés chez la femme enceinte; ils doivent être recherchés et traités lorsqu'ils sont invalidants afin de prévenir la survenue des troubles de l'humeur et leurs conséquences sur le lien mère enfant.

N2  - From the age of menarche through menopause, women report insufficient sleep and insomnia more frequently than men of similar ages. The physiological and hormonal changes that occur during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause all influence women's sleep architecture and sleep quality. The prevalence of some sleep disorders, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, and restless legs syndrome are all higher in women compared with men. The prevalence of other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea and some parasomnias, increase in women during specific stages of life. At the same time, there are a few data suggesting that many sleep disorders remain underdiagnosed and possibly undertreated in women. Women who are menstruating, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal all report better sleep quality compared with pregnant and postpartum women. Additional factors that women commonly encounter across the stages of their lives, such as childcare responsibilities, the work-life balance, the caregiver role for the elderly, and stress, can also impact women's sleep quality and daytime functioning. In this review, we discuss the following: (1) sleep in women during the menstrual cycle; (2) sleep in women during pregnancy and the postpartum stage; and (3) sleep during the menopausal stage, followed by a brief discussion of the postmenopausal stage. Our aims are to promote an understanding of changes in sleep across the stages of a woman's life, encourage early detection, and advocate for gender-specific treatment strategies and future research.

N2  - Aim. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Materials and Method. 44 patients with OSAS and 44 healthy adults were included in this study. The participants having rheumatic or systemic inflammatory disease, advanced liver or kidney failure, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, pregnancy, prerenal azotemia, known history of coronary artery disease, any pulmonary disease, rhinitis, or atopy, history of major trauma or surgery within the last six 6 months, and inhaled nasal or systemic corticosteroid use or other anti-inflammatory medications and those with <18 years of age were excluded. Serum PAPP-A levels were determined by the Elisa method with the immune sandwich measuring method. Statistical analysis of the study was performed with SPSS 17.0 statistical analysis package program, and p<0.05 was considered as significant. Results. Serum PAPP-A levels of patients with OSAS (2.350 ng/ml (0.641-4.796)) were significantly higher (p<0.001) when compared with healthy controls (0.971 ng/ml (0.109-2.679)). There was a statistically significant difference in serum PAPP-A levels between groups of OSAS patients according to the classification of OSAS severity. Between the groups of patients with OSAS, serum levels of PAPP-A in moderate group was significantly higher when compared with severe OSAS group (p<0.001). There was positive correlations between PAPP-A levels and night minimum (p=0.042, r=0.309), and average oxygen levels (p=0.006, r=0.407). There was a negative correlation between PAPP-A levels and AHI (p=0.002, r=-0.460). Conclusion. Higher PAPP-A levels in OSAS patients that were found in this study show inflammatory component in OSAS.

N2  - Pregnant women and their fetuses represent susceptible populations to environmental contaminants. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among pregnant women may contribute to adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth. Multiple previous studies have assessed airborne sources of PAHs among pregnant women but few have measured urinary PAH metabolites which can capture total exposure through multiple routes. The aim of this study was to bridge this knowledge gap by assessing longitudinal urinary PAH metabolite concentrations over two time points in pregnancy cohorts in Boston (N = 200) and Puerto Rico (N = 50) to better understand exposure distributions throughout pregnancy and how they relate to demographic factors. Urine samples were analyzed for 1-NAP, 2-NAP, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 2,3-PHE, 4-PHE, 9-PHE, and 1-PYR. Concentrations of 2-NAP, 1-PYR, and 4-PHE were higher in Puerto Rico, while all other metabolites were present in higher concentrations in Boston. In Puerto Rico, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were weak to moderate, ranging from 0.06 to 0.42. PAH metabolite concentrations were significantly higher among younger, heavier (except 1-NAP and 9-PHE), and less educated individuals in Boston only. Consistent significant associations between PAH concentrations and measured covariates were not found in Puerto Rico. Our results suggest that potentially important differences in PAH exposure exist between these two populations. Additionally, our results indicate that multiple urinary measurements are required to accurately assess PAH exposure throughout pregnancy. Pregnant women in Boston and Puerto Rico are differentially exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with some biomarker levels being associated with younger age and higher BMI.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Health promoting lifestyle is any kind of action that is taken to maintain the health of the individual. Healthy lifestyle plays an important role in improving the maternal-fetal outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of training pregnant women and their husbands on health promoting lifestyle. METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted among 189 pregnant women in the city of Bukan, Iran. Participants were categorized into three groups: the recipients of the training along with their husbands (the first intervention group), the recipients of the training without their husbands (the second group of intervention) and the routine care recipients (control group). Four sessions of group training were held for mothers of both interventional groups and one group training session was held for the mothers of the first intervention group regarding sleep health, nutrition, physical activity, self-image and sexual issues. Health promoting lifestyle questionnaire (score range: 52 - 208) was completed and assessed before the intervention, eight weeks after the intervention and six weeks after delivery. FINDINGS: There was no statistically significant difference between the groups before the intervention in terms of the total score of health promoting lifestyle. Eight weeks after the intervention, the mean score of health promoting lifestyle was 162.2±2.5 in the first group, 153.6±2.5 in the second group and 133.4±2.4 in the control group, which was significantly higher in both intervention groups compared to the control group (p<0.001). Six weeks after delivery, the mean score of health promoting lifestyle was 159.8±3.0 in the first group of intervention, 143.1±3.0 in the second group and 133.7±3.0 in the control group, which was significantly higher in the first group of intervention compared to the second group of intervention (p=0.003) and control group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of the study showed that training pregnant women along with their husbands or training the women alone improves lifestyle. However, training pregnant women along with their husbands proved to be more effective than training the women alone.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the frequency and the risk factors for restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy in an Italian population rarely studied, in epidemiological studies on the syndrome. A total of 648 women (median age: 35 years; interquartile range: 32–38), who delivered on randomly selected days at the obstetric department of our hospital, were identified. One hundred and thirty-two women (20.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 17.3–23.5) met the criteria for a diagnosis of RLS. The odds ratio (OR) of RLS was, in comparison with women aged <35 years, 1.69 (95% CI 1.14–2.51) in women aged ≥35 years. Subjective insufficient sleep (OR: 2.35, 95% CI 1.27–4.35) and difficulty in initiating sleep (OR: 1.73, 95% CI 1.15–2.63) increased the risk of RLS. This study confirms the high frequency of RLS in pregnant women. The risk of the condition was increased in women aged ≥35 years and in the women reporting sleep-wake disturbances during pregnancy.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a common neurological, sensorimotor disorder, is two/three times more frequent in pregnant women than in the general population. The prevalence of RLS during pregnancy ranges widely, showing differences among populations. What do the results of this study add? This study adds data about the frequency and the risk factors for RLS during pregnancy in a Northern Italian population, rarely considered in epidemiological studies on the syndrome. Older age and sleep-wake disturbances are the main factors associated with the condition. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Screening for RLS might be useful for pregnant women to manage the condition. Further research is needed to investigate and define the potential impact of RLS during pregnancy on foetal and maternal health.

N2  - Maternal obesity induces pregnancy complications and disturbs fetal development, but the specific mechanisms underlying these outcomes are unclear. Circadian rhythms are implicated in metabolic complications associated with obesity, and maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. Accordingly, obesity-induced circadian dysfunction may drive adverse outcomes in obese pregnancy. This study investigated whether maternal obesity alters the rhythmic expression of clock genes and associated nuclear receptors across maternal, fetal, and placental tissues. Wistar rats were maintained on a cafeteria (CAF) diet prior to and throughout gestation to induce maternal obesity. Maternal and fetal liver and placental labyrinth zone (LZ) were collected at four-hourly time points across days 15-16 and 21-22 of gestation (term = 23 days). Gene expression was analyzed by RTqPCR. Expression of the accessory clock gene Nr1d1 was rhythmic in the maternal and fetal liver and LZ of chow-fed controls, but in each case CAF feeding reduced peak Nr1d1 expression. Obesity resulted in a phase advance (approx. 1.5 h) in the rhythms of several clock genes and Ppar-delta in maternal liver. Aside from Nr1d1, expression of clock genes was mostly arrhythmic in LZ and fetal liver, and was unaffected by the CAF diet. In conclusion, maternal obesity suppressed Nr1d1 expression across maternal, fetal, and placental compartments and phase-advanced the rhythms of maternal hepatic clock genes. Given the key role of Nr1d1 in regulating metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory processes, our data suggest that disruptions to rhythmic Nr1d1 expression in utero may contribute to programmed health complications in offspring of obese pregnancies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: While the etiology in many cases of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is unclear, recent evidence suggests possible immunological dysfunction, which is a common etiology for many pediatric respiratory diseases. We sought to investigate whether maternal history of RPL is associated with long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring. STUDY DESIGN: A population based cohort analysis was performed comparing the risk of long-term respiratory morbidity (up to the age of 18 years) of children born to mothers with and without a history of RPL (defined as two or more losses). Respiratory morbidity included hospitalizations involving a pre-defined set of ICD-9 codes, as recorded in the hospital medical records. Deliveries occurred between the years 1991-2014 in a tertiary medical center. Multiple pregnancies and fetal congenital malformations were excluded. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was constructed to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: During the study period, 242 187 newborns met the inclusion criteria; 5% (n=12,182) of which were offspring to mothers with a history of RPL. Respiratory morbidity was significantly more common in the exposed group (6.0% vs. 4.8%, p<0.001, Table). Specifically, offspring to mothers with a history of RPL had higher rates of obstructive sleep apnea and asthma (p value <0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve exhibited a higher cumulative incidence of total respiratory morbidity in offspring of mothers with a history of RPL (Log rank p value <0.001, Figure). In the Cox regression, maternal history of RPL was independently associated with increased pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring, while adjusting for gestational age, birthweight, maternal age, gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.34, p value <0.001). CONCLUSION: : Maternal history of recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with a higher risk of future pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring possibly explained by a common immunological etiology.

N2  - Narcolepsy type 1 is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep fragmentation, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy. Stimulant medications such as modafinil and amphetamines are the first-line medications for treating sleepiness. However, the management of narcolepsy during special circumstances of life such as pregnancy is complex. MMDM is a 34-year-old female with Narcolepsy type 1 treated with modafinil (400mg/d) and citalopram (20mg/d). Before she become pregnant, modafinil and citalopram were replaced for L-Carnitine 510mg/d with good outcome. She underwent an usual pregnancy and was submitted to a term cesarean delivery without child-birth complications. This is the first description of oral L-Carnitine such an alternative to treatment narcolepsy type 1 during pregnancy. Treat these patients is not easy but care narcolepsy pregnant is a challenging even bigger. In a disease without many treatment options, L-Carnitine can be used to treat daytime sleepiness during pregnancy in narcolepsy.

N2  - Preterm infants are babies born before completion of 37 w of gestation. Their organs are immature especially brain. Sleep has a vital role in brain development and maturation in infants. Neonatal intensive care unit is a place where infant’s comfort is disturbed by many environmental stimuli. So the sleep is disrupted. Nesting facilitates transformation of sleep pattern from erratic disturbed spells to deep peaceful nights and contented days. This study aimed to investigate the effect of nesting on sleep pattern of infants hospitalized in NICUs. This crossover clinical trial was performed at a tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). 21 preterm infants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to two groups of nest and routine procedure. Sleep status was evaluated by using neonatal sleep assessment Scale. Duration of Total Sleep Time per cycle (TST) and duration of each stage such as quiet sleep, active sleep indeterminate sleep were recorded and analysed by using paired t-test. Duration of Total Sleep Time per cycle (TST) and duration of each stage were significantly higher among preterm with nesting than usual procedure of care (p<0.001). Duration of sleep time in each stages shows, duration of active sleep is significantly reduced (34.76) with nesting as compared to routine care (39.55) although which is not significant (t=1.134, P=0.270) there is significant increase in quiet sleep (63.62 ± 17.957) with nesting than with routine care and indeterminate sleep time was increased with nesting as compared with sleep in routine care which is highly significant (t=4.570, p<0.001), (t=2.297, p=0.003) at 0.05 level of significance. The present study results supports the use of nesting aids in increase sleep and duration of quiet sleep and aids in stability of physiological parameters. Thus using nesting for preterm infant is recommended to facilitate infant’s quality of sleep in NICU.

N2  - Introduction and Aim: Oxygen plays a vital role during fetal organogenesis. The third trimester of pregnancy requires more oxygen than the 1st and 2nd trimesters. Therefore need of oxygen is of utmost importance for proper uteroplacental perfusion and the associated fetal-organomaturation. The placental trophoblast plays a crucial role in the development of the fetus. Improper trophoblast invasion due to insufficient uteroplacental perfusion is found to be one of the etiological factors of preeclampsia. Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is the primary risk factor often imparting increased spiral artery remodelling, which causes vascular hypertension and its mediated complications. Hence the management of pregnancy associated disorder with natural remedy is crucial as most of the available synthetic medicines are widely deleterious to both mother and fetus. The aim of our present study is to assess the effect of black tea incubation in placental trophoblast on the expression of vital signaling proteins and its management. Materials and Methods: Determination of signaling proteins such as 4-Hydroxynonenol(4-HNE), Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Caspase 3, Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and Placental growth factor (PLGF) in normotensive and preeclamptic placental trophoblast was executed with and without black tea perfusion. Results: Increased expression of 4-HNE, ADMA, TNF-α, Caspase 3, HSP70 along with decreased PLGF was observed in preeclamptic placental trophoblast. On black tea incubation, the expressions of signaling proteins were significantly modified in preeclamptic placental trophoblast when compared to their respective subjects. Hence it reveals that black tea may attenuate stress inducible factors and promote live fetal outcome. Conclusion: The consumption of black tea may be beneficial to the pregnant women to manage complications like hypertension including sleep deprivation.

N2  - The widely used organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is often detected in food. CPF inhibits acetylcholinesterase and can modify muscle contractility and respiratory patterns. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to CPF on respiratory parameters and diaphragm contractility in 21- and 60-days old rats. Pregnant rats were exposed to oral CPF (1 or 5 mg/ kg /day: CPF-1 or CPF-5 groups vs vehicle: controls) from gestation onset up to weaning of the pups that were individually gavaged (CPF or vehicle) thereafter. Two developmental time points were studied: weaning (day 21) and adulthood (day 60). Whole-body plethysmography was used to score breathing patterns and apnea index during sleep. Then, diaphragm strips were dissected for the assessment of contractility and acetylcholinesterase activity. Results showed that the sleep apnea index was higher in CPF-exposed rats than in controls. In adult rats, the expiratory time and tidal volume were higher in CPF-exposed animals than in controls. At both ages, the diaphragm’s amplitude of contraction and fatigability index were higher in the CPF-5 group, due to lower acetylcholinesterase activity. We conclude that chronic exposure to CPF is associated with higher sleep apnea index and diaphragm contractility, and modifies respiratory patterns in sleeping juvenile and adult rats.

N2  - Aim: To compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of labetalol and nifedipine modified release (MR) in hypertensive pregnant women. We also investigated the effect on the heart rate (HR) and determined the proportion of time spent in target. Methods: This was an exploratory study. Women with chronic hypertension taking either labetalol or nifedipine were offered 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Sleep, wake and drug ingestion times were self-reported. An indirect response model was used to analyse the systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and HR time-series; the effect of gestation and type of drug was evaluated. Results: Forty-eight women were recruited: 24 in each group. There was no difference in clinical characteristics. In women taking nifedipine there was a positive association between the dose of nifedipine and pre-dose BP p =.002, this was not present in the labetalol group. There was a difference between the drug effects on both the SBP and DBP time-series (p =.014). In comparison to labetalol, there was less variation in day time BP in those women prescribed nifedipine. Women on labetalol spent a larger proportion of time with their DBP below target (<80 mmHg). The HR dynamics were qualitatively different, a stimulatory effect was found with nifedipine compared to an inhibitory effect with labetalol. Conclusion: There are significant and important differences between the BP lowering effects of nifedipine and labetalol. A large randomised control trial is required to investigate the relationship between BP variability and time in target on pregnancy outcomes.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in pregnant women and may be characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and placental insufficiency. The incidence of maternal and neonatal outcomes such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weights, cesarean delivery and neonatal intensive care unit admission are increased in pregnant women with OSA. This study examined the effects of gestational IH on endothelial function of adult offspring. Methods: Female WT C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks) were divided in 2 groups: IH or intermittent air (IA). Mice were subjected to IH while they were asleep during the daylight cycle; IH was by delivering a hypoxic mixture (12% oxygen) with room air every 30s; IA received air instead of the hypoxic mixture. Pregnant mice were kept under IH during the gestation period (for 21 days). After giving birth, IH was halted and offspring mice were maintained under normal conditions for sixteen weeks, when the male mice were sacrificed and endothelium-dependent relaxation was measured using a wire myograph system. Results: After 1 week of delivery, pups in the IH group (2.6 ± 0.3g) weighed significantly less than the IA group (3.8 ± 0.3g, P<0.05); these differences remained significant for 4 weeks. Subsequently though, IH male pups gained weight until there were no significant differences between the groups at 8 weeks of age. However, IH pups weighed significantly more at 16 weeks (39.7 ± 3.2) compared to IA pups (32.9 ± 1.6, P<0.05). Endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly impaired at 16 weeks between the two groups (Emax IH: 69.2 ± 5.4% vs. IA: 90.8 ± 5.6%, P<0.05). Conclusion: In mice, gestational IH resulted in significantly reduced birth weights. However, offspring exposed to IH during gestation demonstrated increased weight gain, and their weight eventually surpassed those of mice exposed to IA during gestation. Gestational IH also caused endothelial dysfunction in adult offspring. These results suggest that adult children born to women with OSA could be at risk of obesity and cardiovascular complications.

N2  - Background: To assess if the effects of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on heart rate (HR) and HR variability, as a measure of autonomic control, were more severe in a group of children born preterm compared with a group of children born at term referred to our sleep laboratory for assessment of SDB. Study design: Children (3-12 years of age) referred for polysomnographic assessment of SDB were recruited; 50 born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and 50 at term, matched for age and SDB severity. The mean HR and HR variability using power spectral analysis were calculated for each child for wake and sleep, and stages N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement sleep. Results: Ex-preterm children were born between 23 and 35 weeks of gestational age (29.3 ± 3.6; mean ± SEM). There were no differences in the demographic, sleep, or respiratory characteristics between the groups. High-frequency power (reflecting parasympathetic activity) was greater in the ex-preterm children in both N2 and N3 (P <.05 for both) and total power was greater in N3 (P <.05). When the children were divided by SDB severity, these effects were most marked in those preterm born children with moderate to severe disease. Conclusions: Preterm born children matched for age and SDB severity with children born at term showed no differences in sleep characteristics; however, they did exhibit increased parasympathetic tone during non-rapid eye movement sleep.

N2  - Background: Sleep problems have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms and diagnosis. However, past research has studied the simultaneous association of sleep problems with precursor ASD symptoms. Using data from a birth cohort, we estimate prospective associations between infant sleep characteristics at 12 months and later ASD screening scores at 24 months. Methods: We obtained data from children (N = 1,096) and their mothers as participants in the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood longitudinal birth cohort study. Mothers were enrolled between 2006 and 2011, when they were 16-26 weeks pregnant. Using linear regression, we examined the influence of infant sleep characteristics (nighttime and daytime sleep, night wakings, and sleep onset latency) at 12 months on ASD screening scores at 24 months while controlling for other psychosocial characteristics. Results: The number of night wakings was the only sleep characteristic at 12 months to be significantly associated with the development of early ASD symptoms at 24 months (B = 0.097, P = .021; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.180). However, other competing risks, especially child socioemotional competence at 12 months (B = 0.573, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.361 to 0.785), showed stronger relative contributions in predicting ASD risk. Conclusions: Infants with more sleep problems by 12 months, especially those waking more often during the night, showed an increased number of early ASD symptoms a year later. This study suggests that infant sleep characteristics could constitute one clinical sign of ASD risk, together with key psychosocial characteristics.

N2  - Rationale: The management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and reduction in mortality has improved significantly with implementation of pharmacologic therapy and lifestyle modifications. The use of adaptive servo-ventilator (ASV) has been adopted since 2007 for patients with concomitant central sleep apnea (CSA). Despite improvement in surrogate markers in short term studies; a single, recent RCT (SERVE-HF trial) demonstrated an increase in mortality in patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). We have investigated our experience within the Northern California Kaiser Permanente population. Methods: Patients with an EF <45% and a diagnosis of CSA or mixed sleep apnea who were prescribed an ASV device between January 2007 and June 2013 were included with a minimum follow up time of 24 months or death. ASV devices were recalled June 2015, which serves as the endpoint for study follow-up. Patients were included with an EF<45% either prior to initiation of ASV or if developed during the study period. Patients with severe COPD or pregnancy were excluded. Results: 158 patients were identified. The mean patient follow-up time was 37 months. 57/158 patients (36%) died prior to June 2015, with mean time from ASV start to death of 24 months. Of these, 38 were found to have a cause of death suggestive of an underlying cardiovascular etiology including: cardiac arrest, heart failure, myocardial infarction, advanced cardiac procedure and hospice for end stage heart failure. 67/158 patients (42%) required hospitalization for HFrEF exacerbation with a median of 2 admissions and mean time to admission of 13 months, among patients with at least 1 admission. Baseline characteristics are illustrated in Table 1. Our cohort is comparable to the SERVE-HF population with a mean age 68 years, 90.5% male and baseline EF of 35.3%, with the exception of an increased AHI, mean 51.3 vs. 31.2. Of our 113 patients with both a baseline and follow up EF measurement, mean decline in EF was 5.8%, with an interquartile range from -15 to +2.5. Conclusions: We demonstrate a 36% all-cause mortality rate and 42% hospitalization rate for HFrEF exacerbation in patients with HFrEF and CSA who are prescribed an ASV device. CSA is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in HFrEF. Given this is a population of high risk, further comparison to matched ASV-unexposed patients will better elucidate if this intervention is associated with the deviation from the expected mortality and morbidity rate).

N2  - This study leverages psychiatric intake data from treatment-seeking perinatal women aiming to explore the understudied associations between childhood adversity, sleep quality, and severity of perinatal mental illness in this population. The sample is 578 perinatal women presenting for initial evaluation to a university-based perinatal psychiatry clinic. At intake, we collected demographics, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), sleep quality, and diagnosis and symptom severity of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Clinician-rated diagnoses showed that 65% of women met criteria for major depression, 23% for generalized anxiety disorder and 4% for PTSD; almost 30% of women had childhood adversity and 98.2% reported poor perinatal sleep quality. Regression analyses revealed differential associations between ACEs and sleep quality and perinatal mood symptoms; ACEs were significantly associated with pregnancy and postpartum PTSD, whereas sleep quality was associated with perinatal depression and generalized anxiety. Screening for ACEs and sleep quality during perinatal intake has high clinical utility, as these two factors significantly contribute to symptom severity across peripartum.

N2  - Background Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses following childbirth (i.e. “postpartum psychosis”, PP) and there is a need to identify which factors underlie this increased risk. Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss. Results Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47–2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526). Limitations Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes. Conclusions In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.

N2  - In the general population, sleeping problems can precede an episode of depression. We hypothesized that sleeping problems during pregnancy, including insomnia symptoms, shortened sleep, and daytime tiredness, are related to maternal postnatal depressiveness. We conducted a prospective study evaluating sleep and depressive symptoms, both prenatally (around gestational week 32) and postnatally (around 3 months after delivery) in the longitudinal CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort in Finland. Prenatally, 1667 women returned the questionnaire, of which 1398 women participated also at the postnatal follow-up. Sleep was measured with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ) and depressive symptoms with a 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Altogether, 10.3% of the women had postnatal depressiveness (CES-D ≥ 10 points). After adjusting for main background characteristics and prenatal depressiveness (CES-D ≥ 10), poor general sleep quality (AOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.21–2.88), tiredness during the day (AOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.41–3.38), short sleep ≤ 6 and ≤ 7 h, sleep latency > 20 min, and sleep loss ≥ 2 h were associated with postnatal depressiveness (all p <.050). Postnatally, after the adjustment for background characteristics, virtually all sleeping problems (i.e., difficulty falling asleep (AOR 7.93, 95% CI 4.76–13.20)), except frequent night awakenings per week or severe sleepiness during the day, were related to concurrent postnatal depressiveness. Thus, several prenatal and postnatal sleeping problems are associated with increased depressive symptoms 3 months postnatally. Screening of maternal prenatal sleeping problems, even without depressive symptoms during pregnancy or lifetime, would help to identify women at an increased risk for postnatal depressiveness.

N2  - Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from concurrent medical symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) and sleeping problems. However, there is limited information on the correlation between co-morbidities and autistic behavioral symptoms. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of GI and sleep problems in Chinese ASD children, examined the impacts of GI and sleep problems on autistic behavioral symptoms, and investigated the factors associated with GI and sleep problems. The survey included 169 ASD and 172 healthy children. Data regarding demographic characteristics, GI symptoms, sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms were collected through questionnaires. GI and sleep problems were prevalent in Chinese ASD children. Moreover, ASD children with GI symptoms reported more severe ASD core symptoms than others. Autistic children's GI symptoms were associated with maternal sleep problems during pregnancy, child's 0–6 month food sources and picky eating. ASD children with sleep disturbances had lower performance in daily living skills, social cognition, social communication and intellectual development than ASD children without sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances were associated with extra nutrient supply during lactation and feeding, and child's picky eating. Autistic children with GI or/and sleep problems may represent clinically relevant subtypes of ASD, for which targeted treatments may be needed.

N2  - Background: Our Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study suggested that a brief sleep intervention in infancy reduced the risk of obesity at age 2 y. In contrast, we observed no benefit from the nutrition and activity intervention. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine how these interventions influenced growth at ages 3.5 and 5 y compared with usual care (Control). Design: A follow-up of a parallel, 4-arm, single-blind, 2-y, randomized controlled trial in 802 women (86% European, 48% primiparous) recruited in pregnancy (58% response rate) was undertaken. All groups received standardWell-Child care with additional support for 3 intervention groups: FAB (promotion of breastfeeding, healthy eating, physical activity: 8 contacts, antenatal, 18 mo); Sleep (prevention of sleep problems: antenatal, 3 wk); Combination (both interventions). Follow-up measures were collected by staff blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was child body mass index (BMI) z score, and secondary outcomes were prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile), self-regulation (psychological measures), sleep, physical activity (accelerometry, questionnaires), and dietary intake (food-frequency questionnaire). Analyses were conducted through the use of multiple imputation. Results: Retention was 77% at age 3.5 y and 69% at age 5 y. Children in the FAB group had significantly higher BMI z scores than did Controls at age 5 y (adjusted difference: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47) but not at age 3.5 y (0.15; 95% CI: -0.04, 0.34). Children who received the Sleep intervention (Sleep and Combination groups) had significantly lower BMI z scores at age 3.5 y (-0.24; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.10) and at age 5 y (-0.23; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.07) than children who did not (Control and FAB groups). Conclusions: A conventional intervention had unexpected adverse long-term weight outcomes, whereas positive outcomes from a less conventional sleep intervention remained promising at age 5 y. More intensive or extended sleep intervention might have larger or longerlasting effects and should be investigated. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00892983.

N2  - An intact communication between circadian clocks and the stress system is important for maintaining physiological homeostasis under resting conditions and in response to external stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for a reciprocal interaction between both - from the systemic to the molecular level. Disruption of this interaction by external factors such as shiftwork, jetlag, or chronic stress increases the risk of developing metabolic, immune, or mood disorders. From experiments in rodents, we know that both systems maturate during the perinatal period. During that time, exogenous factors such as stress or alterations in the external photoperiod may critically affect - or program - physiological functions later in life. This developmental programming process has been attributed to maternal stress signals reaching the embryo, which lastingly change gene expression through the induction of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the well-known function of the adult circadian system in temporal coordination of physiology and behavior, the role of maternal and embryonic circadian clocks during pregnancy and postnatal development is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the circadian-stress crosstalk at different periods of development may help to improve stress resistance and devise preventive and therapeutic strategies against chronic stress-associated disorders.

N2  - This is an atypical case of a 27 year old right handed female with recurrent idiopathic Chorea Gravidarum that persists several years after pregnancy. The patient has a history of asthma, migraines, depression, and is now s/p tubal ligation (after her third delivery). She was referred to Loma Linda University Movement Disorder Clinic for evaluation of abnormal movements in September of 2013. She reports that the movements are jerky and involve the left arm, left leg, and mouth > right arm. The movements are constant, even occurring during sleep. The movements at night interfere with sleep. She frequently bites her tongue and has drooling because of abnormal mouth movements. She is unable to sit next to people because she is concerned she will elbow them. On exam she has constant, purposeless, complex, jerky movements in the left upper extremity >> left low-er extremity > right upper extremity (flexion, extension, twisting), involving proximal and distal muscles, nonrhythmic, and non-stereotypic. The movements are not distractible. There is intermittent kicking of the left leg and the patient has difficulty keeping her tongue protruded. The patient has no obvious risk factors for Chorea Gravidarum. The patient is not pregnant and is not taking exogenous hormones. There is no history of rheumatic fever, SLE, substance abuse, or exposure to drugs known to cause chorea. Extensive workup is negative including EMG/NCS, MRI, TTE, CBC, CMP, Urine Copper, Ceruloplasmin, Lupus panel, ASO, ESR, HIV, RPR, TSH, PTH, FT4, Huntington's Disease genetic testing. However, she does have hormonal abnormalities (high progesterone, low testosterone). This is consistent with the understanding of Chorea Gravidarum to be a“hormone-induced chorea” that occurs after activa-tion of a previous static, subclinical, lesion in the basal ganglia because of hormonal changes.

N2  - Globally, anxiety and depression is the third leading cause of disease burden for women 14 to 44 years of age. The World Health Organisation reports that 15 to 57% of women in developing countries experience symptoms of depression. Maternal mental illness has a negative impact on infant and young child (IYC) growth, development and care, having serious health implications in terms of physical, cognitive and emotional well-being during crucial stages of the life span, such as the first 1000 days and early childhood. Various studies conducted in both developed and developing countries, have shown that maternal depression is associated with negative health outcomes such as: low birth weight, developmental delay, incomplete immunisation schedules, acute or chronic diarrhoea, somatic symptoms, disrupted sleep patterns and child abuse, as well as psychiatric and neuro behavioural disorders. In addition, maternal depression impairs IYC care practices related to breastfeeding, health care, safety and development. It also contributes to inadequate nutrition during pregnancy as well as that of offspring during infancy and childhood, resulting in suboptimal brain development and inadequate growth. Infants with depressed mothers are not only vulnerable to becoming underweight, but also being stunted.

N2  - Learning Objective #1: Describe workup for elevated PTT and discuss the implications of positive lupus anticoagulant Learning Objective #2: Recognize the association and potential causality between lupus anticoagulant and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension CASE: MFO is an 84-year-old cisgender woman with past medical history significant for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, hypertension, hyper-lipidemia, type 2 diabetes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a 20-pack-year history of cigarette smoking, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension presenting with two months of recurrent nosebleeds. The patient sleeps with 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula with saline humidifier and uses fluticasone three times daily for nasal congestion. She is not on antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. She denies personal or family history of bleeding or clotting disorders, easy bruising, or anemia. She experienced no complications or excessive perioperative bleeding during previous cholecystectomy, pregnancy, or vaginal delivery. Her pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed via echo 4 years prior, and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 43 mmHg. Her pulmonary hypertension is currently managed with sildenafil and bosentan. Physical exam demonstrated intra-nasal dried blood without visible vessel or abrasion. No ecchymosis or petechiae were appreciated. The patient was referred to ENT, where she was found to have an elevated PTT of 42.6 seconds. A subsequent aPTT mixing study suggested the presence of a lupus anticoagulant based on correction of prolonged aPTT with a lupus anticoagulant insensitive reagent. IMPACT: While elevated aPTT was likely an incidental finding, unrelated to MFO's epistaxis, the presence of a lupus anticoagulant may shed light onto the etiology of her idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. An elevated PTT can indicate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. It is important to conduct a thorough workup for these factors, which have known associations with recurrent thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of lupus anticoagulant in a healthy population is estimated at about 3% (Shi et al., 1990). As with MFO, it is often found during a work-up of incidentally-discovered elevated PTT. A reported 24-33% of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies are predisposed to vascular thrombosis (Gastineau et al., 1985). Recent studies demonstrated a potentially causal relationship between lupus anticoagulant and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (Parthvi et al, 2017). The pathophysiology remains unclear, but some hypothesize it may develop due to thrombosis, chronic thromboembo-lism, and associated endothelial remodeling (Zuily et al., 2015). Early identification of antiphospholipid antibodies can allow physicians to appropriately screen and treat before irreversible pulmonary vascular pathology occurs.

N2  - In resistance to thyroid hormone β (RTH-β), mutations in the thyroid hor-mone receptor isoform β results in symptoms of both increased and decreased TH action depending on the tissues' predominant receptor isoform expression. TSH circadian rhythm under the effect of different types of autoimmune thy-roid disease (AITD) in RTH-β and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been observed. Here we present an RTH-β family with different accompany-ing AITD in which both genetically-diagnosed members also had concomi-tant T2DM. We observed the index patient (Case 1) through gestation and 2 years postpartum, and assessed the circadian rhythm of circulating TSH, FT4 and FT3 in both subjects. We found that the natural progression of AITD is independent of inherent RTH-β. In Case 1, the presence of RTH-β did not increase disease duration or progression toward permanent hypothyroidism after the development of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT). An analysis of the cir-cadian rhythm of TSH in RTH-β at baseline thyroid hormone levels showed that despite stably elevated FT4 and FT3, nocturnal TSH increase was evident, starting at approximately 7 PM, whereas in RTH-β with Grave's disease (GD) (Case 2), TSH was suppressed to the low detection limit with no observable TSH surge though pulsatility remains. Glucose metabolism was independent of TFT results, but TSH rhythm may be absent in uncontrolled diabetes. The presence of different AITD in this family and the occurrence of PPT in one subject allowed the observation of glucose changes under variations of thyroid hormone levels. In Case 1, the most dramatic change in TH results was dur-ing the hypothyroid phase of PPT, at which basal glucose and insulin was still comparable to baseline levels. On the other hand, no nocturnal TSH increase was observed for unmanaged diabetes in Case 2. In conclusion, TSH circa-dian rhythm may be preserved in RTH with HT in controlled glycemia, while the TSH nocturnal surge was absent in RTH with GD in uncontrolled diabetes. Although it is unknown whether thyroid hormone or glucose level has a greater impact on TSH variation in RTH-β patients, the treatment of hormonal disturbance and hyperglycemia may be synergetic toward normalizing nocturnal TSH surge.

N2  - Objective: Women with gestational diabetes (GDM) have a 7–12-fold increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Postpartum weight retention is highly predictive for future obesity, and further increases risk for type 2 diabetes. We sought to identify predictors of losing at least 75% of gestational weight gain by very early postpartum in women with recent GDM. Methods: We recruited women with GDM during pregnancy or just after delivery. Prepregnancy weight was self-reported at recruitment; gestational weight gain, mode of delivery, and insulin use were extracted from medical records. At a mean of 7.2 (±2.1) weeks postpartum we measured weight and height and administered questionnaires, including demographics, breastfeeding, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, sleep, Harvard Food Frequency, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. We modeled the odds of 75% loss of gestational weight gain at the study visit using multivariable logistic regression models and selected the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) as our final model. Analyses were conducted using JMP 10–13 Pro (SAS Institute Inc.) Results: Seventy-five women with recent GDM were included in the study. The mean age of study participants was 33 (SD ±5) years old, of whom 57% were white, 30% were African American, and 20% of the women identified as Hispanic. The mean prepregnancy BMI was 31.4 kg/m2 (SD ±5.6) and the mean pregnancy weight gain was 12.5 kg (SD ±7.8). Fifty-two percent of participants lost at least 75% of their pregnancy weight gain by the early postpartum study visit. Thirty-seven women (49%) exceeded Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for gestational weight gain. In a multivariate model adjusting for weeks postpartum at the time of the study visit, less gestational weight gain (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39–0.73), increased age (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.13–2.20), and lack of insulin use during pregnancy (OR 0.08 for use of insulin; 95% CI 0.00–0.73) were associated with at least 75% postpartum weight loss. Prepregnancy BMI and sleep were not retained in the model. Race/ethnicity, education, breastfeeding, nulliparity, cesarean section, depressive symptoms, dietary composition, glycemic index, and physical activity did not meet criteria for inclusion in the model. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of women with recent GDM lost at least 75% of their gestational weight gain by early postpartum. Older women, those who did not use insulin during pregnancy and those who gained less weight during pregnancy were significantly more likely to have lost 75% of gestational weight by very early postpartum.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal functional status is an important health outcome for new mothers. Postpartum wellness includes both feeling “back to self” physically and emotionally, and maternal readiness to perform caretaking tasks. This study sought to identify factors that influence maternal wellness following pregnancy in urban low-income women, in order to identify areas for targeted intervention among this at-risk cohort. STUDY DESIGN: We examined the association between depression, self-efficacy, social support, partner support, and sleep with 3 week postpartum physical and emotional wellness. Depression was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS ≥10) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9 ≥10). This study includes 379 (of 510 enrolled) mothers, who completed the baseline and 3-week survey (34 days ≤13 postpartum). Ninetyseven percent were Black or Hispanic, 53% were born outside of the US, and all were enrolled in Medicaid Managed care. RESULTS: 379 respondents were included. Mothers who did not feel back to self physically and emotionally were more likely to have antepartum complications (47% vs. 34%, p=0.04), were more likely to have a history of depression (29% vs. 15%, p=0.004), less likely to feel supported by their partner (50% vs. 28%, p=0.0006), and less likely to get >5 hours of sleep/night (67% vs. 84%, p=0.002). After controlling for antepartum complications, self-efficacy, social support, partner support, depression at baseline, and sleep, mothers who reported partner support (adjusted OR: 1.2, CI 1.07-1.40) and >5 hours of sleep (adjusted OR: 2.2, CI 1.13-4.4) were more likely to feel physically and emotionally back to self at 3 weeks postpartum. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that interventions targeting partner support and sleep may increase mothers' wellness in the early postpartum period, as baseline depression, lack of partner support, and insufficient sleep were risk factors for poor maternal wellness following pregnancy in this population.

N2  - Background. The Worldwide prevalence of tension-type headache (TTH) an average of 42% in adults. In Ukraine the prevalence of TTH in adolescents is poor documented. Aim of this study - to determine the prevalence of TTH and identify the risk factors among adolescents in Kharkiv. Methods. The scientific work is based on the results of the survey of 2342 adolescents aged 13-18 years in the period of preventive medical examinations in randomly selected secondary schools in Kharkiv. The analysis of the risk factors for the development of TTH was conducted by the questionnaire developed by us. Possible risk factors in the formation of TTH were divided into 4 groups: hereditary, biomedical, psychosocial and welfare. Results. It was found that the prevalence of headache in adolescents in Kharkiv was 80,2%. Girls were more likely to suffer from headache (56,3%). Primary headache was the most common type of headache (72,2%). TTH has taken the main place among primary headaches (61,1%). We observed infrequent episodic TTH in 59,7% of adolescents with TTH, frequent episodic TTH - in 33,8% and chronic TTH - in 6,5% of adolescents with TTH. The risk factors for development of TTH in adolescents were genetics factors for headache (59%), gastrointestinal (24%) and autonomic nervous system (46%) disorders; pathology of the ante-, intra- and postnatal periods: fetal pathology (51%) and newborn (55,8%); extragenital mother's pathology (27%) (especially for adolescents with chronic TTH (35,5%)), pathology of pregnancy and childbirth (50,5%); syndrome of increased neuro-reflex excitability (46%) and sleep disorders in early childhood; comorbidity (increased excitability (18%), sleep disturbance (27%), gastrointestinal tract diseases (24%)); unfavorable family factors (divorce (23%) and quarrel (27%) of parents); poor adaptation to pre-school (51%) and school education (40%); hypodynamics (prolonged work at the computer (1,4±0,2 hours), drop in visits of sports groups (27,3%), smoking (41%) and alcohol consumption (23%). Conclusions. The frequency of TTH in adolescents in Kharkiv city is 61,1%. The most common form is infrequent episodic TTH. Chronic TTH is observed in 6,5%. It's revealed that the main risk factors for the development of TTH in adolescents are genetic factors, pathology of the perinatal period, concomitant pathology, unfavorable family factors, hypodynamia, smoking and alcohol consumption. Prognostic tables have been developed for allocating risk groups for the formation and chronization of TTH for the timely administration of treatment and prophylactic measures.

N2  - This review presents the current status of a method for prevention and timely correction of human functional disturbances that was first proposed by Russian neurologist Ya.I. Levin in 1998 and further developed by the authors. The approach is named "Music of the Brain" and is based on musical or music-like stimulation organized in strict accordance with the biopotentials of a patient's brain. Initial studies on the music of the brain approach were analyzed, and its limitations were noted. To enhance the efficiency and usability of the approach, several combinations of music therapy with neurofeedback technique-musical neurofeedback-were developed. Enhanced efficiency of the approach has been shown for correction of functional disturbances during pregnancy and for elimination of stress-induced states in high technology specialists. The use and advantages of musical neurofeedback technology for increasing human cognitive activity, correcting sleep disturbances and treatment of disorders of attention were verified. After further development and testing the approach may be suited for a wide range of therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures in the protection of public health.

N2  - Introduction and aim: Pulsatile tinnitus can impose a significant burden upon quality of life. It is characterized by rhythmic pulsations synchronous to the patient's heartbeat, discriminating venous hum from its arterial analogue by its continuous murmur and the abolishment of symptoms when compressing the ipsilateral jugular vein. Pulsatile tinnitus might be caused by the increased sensitivity to bone-conducted sounds (such as in superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome) or disruption of laminar flow, creating audible turbulence. The latter might be caused by sigmoid sinus anomalies (incl. diverticulum, aneurysm, wall dehiscence, etc.), by increased cardiac output syndromes (incl. anemia, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, etc.) or intracranial hypertension. We report the case of a patient who presented at our department with an incapacitating venous pulsatile tinnitus in the right ear. Case report A 55-year-old woman presented at the outpatient clinic with an incapacitating venous hum in her right ear for 2 years, with sleep disturbances. Tinnitus Functional Index revealed a severe level of distress (score of 70.4). Occluding her ipsilateral jugular vein made this noise stop immediately. She did not report any other otological symptoms, such as hearing loss or vertigo. Microscopic examination of the tympanic membrane was normal. Liminal and speech audiometry thresholds were normal. The patient had a history of Becker Muscular Dystrophy and hypothyroidism. She took L-thyroxine, Promagnor, Paroxetine, Zolpidem and Alprazolam. Echocardiography demonstrated a normal cardiac output. High-resolution temporal bone CT and MRI angiography showed a laterally protruding sinus sigmoid diverticulum/aneurysm in the right mastoid with a focal wall dehiscence. Due to the incapacitating complaints and sleep disturbance of the patient we advised to perform surgical reconstruction. During surgery, the lesion appeared to be a well-circumscribed sac in which the sigmoid sinus focally protruded into the adjacent mastoid area, more likely to be sigmoid sinus aneurysm. The wall dehiscence on the anterosuperior aspect towards the junction with the superior petrosal sinus was also identified. The sigmoid sinus along with the aneurysm were skeletonized, decompressed and pushed medially. The cortical bone was reconstructed in this new position with cortical bone chips and bone paté obliterating the mastoid fully. Prophylactic low-molecular weight heparines were administered to prevent venous thrombo-embolism. In the postoperative period, the patient experienced symptom relief from the day after surgery and onwards. Conclusion: Pulsatile tinnitus as a result of sigmoid sinus diverticula, aneurysms and dehiscence is a rare, but largely treatable condition. Available interventions include sigmoid sinus wall reconstruction with cortical bone chips and bone paté which has a high rate of symptom resolution.

N2  - Background. The early (in the first months of life) formation of atopic status and the development of allergies are not uncommon pathological conditions in a pediatrician's practice, requiring sufficiently studied and theoretically grounded measures for the organization of primary/secondary prevention. Case Report. The parents visited a doctor with complaints of widespread skin rashes and troubled night sleep in a child from the age of two months. A burdened history of allergies of the child was traced through the female lineage (food allergy in the mother, maternal sister and grandmother). The perinatal period is complicated by acute respiratory infection in the third trimester and by maternal nutritional preferences (consumption of goat's and whole cow's milk). The delayed (on the 5th day of life) breastfeeding initiation, feeding with cow's milk-based formula, living next to an industrial enterprise, maternal choices of products with a high sensitizing potential not only during pregnancy but also during breastfeeding probably caused the early formation of atopic status - dry skin, widespread papular rash, microvesicles on the cheeks, hips, shins, scratching traces, serous-bloody crusts objectively defined at admission. The SCORAD scores corresponded to severe atopic dermatitis. The ImmunoCAP technology revealed high antibody titres to a number of products, including cow's milk and chicken egg proteins. Based on the findings, a therapeutic diet aimed at secondary prevention of allergic diseases, including respiratory allergies, was developed for the child. Conclusion. A case of the early (from 2 months) formation of atopic status with the development of atopic dermatitis caused by polyvalent food sensitization is described. A therapeutic diet containing products with a low sensitizing potential was prescribed for the child. The suggested therapy including the diet should prevent the progression of an allergic disease.

N2  - Alterations in the development of attention and behavioral organization can configure clinical diagnoses such as attention deficit disorder (ADD) that may not be accompanied by hyperactivity (ADHD), the latter seems to have a direct relationship with other endocrine diagnoses such as the obesity. The aim of the study is to analyze the relationship between ADHD and obesity. That is why a systematic review of scientific studies is carried out revealing relationships between both disorders from a physiological, cognitive and behavioral perspective. It is concluded that the relationship between ADHD and obesity is given by genetic factors, by dopaminergic variations, changes in sleep patterns, emotional imbalances and by alterations in the regulation of behavior; likewise, social factors related to pregnancy care and the feeding of women before and during pregnancy influence it.

N2  - Objective: Women with spinal cord injury (SCI) at or above T6 experience lactation dysfunction and severe hypertensive episodes, termed Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD). Prevalence and the major barriers to breastfeeding caused by SCI are unknown, as woen's health after SCI is understudied. This study examines the extent of specific SCI-related breastfeeding complications. Method: A multi-centre retrospective study was conducted at the International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD, Canada) and Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). An expert panel of clinicians, researchers and mothers with SCI were recruited. The panel used the Delphi method to develop two online questionnaires for women who breastfed after SCI (n = 102). Questionnaire domains included participants' injury, pregnancy, childbirth, lactation/breastfeeding difficulties, breastfeeding education and psychological wellbeing (using validated scales for quality of life after SCI, postpartum depression, anxiety, maternal self-efficacy). Results: Participants were 41.31 ± 9.77 years old, with SCI ranging from C4-L1. AD was reported by 46.7% of women with cervical SCI (n = 14), 25% of women with upper thoracic (T1-T6) SCI (n = 3) and 13.1% of women with low-level SCI below or at T7 (n = 8). 76.7% (n = 23) of women with cervical SCI indicated insufficient milk production as a major breastfeeding complication compared to 58.3% (n = 7) of upper thoracic and 36.1% (n = 22) of low-level SCI. Breastfeeding cessation in women with cervical and upper thoracic SCI was mainly due to lack of time for both breastfeeding and personal care (bladder care, showering, activities of daily living). The low-level SCI group reported sleep deprivation. 63% (n = 56) of women who sought information self-researched or received no education on breastfeeding with SCI. Rates of self-reported postpartum depression (PPD) evaluated by the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System-3D tool (PRAMS-3D) ranged from 25-37% (up to 4 times greater than prevalence of clinically diagnosed PPD in this sample). Conclusion: This is the largest cohort study of motherhood after SCI that identifies specific breastfeeding complications related to SCI. AD and lactation dysfunction were more prevalent in higher SCI. Early assessment is recommended to prevent missed diagnosis of PPD. There is need for increased education on breastfeeding after SCI. Breastfeeding plans should include considerations for balancing personal care, night feeds and mobility challenges.

N2  - Background: Food insecurity (FI), the lack of consistent access to food, is a major public health problem affecting over 40 million Americans. Because of limited economic resources, food insecure individuals are more likely to have poor nutrition, limited physical activity, and increased stress leading to poor health outcomes. Numerous studies have examined if FI leads to increased weight gain, but little is known about how FI affects individuals who are obese. The objective of this study was to determine if obese, food-insecure individuals are more likely to have medical co-morbidities than obese, food-secure individuals. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All participants (> 6 years of age) who were obese were eligible. Participants who were pregnant or missing FI data were excluded. The predictor was household FI defined by the USDA Food Security Scale. The primary outcome was the total number of obesity related co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, cancer, asthma, and sleep apnea). Secondary outcomes evaluated the association between FI and individual co-morbidities. Propensity score weighting was used to improve covariate balance between food insecure and food secure participants. Propensity scores were estimated based on demographic and clinical characteristics using a machine-learning technique called random forest. We used Poisson regression to test the association between FI and total number of medical co-morbidities and predictive margins to determine the percent difference in co-morbidities, adjusting for the propensity of being food insecure and accounting for the complex survey design of NHANES. Results: Of the 11,283 participants, 23.2% were food insecure. Food insecure individuals were significantly more likely to be younger age, have a lower household income, have public insurance, and a higher BMI (p< 0.01 for all comparisons). In propensity score adjusted models, FI was associated with an 11.8% (95% CI: 1.33%, 22.3%, p=0.03) increase in the number of obesity related co-morbid conditions. In secondary analyses, FI was associated with an increased odds of participants having cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.84; p=0.02) and asthma (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.55; p=0.01). There was a trend toward FI being associated with diabetes, but results were not statistically significant. FI was not significantly associated with other co-morbid conditions. Conclusions: In this nationally representative cohort, we found that obese individuals who suffered from FI were significantly more likely to have an increased number of co-morbid medical conditions than obese, food-secure individuals. Although further research is needed to determine causality, FI may be an independent, modifiable risk factor that clinicians should consider when treating obese patients in order to prevent medical co-morbidities.

N2  - Background: Mobile technologies deliver new capabilities that can be beneficial to drive major aspects of health care. In patientcentered healthcare there is a need for continuing monitoring health technologies to enable the fast and accurate decision making. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore and identify new and emerging technologies that are likely to impact the future of health care and practical research. Methods: We conducted a systematic search on top ranking health technology websites according to Alexa Rank. The websites included msn.com, theguardian.com, techcrunch.com, cnet.com, and telegraph.co.uk. The search was carried out with pre-defined search terms on published news articles from January to October 2016. Technologies of interest were mHealth technologies, which have a potential impact on health care, regardless of their maturity level (i.e. under development, prototype, under control trial study, or pilot study). Results: A total of 262 news articles were identified through electronic search and screened. After comparing against selection criteria, 75 mHealth innovative products/interventions were included in this review. Several wearable devices such as watches and wrist-worn bands were introduced for mental coaching, physical activity, fertility, fitness, sleep, blood pressure, and vital sign tracking. Numerous reports on smartphones connected appliances for medication adherence monitoring, baby tracking, woman health, including menstruation and pregnancy monitoring, were identified. Smartphone apps for body changes visualization, pre-hospital care, sleep screen, birth control, eye examination, rehabilitation, disease diagnosis and prescription, mental health services, and organ donation were also introduced. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that personalized lifestyle and move towards consumer centered medicine monitoring through mobile health technologies such as wearable and connected appliances are emerging, which will be accessible for higher proportion of patients and health providers in the near future.

N2  - Background: Perinatal depression has wide-ranging impacts on the health of mothers, babies and their families. Previously published data suggest seasonal variation in the prevalence of perinatal depression, as well as possible variation with gestation. Aims: To describe the prevalence of perinatal depression in a New Zealand population; to describe the trend in depression over gestational age; and to assess the influence of season on perinatal depression. Materials and Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a prospective cohort of 260 women in Dunedin, New Zealand. Edinburgh Depression Scores were collected at four antenatal time points and at six months postpartum. Results: Prevalence of depression decreased from 8.1% to 4.6% antenatally, and to 6.6% postnatally, but the variation was non-significant. Prevalence was significantly higher in winter and spring antenatally (odds ratio (OR) 3.15, 95% CI 1.01–9.82 and OR 3.16, CI 1.05–9.55), and in spring postnatally (OR 8.40, 95% CI 1.01–69.52) compared to autumn. Antenatal depression was associated with poor sleep quality (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.22–14.93), while postnatal depression was associated with caesarean delivery (OR 5.03, 95% CI 1.29–19.64). Conclusions: This is the first NZ cohort to assess depression over multiple antenatal and postnatal time points. A significantly higher rate of depression was identified in winter and spring antenatally and in spring postnatally, corresponding to a higher risk of postnatal depression with autumn deliveries. These findings should prompt greater awareness at these higher risk time periods.

N2  - Background: Few studies have included male clients (MC) of female sex workers (FSW); hence, little is known about their involvement in or willingness to participate in HIV prevention programs. Additionally, there is a dearth of information about MC and FSW attitudes about condom use and strategies they use to negotiate condom use during sexual transactions. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with MC and FSW living in Kisumu, Kenya. FSW were recruited through Impact-RDO's key population service program, whereas MCs were referred mostly by the FSW. We sought to understand participants' perceptions about their own and their MC condom use, situations in which they wanted to use condoms but were unable to, and how they negotiate condom use in transactional sex. Results: We enrolled 30 MC and 30 FSW. FSW were younger, less educated, and less likely to be married than MC; MC was on average 8 years older than FSW. Most MC (n=17) and FSW (n=28) believed that using condoms made them not worry when engaging in sex work, primarily when with new or intermittent partners: “If I use condom today, I will not be stressed up the following day.” Most FSW (n=18) refused to engage in condomless sex. Prevention of pregnancy (n=18) also prompted consistent condom use. However, some MC (n=10) and FSW (n=7) reported using condoms inconsistently; the offer of higher prices hindered FSW demand for condom use. Some MC used inference in deciding with whom it is safe to have condomless sex: “You tell her that you don't have a condom and if she tells you, I don't want to die soon', that one means she is not infected,” whereas FSW indicated that for some MC, paid sex with condom does not provide value for money: “They see that when you sleep with them without condom is when his money has served a purpose.” Conclusions: Identifying MC through FSW is feasible and enabled garnering insights from them regarding HIV prevention practices. Interventions are needed that target FSW and MC on the importance of consistent condom use.

N2  - Introduction: Childhood obesity is still an important public health problem in Spain and worldwide. Apart from the effects during growth, childhood obesity has been associated with increasing the risk of suffering from chronic diseases during adulthood. Among others, data support increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome. On the other hand, school has been identified as the best place to reach children for screening and intervention studies. Purpose: To develop a protocol in which pediatricians and teachers collaborate in the prevention, early identification and treatment of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in school children. Material and Methods: Based on previous experience of the research group and on literature review, it was agreed that the following data should be annually collected in a longitudinal 5-year lasting study: (a) Education of parents or guardians; (b) Duration of pregnancy, lactation; (c) Family history of CVD; (d) Sleep; (e) Sedentary lifestyle; (f) Physical Activity; (g) Body composition; (h) Tanner stage; (i) Handgrip strength; (j) Cardiopulmonary auscultation; (k) Weight and height; (h) Dietary habits. Parents will sign an informed written consent and all ethical aspects will be considered. In order to guarantee the confidentiality, personal data will be taken on a separate sheet and will be kept by the main researcher of the study. Each child will get a random code which will make identification impossible. Results: After presenting the aim and protocol of the study, 3 schools from Madrid and Toledo have accepted to participate, with a total number of 1500 children (ages 3-16). Children will not be randomly selected, as parents have to agree upon participation. This could introduce some bias in the socioeconomic background of the family, but will not have an influence on the methodological approach of the study and results. A pilot study will be performed in order to assure feasibility of the study. Nurses will give support to pediatricians at schools, so that exploration does not exceed 1-h time per classroom. Physical fitness will be evaluated during Physical Education (PE) classes in collaboration with PE teachers. Conclusion: The importance of the collaboration between primary care pediatricians and teachers has not been sufficiently exploited. PESCA study will try to fill in this gap and to develop tools and algorithms to facilitate early identification of CV risk factors, in order to contribute to children's current and future health.

N2  - Disturbances in maternal physiology can cause changes in the fetal condition that may lead to impaired fetal development. Synchronous monitoring of cardiac autonomic tone via the assessment of the fetal and maternal heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) may provide an appropriate diagnostic window. Partial rank correlation coefficients between the maternal and fetal HR and HRV indices were calculated and verified by testing surrogate data in 315 magnetocardiographic (MCG) recordings from 141 healthy women pregnant with singleton fetuses [18+6 to 39+2 weeks gestational age (WGA)]. We assessed maternal self-perceived depression, anxiety and stress by means of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales self-reporting instrument (DASS42G) questionnaire. The maternal HRV correlated positively with the fetal HRV, but negatively with the fetal HR. Correlation was |r|<0.2 in state-independent and gestational age (GA) <32 weeks, but |r|>0.2 in active sleep and GA ≥32 weeks. The DASS42G results correlated with the maternal HRV and HR, while the fetal HR and HRV were not influenced. Correlations between maternal and fetal autonomic activation were statistically confirmed. They depend on the GA and active fetal state. As far as healthy subjects are concerned, maternal self-perceived stress, anxiety or depression is mirrored in maternal but not in fetal autonomic tone.

N2  - Objective: Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for infants and young children in the USA, and the children of young mothers are at an even higher risk. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been successful in promoting behaviour change for many health conditions. This study assessed interest in mSafety, a text and video messaging mHealth intervention targeting injury prevention knowledge, behaviour and self-efficacy in young mothers. Design: Interviews with young mothers were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Setting: Interviews took place at a health clinic for teenage mothers and their children and at a local public charter high school which serves pregnant teenagers and young mothers. Method: A trained research assistant conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 young mothers (ages 15–20). Participants were asked both closed and open-ended questions to elicit opinions about their willingness to utilise mSafety. Results: The results of the interviews were positive. Participants were most interested in learning about the prevention of falls and poisonings, as well as safe sleep. Many emphasised that the language of the messages should be simple and that videos could be included to demonstrate methods of injury prevention. Most interviewees were willing to participate in a ‘virtual home safety visit’ in which participants text home photos to an expert to evaluate home safety practices. Conclusion: The concept of an mHealth intervention that would provide young mothers with the tools to prevent injuries among their children received positive feedback.

N2  - Introduction: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare condition affecting obese woman of childbearing age. Although IIHs pathophysiology is unknown, its profile is invariably characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP), papilledema and visual loss. Pulmonological disorders such as sleep apnea, and otological symptoms such as tinnitus and hearing loss have been previously reported in IIH patients. Obesity stresses the respiratory system, but otological symptoms could be directly linked to increased ICP and consequent increases in perilymphatic and venous sinus pressures. Thus, we characterized the ICPs and the presence of otological and respiratory symptoms of IIH patients in a population-based setting. Methods: A total of 35 patients with IIH diagnosis admitted from a defined catchment area between 2000 and 2016 were reviewed. All otological and respiratory symptoms were reviewed from patient records. Results: Total of 80% were females. At the time of diagnosis the mean for age was 30.1 years, for BMI 36.2 kg/m2, for CSF opening pressure (OP) 31.2 mmHg, and for follow-up time 4.4 years, respectively. Tinnitus occurred in 43 and 6% participants had documented hearing loss. Presentation of otological symptoms were associated with increased presence of papilledema (p = 0.045), higher BMI (37.9 vs. 34.4 kg/m2) and to a poorer outcome after treatment (36% vs. 23%), but not to sex, age or OP. The patients with otological symptoms were more often shunted (44% vs. 28%) and had higher presentation of pulmonological symptoms(56% vs. 5%) (p = 0.002) as compared with patients without otological symptoms. Conclusions: Our results suggest that otological symptoms are common in IIH patients and that they should be screened due to increased morbidity and possible pulmonological disorders.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) – defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least 6 months’ duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy – is estimated to affect 6–27% of women worldwide. In the United Kingdom, over 1 million women suffer from CPP, which has been highlighted as a key area of unmet need. Current medical treatments for CPP are often associated with unacceptable side effects. A specific style of acupuncture, the meridian balance method electro-acupuncture (BMEA) and traditional Chinese medicine health consultation (TCM HC (BMEA + TCM HC = BMEA treatment)), may be effective for CPP in women. Aim: Three focus group discussions and semi-structured telephone interviews were embedded in a randomised controlled feasibility trial to gain in-depth description of the perceived benefits of the participants’ respective interventions. Methods: Women with CPP were randomised into the BMEA treatment, TCM HC or National Health Service standard care (NHS SC). Focus group discussions were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted post focus group discussions. Findings: A total of 30 women were randomised into BMEA treatment, TCM HC or NHS SC. A total of 11 participants attended the three focus group discussions. Thematic analysis of focus group discussions showed: a perceived pain reduction, enhanced sleep, energy level and sense of well-being in the BMEA treatment and TCM HC groups; a dislike for the adverse effects of medications, frustration at the lack of effective treatment, heavy reliance on medications and services that are helpful, in the NHS SC group. Semi-structured telephone interviews showed that the methodology was acceptable to the participants. Conclusion: The embedded focus group discussions captured the rich and complex narratives of the participants and provided insights into the perceived benefits of the BMEA treatment, TCM HC and NHS SC interventions.

N2  - Background: Being overweight constitutes a health risk, and the proportion of overweight and obese children is increasing. It has been argued that road traffic noise could be linked to adiposity through its influence on sleep and stress. Few studies, to our knowledge, have investigated whether noise and adiposity are associated. Most of them were on adults, and we are not aware of any longitudinal study using repeated measures. Objectives: The present longitudinal study investigated whether road traffic noise exposures in pregnancy (N = 6,963; obs = 22,975) or childhood (N = 6,403; obs = 14,585) were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories in children. Methods: We obtained information on BMI and covariates from questionnaires used in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, Statistics Norway, and Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We modeled road traffic noise for the most exposed façade of children's present and historical addresses at 6 time points from pregnancy to age 8. We investigated effects on BMI trajectories using repeated measures and linear mixed models. Results: The results indicated that BMI curves depended on road traffic noise exposure during pregnancy, but not on exposure during childhood. Children in the highest decile of traffic noise exposure had increased BMI, with 0.35 kg/m2 more than children in the lowest decile, from birth to age 8 years. Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy may be associated with children's BMI trajectories. Future studies should investigate this further, using anthropometric measures such as waist-hip ratio and skinfold thickness, in addition to BMI.

N2  - The Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family plays a central role in the generation and regulation of inflammatory responses, in both innate and adaptive immunity. Although the IL-1 molecules are traditionally considered to be classical proinflammatory cytokines, their functions are not restricted to inflammation, and they have also been shown to play a key role in a wide range of additional physiological and pathological functions, including learning modulation, sleep, pregnancy, depression, appetite, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and many others. Since their effect as cytokines and regulators of inflammation is so pleiotropic, any shift of the biological balance between agonistic and antagonistic signals has the potential to cause disease. Here, we consider the genetic influence of interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in the context of susceptibility to human diseases. We review known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-1 genes linked to human diseases, and suggest how exploring biological effects of IL-1 gene cluster polymorphism may lead to new directions in understanding and diagnostic of disease and effective treatment.

N2  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent developmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication and social interaction and in stereotyped or repetitive behaviors. Besides the classical behavioral dyad, several comorbidities are frequently present in patients with ASD, such as anxiety, epilepsy, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction. Although the etiology of ASD remains unclear, there is supporting evidence for the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors. Valproic acid (VPA) is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer that, when used during the gestational period, increases the risk of ASD in the offspring. The animal model of autism induced by prenatal exposure to VPA demonstrates important structural and behavioral features that can be observed in individuals with autism; it is thus an excellent tool for testing new drug targets and developing novel behavioral and drug therapies. In addition, immunological alterations during pregnancy could affect the developing embryo because immune molecules can pass through the placental barrier. In fact, exposure to pathogens during the pregnancy is a known risk factor for ASD, and maternal immune activation can lead to autistic-like features in animals. Interestingly, neuroimmune alterations are common in both autistic individuals and in animal models of ASD. We summarize here the important alterations in inflammatory markers, such as cytokines and chemokines, in patients with ASD and in the VPA animal model.

N2  - Rationale Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtCO2) monitoring has been available for many years. In recent studies its use has been validated in patients with sleep apnea, primarily in the pediatric population. It is our belief that during PAP titration PetCO2 levels will be unreliable due to CO2 washout cause by the increased flow delivered with PAP therapy. We hypothesize that PtCO2 will be a more accurate way to monitor and titrate CO2 levels during PAP titration than PetCO2. Methods In this prospective study 46 patients were enrolled during their polysomnography. The polysomnography types included were diagnostic, split night, and PAP titrations. The primary end point was 1) the accuracy of both PtCO2 & PetCO2 when compared with PaCO2, 2) the change in PetCO2 during PAP therapy compared to PtCO2 and PaCO2. Exclusion criteria included: <18 years of age, allergy to adhesives, skin lesions impairing membrane placement, pregnant, actively incarcerated, or unable to consent at the time. During the polysomnogram data was recorded in 30-minute intervals. At the end of the polysomnogram an arterial blood gas was drawn by the Respiratory Department. This data was then inserted into a excel file and statistically analyzed. Results The data was analyzed using t Test and multiple regression models. Our study showed no significant difference in the comparison of transcutaneous or end tidal CO2 levels (mean 38.6 and 37.6). A multiple regression model was used to compare the different measurement types including covariates. There was no statistical significant in CO2 levels based between PtCO2 & PaCO2 (t -0.094, p 0.926), PetCO2 & PaCO2 (t -1.275, p 0.209), and PtCO2 & PetCO2 (t 1.045, p 0.302). When comparing the effect of flow on carbon dioxide levels using end tidal there was no significant change (p 0.400). Conclusion Transcutaneous and end tidal CO2 monitoring is equally effective in monitoring CO2 levels during PAP titration. Based on our results there does not appear to be a significant effect from the flow of PAP therapy on CO2 monitoring with end tidal CO2. Either PetCO2 or PtCO2 monitoring can safely and accurately be used during polysomnography. A study evaluating flow moderation on end tidal CO2 levels should be considered for patients with higher positive airway pressures.

N2  - The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.

N2  - While prolactin is most well known for its role in lactation and suppression of reproduction, its physiological functions are quite diverse. There are many etiologies of hyperprolactinemia, including physiologic as well as pathologic causes. Physiologic causes include pregnancy, lactation, sleep-associated, nipple stimulation and sexual orgasm, chest wall stimulation, or trauma. Stress is also an important physiologic cause of hyperprolactinemia, and its clinical significance is still being explored. This review will provide an overview of prolactin physiology, the role of stress in prolactin secretion, as well as the general clinical approach to hyperprolactinemia.

N2  - Key points: Fetal behavioural state in healthy late gestation pregnancy is significantly affected by maternal position overnight. Maternal left lateral position is the one most frequently adopted at sleep onset. The maternal position at sleep onset is maintained the longest overnight. Fetal state 1F is more common in maternal supine positions overnight. Fetal state 4F is less common in maternal supine sleep positions. Fetal state and maternal sleep position are independently associated with fetal heart rate variability. Maternal sleep position significantly affects fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and affects circadian fetal heart rate patterns. Abstract: Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. Maternal position affects FBS with supine position being associated with an increased likelihood of fetal quiescence consistent with the human fetus adapting to a lower oxygen consuming state. Several studies have now confirmed the association between sleep position and risk of late intrauterine death. We designed this study to observe the effects of maternal sleep positions overnight in healthy late gestation pregnancy. Twenty-nine healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings overnight. Two blinded observers assigned fetal states in 5 min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Maternal position was determined from infrared video recording. Compared to state 2F (active sleep), 4F (active awake-high activity) occurred almost exclusively when the mother was in a left or right lateral position. State 1F (quiet sleep) was more common when the mother was supine [odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11–1.52] and less common on the maternal right side with the left being the referent position (OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.70–0.93). State 4F was more common between 21.00 and 01.00 h than between 01.00 and 07.00 h (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.32–3.47). In each fetal state, maternal position had significant effects on fetal heart rate and measures of FHRV. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal sleep position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are probably fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

N2  - Objectives: This study aimed to identify the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to examine its associations with social and behavioral factors, maternal body mass index (BMI), anemia, and hypertension. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed on data collected from 2345 pregnant women from 16 hospitals in five selected provinces in mainland China. Results: Prevalence of GDM was as follows: overall: 3.7%, pregnant women in the first pregnancy: 3.4%, pregnant women in the second pregnancy: 4.6%. Compared with early pregnancy women, late-stage pregnant women were more likely to have GDM (OR = 4.32, 95% CI (1.82, 10.27)). Compared with 18-25 years old pregnant women, women aged 36-45 years were more likely to have GDM (OR = 3.98, 95% CI (1.41, 11.28). Compared with non-hypertensive patients, hypertensive patients were more likely to have GDM (OR = 6.93, 95% CI (1.28, 37.64)). However, second pregnancy, high maternal BMI, prolonged screen time (TV-viewing time, computer-using time, and mobile-phone using time), insufficient and excessive sleep duration, poor sleep quality, smoking, and secondhand smoke exposure were not significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Conclusions: Women in the second pregnancy do not appear to predict an increased risk for developing GDM than women in the first pregnancy. High-risk groups of GDM included women in their late pregnancy, aged 36-45 years old, and with hypertension. The findings will contribute to an improved understanding of social and behavioral determinants of GDM in Chinese population and contribute to the development of health-prevention promotion interventions to address GDM.

N2  - Alanine transaminase (ALT) is still the most sensitive marker for evaluating the damage of liver cells. ALT measurements may be affected by common nonpathological factors such as gender, age, pregnancy, different physiological conditions, circadian rhythm, diet, drinking, smoking, strenuous exercise, metabolic factors, drugs, blood collection methods, and specimen collection, transmission, and preservation. It is important to emphasize the definition of limits of normal ALT and the influence of the above-mentioned non-pathological factors on its test results.

N2  - Background: Depression during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and subsequent possible adverse effects on the cognitive, emotional and behavioral development of the child. The aim of the study was to identify maternal characteristics associated with poor mental health, in a group of overweight/obese pregnant women in nine European countries, and thus, to contribute to better recognition and intervention for maternal depression. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, baseline data from early pregnancy (< 20 weeks) of the DALI (Vitamin D and Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention) study were analyzed. Maternal mental health was assessed with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Women were classified as having a low (WHO-5 ≤ 50) or high wellbeing. Results.: A total of 735 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of having a low wellbeing was 27.2%, 95% CI [24.0, 30.4]. Multivariate analysis showed independent associations between low wellbeing and European ethnicity, OR = .44, 95% CI [.25,.77], shift work, OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.11, 2.93], insufficient sleep, OR = 3.30, 95% CI [1.96, 5.55], self-efficacy, OR = .95, 95% CI [.92,.98], social support, OR = .94, 95% CI [.90,.99], and pregnancy-related worries (socioeconomic: OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.02, 1.15]; health: OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.11]; relationship: OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.05, 1.31]). Conclusions: Mental health problems are common in European overweight/obese pregnant women. The identified correlates might help in early recognition and subsequent treatment of poor mental health problems during pregnancy. This is important to reduce the unfavorable effects of poor mental health on pregnancy outcomes. Trial registration:ISRCTN70595832 , 02.12.2011.

N2  - Aim/Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological and sleep disorder. Metabolic disorders are known to be related to sleep disorders. We prospectively evaluated whether obesity and its possible cofactors were related to the presence of RLS. Materials and Methods: The study included 143 obese and 94 non-obese individuals. Obese patients had a BMI of 30 and over, while non-obese patients had a BMI lower than 30. Patients with arthritis and pregnancy were excluded but not those with diabetes mellitus. Participants who met diagnostic criteria recommended by the International RLS Study Group were diagnosed as having RLS. Depression, anxiety, daytime sleepiness, insomnia and sleep quality were evaluated in detail. Results: The mean age of obese patients was 40.52 years and that of non-obese patients was 39.76 years. The mean body mass index was 36.77 in the obese group and 25.71 in the non-obese group. The occurrence of depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and insomnia scores were significantly higher in obese individuals. The evaluations of daytime sleepiness, sleep efficiency and sleep latency were not significantly different between the groups. Discussion: Although the presence of RLS was correlated with obesity and vascular risk factors at a significant level, it was also shown that depression, anxiety and insomnia were significantly frequent in obese patients (although not daytime sleepiness). Further studies are needed.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy. However, there is no support system in Japan to prevent sleep disturbances in pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of sleep disturbances during pregnancy on the Subjective Well-Being Inventory (SUBI) scores and Quality of Life (QOL) during the peripartum period. Subjects and methods: Design: Nonrandomized interventional study. Participants: The study included 46 pregnant women who had undergone checkups at an obstetric hospital. Interventions: A support program provided knowledge about sleep changes during pregnancy, support for sleep disturbances, and follow-up of screening for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). One pregnant woman with suspected SDB according to screening results was referred to the support program. Pulse oximetry (PMP-200GplusX pulse oximeter) was used for SDB assessment. The hourly nocturnal peripheral arterial blood oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was calculated by dividing the frequency at which oxygen saturation did not reach the reference value by the duration of the examination. Sleep support is to propose ways to improve pregnant womenś sleep disturbances. The effect of sleep support was assessed with SUBI and QOL questionnaires. Components of the sleep program 1 General knowledge about sleep • Importance of sleep • Sleep architecture: homeostatic maintenance mechanism, biological clock mechanism. • Sleep requirements 2 Education about sleep changes in pregnancy • Hormonally induced sleep changes during pregnancy • First trimester: prominent drowsiness • Second trimester: stable sleep • Third trimester: prolonged sleep latency, increased nocturnal arousals 3 Screening for SDB with a pulse oximeter • Patients with a 3% ODI of less than 0.5 were considered to have no SDB; values of 0.5 to 4.9 were in the normal range, 5 to 14.9 indicated mild SDB, 15 to 29.9 indicated moderate SDB, and a 3% ODI of 30 or more indicated severe SDB. 4 Sleep support using the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire • The sleep questionnaire was completed after program completion and was used to determine the need for sleep support. For example, we advised sleeping in bed for 7-8 hours or more. Results: Of the 46 participants, none had 3% ODI less than 0.5 ; 3% ODIs of 0.5 to 4.9 were found in 25 (54.3%), 5.0 to 14.9 in 16 (34.8%), 15.0 to 29.9 in 4 (8.7%), and more than 30 in 1 (2.2%) participant(s). The outcome measures were the World Health Organization (WHO)-SUBI and WHO-QOL26 scores; these were recorded at baseline and following program completion. A generalized estimation equation was used for the baseline survey. The mean changes in several confounding variables on the WHO-QOL26 were found to be higher on assessment after program completion (P = 0.014) than at baseline. Conclusions: Sleep support during pregnancy improved the QOL. Therefore, the need for sleep support should be reinforced in home-based self-care during pregnancy. SDB screening of pregnant woman without risk factors is necessary.

N2  - Introduction: Respiratory Sleep Disorders (RSD) are often found in pregnant women as a result of weight gain, edema, hormonal changes and hyperemia. This may lead to the narrowing of the upper airways and consequently increase the resistance to the airflow, causing cardio-metabolic changes such as gestational diabetes and hypertention. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) has been associated with preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. The aim of this investigationwas to identify the association between pregnant women with gestational diabetes and OSA. Methods: A prospective study were performed and the data were collected from 20 pregnant women with gestational diabetes. Subject completed a sleep study level III in order to estimate the prevalence of RSD. Results: The sample had the following baseline features: 36.20±4.95 years, 29,87±7,04 gestational weeks, Body Mass Index (BMI) = 28,73±5,60 kg/ m2, 85% with snoring and no relevant daytime sleepiness accessed through the Epworth score. Five participants were diagnosed with OSA: Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) = 14.96 ± 7.32 (events/hour of recording), AHI in supine = 18.98±7.66, minimum oxygen saturation (SpO2) = 88.88±2.27% and mean SpO2 = 93.20±4.24%. None of the women presented secondary complication during pregnancy or delivery associated to OSA. Conclusion: This study suggests OSA is prevalent in pregnant women with gestational diabetes. It was also noted that the higher BMI the higher AHI. Further well-designed studies are warranted to get more consistent data.

To determine the prevalence of sleep disorders WPand to compared with CW. To determine causes that fragment sleep in WP and to compared with CW. Materials and methods: Transverse prospective observational study, performed from July 2013 to December 2015. A specific questionnaire was designed for the data collection of the study, and questionnaires of Oviedo, and Scale Epworth. All the full term expectant mothers who atended the Obstetrics Department as well as CW attending the Gynecology Department were included. Results: 320 PW: 1st Quarter (Q): 106 ; 2nd. Q: 104; 3rd Q: 110 women. CW: 300. PW/CW: 31.6/30.8 years. Satisfaction of sleep: 17.6/18.9 p=0.04. Hypersomnia: 16.8/12.1 p=0.09. Insomnia DSM IV: 3.4/1.9 p=0.09. Restless legs syndrome: 18.2% (1st Q: 14.2 ; 2nd Q: 17.3; 3rd Q: 22.7); PW 23/CW 31.2 p=0.01. Snoring: 6.2/2.4. Apnea: 1.9/2.0 p=0.89. Increase in urinary frequency: 85.6/48.9 p=0.00. Not being able to spin / turn in bed: 36.2/6.5 p=0.00. Report uncomfortable sleeping position: 44.4/ 13.4 p= 0.00. Cramps: 28.4/13.4 p=000. Gastroesophageal reflux: 24.7/3.2 p=0.00. Bruxism: 9.7/25 p=0.00. Awakenings caused by a couple or children: 30/16 p=0.00. Conclusions: Sleep disorders are common in mothers to be with hypersomnia and insomnia. The first cause fragment sleep in PW was increased in urinary frequency, after uncomfortable sleeping position. We believe that it is necessary to know the different causes that fragment the dream of the pregnant woman to treat them and in this way, to achieve a pregnancy and a pleasant sleep.

N2  - Background For many women, pregnancy-related sleep disturbances and pregnancy-related anxiety change as pregnancy progresses and both are associated with lower maternal quality of life and less favorable birth outcomes. Thus, the interplay between these two problems across pregnancy is of interest. In addition, psychological resilience may explain individual differences in this association, as it may promote coping with both sleep disturbances and anxiety, and thereby reduce their mutual effects. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether sleep quality and sleep duration, and changes in sleep are associated with the level of and changes in anxiety during pregnancy. Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of resilience on these associations. Methods At gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34, 532 pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland filled out questionnaires on general sleep quality, sleep duration and pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience was assessed in week 14. Results Parallel process latent growth curve models showed that shorter initial sleep duration predicted a higher initial level of anxiety, and a higher initial anxiety level predicted a faster shortening of sleep duration. Changes in sleep duration and changes in anxiety over the course of pregnancy were not related. The predicted moderating effect of resilience was not found. Conclusions The results suggested that pregnant women reporting anxiety problems should also be screened for sleeping problems, and vice versa, because women who experienced one of these pregnancy-related problems were also at risk of experiencing or developing the other problem.

N2  - Sleep and pregnancy are dynamic processes with unique and evolving physiological substrates. Given the restorative hypothesis of sleep as an anabolic process essential for cellular and tissue regeneration, the largely unexplored role of sleep in gestational physiology and pregnancy outcomes promises to be a fascinating topic. Emerging literature suggests that objectively measured or self-reported short sleep duration may be a risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension, and cesarean delivery. In this review, we discuss obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS), two sleep disorders prevalent in pregnancy. OSA is especially likely in high-risk pregnancy where it is associated with comorbid cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances. We review new data strongly suggesting that OSA is an independent risk factor for GDM and gestational hypertension. It remains to be seen if sleep disruption, whether or not in the context of gestational RLS and gestational OSA, is a modifiable factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Clinicians are encouraged to query sleep symptoms in pregnant women and to have a low threshold to pursue investigations for OSA, including the subjective symptoms of snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime sleepiness, and also medical comorbidities, such as chronic hypertension.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet under-diagnosed and under-investigated. Assessment of sleep quality is clinically relevant in view of the previous findings that sleep disturbances may be associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy or delivery outcomes. We investigated sleep quality during pregnancy focusing on insomnia, nocturnal breathing problems and sleepiness. Materials and methods: A total of 1858 pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were studied three times prospectively during pregnancy. Sleep quality was assessed in early, mid-, and late pregnancy (gestational weeks/gwks 14, 24, and 34, respectively) by using the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ). Responses regarding insomnia symptoms, sleepiness symptoms, and breathing problems were dichotomized to represent clinically significant problems. To analyze the changes in sleep variables between the pregnancy stages, McNemar's test was used to compare dichotomous variables. Results: Each insomnia symptom type (difficulties falling asleep, number of nocturnal awakenings per week and per night, and too early morning awakenings) increased from early pregnancy to late pregnancy (all p values < 0,001). Snoring increased across pregnancy (p < 0,001). Witnessed apneas remained rare. General sleep quality level remained the same during early and mid-pregnancy, but decreased towards late pregnancy (p < 0,001). Women also took more naps in early and late pregnancy comparing to mid-pregnancy (p < 0,001). Morning and daytime tiredness decreased from early to mid pregnancy (morning tiredness p < 0,05, daytime tiredness p < 0,001) and also from early to late pregnancy (morning tiredness p < 0,001, daytime tiredness p < 0,05). Conclusions: Our study is in keeping with previous findings that general sleep quality declines as pregnancy proceeds. Using a detailed sleep questionnaire, we further suggest that sleep onset insomnia, sleep maintenance insomnia, and snoring worsened as pregnancy proceeded. However, no increase in negative daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity against pregnancy-related sleep impairment.

N2  - This review aims to evaluate the performance of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening questionnaires during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy was 26.7% (95%CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I2 = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.45, 0.83; I2 = 78.65%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I2 = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was performed in early pregnancy (≤20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk pregnancy (0.44). Performance of ESS was poor with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.33, 0.56; I2 = 32.8%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I2 = 81.55%), respectively. In conclusion, BQ and ESS showed poor performance during pregnancy, hence a new OSA screening questionnaire is needed. Registration: PROSPERO registration CRD42015025848.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep habits (SH) are dependent on biology, age, culture and socio-economic environment. Knowledge of SH of a population is crucial to precociously identify pathology and prevent complications. Objective: To characterize the sleep habits of a Portuguese sample of infants up to six months of age. Materials and methods: Observational, descriptive and longitudinal study. Newborns in a maternity of a Portuguese tertiary hospital were randomly assigned during six months; informed consent from the mothers was obtained. The same questionnaire about sleep habits in the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th month of age of their children was answered by telephone or e-mail. Results: A total of 335 infants (50,2% boys) out of 470 newborns selected were included, those inwhich the mothers answered to at least 3 of the 4 questionnaires. Most infants sleep in their own bed in their parents room until 6 months (1;2;4;6mth: 72,2%;77,3%;72,5%;59,1%), but a significant number sleep in their own room(1;2;4;6mth: 9%;5,1%;13,7%;28,4%) or in their parents bed (1;2;4;6mth: 8,7%;8,7%;7,2%;4,8%). Median duration of nocturnal sleep was similar up to six months of age (nine to ten hours), as well as the median time to get asleep (about 15 minutes). Median duration of daytime sleep decreased with age (1;2;4;6mth: 8 h;6 h;5 h;4 h), as well as the number of naps (1;2;4;6mth: 4;3;3;2). Median duration of naps was similar (1,5-2 hours). Way to fall asleep: with breast/bottle feeding (1;2;4;6mth: 46%;37,6%;31,9%;25,7%), on lap (1;2;4;6mth: 57%;48,4%; 33,7%;28,4%), on parents' bed/couch (1;2;4;6mth: 32,6%;27,2%;20,3%;19,1%), in the presence of parents (1;2;4;6mth: 54%;27,8%;43,3%;11,3%), with light (1;2;4;6mth: 31,6%; 27,8%;20,3%;11,3%), with presence light (1;2;4;6mth: 55,2%;56,4%;55,2%; 58,8%) with an object (1;2;4;6mth: 21,2%;31%;41,8%;43,9%), with pacifier (1;2;4;6mth: 42,7%;58,5%;51%;49,9%), with music (1;2;4;6mth: 29,6%; 30,4%;19,7%;20,3%), listening stories/songs (1;2;4;6mth: 24,2%;22,1%; 20,3%;21,8%), with TV (1;2;4;6mth: 19,1%;16,4%;11,3%;10,1%), on lap (1;2;4;6mth: 20,9%;19,4%;10,4%;9,3%) - these last two habits were significantly different over time (p< 0,001). Nocturnal awakenings were frequent, decreasing with age (1;2;4;6mth: 83%;77,6%;69,6%;54,9%). How they fall asleep after a night awakening: with breast/bottle feeding (1;2;4;6mth 50,4%;37,9%;29,9%;20,3%), on lap (1;2;4;6mth: 34,4%;28,4%; 14,6%;12,2%) - these two habits were significantly different over time (p< 0,001) - alone (1;2;4;6mth: 30,7%;40,3%;38,5%;35,8%), in the presence of parents (1;2;4;6mth: 48,7%;37,9%;34%;27,5%), with light (1;2;4; 6mth: 10,7%;4,8%;6%;3,9%), with presence light (1;2;4;6mth: 51,3%; 56,1%;41,2%;34,3%). About a third of mothers were worried about their children's sleep (1;2;4;6mth: 37,3%;32,3%;36,2%;31,1%). Conclusions: Sleep habits changed significantly in the first months of life. Dependence on parents to sleep was very frequent, although diminishing with age. It was possible to identify potentially deleterious habits for adequate sleep hygiene, already present very early. To prevent sleep disorders, such as behavioral insomnia, it is important to intervene very early, ideally during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep and epilepsy are interrelated. Sleep and its disorders play important role in management of patients with epilepsy (PWE). Knowledge of associated features could lead to better understanding of this important link. Our aim was assessing the sleep structure of PWE in relation to pregnancy and perinatal complications (PPC) reported by history. Materials and methods: PWE of age 18 and above underwent a detailed questionnaire-based evaluation at epilepsy and sleep disorders clinics and standard polysomnography(PSG). Parameters related to sleep were obtained based on standardized PSG scoring procedure. T-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Eighty patients were included in this analysis. Of which 21 (35.6%) reported PPCs by history. We found quite stable differences of objective sleep parameters in favor of PWE without PPCs. Statistically significant PSG findings were as follows (no PPC/PPC): wake after sleep onset (mins)e 60.7/99, total sleep time (mins)e442.5/396.2, sleep efficiency (%)e87.7/ 80.2, number of awakeningse9.7/14.4, NREM2 latency (mins)e22.3/43.6, NREM3 latencye39.8/84.8, REM-sleep percentage from total sleepe14.6/ 9.6 (p< 0.05 for all comparisons). There were no differences in seizure frequency and body-mass index in both groups. Conclusions: We found a clear difference in sleep structure of PWE with and without PPCs. PWE reporting PPCs have overall worse sleep pattern, lesser amount of REM-sleep, and higher percentage of wake during sleep and increased number of awakenings. It is possible that PPCs in medical history may play a role in formation of intrinsic sleep mechanisms later on or in development of co-morbid sleep disorders in adult PWE.

N2  - Introduction: Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor sleep disorder characterized by an urge to move, that occurs or worsens at rest, more towards evening and is relieved by activity. The prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is 2-3 times more than in the general population, affecting about 15-25% of pregnant women. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of RLS in pregnancy in South Indian population and its association with serum ferritin levels. Materials and methods: In a prospective study from February to August 2016, 325 pregnant women were enrolled. Subjects were grouped as RLS positive (49 subjects) and controls (276) based on the one-on-one interview and were followed 6 months later by telephonic interview. Results: The subjects' mean agewas 25.15 ± 3.86 years and ranged from 18 to 38 years. The mean BMI of the study populationwas 26.22 ± 5.31 kg/m2 and the mean gestational agewas 30.21 ± 8.4 weeks. The prevalence of RLS was 15.1% (49 subjects). The distribution of age, BMI, comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension were similar in the two groups. The number of hours of sleep was significantly less in the RLS positive group (7.93 Vs 7.5 hours; p value=0.017). Of the 49 RLS positive subjects, 3, 6 and 40 subjects were in their first, second and third trimester of pregnancy respectively. Thirty RLS positive women were primigravida. The levels of haemoglobin (mean value of 11.5 ± 1.6 versus 11.4± 1.3 gm/dl; p value =0.73), oral iron supplements (mean value of 69.4± 43.3 versus 63.3 ± 37.4 mg of elemental iron per day; p value= 0.37) and serum ferritin (mean value of 37.6 ±36.0 versus 36.2 71.8 mcg/L) and baby's birthweight ( 2.67±0.6 versus 2.86± 0.6 kilograms) did not differ significantly between the RLS positive and control groups. Forty-five women reported complete resolution of RLS symptoms, while 2 women had persistent RLS symptoms, six months after delivery. Two women were lost to follow up. Conclusions: The prevalence of RLS in Indian pregnant women is 15.5%. The RLS was undiagnosed in this population previously. RLS was more prevalent in the third trimester of pregnancy. Neither multiparity or low serum hemoglobin or ferritin were associated with RLS in pregnancy. The presence of RLS did not adversely affect the outcome of pregnancy or the baby's birthweight.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disruptions during pregnancy and post-partum lactation period is an emerging health concern. To develop an animal model for studies on peri-partum sleep disorders, sleep patterns in female rats during pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning, were assessed and associated adaptive changes in their anxiety were examined. Materials and methods: Sleep-wakefulness (S-W) was measured objectively taking electroencephalogram(EEG) and electromyogram(EMG). These electrodes were surgically implanted under anaesthesia in nulliparous femaleWistar rats maintained in standard laboratory conditionswith food and water given ad libitum. After post-surgical recovery, three control recordings of S-W were taken for 24 h before the animals were kept for mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, S-W recordings were acquired during different days of pregnancy, post-partum lactation/nursing days, and also after weaning. Their anxiety levels were tested in the elevated plus maze. Results: The results showed an increase in sleep during pregnancy, primarily due to an increase in light non-REM sleep (S1) during dark period. After parturition, there was a decrease in sleep, especially during daytime, with an increased number of short duration S1 episodes. It resulted in increased time in waking with fragmentation of sleep and an increase in non-REM sleep delta power. Increased anxiety was observed during third trimester of pregnancy and gradual reversal of it after parturition. Conclusions: This study provided the first longitudinal comprehensive assessment of S-Wduring pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning in an animal model, along with concomitant recording of anxiety levels. The new findings include post-partum decrease in daytime sleep, with short duration S1 episodes. It not only resulted in increased time in waking, but also in fragmentation of sleep. Sleep homeostatic drive during post-partum period amidst fragmented sleep is evident from the increase in the delta power which is one of the key finding in this study. Observed increase in sleep during pregnancy in rats also clarifies some of the earlier reports. Simultaneous behavioural recording, which showed increased anxiety during the third trimester of pregnancy and its gradual reversal after parturition, are interesting observations of this study. The study provides an animal model for drug trials and studies on sleep disorders during peri-partum window.

N2  - Sleep in fetus and neonates of altricial species undergo age-specific changes which are indicative of developmental milestones. Moreover, maternal sleep is marked by reduced quality especially during last trimester of pregnancy even during normal pregnancy. Further disruptions in sleep during pregnancy adversely affect the neuropsychological development of the offspring that is illustrated by strictly controlled animal experiments. Sleep deprivation during late pregnancy adversely affects fetal neural networks evident from depression like symptoms and expression of hyperactivity and increased risk-taking behaviour during adolescence. Litters born to sleep deprived dams had lower body weights at birth. The ontogenetic profiles of sleep-wakefulness in these neonates provided further evidences for an altered neural development. Newborns of rapid eye movement sleep deprived dams had higher percentage of active sleep (AS) form postnatal days 1-21, and reduced latency to AS during day 15 and 21. Sleep-wake cycles of lesser frequency and longer duration in comparison to control pups indicated maturational delay in the sleep-wake neural networks. The changes in sleep-wakefulness during initial development in the neonates from other prenatally stressed conditions are compared. Examination of altered sleep-wake patterns during early postnatal window may provide crucial information about abnormal neural development in the offspring.

N2  - Bariatric surgery is an effective therapy for obesity but is associated with long-term complications such as dumping syndromes and nutritional deficiencies. We report a case of a 26-year-old caucasian female, with history of morbid obesity and gestational diabetes (GDM), who became pregnant 4 months after Roux-en-Y bypass surgery. She developed GDM during subsequent pregnancy, which was initially managed with metformin and insulin. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia causing sleep disturbance and daytime somnolence occured at 19 weeks of pregnancy (19/40). Treatment with rapid-acting carbohydrates precipitated further hypoglycaemia. Laboratory investigations confirmed hypoglycaemia at 2.2 mmol/L with appropriately low insulin and C-peptide, intact HPA axis and negative IgG insulin antibodies. The patient was seen regularly by the bariatric dietetic team but concerns about compliance persisted. A FreeStyle Libre system was used from 21/40 enabling the patient a real-time feedback of changes in interstitial glucose following high or low GI index food intake. The patient declined a trial of acarbose but consented to an intraveneous dextrose infusion overnight resulting in improvement but not complete abolishment of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemias subsided at 34/40 and metformin and insulin had to be re-introduced due to high post-prandial blood glucose readings. An emergency C-section was indicated at 35 + 1/40 and a small-for-gestational-age female was delivered. There have been no further episodes of hypoglycaemia following delivery. This case illustrates challenges in the management of pregnancy following bariatric surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first use of FreeStyle Libre in dumping syndrome in pregnancy following bariatric surgery with troublesome nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

N2  - Introduction: A limited number of studies have examined the factors associated with sleep quality among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate sleep quality and to determine the associations between sleep quality and demographic and healthrelated characteristics, anemia, fatigue and physical activity in Turkish patients with MS. Materials and methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. A total of 105 patients with MS attending a neurology outpatient clinic in Ankara, Turkey were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with MS for at least one month, those who were relaps-free for the past 30 days and able to communicate in Turkish. Exclusion criteria were severe comorbidity, cognitive impairment, major psychiatric disorder, alcoholism, previously diagnosed sleep disorders, pregnancy, lactation, working in the night shift, and clinically unstable condition. The sample included 102 patients (67.6% female). The study was approved by the Hospital Ethical Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data were collected by an information form, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F) and the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-S). Anemia was evaluated by measuring hemoglobin levels. Data analysis were performed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Spearman's correlation coefficients and logistic regression analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the patients was 36.93 ± 10.50 years (range= 19-75), and the median disease duration was 60 years (range= 1-300). Ninety patients (88.2%) had relapsing remitting MS. The mean global PSQI score was 5.98 ± 3.94, and 52.0% of the participants had poor sleep quality. Approximately 20.0% of the patients had anemia. The global PSQI scores were higher in patients who never smoked or who quit smoking (z = -2.24; p = 0.025), those who had a comorbidity (z = -2.34; p = 0.019), those who had poor self-rated health (z = -2.54; p = 0.011) and patients with low levels of physical activity (z = -2.49; p = 0.013). There were a positive correlation between the global PSQI score and the VAS-F fatigue subscale score (r = 0.39; p < 0.001). The global PSQI score was negatively correlated with the VAS-F energy subscale score (r = -0.32; p = 0.001) and the total IPAQ-S score (r = -0.32; p = 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the only factor associated with poor sleep quality was a higher VAS-F fatigue score (adjusted Odds Ratio, 1.283; 95% confidence interval, 1.031-1.596), after controlling for potential risk factors. Conclusions: The results of the study indicated that poor sleep quality was common in patients with MS. Poor sleep quality was also associated with fatigue among patients with MS. A better understanding of risk factors related to sleep quality may facilitate appropriate interventions that improve health outcomes in this population.

N2  - Introduction: Prematurely born children have been reported to be at increased risk of sleep problems. The aim of this study was to explore if prenatal or neonatal factors can predict sleep problems at age 11 years in children born extremely premature (EP). Materials and methods: A prospective observational study of all infants who were born EP (gestational age < 28 weeks or birth weight < 1000 g) Norway in 1999 and 2000. Prenatal and neonatal data, such as information about pregnancy complications, birth method, Apgar score, born small for gestational age (SGA), number of days on respirator, steroids for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neonatal cerebral hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and more, were collected by all Norwegian obstetric and pediatric departments. Parental questionnaire mapped current sleep problems and sleep habits when the children were 11 years old. Results: Smoking in pregnancy predicted snoring (OR 4.3) and neonatal cerebral hemorrhage and being SGA at birth predicted difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings (OR 2.2 and 2.3). No prenatal or neonatal factors predicted sleep duration less than recommended or daytime sleepiness. Of 231 of 372 eligible children, 28% snored, 27% had difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings, 17% suffered from daytime sleepiness and 25% had shorter sleep duration than recommended (< 9 hours). Conclusions: Of numerous relevant exposures during the prenatal and neonatal period, only smoking during pregnancy, being born SGA and cerebral hemorrhage predicted sleep problems at 11 years of age.

N2  - Introduction: The aims of this study were to assess the effectiveness of pTESHF in improving sleep quality vs controls (sham), and pTESLF improving sleep quality over pTESHF. The central hypothesis was pTESLF would have a more profound effect on sleep quality. Materials and methods: Healthy volunteers with a pre-screening PSQI ≥ 5 were recruited. Exclusion criteria were: diagnosed sleep disorder, actively medicated for sleep difficulties, neurological or psychiatric disorder, cranial or facial implants, recent head trauma/concussion, recent hospitalization, high blood pressure, pregnancy, diabetes. pTES treatment was administered using a novel transdermal electrical neuromodulation device with adhesive electrodes over the right temple (trigeminal nerve) and the base of the neck (cervical nerve). Subjects self-treated with pTESHF (3-11 kHz, biphasic pulse, 5-7 mA), pTESLF (0.5-0.75 kHz, biphasic pulse, < 5 mA) or sham each night before retiring. Blinding of subjects was accomplished with a sham mode which provided a 30 sec ramp up period to the steady state current and then secured. The evaluators were also blinded. Subjects wore actigraph watches with event markers to capture bedtime and morning waking. Nightly measures included: number of wakeups after bedtime, waking time after sleep onset (WASO), and % time awake. A total of 27 subjects were enrolled (2 dismissed for failure to comply). The remaining 25 subjects were randomized into two groups according to week in a crossover design: Week 1: pTESHF (n = 15) or sham (n = 10) Week 2: pTESLF (n = 12) or pTESHF (n = 13) Results: There were no significant differences noted in baseline group demographics. 93% of the subjects were male, average age 32 years, 79% Caucasian, 11% Black, 7% Asian and 4% Hispanic. Baseline PSQI 9.56 ± 2.55 (mean ± sd). There were no significant inter-week differences between subjects in the treatment group. Actigraphy data suggest improvements in sleep quality of pTESHF over controls. Conclusions: Based on the evidence presented here, non-invasive neuromodulation of the trigeminal and cervical neural pathways with Neuros can offer a chemical-free method of regulating autonomic arousal to improve sleep quality.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep apnoea in pregnancy is known to adversely affect birth outcomes. Whether in utero exposure to maternal sleep apnoea is associated with long-term childhood consequences is unknown. Materials and methods: Population-based longitudinal study of singleton infants born during 2002 to 2012 was conducted using linked birth, hospital, death, developmental, and educational records from New South Wales, Australia. Maternal sleep apnoea during pregnancy was identified from hospital records. Outcomes were mortality and hospitalisations up to age 6, developmental vulnerability in the 1st year of school (aged 5-6), and performance on standardised tests in the 3rd year of school (aged 7-9). Cox proportional hazards and modified Poisson regression models were used to calculate hazard and risk ratios for outcomes in children exposed to maternal apnoea compared to those not exposed. Results: 209 of 626,188 singleton infants were exposed to maternal sleep apnoea. Maternal apnoea was not significantly associated with mortality (Fisher's exact p=0.48), developmental vulnerability (adjusted RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.75-2.21), special needs status (1.58; 0.61-4.07), or low numeracy test scores (1.03; 0.63-1.67) but was associated with low reading test scores (1.55; 1.08-2.23). Maternal apnoea significantly increased hospitalisations in the 1st year of life (adjusted HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.40-2.34) and between the 1st and 6th birthdays (1.41; 1.14-1.75). This is partly due to admissions for suspected paediatric sleep apnoea. Conclusions: Maternal sleep apnoea during pregnancy is associated with poorer childhood health. Its impact on developmental and cognitive outcomes warrants further investigation.

N2  - Research Objectives: To describe the sleep experiences of adults living with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Qualitative descriptive inquiry via semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. A cyclical method of coding and thematic analysis was used to produce themes. Setting: On-site interviews were conducted at a rehabilitation center with community-dwelling adult TBI survivors. Participants: 16 participants were recruited via purposive sampling. All participants had completed an inpatient stay at a TBI Model System (TBIMS) affiliated rehabilitation center. Saturation was achieved at 12 transcripts. Inclusion criteria: 1) moderate-severe TBI; 2) appropriate cognition and ability to communicate; 3) between ages 18 to 50; and 4) 1 to 4 years postinjury. Exclusion criteria: 1) history of sleep disturbance or disorder prior to the TBI; 2) non-English speaking; and/or 3) pregnant. The final sample consisted of predominately Caucasian men; average age was 32.4 years (SD=9.9); average length of years post-injury was 2.6 years (SD=.89). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Themes. Results: Participants described frustration with sleep problems or fatigue and a lack of screening and resources. Participants particularly desired management strategies beyond rehabilitation discharge. Five central themes with subthemes were identified: 1) problems with sleep; 2) impact of sleep and fatigue on relationships and work; 3) learning to manage sleep problems; 4) coping with sleep problems; and 5) desire for sleep-related resources. Conclusions: Focused support for coping and management strategies specific to sleep, during and after inpatient rehabilitation, may aid recovery. Future research may include dyad research to broaden the description of sleep experiences and aid in development or modification of treatments tailored to the needs of survivors of TBI.

N2  - Objective Qualitative interviews with mothers of babies at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) were carried out to understand their views and decision-making process on the infant sleep environment and safe sleep messages. Design and setting Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted between February and November 2014 in deprived areas of Bristol, UK. Mothers were asked about their decision-making for the infant sleep environment and safe sleep messages including infant sleep position, co-sleeping, smoking, dummy use, feeding and disrupted routines. The interviews were transcribed, coded and thematic analysis carried out. Participants Participants were invited based on an algorithm developed in a previous SIDS case control study that identified an increased risk of SIDS from four demographic characteristics: young maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, three or more children, and a measure of deprivation. The presence of three, or more characteristics led to being invited to take part in the qualitative study. results Factors influencing mothers’ adherence to the safe sleep messages included previous experience and the credibility of the advice given. They described disrupted routines that led to risky scenarios with a belief that occasional risks were acceptable. Where circumstances made following the advice more difficult they found alternative strategies to reduce the risk, including the use of movement monitors, regular checking and a belief that lighter maternal sleep in the presence of a baby was protective. conclusions Safer sleep messages should be tailored to fit with the lived realities of mothers, especially those at higher risk. The traditional list of ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’ was not well accepted by this group. Interventions that seek to influence this higher-risk group should acknowledge mothers’ own protective instincts and consider their beliefs and understanding behind the safer sleep messages if they are to be effective and encourage this group to change.

N2  - This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify “red flag symptoms” suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.

N2  - Objectives To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O&NS) biomarkers at the end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers and pregnancy-related outcome variables. Methods We measured plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal depression and non-pregnant controls. Results Pregnancy is accompanied by significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased O&NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms). Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered –SH, TRAP and zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased O&NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g. hyperpigmentation, labor duration, caesarian section, cord length, breast milk flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics. Conclusions Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O&NS, lowered antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O&NS at the end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby.

N2  - The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has increased in most countries the last decades. Considering this in a simplistic way, we can say that obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Moreover, the environment from conception to childhood could influence the child’s future health. The first 1000 days of life start with woman’s pregnancy, and offer a unique window of opportunity to contribute to obesity prevention. In light of the actual literature, the aim of our article is to discuss a proposal of 10 good practices to minimize obesity in the first 1000 days emerging from published science. (1) Both the mother’s and the father’s behaviors are important. A balanced diet with appropriate fat and protein intake, and favoring fruits and vegetables, is recommended for both parents during the conception period and pregnancy. Furthermore, overweight/obese women who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their weight before conception. (2) During pregnancy, at birth, and during early life, body composition measurements are crucial to monitor the baby’s growth. (3) Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended at the beginning of life until six months of age. (4) Four to six months of age is the optimal window to introduce complementary feeding. Until one year of age, breast milk or follow-on/commercial formula is the main recommended feeding source, and cow’s milk should be avoided until one year of age. (5) Fruit and vegetable introduction should begin early. Daily variety, diversity in a meal, and repeated exposure to the food, up to eight times, are efficient strategies to increase acceptance of food not well accepted at first. There is no need to add sugar, salt, or sugary fluids to the diet. (6) Respect the child’s appetite and avoid coercive “clean your plate” feeding practices. Adapt the portion of food and don’t use food as reward for good behavior. (7) Limit animal protein intake in early life to reduce the risk of an early adiposity rebound. Growing-up milk for children between one and three years of age should be preferred to cow’s milk, in order to limit intake and meet essential fatty acid and iron needs. (8) The intake of adequate fat containing essential fatty acids should be promoted. (9) Parents should be role models when feeding, with TV and other screens turned-off during meals. (10) Preventive interventions consisting of promoting physical activity and sufficient time dedicated to sleep should be employed. In fact, short sleep duration may be associated with increased risk of developing obesity. Based on literature reviews, and given the suggestions described in this manuscript, concerted public health efforts are needed to achieve the healthy objectives for obesity and nutrition, and to fight the childhood obesity epidemic.

N2  - Background Excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems are likely to emerge from the complex interplay of various factors. Aims To investigate the role of infant (e.g., temperament), maternal (e.g., anxiety and depressive disorders), and familial (e.g., social support) factors as potential precursors of infant regulatory problems. Study Design Prospective-longitudinal study. Subjects 286 mother-infant dyads were investigated from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum via questionnaires and interviews. Outcome measures Regulatory problems at 2, 4 and 16 months postpartum assessed by standardized diagnostic interviews. Results Fussy infant temperament and maternal anxiety disorders were associated with excessive infant crying (OR=1.16, 95%CI:1.05-1.29, OR=3.28, 95%CI:1.16-9.26) and feeding problems (OR=1.05, 95%CI:1.01-1.11, OR=2.27, 95%CI:1.36-3.80) whereas maternal depressive disorders were associated with infant sleeping problems (OR=2.55, 95%CI:1.06-6.11). Moreover, high maternal age (OR=0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.98) was associated with a lower risk for excessive crying and being a single mother (OR=0.16, 95%CI:0.03-0.73) and cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions (OR: 0.59, 95%CI:0.36-0.96) was associated with a lower risk for sleeping problems. Conclusion Excessive infant crying and feeding problems may be related to interactional deficits of anxious mothers who perceive their infants as “difficult” during soothing or feeding situations. Sleeping problems may be transmitted already during pregnancy by an altered sleep-wake-rhythm of mothers with a history of depression or by a genetic predisposition. Therapeutic interventions should focus on maternal anxiety and depression, behavior management techniques to cope with difficult situations with “fussy” infants and potential protective factors (e.g. favorable maternal emotion regulation) to address crying, feeding and sleeping problems.

N2  - After childbirth, women may develop symptoms of depression with the associated sleep disturbances. This study assessed the relationship between insomnia and both depression symptoms and blood estradiol levels in women during the early postpartum period. 84 patients were assessed 24–48 h after labor. The main assessment methods were the following psychometric scales: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Serum estradiol levels were measured using ELISA assay. Women who developed postpartum insomnia significantly more often reported insomnia during pregnancy (P = 0.001), were more likely to have suffered from depression in the past (P = 0.007) and had significantly higher BDI (P = 0.002) and EPDS (P = 0.048) scores. Our study demonstrated no significant association between Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and postpartum insomnia. The groups of women with and without postpartum RLS showed no significant differences in the incidence of postpartum insomnia. No significant differences in estradiol levels were observed in women with and without postpartum insomnia. The study showed the following factors to play a major role in development of postpartum insomnia: an increase in Beck Depression Inventory score, a history of depression and a history of insomnia during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Rare disorders such as narcolepsy require casting a broad net to identify potential patients for clinical trials. The present report presents the results of an internet based pre-selection recruitment methodology to accomplish this. A collaboration between Flamel Ireland/ Avadel Ireland and Link2Trials used this approach to identify type 1 narcolepsy patients for potential eligibility for a clinical trial. Materials and methods: The link to the pre-selection website was available via internet search engines as well as social media websites. The link had potential participants respond to 11 questions regarding their eligibility for the trial. A unique aspect of this study is that the previous use of sodium oxybate was an exclusion criteria. Thus the link did not merely identify narcolepsy subjects, but rather narcolepsy patients with cataplexy without a negative history of sodium oxybate use. Results: 358 people successfully completed the 11 questions online. Of those, 88 (24.5%) were eligible and were referred on to the nearest investigative site. The main reasons for exclusion were narcolepsy without cataplexy (n=120) and comorbid medical/sleep disorder (n=103). Other exclusion reasons included past sodium oxybate use (n=96), no narcolepsy diagnosis (n=79), working nights or shift work (n=35), driving for a living (n=24), not willing to discontinue contraindicated medication (eg. anticataplexy medication) (n=19), not willing to discontinue alcohol (n=13), not meeting excessive daytime sleepiness requirements (n=8), pregnancy/ breastfeeding (n=5) and not willing to use electronic diary (n=1). Conclusions: The use of an internet based pre-selection system, even for rare conditions such as type 1 narcolepsy was shown to be an effective screening method to identify potential subjects meeting specific entry criteria. For this study, 24.5% of individuals who completed the survey were eligible for clinical trial participation.

N2  - Introduction: Postpartum is a vulnerable period in terms of mental problems. Herbal medicine may be an effective intervention for improving the mothers’ mental health.This study was performed with aim to determine the effect of Lavender cream with or without footbath on anxiety, stress and depression. Methods: This randomized clinical controlled trial was conducted on 141 women aged 18-40 years with first to three pregnancies at 25-28 weeks of pregnancy in Tabriz-Iran during 2013-2014. The subjects were placed in three groups; receiving Lavender cream and footbath, Lavender cream, and placebo. Immediately after delivery, women applied locally 2 gr (two segments of hand finger) cream (Lavender or placebo) to the legs, 1.5 hours before sleep, for 6 weeks. The group of footbath immersed their legs in warm water. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks after delivery using DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, stress scales-21). Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 14) and One-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: There was no significant difference between the three groups in terms of anxiety, depression and stress before intervention. There was significant difference between the three groups in terms of anxiety (P<0.001), stress (P<0.001) and depression (P<0.001) at 6th week postpartum; Mann-Whitney U test showed statistically significant difference between two intervention groups with the placebo group (P<0.05), but no significant difference was found between two intervention groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Lavender cream with or without footbath can decrease stress, anxiety and depression of women at postpartum period.

N2  - Objective: We examined the influence of self-reported sex and menstrual bleeding status on symptom profiles and burden in people living with HIV (PLWH) using combination antriretroviral therapy (cART) for the following reasons: - although cART has allowed PLWH to live well past midlife with a chronic illness, they are more likely to be affected by comorbid conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Cook et al, 2011) - the prevalence of HIV in women has escalated in the US such that sex and gender differences in disease progression, complications and treatment outcomes are emerging, with women now facing a 3-year higher mortality rate vs men with HIV (CDC Report, 2015) - PLWH report fatigue, depression, poor sleep and difficulty concentrating as the most frequent and debilitating HIV symptoms, but much of the research is dated, restricted to single site studies, based on old symptom indices and focused mostly on men (The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort C. 2008). Design:A cross-sectional study was conducted that included both a sex-based analysis of previously reported symptom characteristics of 1373 respondents to an anonymous, online survey (Schnall et al, under review) and a follow-up, on-line survey of menstrual bleeding status in eligible females from the respondent pool. Eligibility for the parent survey included 18 yrs of age or older, a diagnosis of HIV and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), experiencing symptoms in the last 4 weeks, not currently pregnant, resident of the US, able to read and respond electronically in English, and willing to participate in an online survey. A modified version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment scale was used to measure 27 HIV-associated symptoms (yes/no) and burden (difficulty with day-to-day activites in the last 30 days) on a scale from 0-no impact to 4 - very much. (Auizerat et al, 2009). For the sex-based analysis, only data were used from respondents with concordant sex at birth and current gender identity. For the follow-up female survey, respondents had to be willing to be re-contacted and not currently pregnant. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations and linear mixed models were used to characterize the role of sex and menstrual status as predictors of HIV symptom burden in PLWH. Results: There were 957 males and 385 females who reported concordant sex at birth and gender identity. Females were more likely to be Black (46% vs 20%, p= <0.01), heterosexual (91% vs 4%, p=<.01), and with less education and lower income (p=<0.01) compared to males. Although younger on average (47-11 yrs vs 50-12 yrs, p=<0.01), females were heavier (BMI=33-9 vs 28-5, p=<0.01) and reported a longer duration of HIV infection (16-9 yrs vs 14-10yrs, p=0.05) and more comorbid conditions (1.06-1 vs 0.86-0.9, p=<0.01). In both men and women, fatigue, muscle aches/pains and depression were the most common of the 27 HIV symptoms assessed, but in females, mean symptom burden scores were higher (worse) for fatigue, muscle aches/pains, shortness of breath, nausea and thirst, after adjusting for covariates (p=-0.05). In the follow-up online female survey (n=222), those reporting amenorrhea due to natural menopause or hysterectomy (= menopause group; n=104) did not differ on BMI or by race, sexual orientation, income/eduation or smoking features compared to those still menstruating at least once in the past 11 months (= menstruating group; n=118), but the menopause group was older (54-7 vs 39-9 yrs, p=<.01) with longer duration of HIV (18-8 vs 13-9 yrs, p=<0.1) and more comorbid conditions (1.3-1 vs .65-.9, p=<.01). After adjusting for these covariates, the estimate of difference in burden scores remained higher for fatigue (p=0.03), difficulty falling asleep (p=.04) and muscle aches and pains (p=.05) in the menopause group. Conclusion: Two of the most common symptoms in PLWH - fatigue and muscle aches/pains - invoke additional burden in women compared to men. This symptom burden may be exacerbated once menses ceases, suggesting a greater role for menopause management in women with HIV.

N2  - Introduction: Internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors are of increasing public health concern because of the numerous consequences for the individual and the whole society. Twin studies have revealed substantial genetic and environmental infu-ences on children's behavior, while examining birth weight difference could be helpful to identify the specifc contribution of various non-shared prenatal environmental factors on later psychological development. Materials and Methods: As part of the Twins and Multiple Births Association (TAMBA) Heritability Study, we recruited mothers of twins aged 18 months to 5 years registered with TAMBA, a volunteer-based association in the United Kingdom. Nine-hundred and sixty twins (480 pairs) were included in this analysis. Twins' mothers answered questions relative to their pregnancy and their twins' characteristics, and completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5-5. This widely used tool gives information regarding internalizing and externalizing problems, identifying the more challenging areas for each child. The association between absolute birth weight difference and each CBCL scale's score difference was analysed by means of a multiple linear regression. Expected mean CBCL score differences were calculated. Results: In monozygotic and dizygotic twins analyzed together, statistically and clinically signifcant associations were found between intrapair birth weight difference and difference in total score and sleep problems scores. These results were repeated in monozygotic twins analysed alone. In addition, the associations of birth weight difference with differ-ence in internalizing problem, emotional reactiveness and somatic complaints were statistically and clinically signifcant in monozy-gotic twins. No signifcant results were observed in dizygotic twins when analyzed as a separate group. Conclusions: The results of the present study show that, with increasing absolute birth weight difference, the intrapair difference in total problems, internalizing be-haviors and sleep problems increases, with smaller twins being at major risk of behavior problems. Moreover, results in monozygotic twins suggest a causal association between birth weight and behavior development, as genetic and common environmental infuences are automatically controlled for in this type of analysis.

N2  - On the basis of research evidence (level A), postpartum depression and anxiety, also known as postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, affects 10% to 25% of mothers, making it the most common underdiagnosed obstetric complication. However, women of lower socioeconomic status can have ongoing depressive symptoms beyond the initial postpartum year. (1) On the basis of research evidence (level A), postpartum depression can severely threaten the mother-child relationship in terms of the ability to form attachments and bonds. This in turn can lead to developmental delays, which can potentially result in impaired cognitive, social, and behavioral development. (11)(12) On the basis of research evidence (level A), mothers who experience depression are less likely to integrate health care advice from their pediatric providers, which include important topics such as sleep safety and car seat and other home safety anticipatory guidance. (15) On the basis of research evidence (level A), the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians screen mothers at the infant's 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-month well-child visits. (1) On the basis of research evidence (level B), the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women, with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up. (31) On the basis of research evidence (level A), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, maternal depression screening is covered under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment benefit. (32) On the basis of research evidence (level A), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a free, validated screening instrument that can be easily integrated within the clinical setting. A score of at least 10 constitutes a positive finding and raises concern for depressive illness in the mother. (22) On the basis of research evidence (level A), psychotherapy is effective for the treatment of postpartum depression and is a good start in the treatment plan. (25) On the basis of research evidence (level A), if psychotherapy is unavailable or if symptoms are severe, then medications need to be considered. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Sertraline is the best option because of low concentrations in breast milk and a good safety profile during pregnancy. (25).

N2  - We examined the effect of chronic prenatal alcohol exposure on certain neuronal systems involved with the sleep-wake cycle of C57BL/6J mice exposed to prenatal alcohol once they had reached 56 days post-natal. Pregnant mice were exposed to alcohol, through oral gavage, on gestational days 7–16, with recorded blood alcohol concentration (BAC)s averaging 1.84 mg/ml (chronic alcohol group, CA). Two control groups, an oral gavage sucrose control group (chronic alcohol control group, CAc) and a non-treated control group (NTc), were also examined. At 56 days post-natal, the pups from each group were sacrificed and the whole brain sectioned in a coronal plane and immunolabeled for cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), serotonin (5HT) and orexin-A (OxA) which labels cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic structures respectively. The overall nuclear organization and neuronal morphology were identical in all three groups studied, and resemble that previously reported for laboratory rodents. Quantification of the estimated numbers of ChAT immunopositive (+) neurons of the pons, the TH+ neurons of the pons and the OxA+ neurons of the hypothalamus showed no statistically significant difference between the three experimental groups. The stereologically estimated areas and volumes of OxA+ neurons in the CA group were statistically significantly larger than the groups not exposed to prenatal alcohol, but the ChAT+ neurons in the CA group were statistically significantly smaller. The density of orexinergic boutons in the anterior cingulate cortex was lower in the CA group than the other groups. No statistically significant difference was found in the area and volume of TH+ neurons between the three experimental groups. These differences are discussed in relation to the sleep disorders recorded in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).

N2  - Background: An increasing number of children are exposed to road traffic noise levels that may lead to adverse effects on health and daily functioning. Childhood is a period of intense growth and brain maturation, and children may therefore be especially vulnerable to road traffic noise. The objective of the present study was to examine whether road traffic noise was associated with reported inattention symptoms in children, and whether this association was mediated by sleep duration. Methods: This study was based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Parental reports of children's inattention at age 8 were linked to modelled levels of residential road traffic noise. We investigated the association between inattention and noise exposure during pregnancy (n = 1934), noise exposure averaged over 5 years (age 3 to 8 years; n = 1384) and noise exposure at age 8 years (n = 1384), using fractional logit response models. The participants were children from Oslo, Norway. Results: An association with inattention at age 8 years was found for road traffic noise exposure at age 8 years (coef =.0083, CI = [.0012,.0154]; 1.2% point increase in inattention score per 10 dB increase in noise level), road traffic noise exposure average for the last 5 years (coef =.0090, CI = [.0016,.0164]; 1.3% point increase/10 dB), and for pregnancy road traffic noise exposure for boys (coef =.0091, CI = [.0010,.0171]), but not girls (coef = -.0021, CI = [-.0094,.0053]). Criteria for doing mediation analyses were not fulfilled. Conclusion: Results indicate that road traffic noise has a negative impact on children's inattention. We found no mediation by sleep duration.

Ethiopia has designed a five year (2011-2015) plan to cover 100% of the households in malarious areas with one insecticide treated net (ITN) for every two persons, and to raise consistent ITN utilization to at least 80%. However, evidence on ownership of ITN among malarious rural households in northwest Ethiopia is quite limited. Hence, the present study aimed at assessing ownership of ITN and associated factors among rural households at risk of malaria at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site, northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross sectional re-census was carried out in Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site during peak malaria seasons from October to December, 2014. Data for 15,088 households at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site were used for the analysis. Descriptive measures and binary logistic regression were carried out.
RESULTS: Among those who owned at least one ITN, 53.4% were living at an altitude >2500 m above sea level. However, out of households living at an altitude <2000 m above sea level, 15.8% (95% CI 14.4%, 17.3%) owned ITN at an average of 4.3 ± 2.1 persons per ITN. Of these, 69.5% (95% CI 64.7%, 74.1%) used the ITN. Among utilizing households at malarious areas, 23.7% prioritized pregnant women and 31.4% children to use ITN. The availability of radio receiver/mobile (AOR 1.60, 95%CI 1.08, 2.35) and secondary/above educational status of household member (AOR 1.54, 95%CI 1.19, 2.04) were predictors of ownership of ITN.
CONCLUSION: Rural households at risk of malaria did not own a sufficient number of ITN though the utilization is promising. Moreover, prioritizing children and pregnant women to sleep under ITN remains public health problems. Programmers, partners and implementers should consider tailored intervention strategy stratified by altitude in distributing ITN. ITN distribution should also be accompanied by using exhaustive promotion strategies that consider people without access to any source of information, and educating households to prioritize pregnant and under five children to sleep under ITN.

N2  - Evidence on the association between sleep, diet, and eating behaviors in pregnant women is lacking. We examine this in a cohort of apparently healthy pregnant women. At 26–28 weeks gestation, 497 participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep and a 24-h recall to assess dietary intake. Diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index for pregnant women in Singapore (HEI-SGP) score and previously derived dietary patterns (vegetables-fruit-rice, seafood-noodles, and pasta-cheese-meat pattern). Eating behaviors studied included the longest night-time fasting interval, frequency of consumption occasions, energy from discretionary foods, and night-time eating. Adjusted means were estimated between poor/good quality and short/normal sleepers using linear regressions, including covariates. Good sleep quality versus poor sleep quality, was associated with better diet quality (mean HEI‐SGP 54.6 vs. 52.0; p = 0.032), greater adherence to the vegetables-fruit-rice pattern (mean 0.03 vs. −0.15; p = 0.039), lesser adherence to the seafood-noodle pattern (mean −0.14 vs. 0.03; p = 0.024), and a trending lower calories from discretionary foods (mean 330.5 vs. 382.6 kcal; p = 0.073), after adjusting for covariates. After additional adjustment for anxiety, only sleep quality and the seafood‐noodle pattern remained significantly associated (p = 0.018). Short sleep was not associated with any diet or eating behavior. In conclusion, good sleep quality is associated with a better diet quality and a greater adherence to the vegetable-fruit-rice pattern, but with lesser adherence to the seafood-noodle diets in pregnant women.

N2  - Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was shown to be associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied. Material and methods Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters. Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA. Results At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4, 12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and more severe β-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%. Conclusion OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and β-cell function. A simple screening tool involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting OSA in this patient group.

N2  - Aim: This study aimed to determine whether measures of intermittent hypoxia derived from 24-hour oximetry correlate with measures of apnoea derived from modified nap polysomnography undertaken for preterm infants before discharge. Methods: Infants born ≤32 weeks of gestation were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit and had a modified polysomnography to assess their respiratory stability once they were ≥35 weeks of postmenstrual age. Infants were defined as unstable if they had more than 10 obstructive events per hour or any apnoea of >20 seconds in length. Infants also had a 24-hour oximetry performed during this period. The results of the 24-oximetry desaturation index (DSI) were compared to nap polysomnography results for central and obstructive apnoea indices and correlations tested. Results: Twenty-four infants completed the study. There were 15 (63%) infants defined as unstable by the modified polysomnography. The 3% DSI and 4% DSI from the 24-hour oximetry were significantly higher in the unstable infants, and values for all infants correlated with the obstructive index and the central apnoea index from the modified polysomnography. Conclusion: The 3% DSI and 4% DSI values from a 24-hour oximetry study may provide noninvasive measures of respiratory stability in preterm infants ready for discharge.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep apnea in pregnancy is known to adversely affect birth outcomes. Whether in utero exposure to maternal sleep apnea is associated with long-term childhood consequences is unclear.
Methods: Population-based longitudinal study of singleton infants born during 2002-2012 was conducted using linked birth, hospital, death, developmental, and educational records from New South Wales, Australia. Maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy was identified from hospital records. Outcomes were mortality and hospitalizations up to age 6, developmental vulnerability in the first year of school (aged 5-6 years), and performance on standardized tests in the third year of school (aged 7-9 years). Cox proportional hazards and modified Poisson regression models were used to calculate hazard and risk ratios for outcomes in children exposed to maternal apnea compared with those not exposed.
Results: Two hundred nine of 626188 singleton infants were exposed to maternal sleep apnea. Maternal apnea was not significantly associated with mortality (Fisher's exact p = .48), developmental vulnerability (adjusted RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.75-2.21), special needs status (1.58; 0.61-4.07), or low numeracy test scores (1.03; 0.63-1.67) but was associated with low reading test scores (1.55; 1.08-2.23). Maternal apnea significantly increased hospitalizations in the first year of life (adjusted HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.40-2.34) and between the first and sixth birthdays (1.41; 1.14-1.75). This is partly due to admissions for suspected pediatric sleep apnea.
Conclusions: Maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy is associated with poorer childhood health. Its impact on developmental and cognitive outcomes warrants further investigation.

N2  - Background: Racial/ethnic minority and low-income families are disproportionately burdened by childhood obesity. The “frst 1,000 days”-pregnancy and infancy to age 2 years-is a critical growth period, and established childhood obesity risk factors exist during the frst 1,000 days. Little research has focused on established childhood obesity risk factors during the frst 1,000 days among low-income, minority populations. Objective: To examine established childhood obesity risk factors during the frst 1,000 days in low-income families in northern Manhattan, the area with the highest prevalence of childhood obesity in New York City. Methods: We prospectively recruited pregnant women and families with infants < age 2 years in a multi-site Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Trained research staff administered validated survey questions. Using standardized protocols, research staff measured parent and infant weight; parent height; and infant length. Outcomes were childhood obesity risk factors during pregnancy and infancy. Pregnancy risk factors were maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2] and maternal excess gestational weight gain based on Institute of Medicine criteria. Infant risk factors were non-exclusive breastfeeding before age 6 months, early introduction of solids (before age 4 months), age-specifc curtailed infant sleep, routine daily infant screen time, and high infant weight-for-length defned as sex-specifc weight-for-length z-score > 2.0 per World Health Organization standards. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using descriptive statistics to determine the frequencies of established childhood obesity risk factors at baseline. Results: Among 303 parents, 99% were female and 30% were pregnant. Mean parent age was 29 ± 6 years, 93% were Hispanic/Latino, and 74% reported annual household income under $20,000. Among 210 participants with infants, mean infant age was 9 ± 7 months and 50% were female. For maternal risk factors during pregnancy, 58% had pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and 84% had excess gestational weight gain. For the subset with infants, 95% reported non-exclusive breastfeeding, 45% early introduction of solids, 38% curtailed infant sleep, and 64% routine daily infant screen time. Estimated prevalence of high infant weight-for-length was 18.6% (95% CI: 13.1, 24.1), with similar prevalence between males and females. Conclusions: In this low-income sample, childhood obesity risk factors during the frst 1,000 days were common. Estimated prevalence of high infant WFL was two-fold higher than the general United States population. Future interventions to reduce childhood obesity in northern Manhattan should focus on reducing obesity risk factors during the frst 1,000 days.

N2  - Data from the cohort studies and clinical case studies are mainly used for a consultation with pregnant women. However, it takes a long time for an accumulation of these data, and few data exist for new drugs. On the other hand, a lot of non-clinical animal data exists even for new drugs, because the data are required for new drug application. Human fetal risk is evaluated using both human and animal data in the labeling of drugs. The animal data become more important when human data is not enough, and it could be obtained from the “Interview Form” on the website of the pharmaceutical companies. Education symposium “Teratogenicity of common drugs” has been held in the annual meeting of the Japanese Teratology Society for 10 years. We selected ADHD drugs, a new sleep-inducing drug and a new antidepressant drug for this year's meeting. Methylphenidate hydrochloride, atomoxetine hydrochloride and guanfacine hydrochloride are included as ADHD drugs. We pick up ramelteon and suvorexant from new sleep-inducing drugs. Mirtazapine, duloxetine hydrochloride, and venlafaxine hydrochloride are known as new antidepressant drugs. In ADHD drugs, spina bifida was observed in the rabbit study of methylphenidate hydrochloride, spina bifida and exencephaly were noted in the mouse study of guanfacine hydrochloride. In new sleep-inducing drugs, diaphragm hernia and skeletal variation were observed in the rat study of ramelteon. No teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies of the other drugs. It is considered that animal data is also useful for the evaluation of the human fetal risk.

N2  - Recent literature has reported an association between maternal supine sleep position and stillbirth during late pregnancy. In this position the gravid uterus almost completely obstructs the inferior vena cava. A small number of women experience supine hypotension, thought to be due in part to inadequate collateral venous circulation. The aim of this paper is to review the literature describing the anatomy of the collateral venous system and in particular the azygos system, the abdominal portion of which has not been well studied. A systematic review was conducted using the electronic databases: Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Relevant anatomical and radiological literature concerning the azygos system in particular was reviewed. The search was limited to adult human studies only. The collateral venous system can be divided into superficial, intermediate and deep systems. The azygos system in particular provides immediate collateral venous circulation in the event of acute inferior vena caval obstruction. The abdominal portion of this pathway, including the ascending lumbar vein, has not been well studied and there are certain variations that can render it ineffective. In conclusion, the collateral venous system provides an alternative route for blood to flow back to the systemic circulation when acute occlusion of the inferior vena cava occurs in the supine position during late pregnancy. However, certain anatomical variations can render this pathway ineffective, and this could have implications for the development of supine hypotension and stillbirth in late pregnancy. Clin.

N2  - Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are the mainstay treatment for the 10-20% of pregnant and postpartum women who suffer major depression. With an estimated 4 million children born in the United States each year and 2-13% of pregnant women taking an SSRI, approximately 80,000-520,000 newborns are exposed annually to an SSRI in utero. SSRIs are generally considered safe, with minimal risk for pregnancy complications or teratogenic risk, although accumulating evidence suggests that in utero SSRI exposure perturbs neurodevelopment and may elicit detrimental effects on offspring's' neuropsychological health, including increased risk for internalizing behavior, abnormal social behavior, and depression during adolescence. These findings in humans are consistent with rodent data showing that perinatal SSRI exposure disturbs multiple behavioral domains associated with mood disorders, including increased helplessness, anxiety, anhedonia, perturbed sleep, and diminished sexual performance. Neurobiological mechanisms underlying the deleterious behavioral effects of perinatal SSRI exposure are poorly understood; however, our preliminary findings suggest that an epigenetic mechanism (DNA methylation) and downstream changes in the transcription factor Foxn3 in the neonatal hippocampus contribute to adverse effects of early-life SSRI exposure. Our current experiments are testing the working hypothesis that the adverse behavioral consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure are mediated by perturbed DNA methylation and Foxn3 function in the early postnatal hippocampus. Methods: We hypothesize that perinatal SSRI exposure downregulates DNA methylation and disrupts Foxn3 signaling in the early postnatal hippocampus and that this may provide a molecular switch that triggers adverse downstream effects on neurodevelopment and emotional behavior. To test this, we first examined global DNA methylation (5- methylcytosine) levels in brains of neonatal rats that were perinatally exposed to the SSRI paroxetine. We later used next-generation sequencing to interrogate gene-specific methylation changes in the hippocampus of perinatal SSRIexposed offspring. Because our data pointed to SSRI-induced suppression of DNA methylation (with a specific decrease in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a), our next experiment tested the hypothesis that siRNA-mediated suppression of Dnmt3a expression in the hippocampus of early postnatal rats would elicit adverse behavioral consequences (e.g., enhanced FST immobility) akin to what occurs following perinatal SSRI exposure. Finally, because the gene Foxn3 was one of the genes most affected by SSRI exposure (showing altered methylation as well as suppressed expression relative to control subjects), we conducted another siRNA study to transiently suppress Foxn3 expression in the early postnatal hippocampus to test whether this was sufficient to induce greater depression-like behavior, similar to what occurs following early life SSRI treatment. Results: Perinatal SSRI exposure led to decreased hippocampal DNA methylation levels relative to vehicle-exposed controls; notably no changes were observed in other limbic brain regions. Next generation sequencing analyses identified numerous gene-specific methylation differences in the hippocampus of perinatal SSRI-exposed rats, with a preponderance of hypomethylated genomic regions in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus subregions. Results of our siRNA study showed that transient knock-down of Dnmt3a in the early postnatal hippocampus lead to greater depression-like behavior (FST immobility) in adult offspring with no effect on anxiety-like behavior. These results were highly reminiscent of the behavioral consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure. The siRNA study examining transient Foxn3 expression is ongoing. Conclusions: Data from our laboratory and others highlight myriad behavioral disturbances that emerge in adult offspring exposed to SSRIs in early life. The hippocampus regulates behavioral domains that are altered by perinatal SSRI exposure, including depression-like behavior in the FST, anxiety and social behavior. Moreover, our preliminary findings of perinatal SSRI-induced decreases in early postnatal hippocampal DNA methylation, including specific changes in methylation and expression of the Foxn3 gene, suggest that perinatal SSRI exposure induces molecular changes that functionally impact hippocampal-mediated behavioral domains. The SSRI-induced methylation changes were associated with reduced neonatal hippocampal expression of the DNA methylating enzyme, Dnmt3a, and we found that siRNA-mediated Dnmt3a knockdown in the neonatal hippocampus recapitulated the behavioral effects of early-life SSRI exposure in both male and female rats. Our results may have important implications on the use of SSRIs during pregnancy and on the etiology of depression in general, as early-life changes in epigenetic mechanisms disrupt normal hippocampal development, leading to an increased risk for depression in adulthood.

N2  - For the treatment of insomnia in pregnancy, pharmacological therapy is often avoided and improvement of life is recommended by many clinicians. On the other hand, aggravation of psychological symptom which are associated with insomnia are known during pregnancy and puerperium period. We had known that few hypnotics are proved to be a teratogen. In clinical practice, benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam, brotizolam and lormetazepam, are commonly used. In the 1990s, the concern of the association of cleft palate with hypnotics rose, the teratogenicity has been believed to be a false signal. In short, the study design was the cause of the wrong signal, and cohort studies which have higher evidence level are cited than case control studies. Generally, there are no risks of teratogenicity or no more than common risk of teratogenicity even if the drug has a risk. Non-benzodiazepine (zolpidem and zopiclone) is believed to have no teratogenicity as well. Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist which is developed in Japan. Melatonin is a hormone which controls sleeping rhythm and its secretion decreases during the day time and increases during night time to auto-regulate body clock. In the USA, this hypnotic has been sold since 2005. In Japan, it has been sold since 2010. Suvorexant is an orexin receptor antagonist. Orexin is a neurotransmitter to make the brain alert and suvorexan enhances sleep by antagonizing orexin. In Japan, it has been sold since 2014. There are few clinical trials of those new hypnotics. Clinical consequences of these hypnotics and recommendations of medication instruction will be presented.

N2  - Background: Although medication is generally avoided wherever possible during pregnancy, pharmacotherapy is required for the treatment of pregnancy associated hypertension, which remains a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The long-term effects to the child of in-utero exposure to antihypertensive agents remains largely unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review published studies on adverse outcomes to the child associated with in-utero exposure to antihypertensive medications. Methods: OVID, Scopus, EBSCO Collections, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant publications published between January 1950 and October 2016 and a total of 688 potentially eligible studies were identified. Results: Following review, 47 primary studies were eligible for inclusion. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was used to assess study quality. Five studies were of excellent quality; the remainder were either mediocre or poor. Increased risk of low birth weight, low size for gestational age, preterm birth, and congenital defects following in-utero exposure to all antihypertensive agents were identified. Two studies reported an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder following exposure to labetalol, and an increased risk of sleep disorders following exposure to methyldopa and clonidine. Conclusion: The current systematic review demonstrates a paucity of relevant published high-quality studies. A small number of studies suggest possible increased risk of adverse child health outcomes; however, most published studies have methodological weaknesses and/or lacked statistical power thus preventing any firm conclusions being drawn.

N2  - Background Despite physical activity playing an important part in enhancing and maintaining good health throughout the life course, little is known about it in young children. This study aimed to identify predictive factors associated with intensity of physical activity in 12-month-old infants. Methods Parents of participants in the Environments for Healthy Living birth cohort study were approached. We collected data on physical activity from 141 infants using ankle-mounted tri-axial accelerometers (GENEActiv, Kimbolton, UK) in the unit of signal vector magnitude (SVM) score over 7 consecutive days, and linked the data to abstracts of postnatal notes and electronic medical records. To identify factors associated with intensity of physical activity, a machine learning framework was used to process the complex data, in which a multivariate linear regression model was fitted on a set of selected predictors using the ReliefF feature ranking algorithm to distinguish lower and higher active groups. Findings The physical activity level of mean SVM score ranged from 0·677 to 4·932 in the lower active group (n=70) compared with 4·975 to 10·628 in the higher active group (n=71)]There were more boys than girls in the active group (49 vs 22) and more girls than boys in the inactive group (42 vs 28; r=0·615). High intensity of physical activity in 12-month-old infants was associated with larger infant length (12 months; 95% CI 13·47 to 29·38), higher maternal blood pressure (12 months; 5·54 to 27·70), longer gestation period (13·75 to 34·47), higher breastfeeding duration (weeks; 2·33 to 12·84,), more movement during sleep (1·25 to 2·32), and high intake of vegetables (0·19 to 4·44) and juice (0·04 to 1·67) and less consumption of adult crisps (0·05 to 0·73). Interpretation The findings suggest that at age 12 months boys are more active than girls and that both gestational and postnatal environment factors, such as preterm birth (<37 weeks), dietary habits, and longer breastfeeding duration, are important predictors of intensity of physical activity in 1 year olds. However, a limitation of this study is the requirement for infants to wear the accelerometer for 7 full days; all the children with fewer than 7 days' wear were excluded from the study. These findings can help inform interventions to promote healthier lifestyles in young families.

N2  - Introduction Women at high inherited risk of ovarian cancer are advised to undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) at age 40-45 years or when their families are complete. Most women are premenopausal at this age, so RRBSO will induce surgical menopause. Despite the clear benefits of RRBSO for cancer risk reduction, much less is known about the impact on non-cancer outcomes that contribute to health and well-being and inform surveillance and management strategies. Methods and analysis This will be a multicentre, prospective cohort study of 105 premenopausal high-risk women undergoing RRBSO and an age-matched comparison group of 105 premenopausal women not planning oophorectomy or pregnancy in the next 2 years. The aim of this study is to measure the impact of RRBSO on sexual function (primary outcome) at 24 months in high-risk premenopausal women compared with the comparison group. Secondary outcomes include menopausal symptoms and menopause-related quality of life, mood, sleep quality, markers of cardiovascular disease and pre-diabetes, bone density and markers of bone turnover, and the impact of hormone replacement therapy use on these outcomes. Data analysis methods will include logistic and linear regression using general estimating equations accounting for the repeated outcome measurements within each participant. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by institutional ethics committees at each participating centre. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and national and international networks of centres managing high-risk women, and will inform national and international clinical guidelines. Trial registration number The pre-results protocol for this trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (anzctr.org.au; registration no: ACTRN12615000082505).

N2  - Since the inception of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure (HF) guidelines in 2006, much has changed in the care for patients with HF. Over the past decade, the HF Guidelines Committee has published regular updates. However, because of the major changes that have occurred, the Guidelines Committee believes that a comprehensive reassessment of the HF management recommendations is presently needed, with a view to producing a full and complete set of updated guidelines. The primary and secondary Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF panel members as well as external experts have reviewed clinically relevant literature to provide guidance for the practicing clinician. The 2017 HF guidelines provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management (self-care, pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, device, and referral) that should aid in day-to-day decisions for caring for patients with HF. Among specific issues covered are risk scores, the differences in management for HF with preserved vs reduced ejection fraction, exercise and rehabilitation, implantable devices, revascularization, right ventricular dysfunction, anemia, and iron deficiency, cardiorenal syndrome, sleep apnea, cardiomyopathies, HF in pregnancy, cardio-oncology, and myocarditis. We devoted attention to strategies and treatments to prevent HF, to the organization of HF care, comorbidity management, as well as practical issues around the timing of referral and follow-up care. Recognition and treatment of advanced HF is another important aspect of this update, including how to select advanced therapies as well as end of life considerations. Finally, we acknowledge the remaining gaps in evidence that need to be filled by future research.

N2  - Introduction: One indicator for fetal risk of mortality is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Whether markers reflecting the impact of growth restriction on the cardiovascular system, computed from a Doppler-derived heart rate signal, would be suitable for its detection antenatally was studied. Material and methods: We used a cardiotocography archive of 1163 IUGR cases and 1163 healthy controls, matched for gestation and gender. We assessed the discriminative power of short-term variability and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate, computed over episodes of high and low variation aiming to separate growth-restricted fetuses from controls. Metrics characterizing the sleep state distribution within a trace were also considered for inclusion into an IUGR detection model. Results: Significant differences in the risk markers comparing growth-restricted with healthy fetuses were found. When used in a logistic regression classifier, their performance for identifying IUGR was considerably superior before 34 weeks of gestation. Long-term variability in active sleep was superior to short-term variability [area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 72% compared with 71%]. Most predictive was the number of minutes in high variation per hour (AUC of 75%). A multivariate IUGR prediction model improved the AUC to 76%. Conclusion: We suggest that heart rate variability markers together with surrogate information on sleep states can contribute to the detection of early-onset IUGR.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 15-month intervention on dietary intake conducted among obesity-prone normal-weight pre-school children.
DESIGN: Information on dietary intake was obtained using a 4 d diet record. A diet quality index was adapted to assess how well children's diet complied with the Danish national guidelines. Linear regression per protocol and intention-to-treat analyses of differences in intakes of energy, macronutrients, fruit, vegetables, fish, sugar-sweetened beverages and diet quality index between the two groups were conducted.
SETTING: The Healthy Start study was conducted during 2009-2011, focusing on changing diet, physical activity, sleep and stress management to prevent excessive weight gain among Danish children.
SUBJECTS: From a population of 635 Danish pre-school children, who had a high birth weight (≥4000 g), high maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (≥28·0 kg/m2) or low maternal educational level (<10 years of schooling), 285 children completed the intervention and had complete information on dietary intake.
RESULTS: Children in the intervention group had a lower energy intake after the 15-month intervention (group means: 5·29 v. 5·59 MJ, P=0·02) compared with the control group. We observed lower intakes of carbohydrates and added sugar in the intervention group compared with the control group after the intervention (P=0·002, P=0·01).
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention resulted in a lower energy intake, particularly from carbohydrates and added sugar after 15 months of intervention, suggesting that dietary intake can be changed in a healthier direction in children predisposed to obesity.

N2  - West syndrome hasn't been thoroughly investigated in Georgia. The purposes of our study were a) to assess the clinical and etiological peculiarities of West syndrome, based on MRI data and its relation to the long-term outcome; b) to assess the evolution of West syndrome and its relation to patient characteristics; c) to compare the efficacies of treatments with ACTH and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); d) to evaluate the neuropsychological outcome after 12 and 24 months and their early predictors. We evaluated 31 patients (17 male, 14 female) with infantile spasms. Mean age of seizure onset was 6.3 months. Inclusion criteria were newly diagnosed patients with infantile spasms from 2 to 18 months, abnormal EEG and written informed consent of parents/ caregivers. We collected birth, family and seizure detailed history. All patients were examined neurologically, investigated with prolonged sleep and awake video - EEG, brain MRI, developmental screening tests (Ages & Stages Questionnaires®, Third Edition, ASQ-3™) at the time of admission. Spasm diary was given and filled by every parent/caregiver. The video-recording of seizures to study the detailed phenomenology of event was done in all cases as well. In 94% of patients (n=29) spasm were observed in clusters. EEG investigation revealed hypsarrhythmia in majority of cases (n=20; 65%). 19% (n=6) and 16% (n=5) patients had modified hypsarrhythmia and other types of EEG changes respectively. In 19 (61%) cases neurological examination was normal. 7 patients (22.6%) showed normal neuropsychological development. In remaining 12 (38.7%) and 12 (38.7%) cases moderate and severe delay of development was revealed accordingly. MRI investigation revealed no abnormality in 16% (n=5). 16 (52%) individuals were treated with ACTH only. In 12 (39%) cases ACTH and AED were used simultaneously and 2 (6.5%) cases were treated with AED only. One year follow-up assessments were provided in 22 (74%) cases. One patient died during the study. Neuropsychological development was with no changes in 12 (55%) individuals. In 3 (9.7%) cases some improvement was detected and the deterioration of development was identified in 6 (19%) individuals. In all cases with developmental deterioration, seizures were started before seven month of age, this association was statistically significant (Pearson Chi-Square 6.3; df 1; p=0.019). There was no relationship between developmental changes and sex, birth from full term pregnancy, infantile spasm type, treatment, or EEG pattern, however. Despite the fact, that the number of included patients was small, preliminary findings are in accordance to the other published data. The current study is still in process. 12-24 months follow-up with clinical, EEG and neuropsychological monitoring is planned for all cases.

N2  - Major depression occurs in 5–10% of pregnancies and is associated with many negative effects for mother and child, yet treatment options are scarce. To our knowledge, this is the first published randomised controlled trial on Internet delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for this group. Objective To test the efficacy of a pregnancy adapted version of an existing 10-week ICBT-program for depression as well as assessing acceptability and adherence Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Online and telephone. Population or sample Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 10–28 at intake) currently suffering from major depressive disorder. Methods 42 pregnant women (gestational week 12–28) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used. Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed. Results The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post treatment (p < 0.001, Hedges g =1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e. achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004). Measures of treatment credibility, satisfaction, utilization, and adherence were comparable to implemented ICBT for depression. Limitations Small sample size and no long-term evaluation. Conclusion Pregnancy adapted ICBT for antenatal depression is feasible, acceptable and efficacious. These results need to be replicated in larger trials to validate these promising findings.

N2  - Maternal hypothyroidism (MH) is the most common cause of transient congenital hypothyroidism. Different animal models are used for assessing developmental effects of MH in offspring. The severity and status of hypothyroidism in animal models must be a reflection of the actual conditions in humans. To obtain comparable results with different clinical conditions, which lead to MH in humans, several factors have been suggested for researchers to consider before designing the experimental models. Regarding development of fetal body systems during pregnancy, interference at different times provides different results and the appropriate time for induction of hypothyroidism should be selected based on accurate time of development of the system under assessment. Other factors that should be taken into consideration include, physiological and biochemical differences between humans and other species, thyroid hormone-independent effects of anti-thyroid drugs, circadian rhythms in TSH secretion, sex differences, physical and psychological stress. This review addresses essential guidelines for selecting and managing the optimal animal model for MH as well as discussing the pros and cons of currently used models.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Up to 18% of men experience depression and/or anxiety during the transition to parenthood. Interventions designed specifically to promote the mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce. Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new fathers.
OBJECTIVE: To guide the development of Healthydads.ca, a website designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers' perspectives of barriers to seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting the decision to visit such a website.
METHODS: One hundred and seventy-four men whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the decision to visit a father-focused website.
RESULTS: Most men (155/174, 89.1%) reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174, 72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a revisit.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health. Specific user and website features were identified to optimize the use of father-focused websites.

N2  - Objective: Public Health initiatives, such as the “Safe to Sleep” campaign, have traditionally targeted infants’ risk factors for the prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, controversy remains regarding maternal and obstetrical risk factors for SIDS. In our study, we sought out to determine both modifiable and non-modifiable obstetrical and maternal risk factors associated with SIDS. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the CDC’s Linked Birth–Infant Death data from the United States for the year 2010. The impact of several obstetrical and maternal risk factors on the risk of overall infant mortality and SIDS was estimated using unconditional regression analysis, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results: Our cohort consisted of 4,007,105 deliveries and 24,174 infant deaths during the first year of life, of which 1991 (8.2%) were due to SIDS. Prominent risk factors for SIDS included (OR [95% CI]): black race, 1.89 [1.68–2.13]; maternal smoking, 3.56 [3.18–3.99]; maternal chronic hypertension, 1.73 [1.21–2.48]; gestational hypertension, 1.51 [1.23–1.87]; premature birth <37 weeks, 2.16 [1.82–2.55]; IUGR, 2.46 [2.14–2.82]; and being a twin, 1.81 [1.43–2.29], p < 0.0001. Relative to a cohort of infants who died of other causes, risk factors with a predilection for SIDS were maternal smoking, 2.48 [2.16–2.83] and being a twin, 1.52 [1.21–1.91], p < 0.0001. Conclusions for practice: While certain socio-demographic and gestational characteristics are important risk factors, maternal smoking remains the strongest prenatal modifiable risk factor for SIDS. We recommend the continuation of Public Health initiatives that promote safe infant sleeping practices and smoking cessation during and after pregnancy.

N2  - Background Experimental and epidemiologic data suggest that among nonpregnant adults, sleep duration may be an important risk factor for chronic disease. Although pregnant women commonly report poor sleep, few studies objectively evaluated the quality of sleep in pregnancy or explored the relationship between sleep disturbances and maternal and perinatal outcomes. Objective Our objective was to examine the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration, timing, and continuity (measured via wrist actigraphy) and maternal cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity specific to pregnancy. Study Design This was a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women. Women were recruited between 16 0/7 and 21 6/7 weeks’ gestation. They were asked to wear a wrist actigraphy monitor and complete a daily sleep log for a period of 7 consecutive days. The primary sleep exposure variables were the averages of the following over the total valid nights (minimum 5, maximum 7 nights): short sleep duration during the primary sleep period (<7 h/night), late sleep midpoint (midpoint between sleep onset and sleep offset >5 AM), and top quartile of minutes of wake time after sleep onset and sleep fragmentation index. The primary outcomes of interest were a composite of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mild, severe, or superimposed preeclampsia; eclampsia; or antepartum gestational hypertension) and gestational diabetes mellitus. We used χ2 tests to assess associations between sleep variables and categorical baseline characteristics. Crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from univariate logistic regression models to characterize the magnitude of the relationship between sleep characteristics and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. For associations significant in univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was used to explore further the association of sleep characteristics with pregnancy outcomes. Results In all, 901 eligible women consented to participate; 782 submitted valid actigraphy studies. Short sleep duration and a later sleep midpoint were associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–4.53; and odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–5.36, respectively) but not of hypertensive disorders. A model with both sleep duration and sleep midpoint as well as their interaction term revealed that while there was no significant interaction between these exposures, the main effects of both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–4.19; and adjusted odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–4.97, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting separately for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity, both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint remained associated with gestational diabetes. No associations were demonstrated between the sleep quality measures (wake after sleep onset, sleep fragmentation) and hypertensive disorders or gestational diabetes. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a relationship between short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes. Our data suggest independent contributions of these 2 sleep characteristics to the risk for gestational diabetes in nulliparous women.

N2  - Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety have been shown to be more common in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients than in the general population. Both the prevalence and severity of OSA increase during pregnancy. Pregnancy is also a time of high risk for the development of depression and anxiety. This study examined the association between OSA, sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This observational study recruited pregnant women at greater than 26 weeks gestation with a single fetus presenting for antenatal care at King Edward Memorial Hospital, WA. Measurements included: sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); sleep disordered breathing using an ApneaLink monitor (nasal pressure and pulse oximeter); and symptoms of depression and anxiety from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Data from medical records included age, parity, BMI, smoking status, history of depression and use of antidepressants. Results: Data from 126 women were analysed for presence of OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index, AHI, ≥5). OSA was observed in 28 (22.2%) women. Symptoms of depression (defined as an EPDS score of ≥13) were observed in 11 (8.7%) women and symptoms of anxiety (measured as a score of ≥6 on questions 3, 4 and 5 of the EPDS) were observed in 16 (12.7%) women. Compared to women without depressive symptoms, those with depressive symptoms had higher AHI (p = 0.03). Women with symptoms of anxiety were more likely to have sleep apnoea (AHI≥5; p = 0.007). Multivariate analyses controlling for age, BMI, parity, smoking status and history of depression showed that: (i) depressive symptoms were related to AHI, ODI3%, ODI4% and antidepressant use (p < 0.001); and (ii) symptoms of anxiety were related to presence of sleep apnoea (AHI≥5) and antidepressant use (p < 0.001). Conclusion: OSA occurs in one fifth of women in late pregnancy. The severity of OSA is independently associated with symptoms of depression, while the presence of OSA is associated with symptoms of anxiety in pregnancy. The direction of this relationship is unknown but is an important focus for future research.

N2  - Khat (Catha edulis) is a evergreen flowering shrub that is cultivated at high altitudes, especially in East Africa and the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. The plant contains alkaloids, of which cathinone and cathine have structural similarity and pharmacological action similar to amphetamines. The leaves are, therefore, consumed in some regions as a psychoactive stimulant due to cultural beliefs and misperceptions on the health benefits of khat consumption. This resulted in a growing prevalence of khat consumption among pregnant women. The myriad of physiological changes associated with pregnancy impairs sleep and memory. Moreover, khat has also been shown to have adverse effects on memory and sleep. Therefore, its use during pregnancy may further aggravate those impairments. The purpose of this mini-review is to summarize the changes in sleep and memory during pregnancy and the evidence supporting a relationship between khat consumption and neurocognitive deficits and sleep dysfunctions. The misperceptions of beneficial effects of khat, the high prevalence of consumption among pregnant women, and the possibility of under-reporting of khat abuse do necessitate the development of alternative methodologies to identify cases of unreported khat abuse in pregnant women. It is proposed that screening for sleep problems and memory deficits may help identify under-reported cases of khat abuse in pregnant women.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to reveal the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety among Chinese pregnant women. Pregnant women were recruited in Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Self-rating depression scales (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scales (SAS) were used for evaluating depression and anxiety status at each trimester; corresponding sleep quality and duration were reported by pregnant women. Ordinary or multilevel linear and logistic regression model were used to estimate the cross-sectional or longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates were 35.64, 24.23, and 26.24% for depression and 22.57, 17.41, and 21.04% for anxiety at 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd trimester (T3), respectively. Controlling for potential confounders, it revealed significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of sleep with depression and anxiety status. In cross-sectional analysis, women who slept less than 8 h/day had higher risk of depression (T1: OR (95%CI) = 1.75 (1.39, 2.20); T2: 1.52 (1.26, 2.05); T3: 1.60 (1.18, 2.05)) and anxiety (T1: 2.00 (1.57, 2.55); T2: 1.86 (1.37, 2.54); T3: 1.33 (0.99, 1.79)). In the longitudinal analysis, multilevel model revealed that women with subjective “fair” or “bad” sleep quality had elevated risk of depression (OR ranging from 1.54 to 3.71) and anxiety (2.38 to 7.53) during pregnancy. Prenatal depression and anxiety status were prevalent in pregnant women. Sleep quality was associated with depression and anxiety status in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, implying that improving sleep quality should benefit for mental health of pregnant women.

N2  - This study examined the course of antidepressant use, sleep quality, and depression severity from pregnancy through 6-month postpartum in women with and without a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Women (N = 215) were interviewed during pregnancy, 1- and 6-month postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality, and depression severity. Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements in depression severity by 6-month postpartum. In contrast, the depression severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout. Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. When prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore, antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

N2  - Background Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a frequent disorder and its severity superfats as pregnancy progresses. The exact prevalence or incidence of such disorder in pregnant women is still unknown. Objectives To assess the incidence and severity of OSA in pregnant women and to discover the risk factors for OSA during pregnancy. Methods A total of 30 pregnant women and 30 age matched controls completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Stop-Bang questionnaire. SDB diagnosis was based on polysomnography. Results The incidence of OSA among our studied pregnant women was 36.7% and 53.3% of pregnant women were snorers. They demonstrated significantly higher AHI (4.38 ± 4.45) and ODI (3.72 ± 4.03). There was a significant positive correlation between gestational age and ESS, BMI, AHI and ODI, as they are of their highest levels among cases in the third trimester. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that gestational age and body mass index were independent risk factors with odds ratio (2.23 & 4.99) and 95% CI (1.05–5.32 & 1.75–33.28) respectively while the neck circumference and ESS were considered as dependent risk factors. Conclusion Pregnancy is a risk condition for OSA which aggravated by neck circumference and base line BMI. The susceptibility and severity increase by increasing gestational age.

N2  - Objective Pregnancy and the obesity epidemic impacting women of reproductive age appear to predispose women to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. The aim of this study is to examine the association between OSA and adverse maternal outcomes in a national cohort. Methods The National Perinatal Information Center in the US was used to identify women with a delivery discharge diagnosis of OSA from 2010 to 2014. We used the International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision to classify OSA diagnosis and maternal outcomes. Measurements The sample consisted of 1,577,632 gravidas with a rate of OSA of 0.12% (N = 1963). There was a significant association between OSA and preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94–2.54), eclampsia (aOR 2.95, 1.08–8.02), and gestational diabetes (aOR 1.51, 1.34–1.72) after adjusting for a comprehensive list of covariates which includes maternal obesity. OSA status was also associated with a 2.5–3.5-fold increase in risk of severe complications such as cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer (5.1 + 5.6 vs 3.0 + 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and odds of an admission to an intensive care unit higher (aOR 2.74, 2.36–3.18) in women with OSA. Conclusions Compared to pregnant women without OSA, pregnant women with OSA have a significantly higher risk of pregnancy-specific complications such as gestational hypertensive conditions and gestational diabetes, and rare medical and surgical complications such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. OSA diagnosis was also associated with a longer hospital stay and significantly increased odds for admission to the intensive care unit.

N2  - Introduction: A pregnant woman's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well-known. We have been developing a system of fetal movement acceleration measurement (FMAM) in order to investigate fetal well-being since 2008. This system consists of two channels of fetal and maternal movements. This study examined influences of fetal movement during a pregnant woman's sleep on maternal sleep using the FMAM system. Methods: The subjects were eighteen healthy pregnant women (23- 39 yr) at 24-36 gestational weeks. They gave written informed consent to the study. They were instructed to record fetal and maternal movements during their sleep by themselves once every four weeks. The fetal movement sensor was placed on maternal abdomen, and maternal movement sensor was on her thigh. We detected fetal and maternal movement signals independently, and analyzed detected signals using an original software. We calculated parameters; maternal time in bed, maternal waking time, the number of synchronized fetal-maternal movements, and characteristics of fetal movement signals synchronized with maternal movement. Results: Mean values of maternal time in bed ranged from 392.0 min to 421.5 min. Mean values of maternal waking time ranged from 13.6 min to 15.2 min. Mean values of the number of synchronized fetal-maternal movements ranged from 62.9 to 79.4. These parameters corresponded to results with our previous polysomnographic findings. The number of synchronized fetal-maternal movements was similar to results of maternal micro-arousals. The fetal movement signals with synchronized maternal movement were longer and larger than those without synchronization. Conclusion: This study suggest that the FMAM system is useful to see a pregnant woman's sleep disturbance, especially relationships with her fetus.

N2  - Introduction: Insomnia and/or poor sleep quality are common during pregnancy and in the postnatal period and may increase the risk of depression [1, 2]. The rate of postpartum depression is between 3-25% in the first year following delivery. Indeed, maternity blues and postpartum depression are common mental health problems during the early postpartum period. Maternity blues is characterized by transient mood swings to a low mood and crying. In most cases, maternity blues abates within the first few days after delivery [3]. Aim of the study: We evaluated the prevalence of insomnia at childbirth and two months after delivery in a sample of mothers suffering from depression and maternity blues in the perinatal period, which was compared to a control group of euthymic mothers. Materials and Methods: Study subjects included 117 pregnant women (average age of 33, 4 years) with no history of psychiatric illness during pregnancy who were recruited at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department in Siena. Study assessments included: Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and SCID II, to exclude other psychiatric comorbidities. Past and present medical history and demographics were obtained though a clinical interview and an exam of the clinical chart. We then compared euthymic mothers and mothers who showed mood symptoms (postpartum depression and maternity blues) at childbirth and two months after delivery. Particularly, we focused on the differences for the presence, time of onset and progression of insomnia, as assessed via the specific items on Beck's Depression Inventory and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Study analyses were conducted using one way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc testing for normally distributed data. Results: Eighty-one and a half percent of the study subjects were euthymic and 18, 5% endorsed postpartum depression and maternity blues. Both groups of mothers included a relatively high number of subjects who endorsed sleep problems at childbirth and two months after. However and not surprisingly, mothers with depression and maternity blues were statistically more likely to endorse the EPDS item: “I have been so unhappy that I have had difficulty sleeping”. Similarly, the rate of sleep disturbance was significantly higher (p < 0.001), both at delivery and at two months after childbirth for this group. We observed an improvement of sleep disorders over time in both groups, as assessed via the BDI and EPDS. However, and not surprisingly, the group with depression and maternity blues, improved less. Conclusions: In our sample, insomnia was relatively prevalent, both in depressed and non depressed women. However, patients with maternity blues and depression at childbirth and two months later showed higher levels of insomnia. This is not surprising, as insomnia is one of the core symptoms of depression. More studies are needed to establish if insomnia precedes of follows the development of other depressive symptoms [2].

N2  - Sleep related breathing disorders include central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sleep-related hypoventilation, and sleep-related hypoxia. These disorders are frequent and growing in clinical relevance. The related chapter of the S3 guideline Non-restorative sleep/Sleep disorders, published by the German Sleep Society (DGSM), has recently been updated in November 2016. Epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutic procedures, and classification of sleep related disorders have been revised. Concerning epidemiology, a considerably higher mortality rate among pregnant women with OSA has been emphasized. With regards to diagnostics, the authors point out that respiratory polygraphy may be sufficient in diagnosing OSA, if a typical clinical condition is given. For CSA, recommendations were changed to diagnose CSA with low apnea rates present. Significant changes for treating CSA in patients with left ventricular dysfunction have been introduced. In addition, there is now to be differentiated between sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxaemia. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is discussed in more detail. This article sums up and comments on the published changes.

N2  - Neonatal sleep is a crucial state that involves endogenous driven brain activity, important for neuronal survival and guidance of brain networks. Sequential EEG-sleep analysis in preterm infants provides insights into functional brain integrity and can document deviations of the biologically pre-programmed process of sleep ontogenesis during the neonatal period. Visual assessment of neonatal sleep-EEG, with integration of both cerebral and non-cerebral measures to better define neonatal state, is still considered the gold standard. Electrographic patterns evolve over time and are gradually time locked with behavioural characteristics which allow classification of quiet sleep and active sleep periods during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Near term age, the neonate expresses a short ultradian sleep cycle, with two distinct active and quiet sleep, as well as brief periods of transitional or indeterminate sleep. Qualitative assessment of neonatal sleep is however challenged by biological and environmental variables that influence the expression of EEG-sleep patterns and sleep organization. Developing normative EEG-sleep data with the aid of automated analytic methods, can further improve our understanding of extra-uterine brain development and state organization under stressful or pathological conditions. Based on those developmental biomarkers of normal and abnormal brain function, research can be conducted to support and optimise sleep in the NICU, with the ultimate goal to improve therapeutic interventions and neurodevelopmental outcome.

N2  - Introduction: Recent studies have demonstrated an increased risk of stillbirth in late pregnancy with maternal supine sleep position. In this position, the gravid uterus almost completely obstructs the inferior vena cava (IVC). The aim of this study is to investigate the role of collateral venous drainage in differing positions during late pregnancy. Methods: Twelve healthy pregnant women between 35-38 weeks gestation underwent MRI scanning in supine and left lateral decubitus positions. Images were evaluated to measure the calibre and blood flow of the aorta, IVC and azygos vein. Results: Preliminary data has shown that, compared to the left lateral decubitus position, supine positioning was associated with a reduction in cardiac output (5.30 L/min vs 4.04 L/min, p = 0.004). Blood flow through the azygos increased in the supine position (14.04 mL/sec vs 6.96 mL/sec p = 0.026) and decreased through the IVC (1.09 mL/sec vs 21.90 mL/sec p = 0.012). The cross-sectional area of the azygos vein increased in the supine position (0.36 cm2 vs 0.77 cm2 p = 0.008) while the area of the IVC decreased (3.5 cm2 vs 5.5 cm2 p = 0.049). Discussion: Healthy pregnant women experience an increase in collateral venous blood flow in the supine position, likely as a response to marked compression of the IVC. It is suggested that anatomical abnormalities of the collateral venous system may be associated with supine hypotension and may, in part, explain the association between maternal position and risk of stillbirth in late pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep architecture is a term that describes the structural organisation of sleep stages over the course of a single night's sleep. Characteristic changes in sleep architecture are observed with aging and in a range of disorders. However there is very little data that describes the sleep architecture of healthy young adults. Aims: To establish comprehensive normative values of sleep architecture for healthy young adults using current scoring guidelines. Methods: Single night in-laboratory PSG was conducted in 22 yearold participants of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study cohort. Studies were scored according to AASM 2012 guidelines. Studies were excluded from the current analysis if AHI > 5 event.hr-1, RDI > 5 events.hr-1, or the documented use of medications known to affect sleep, regular shift work, excess alcohol consumption, or depression or current pregnancy. Results: 950 individuals underwent a PSG, 240 individuals were excluded. PSG data from 755 participants were analysed by gender. The mean (±SD) age and BMI of the group was 22 ± 0.6 years and BMI 24.9 ± 5 kg.m2. Compared to males, females had increased total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep latency (SL), and decreased wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and time spent in stage N1 sleep. All other measures of sleep architecture were similar between males and females. (Table presented) Conclusion: Young adult women generally have improved polysomnographic features of sleep quality compared to young men, but take longer to fall asleep in the sleep laboratory.

N2  - Objectives: Nearly 25 percent of parents with children under the age of 5 years report sleep issues. An understanding of the regulation of sleep and its effects on maternal and family well-being is important to help families with sleep difficulties. Methods: Sleep, following the transactional model of child development, is influenced by dynamic, bidirectional exchanges between infant characteristics, such as temperament and the caregiving environment. Disruptions in sleep are very frequent after the birth of a baby. Sleep fragmentation and deprivation are almost universal in postpartum period, and there are studies that suggest that such sleep disruptions are correlated with postpartum depression. Likewise, maternal depression predicts infant and toddler sleep difficulties and disruptions in the ability to form a secure bond. Sleep becomes more consolidated usually by ages 6-9 months, and by then, most infants sleep six to eight hours at night. Question regarding links between attachment style and infant's quality of sleep remains largely unanswered. The challenge for counseling parents on ways to help with regulation of the sleep in their babies is to understand the contributions of the child and the parent and to facilitate the child's internal regulation of sleeping. Transactional processes focus on goodness of fit in parent-child relationships, and sleep patterns between the mother and her child is an important aspect of the dyad's behavior. Mothers who require less sleep before pregnancy seem to do better with infants whose sleep is more fragmented, whereas mothers who require more sleep are better fit for infants who sleep more. Results: Research has demonstrated that sleep problems, mostly nighttime awakening and problems with falling asleep, may lead to learning difficulties, irritability, behavioral problems, mood regulation, and obesity. Conclusions: Good sleep hygiene is important to promote health and facilitate bonding between young children and their parents.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting middle-Age women that often causes insulin insensitivity, obesity, infertility, and metabolic syndrome as a result of hormonal imbalances. Gastric bypass procedures have been shown to be effective in treating these symptoms however the efficacy of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) has not been studied in the PCOS population. The purpose of this study was to analyze outcomes of VSG in this population, including the impact on subsequent fertility. Methods: A review of patients undergoing VSG from 2008-2016 from two bariatric centers was performed. Patients with PCOS were compared to a matched control group of non-PCOS (CON) female patients of childbearing age undergoing VSG during the same time period. BMI and percent excess weight lost (%EWL) were collected at 3, 6, and 12-months postoperatively. Patient characteristics and postoperative pregnancy status were compared between the two cohorts. Results: Over 1,000 patients were reviewed. One hundred nineteen were found to have PCOS and were compared to 119 CON patients. The mean age was 36 years and the mean pre-op BMI was 42. The mean total %EWL at one year was 63%. The PCOS cohort had fewer patients with hypertension (24% vs 41%, po0.01), but the two groups were comparable in rates of preop diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, and pseudotumor cerebri. The mean %EWL in the PCOS cohort compared to CON cohort was similar at 3 months (39% vs 37%; p=0.30), trended toward significance at 6 months (55% vs 50%; p=0.06), and was statistically greater at 12 months (66% vs 60%; p=0.05). Significantly more PCOS patients became pregnant after VSG compared to the CON group (22% vs. 3%; po0.01). Of those who became pregnant, 69% of the PCOS patients were previously nulliparous prior to VSG compared to 0% of the CON group (po0.05). Conclusions: PCOS is a relatively common weight-related comorbidity that can exacerbate weight gain but also negatively impact fertility. Compared to non-PCOS patients, PCOS patients experienced similar %EWL at 3 and 6 months, and had greater weight loss at 1 year. More PCOS patients became pregnant following VSG compared to non-PCOS patients, the majority of which were previously nulliparous. This study shows that VSG is effective for weight loss in PCOS patients with obesity and may positively augment fertility rates.

N2  - (1) Epidemiology of sleep complaints in the community: the 2016 SHF Survey Similarly to other international studies, the results from this national survey of Australian adults shows that sleep problems, related to lifestyle and behavioural choices, produce a considerable burden on health, social life and workplace functioning. Much of this is due to competing demands on people's time with a quarter of all adults reporting their usual routine does not allow sufficient sleep. Lifestyle choices affecting sleep habits, such as working or using the internet just before bed, are also associated with adverse effects on sleep and daytime and work performance. Although limited by self-reported data, short sleep and disrupted sleep timing such as social jetlag have consistently been associated with considerable cardio-metabolic morbidity and increased mortality. The population burden of sleep problems in the community associated with lifestyle choices of sleep habits and duration rivals that of clinical disorders. (2) Epidemiology of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and related respiratory sleep disorders OSA is one of the commonest clinical sleep disorders, with 13% of men and 6% of women having it to at least moderate degree, based on an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of 15 events/hr or greater. Age, gender, body mass index and (to a lesser extent) ethnicity influence its prevalence, which has increased in recent years with population ageing and increasing obesity. Common comorbidities include hypertension, vascular disease, metabolic dysfunction and depression. While cognitive dysfunction is a common sequela of untreated OSA and responsible for the increased accident risk and productivity losses associated with the condition, its presence and severity are inconsistently related to AHI. The reasons for this inconsistency are incompletely understood, and deserve closer examination given the importance of the relationship both economically and in terms of well-being. The economic impacts of untreated OSA are substantial, making its identification and treatment highly cost effective, a simple truth that requires wider appreciation by health planners. (3) Epidemiology of Narcolepsy, Restless Legs Syndrome and REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RMD) Different neurological sleep disorders have different challenges when it comes to studying their epidemiology. The prevalence of narcolepsy in the general population has been estimated around 0.5 - 2 per 1000 inhabitants, with the number of undiagnosed patients heavily outnumbering diagnosed patients and long diagnostic delays. Poor differential diagnosis is a possible confound in older prevalence estimates. Previous studies indicated RLS prevalence rates of 10-15%, with female gender, pregnancy and co-morbid diseases increasing risk. RLS diagnosis can be confounded by 'mimics' and their active exclusion is now an obligatory diagnostic requirement. Only moderate to severe RLS requires treatment. Epidemiological studies of RBD are limited by the fact that a definite diagnosis requires polysomnography. General population prevalence is estimated to be up to 2% (7 + % in the elderly). Prevalence studies of probable idiopathic RBD often use validated questionnaires, but these have many difficulties; false-negatives, false-positives, low reproducibility, etc. Current RBD research is centered on its ability to indicate an early stage of neurodegenerative disease and the development of population-based screening tools. Epidemiology is a fast-changing field with new diagnostic and methodological challenges continually emerging and it is thus important that a key conference like Sleep DownUnder regularly includes a comprehensive forum that presents the latest sleep research on these issues. It is also critical, from an advocacy point of view, that sleep professionals are up-to-date with the latest prevalence findings and ideas about what the possible implications of different sleep disorders/problems may be for the community, workplace, health budget and overall economy. The format, of three presentations by national and international sleep experts covering different sleep problems, will provide sufficient time after each presentation for some questions and discussion.

N2  - Aims: Pregnancy is a phenomenon associated with dynamic changes in physical, mental and biochemical status of body and demands increased nutritional intake for developing foetus. The level of various micronutrients which act as co-factors for antioxidant enzymes or it-self as antioxidants gets altered with the progression of pregnancy. The present longitudinal study summarized the trend of selected micronutrients level in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP) supplemented with daily and weekly oral iron folic acid (IFA) tablet during pregnancy and postpartum. Methods: A total of 200 primigravida {N = 100; NAP (Hb > 11 g/dl) and N = 100 AP (Hb = 8–11 g/dl) assigned daily (N = 50) and weekly (N = 50) supplementation} were recruited and overnight fasting blood samples were withdrawn at 13–16 weeks, after 3 months and 6 weeks postpartum. The serum iron, copper, zinc, magnesium and manganese were estimated by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometer. Results: Serum manganese (p < 0.05) at baseline and magnesium (p < 0.01) at postpartum was significantly different between NAP and AP supplemented with daily IFA tablets. The trend of copper found to be increased during pregnancy and later declined at postpartum in both the groups. Daily supplementation resulted in significantly high iron (p < 0.05) in NAP during third trimester. Conclusions: Hypozincemia and hypomagnesemia was observed in anaemic pregnancy supplemented with weekly and daily IFA respectively. Clear evidence of altered micronutrients levels during healthy and anaemic pregnancy was seen. The reference values may be drawn from this study for the nutritional assessment during pregnancy for healthy pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Aims: To explore the experiences of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, and the relationships between perceptions of glucose control, attitudes to technology and glycaemic responses with regard to closed-loop insulin delivery. Methods: We recruited 16 pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes [mean ± sd age 34.1 ± 4.6 years, duration of diabetes 23.6 ± 7.2 years, baseline HbA1c 51±5 mmol/mol (6.8 ± 0.6%)] to a randomized crossover trial of sensor-augmented pump therapy vs automated closed-loop therapy. Questionnaires (Diabetes Technology Questionnaire, Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey) were completed before and after each intervention, with qualitative interviews at baseline and follow-up. Results: Women described the benefits and burdens of closed-loop systems during pregnancy. Feelings of improved glucose control, excitement and empowerment were counterbalanced by concerns about device visibility, obsessive data checking and diminished attentiveness to hyper- and hypoglycaemia symptoms. Responding to questionnaires, eight participants felt less worry about overnight hypoglycaemia and that diabetes ‘did not run their lives’; however, five reported that closed-loop increased time thinking about diabetes, and three felt it made sleep and preventing hyperglycaemia more problematic. Women slightly overestimated their glycaemic response to closed-loop therapy. Most became more positive in their technology attitudes throughout pregnancy. Women with more positive technology attitudes had higher degrees of overestimation, and poorer levels of glycaemic control. Conclusions: Women displayed complex psychosocial responses to closed-loop therapy in pregnancy. Perceptions of glycaemic response may diverge from biomedical data.

N2  - In recent years, the field of scientific and practical interest has shifted to ensuring the health of newborns and children that contribute to public health and future generations. The health of Russia's population, including reproductive health, to date, represents the State value. In recent years, in Russian Federation, there is a trend to an increase in fertility, including in connection with transition from 2012 registration of childbirth recommendations of the WHO with 22 weeks of gestation, but is directly proportional to increasing morbidity and mortality through early disability and perinatal morbidity. The highest frequency of adverse perinatal outcomes occurs in placental insufficiency, particularly in critical condition in the fetus, resulting in the subsequent health of the future generation. The aim of our study is to investigate the morbidity of babies in the first year of life birth on antenatal diagnosed critical state of the fetus. The highest perinatal mortality, high perinatal morbidity with the outcome of the disability we get at the critical state of the fetus, which should be understood as a degree of violation of the morphofunctional state in which the depletion of the compensatory mechanisms is the high risk antenatal, intrapartum or early neonatal death. According to various authors, the perinatal mortality rate in critical condition of the fetus reaches .3‰, early neonatal and . ‰. or the critical condition of the fetus characterized by early and very early preterm birth, severe perinatal CNS damage, respiratory distress syndrome, which subsequently affects the health status of children born in decompensated placental insufficiency. The aim of our research is the study of morbidity of children of the first year of life, born with antenatal diagnosed critical condition of the fetus. A clinical prospective study of 83 pregnant women with complicated critical to the fetus during pregnancy. The results of the study revealed high perinatal morbidity. Perinatal loss in the study group was .8‰ (N= . Of the 8 surviving children, only 33 (48,5%) were observed later in the study of the catamnesis. When studying the history of the development of children during the first year of life with a critical antenatal diagnosed fetal-placental blood flow was noticed by the high frequency of infectious, allergic, neurological morbidity, abnormalities of bone and cartilage system of the visual apparatus. When analyzing the frequency and duration of monitoring by a neurologist, we have identified the expected high frequency of neurological pathology in children with antenatal critical condition. So, all children up to 1 year of life and further consisted on the account at the neurologist, which was due not only to the severity of CNS damage, but also by prematurity. The effects of neonatal ivh transferred 2-4 degree newborns manifested in children over 1 year of life in the form of hypertension-hydrocephalic syndrome in 5 children (15,1%), ischemic brain infarction in the region of the “island zone” with the subsequent formation of cystic leukomalacia in 1 child at 1 month of life. For these children, a characteristic diagnosis to the end of the 1st year of life was cerebral palsy (N=6, 18.2 %). It should be noted the high frequency of perinatal encephalopathy among children in this group (100%). Among the violations of psychomotor development we were allocated a syndrome of increased neuro-reflex irritability (restlessness, sleep disturbances, frequent and persistent vomiting) in 3 children (10,5%). The syndrome of autonomic dysfunction remained until 1 year of life in 24 (71,72%) children, premature live births, respectively gestational age was fading reflexes motor automatism, spinal reflexes, had a late start walking, crawling, ability to sit. There was a high frequency of diagnosis of retinopathy and risk of all children observed in the study of the catamnesis, which is natural, as in decompensated MON characteristic for newborns preterm labor, and abnormalities of cerebral blood flow including microcirculation in the body. For infants born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition of the fetus, characterized by high incidence of infectious disease (more than 2 times per year) in 7(21%) children by the end of 1 the first year of life. Allergic reactions manifest in the first year of life are clinically atopic dermatitis in 5 (15,1%), a high frequency which could be explained not only by prematurity at birth, but also the fact that the majority of children in this group were on artificial feeding. Thus, the results of the study showed that children born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition are at high risk of development of neurological pathology, physical, infectious, allergic morbidity, which may further entail the delay of psychomotor, speech development, with a likely outcome in the disability and social maladjustment.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep apnoea in pregnancy is known to adversely affect birth outcomes. Whether in utero exposure to maternal sleep apnoea is associated with long-term childhood consequences is unknown. Methods: Population-based longitudinal study of singleton infants born during 2002 to 2012 was conducted using linked birth, hospital, death, developmental, and educational records from New South Wales, Australia. Maternal sleep apnoea during pregnancy was identified from hospital records. Outcomes were mortality and hospitalisations up to age 6, developmental vulnerability in the 1st year of school (aged 5-6), and performance on standardised tests in the 3rd year of school (aged 7-9). Cox proportional hazards and modified Poisson regression models were used to calculate hazard and risk ratios for outcomes in children exposed to maternal apnoea compared to those not exposed. Results: 209 of 626,188 singleton infants were exposed to maternal sleep apnoea. Maternal apnoea was not significantly associated with mortality (Fisher's exact p = 0.48), developmental vulnerability (adjusted RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.75-2.21), special needs status (1.58; 0.61- 4.07), or low numeracy test scores (1.03; 0.63-1.67) but was associated with low reading test scores (1.55; 1.08-2.23). Maternal apnoea significantly increased hospitalisations in the 1st year of life (adjusted HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.40-2.34) and between the 1st and 6th birthdays (1.41; 1.14-1.75). This is partly due to admissions for suspected paediatric sleep apnoea. Conclusions: Maternal sleep apnoea during pregnancy is associated with poorer childhood health. Its impact on developmental and cognitive outcomes warrants further investigation especially as the impact of treatment for maternal apnoea could not be evaluated in this study.

N2  - Background: A major impediment to the provision of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) treatment is the reliance on sleep physician-led diagnostic laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) which is labour-intensive, costly and has limited availability. A recent study indicated that a new two-stage model of screening questionnaire (OSA50), followed by home oximetry and nasal flow measurement (via the ApneaLink device; AL) might accurately identify patients with moderate to severe symptomatic OSA in primary care (1). This study investigated if a similar method could identify patients with moderatesevere obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in those already referred for polysomnography (PSG). Presented here is preliminary data. Methods: All new referrals to The Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH) Sleep Disorders Centre were assessed for study suitability. Demographics, anthropometrics, Epworth Sleepiness Score, and OSA50 questionnaire were collected. Exclusion criteria included age <18- years old, pregnancy, patients with significant cognitive impairment, poorly controlled psychiatric disorder, those on treatment for OSA or on domiciliary oxygen. Participants underwent concurrent PSG and AL assessments. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed and ROC area under the curve (AUC) was estimated. Progress to Date: The population comprised 34 (62% males) patients with a mean age of 57 (SD 17). 14 (41%) had moderate-severe OSA based on Level 1 PSG. AL apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15 had ROC AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 85%. AL 3% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) >16 had ROC AUC of 0.84, sensitivity 93% and specificity 75%. Composite variables involving AL variables and others anthropometrics measurements, ESS and OSA50 did not improve ROC AUC scores or sensitivity but did improve specificity. Intended Outcome and Impact: This study's preliminary data provides evidence that AL can diagnose moderate-severe OSA in those referred for PSG. This has the potential to lessen the reliance on PSG for OSA diagnosis and shorten time to commence treatment, improve waiting lists for PSG and provide significant cost savings. Data collection is ongoing. Those patients whose AL did not correlate well with PSG are being examined to see if patient factors can predict who requires PSG for diagnosis.

N2  - Background: The systemic injections of methotrexate (MTX) have emerged as an alternative management for women with ectopic pregnancy. It was then documented that ectopic pregnancy was successfully treated with a single intra muscular (IM) injection of MTX [1]. The MTX, an antifolate acting by inhibition of DHF, an enzyme crucial in the metabolism of folic acid, has many side effects that can be observed at high and low doses such as:skin, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic and hematologic toxicity [2]. Objective: We report a case with a rare toxicity of single IM MTX injection (2500mg) where the issue was fatal. Case report: A 37-year-old woman, with a history of arterial hyperten-sion, of penicillin allergy and of a primary sterility treated with ovulation inductor. She suffers also with a sleep apnea syndrome. She received in one dose 25mg/kg of MTX IM to evacuate an ectopic pregnancy diagnosed by 30,000 UI/l beta hCG level. The first two days after, she developed skin lesions: erythema and a rash. She received three injections of corticosteroid therapy in three days. Forty-eight-hours after, the skin lesions got worse associating edema, gingival lesion, accelerating of sedimentation speed and the patient became agitated. A week later, the patient was hospitalized because of a bone marrow aplasia, hepatic cytolysis (4 times upper limit), renal failure (creatinine 370lmol/L) and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She also presented a digestive toxicity associating melena, hematemesis, hemorrhage and vomiting. In addition, our case developed mucositis and bronchial congestion leading to respiratory failure. The plasma level of MTX at hospitalization (day 10) was 0.179 lM. We suspected a MTX intoxication. She was treated by folinic acid, and an empirical antibiotic therapy. She was also transfused by packed of red bloods cells. At day 11, she died after a severe septic shock. Discussion/conclusion: Success rates of single-dose MTX in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy have been reported to be as high as 94%, with lower toxic side effects, fewer complications and better patient acceptance as compared to multi-dose regimens [3]. In our case, we report a many of side effects of MTX with a high single dose (2500mg) IM. The issue was fatal explained with the MTX mecha-nism of acting. By affecting replication of bone marrow cells, MTX induce thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and granulocytopenia leading to life-threatening infections. However, with single dose form of MTX, very low incidence of side effects was reported as mentioned [4]. The first case of life-threatening neutropenia following single dose of MTX (1mg/kg) to treat ectopic pregnancy was reported in 1996 [5]. Also we had a case in our center on 2013 of MTX toxicity with a lower doses and blood concentration on day 11 (0, 05lM) [6]. This case has shown that the toxicity of MTX can be observed with a single high dose. Further sources of information/References.

N2  - Hypertension can originate from early-life insults, whereas maternal melatonin therapy can be protective in a variety of models of programmed hypertension. We hypothesize that melatonin or melatonin receptor agonist agomelatine can prevent programmed hypertension in adult offspring induced by maternal exposure to continuous light. Female Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats randomly divided into four groups: controls, rats exposed to continuous light, exposed to continuous light plus treated with agomelatine (50 mg/day i.p.), and exposed to continuous light plus treated with 0.01% melatonin in drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation period. Male offspring (n = 10/group) from three litters were examined at 12 weeks of age. Maternal continuous light exposure-induced hypertension in male offspring, which was prevented by melatonin or agomelatine therapy. Continuous light exposure did not affect melatonin pathway in adult offspring kidney. Genes that belong to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), sodium transporters, AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and circadian rhythm were potentially involved in the maternal exposure to continuous light-induced programmed hypertension. Maternal agomelatine therapy decreased Ace expression but increased Agtr2 and Mas1. Maternal melatonin therapy prevented the increases of Slc9a3, Slc12a3, and Atp1a1 expression induced by maternal continuous light exposure. In conclusion, maternal melatonin or agomelatine therapy prevents programmed hypertension induced by maternal exposure to continuous light. Agomelatine and melatonin reprogram the RAS and sodium transporters differentially, to prevent negative programming of continuous light. Our data highlight candidate genes and pathways in renal programming as targets for therapeuticapproaches to prevent programmed hypertension caused by early-life disturbance of the circadian rhythm. Summary Sentence Exposure of the mother to continuous light-induced programmed hypertension in adult offspring, which was prevented by maternal agomelatine or melatonin therapy via regulating reninangiotensin system, sodium transporters, AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and circadian rhythm.

N2  - Background and Aim: Epidemiology of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is not well defined. There are a few case series and only one epidemiological research on asymptomatic patients older than 40 years old with IST. However, the prevalence in younger symptomatic patients is not well known. We evaluated 24 hours (h) Holter ECG recordings for IST of patients who has admitted to outpatient clinic for arrhythmic symptoms. Methods: Retrospectively all 24 h Holter ECG recordings from September 2015 to November 2016 were screened. Rhythm, 24 h mean heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were recorded. Patients' medical histories were taken from hospital database. IST is defined as 24 h mean HR over 90 bpm, resting HR over 100 bpm and the absence of secondary causes for sinus tachycardia. Results: During study time 1817 patients had 1922 24 h Holter ECG recordings due to symptoms like palpitation, syncope and dyspnoea. From all, 28 had inadequate recording due to artefacts, 16 had different degrees of Atrio-ventricular blocks, 2 had a pacemaker and 429 had atrial or ventricular premature beats more than >1% of all heart beats in a day. Those patients were excluded. Sinus rhythm was seen in 1357 and 150 had 24h mean HR over 90 bpm. 41 with possible secondary causes of sinus tachycardia like hyperthyroid, anaemia, infection, pregnancy, sleep apnoea, heart failure were excluded. Total 99 patients were included and 33 had resting HR under 100 bpm. Overall 66 patients were defined as IST. Mean age was 40.33 (±18.2) years and 57.6% were female. Mean 24 h HR was 96.84 (±7.28) bpm and mean resting HR was 111.74 (±8.4) bpm. Prevalence of IST in the whole study population was 3.63% and in only patients with sinus rhythm was 4.86 %. We compared IST patients (n=66) with patients with sinus rhythm and 24 h mean HR under 90 bpm (n=799), female patients were higher in IST group (57.6% vs. 43.9% p=0.031) and were younger (40.33±18.21 years vs. 47.32±17.59 years p=0. 046). Also HRV parameters (SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, HRV Triangular index, LF, HF) were lower in IST group. Conclusions: IST is not rare as previously reported. Prevalence is 4.86% among patients with sinus rhythm. It is mostly seen in younger women and they have diminished HRV parameters. IST is known as a benign situation but symptoms limit patients' daily life and there is also a small risk for development of tachycardiomyopathy. Cardiologist must be aware of this situation and they should keep in mind that it is more common than we expected.

N2  - Background/Purpose: The measurement of patient reported outcomes is a priority for patient-centered high value care. This is particularly true in chronic systemic diseases such as SLE, which can have a significant ongoing impact on quality of life. PROMIS instruments are precise, reliable, and valid measures of physical, mental, and social health, but their relevance and potential value in the clinical care of SLE patients has not been explored. The aims of this study were to evaluate SLE patient perspectives on the relevance and potential utility of PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CATs) and PROMIS10. Methods: Adult outpatients meeting 1997 ACR SLE classification criteria were recruited from an SLE Center of Excellence. Subjects completed 12 PROMIS CATs, the PROMIS10, and participated in focus groups (women) or structured interviews (men). Focus groups and interviews explored the relevance of PROMIS domains, the potential value of PROMIS instruments in routine medical care, and identified missing domains. Transcripts were analyzed for recurring themes and concepts using grounded theory. Results: Twenty eight women and 4 men with SLE participated in 4 focus groups and structured interviews (table 1). Participants reported that PROMIS instruments, especially CATs, reflected their experience with lupus, with women prioritizing domains of fatigue, pain interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, and cognitive abilities as most relevant, and men selecting fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, pain interference, and pain behavior. Subjects identified body image, intimate relationships, pregnancy, and relationships with providers as important areas not addressed by PROMIS. Participants were enthusiastic about using PROMIS in their medical care, citing utility in validating their experience, tracking symptoms and disease progression, facilitating communication with providers, and guiding treatment plans. A recurring theme in the focus groups and interviews was the importance of doctors reviewing the survey results. Conclusion: SLE patients endorse PROMIS instruments as relevant, valuable, and potentially useful in improving clinical care. These data identify domains of importance to SLE patients, including men's greater emphasis on mental health, and areas where there is a need to develop PROMIS instruments. Further longitudinal studies are essential to explore how to most effectively integrate PROMIS measures in routine clinical care. (Table presented).

N2  - PURPOSE: Obstructive Sleep pnea (OSA) and insomnia are often conceptualized and treated as two separate sleep disorders in the primary care setting. While in some cases this is true, studies have shown that 30-70% of patients treated for OSA also exhibited symptoms of insomnia. To date, there are no published reports that study how Insomnia and OSA are assessed in the primary clinical setting and if co-morbid diseases affect time to diagnose OSA. Our hypothesis is that there is a delay in referral for a sleep study to diagnose OSA for patients treated for Insomnia with associated specific co-morbidities. METHODS: We performed a rretrospective chart review of 78 patients referred to our institution's sleep laboratory from primary care clinics between 01/01/11 and 12/31/16 for a sleep study. Inclusion criteria were participants > 18 years old, and have a diagnosis of both OSA and Insomnia. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, chronic, severe mental disorders, and/or history of a Substance Use Disorder. Comorbidities were categorized into four domains: Respiratory (Asthma, COPD, Nasal Allergies); Cardiovascular (HTN, CVA, CAD; Endocrine/GI (DM, GERD, Thyroid Disease) and Nervous (Anxiety, Depression, Seizures). A Multiple Regression was performed to assess the magnitude of the relationships between the predictor variables; age, gender, ethnic group, Body Mass Index (BMI), and comorbidities with the outcome variable time to referral for a sleep study in days. Significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: There were 24 men (30.8%) and 54 women (69.2%), with an average age of 53.9 years, SD = 11.85, and average BMI of 36.66, SD = 9.02 . Patients identified as 41% Black, 41% White, 1.3% Hispanic, and 16.7% as Other. The Multiple Regression performed explained 25% of the variance for time to diagnosis of OSA. The overall test of the regression model was significant (F=2.86, p=0.008). Of the predictor variables, BMI was significant and negative (t=-0.065, p=0.008). Of the comorbidities, endocrine and GI disorders was significant (t=0.448, p=0.05), as well as contributed the greatest weight to time of diagnosis of OSA. Interestingly, respiratory disorders had a negative effect on time to diagnosis although the result was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in the primary care setting, patients who have insomnia, a delay in the diagnosis of OSA was the longest in patients suffering from endocrine and GI (especially GERD) and shortest in those with increased BMI. Patients suffering from cardiovascular and neurological/psychiatric conditions were in the middle. No referral bias based on age, gender, race was dobserved.

N2  - Preterm birth (PTB) occurs among 1:11 U.S. white women and 1:7.5 African American women and is a significant driver of racial disparities in infant mortality. Maternal stress is the most common clinical phenotype underlying spontaneous PTB. Specific patterns of stress and biological mediators driving PTB remain unclear. We examined the effect of childhood stress on birth timing among African American women and evaluated maternal cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. A prospective observational design was employed, with a single study visit at 28–32 weeks gestation and medical record review. The Stress and Adversity Inventory was administered, which provides a comprehensive estimate of childhood stress, stress in adulthood, and five core characteristic subscales (interpersonal loss, physical danger, humiliation, entrapment, role disruption). Venipuncture was performed between 11:00am and 4:00pm and plasma cortisol quantified by ELISA. Analyses controlled for stress in adulthood. Among a final sample of 89, cumulative childhood stress predicted birth timing (p = 0.01). The association was driven by stress related to interpersonal loss and physical danger, with support for maternal cortisol as a biological mediator (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.045]; ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.043], respectively). Results were similar, overall, in sub-group analyses among spontaneously laboring women (n = 53); however, role disruption arose as an additional predictor, as mediated by cortisol elevations (ab = 0.03, 95% CI [0.005, 0.074]). Of note, cortisol was no longer supported as a mediator linking physical danger to birth timing after adjusting for sleep quality and hours awake prior to venipuncture (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [−0.0001, 0.046]). We provide preliminary evidence that, independent of stress in adulthood, childhood stress of specific core characteristics may shape birth timing, with cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. Further investigation is warranted and may bolster the development of biologically-informed screening tools for the prediction and targeted prevention of stress-related PTB.

N2  - 20-year-old girl with history of prematurity born at 32 weeks of gestation, developmental delay and regression, cerebral palsy, spastic quadripararesis, and cerebral palsy diagnosed at age 2-21/2 years. In the past 6-7 years, the patient has developed episodes of tonic posturing mostly induced by excitement, stimulation, and feeding which may occur on a daily basis and lasting about 10 seconds in duration. There is no history of infantile spasms, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures or myoclononus. Patient admitted for long-term video EEG monitoring to characterize the patient's clinical spells and to rule rout underlying epileptic etiology for her symptoms. The patient was not on any anticonvulsant medications during this admission. During sleep, specially on second night of admission when sleep portion was obtained, there were clusters of numerous brief tonic spasms out of asleep. They lasted under 10 seconds in duration and consisted of either bilateral or unilateral (left) arm posturing when the patient raised arms above her head. EEG showed a brief burst of generalized delta activity lasting 1-2 seconds in duration (1-2 hertz, 100-120 microvolts) followed by diffuse rhythmic theta activity lasting 4-10 seconds in duration. The pattern was consistent with remnant of infantile spasms with a component of tonic seizures. The tonic seizures during sleep were not detected by the patient's family.

N2  - Objectives: The prevalence of suicide in Japanese adolescents is increasing, and suicide is the second leading cause of death among that age group. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of suicide ideation and its predictive factors in Japanese school-age children. Methods: A population-based questionnaire survey was performed in 22,419 school-age children (aged 13-18 years) to investigate their recognition of adolescent health promotion. This survey covered representative regions belonging to urban, suburban, and rural areas in Japan. The questionnaire included 28 questions regarding adolescents' worries related to parents, friends, and siblings, as well as sleep habits, suicide ideation, emotional status, information related to sexual activity (sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, contraception), and other information. Results: The prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempts are 21.7 and 3.5 percent in male adolescents and 28.7 and 6.7 percent in female adolescents, respectively. The prevalence of both suicide ideation and suicide attempts increases in tandem with the school grade. Suicide ideations were significantly associated with the experience of cyberbullying, lower number of friends, and less communication with family. Furthermore, worries about bullying, friends, sexual identity, and relationship with parents were also associated with ideation. Worries about school achievement and academic career were also associated but not to a great degree. Feelings of happiness, loneliness, and healthiness of adolescents showed significant relations with ideation. Conclusions: These results indicated that suicidal ideation is a common experience among adolescents, and many factors are associated with such ideation. Knowledge and awareness of the associations between these predictors and adolescents' suicide ideation are important for health providers and adolescents' families to be able to conduct effective suicide prevention.

N2  - Background: There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of primary interventions aiming to prevent excess weight gain among young children. Evaluating behavioral changes, such as physical activity (PA), may add to future development of efficient interventions. The objective was to evaluate the effect on PA outcomes of the 15 month Healthy Start intervention that focused on changing diet, PA, sleep and stress management among normal weight but obesity-prone preschool children. Children were defined as obesity-prone if they had a birth weight > 4,000 g, mothers with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of > 28 kg/m2, or mothers with 10 years of schooling. Method: From a baseline study population of 635 normal weight 2–6 year old preschool children from the greater Copenhagen area, parents of 307 children had given information on PA at both the baseline and follow-up examinations. PA was obtained from a 7 days recording in the Children’s Physical Activity Questionnaire. Time used for sport activities were combined with outdoor playing time to achieve a proxy of total PA level of moderate to vigorous intensity. Results: Linear regression analyses revealed that at follow-up the intervention group spent more time on sports and outdoor activities combined per week than the control group (ITT analyses: intervention: 400 min/week; 95% confidence interval (CI): 341, 459 versus control: 321 min/week; 95% CI: 277, 366; p = 0.02), although no significant intervention effects were seen for each of the subcategories, e.g. sports participation, outdoor activities, screen time, or commuting frequency. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the overall time spent on sports and outdoor activities combined was increased at follow-up among normal weight obesity-prone children, as a result of the Healthy Start intervention. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01583335.

N2  - One of the major health burden nowadays is represented by obesity. Although it's generally recognized the fact that we are living in an obesogenic environment and that sedentarism became very common, many cases of obesity could not be managed by caloric restrictions and an increase of physical activity. As in many other domains of ourlife, it seems that genetics is playing a very important role, representing, after someauthors, from 40 to 70% or the etiology of obesity. First of all, there are proofs that rhythm disturbances that appear during pregnancy may lead to programming defectswhich may become manifest later in life: behavioral problems, blood hypertension,metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, obesity. Maternal circadian rhythms influencefetal rhythms and entrain them to the light-dark cycle, thus they may determine the infants circadian time organization later in life. The regulation of energy balance has an afferent system with a long-Term regulation (ghrelin and serum leptin receptor having orexigenic activity and leptin, obestatin and insulin having an anorexigenic activity) and also with a short-Term regulation, with anorexigenic agents: Apolipoprotein, cholecystokinin, PYY, pancreatic polypeptide, oxyntomodulin, amylin, serotonine, all of them not only interconnected, but also having genetic determinations. So, it became evident that gene therapy represents a newer modality to curtail weight gain and adiposity for extended periods, thereby increasing not only the quality of life, but also the life span.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed obesity prevention among low-income families whose infants are at increased obesity risk. We tested a Facebook peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting healthy infant growth.
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant women (Medicaid insured, BMI ≥25 kg/m2) were randomized to the Grow2Gether intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants joined a private Facebook group of 9-13 women from 2 months before delivery until infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being. Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using quasi-least-squares regression.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9 months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group (p = 0.01, effect size = 0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding beliefs or infant weight-for-length.
CONCLUSIONS: A social media peer-group intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in families with infants at high risk of obesity.

N2  - Aim: To transcultural adapt and analyze the reliability of Spanish version of Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI) and assess the prevalence of pregnancy symptoms in Spanish pregnant women. Materials and methods: A subsample of 120 healthy pregnant women answered the PSI twice and a sample of 280 report the prevalence and limitation of pregnancy symptoms. The reliability was examined by means of percent agreement and weighted Kappa coefficients. The prevalence of pregnancy symptoms was evaluated by the frequency of answers. Results: Perfect and perfect-acceptable agreement was observed in 82% and 96% of the pregnant women, respectively. Weighted Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.589 to 0.889, indicating a good reliability. The most frequent symptoms perceived by Spanish pregnant women were urinary frequency, poor sleep, increased vaginal discharge and tiredness. Conclusion: Spanish Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory is a brief, conceptually equivalent and satisfactory reliable tool that allows an early assessment of the wide range of pregnancy symptoms in the health care practices.

N2  - The long-term consequences of early life nicotine exposure are poorly defined. Approximately 8-10% of women report smoking during pregnancy, and this may promote aberrant development in the offspring. To this end, we investigated potential enduring effects of perinatal nicotine exposure on murine sleep and affective behaviors in adulthood (~13-15 wk of age) in C57Bl6j mice. Mothers received a water bottle containing 200 µg/ml nicotine bitartrate dihydrate in 2% wt/vol saccharin or pH-matched 2% saccharin with 0.2% (vol/vol) tartaric acid throughout pregnancy and before weaning. Upon reaching adulthood, offspring were tested in the open field and elevated plus maze, as well as the forced swim and sucrose anhedonia tests. Nicotine-exposed male (but not female) mice had reduced mobility in the open field, but no differences were observed in anxiety-like or depressive-like responses. Upon observing this male-specific phenotype, we further assessed sleep-wake states via wireless EEG/EMG telemetry. Following baseline recording, we assessed whether mice exposed to nicotine altered their homeostatic response to 5 h of total sleep deprivation and whether nicotine influenced responses to a powerful somnogen [i.e., lipopolysaccharides (LPS)]. Males exposed to perinatal nicotine decreased the percent time spent awake and increased time in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, without changes to REM sleep. Nicotine-exposed males also displayed exaggerated responses (increased time asleep and NREM spectral power) to sleep deprivation. Nicotine-exposed animals additionally had blunted EEG slow-wave responses to LPS administration. Together, our data suggest that perinatal nicotine exposure has long-lasting effects on normal sleep and homeostatic sleep processes into adulthood.

N2  - Objectives Modern technology may have desensitised the ‘biological clock’ to environmental cues, disrupting the appropriate co-ordination of metabolic processes. Susceptibility to misalignment of circadian rhythms may be partly genetically influenced and effects on sleep quality and duration could predispose to poorer health outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is associated with obesity traits, which are brought on by an increased opportunity to eat and/or a shift of hormonal profile promoting hunger. We hypothesised that increased sleep duration will offset susceptible genetic effects, resulting in reduced obesity risk. Methods We recruited 643 (male: 338; female: 305) European children born to participants in the New Zealand centre of the International Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints sleep study. Ten genes directly involved in the circadian rhythm machinery and a further 20 genes hypothesised to be driven by cyclic oscillations were evaluated by Sequenom assay. Multivariable regression was performed to test the interaction between gene variants and average sleep length (derived from actigraphy), in relation to obesity traits (body mass index (BMI) z-scores and percentage body fat (PBF)). Results No association was found between average sleep length and BMI z-scores (p = 0.056) or PBF (p = 0.609). Uncorrected genotype associations were detected between STAT-rs8069645 (p = 0.0052) and ADIPOQ-rs266729 (p = 0.019) with differences in average sleep duration. Evidence for uncorrected gene-by-sleep interactions of the CLOCK-rs4864548 (p = 0.0039), PEMT-936108 (p = 0.016) and GHRELIN-rs696217 (p = 0.046) were found in relation to BMI z-scores but not for PBF. Conclusion Our results indicate that children may have different genetic susceptibility to the effects of sleep duration on obesity. Further confirmatory studies are required in other population cohorts of different age groups.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a potential risk factor for pregnancy-induced complications. Aim: The present study investigated the relationship between SDB and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), by examining nocturnal sleep and respiratory conditions in pregnant women with and those without obesity. Methods: The study involved 14 pregnant women with body mass index (BMI: kg/m2 ) ≥ 30 (mean age, 31.6 years; group 1), 15 pregnant women with BMI < 30 (32.9 years; group 2) at their 37 week of pregnancy, and 30 non-pregnant women (control). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data were collected using the following devices: 1) a portable screening device to detect sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, as indicated by respiratory disturbance index (RDI), 2) a pulse oximeter to measure oxygen saturation (SpO2), 3) a single-channel portable electroencephalograph acquisition system to evaluate sleep stage and quality, and 4) a photo-plethysmograph recorder to record nocturnal parasympathetic nerve activity. Results: Significant differences (all p < 0.05) were observed among the groups for RDI (median: 10.4 [group 1], 7.1 [group 2], 3.5 [control]). Significantly lower SpO2 values were observed in group 1 than in group 2 and control (median: 95.1, 96.6, and 96.5%, respectively). Worsened sleep quality was observed in groups 1 and 2 than in control. Furthermore, group 1 tend to have decreased stability in parasympathetic nerve activity, and 50% of these women developed PIH, whereas group 2 did not develop PIH. Conclusion: SDB and unstable parasympathetic nerve activity may contribute to the development of PIH.

N2  - The Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) National Registry is fully operative (https:www.registronmd.it) with collection of clinical/genetic information (minimal dataset) and reporting of clinical scales; 537 CMT patients have registered thus far and have chosen one of the 9 reference centers; information collected during the ad hoc visit have been entered in the Registry for 420 of them. Registered patients have the chance to participate to a study that requires filling online self-reported questionnaires related to five important issues: disease course and complications during pregnancy; use, efficacy and tolerability of orthotics and assistive devices; outcome of surgery for skeletal deformities; safety of anesthesia; occurrence of sleep disorders (including evaluation of fatigue, anxiety and depression). By February 2016, 201 patients and 36 relatives/friends (as healthy controls) have filled the questionnaires. We are performing a first explorative analysis of results, but data collection on all questionnaires will be prolonged until Novemebr 30, 2017, to obtain a larger sample. Pregnancy: 46/73 CMT women had at least one pregnancy; complications ranging from mild to severe occurred in 44/108 pregnancies vs 9/42 in controls. CMT worsened in 7 pregnancies (6 patients) with no recovery in 5 instances. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 8/108 pregnancies. Satisfaction related to surgical procedures for foot deformities, assessed with VAS (score 0-10), was 6.4±3.5 (n = 110). Repeat surgery was required in 9/72 instances. Sleep: the Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire revealed abnormalities of sleep in 44/142 CMT patients (31%) and in 5/30 controls (17%). The vast majority of CMT subjects (123/138; mean 9.1 ± 3.2), but also of controls (27/30; 8.6 ±2.9) were not good sleepers according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (range 0-21, 0 good sleep). Fatigue: scores of Modified-Fatigue Impact Scale (range 0-82, 0 no fatigue) were higher for CMT (mean 33±18.2) than controls (mean 16.6±12.5). Hospital Scale for Anxiety and Depression: 63/138 CMT subjects had mild-to-severe anxiety and 35/138 mild-to-severe depression as compared to 7/29 and 4/29 controls, respectively. Data analysis on orthotics and anesthesia is ongoing. In conclusion, the first data analyses confirm that there are problems related to all the five domains explored, that will need to be specifically addressed in patients' care.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that sleep disorder diagnosis would be associated with increased risk of preterm birth and to examine risk by gestational age, preterm birth type, and specific sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep apnea, movement disorder, and other). METHODS: In this observational study, participants were from a cohort of nearly 3 million women in California between 2007 and 2012. Inclusion criteria were women with singleton neonates liveborn between 20 and 44 weeks of gestation without chromosomal abnormalities or major structural birth defects linked to a hospital discharge database maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development and without mental illness during pregnancy. Sleep disorder was defined based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code (n=2,265). Propensity score matching was used to select a referent population at a one-to-one ratio. Odds of preterm birth were examined by gestational age (less than 34 weeks, 34-36 weeks, and less than 37 weeks of gestation) and type (spontaneous, indicated). RESULTS: Prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) was 10.9% in the referent group compared with 14.6% among women with a recorded sleep disorder diagnosis. Compared with the referent group, odds (95% CI, P value, percentage) of preterm birth were 1.3 (1.0-1.7, P=.023, 14.1%) for insomnia and 1.5 (1.2-1.8, P<.001, 15.5%) for sleep apnea. Risk varied by gestational age and preterm birth type. Odds of preterm birth were not significantly increased for sleep-related movement disorders or other sleep disorders. CONCLUSION: Insomnia and sleep apnea were associated with significantly increased risk of preterm birth. Considering the high prevalence of sleep disorders during pregnancy and availability of evidence-based nonpharmacologic interventions, current findings suggest that screening for severe presentations would be prudent.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy is one of the most common background factors of sleep disorders. Sleep disorders can cause physical and psychological problems in pregnant women and may also cause some problems for fetus. This study was performed with aim to determine the relationship between sleep disorders during pregnancy with premature labor and low birth weight (LBW). Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was performed in 2012 on 400 pregnant women at third trimester who continuously referred to the Ganjavian hospital in Dezful. Data collection tools were the questionnaire of demographic and obstetrics information and the standard questionnaires of Intensity Sleepiness Index, Sleepiness Scale, Pitisburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 19) and Chi-square test. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The frequency of sleep disorders at third trimester of pregnancy was 63% that significant relationship was found between sleep disorders at third trimester of pregnancy and preterm labor (p=0.038), but there was no significant relationship with LBW (p=0.617). Conclusion: There is a relationship between sleep disorders at third trimester of pregnancy and some undesirable outcomes of pregnancy such as preterm labor, so performing the needed measurements to treat sleep disorders can avoid these kinds of pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Research has demonstrated that exposure to violence and adversity has negative effects on both mental health and biobehavioral outcomes, such as sleep health. Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant women.
METHOD: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed. Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was used to evaluate direct and indirect effects.
RESULTS: Findings indicated that while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however, indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma. That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term mental health difficulties associated with early trauma.

N2  - Background Psychosocial stress during pregnancy has been proposed as a major contributor of glucocorticoid-mediated programming of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, with later adverse health consequences. However, evidence linking maternal stress to maternal cortisol values during pregnancy is inconclusive. A possible explanation for this is that other maternal factors overshadow any potential effects of stress on cortisol levels. We studied a large cohort of pregnant women with extensive data on pregnancy characteristics to determine the respective contributions of biological, environmental and psychosocial stress factors to cortisol levels in pregnancy. Methods We used data from 3039 women from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development-study cohort. Serum cortisol was measured in blood, collected at the first prenatal visit, at different gestational ages (median = 91 days, range = 40–256 days), and at various time points during the day (median = 11:45 h, range = 08:00–18:30 h). We assessed associations between maternal serum cortisol in pregnancy and biological factors, lifestyle factors and stress factors, including depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, work stress, parenting stress and fatigue. Results In multivariable analysis, variables that were associated with higher cortisol levels in pregnancy were lower maternal age [1.5 nmol/l, 95%CI (0.6–2.4)], being nulliparous [21.5 nmol/l (15.9–27.1)], lower pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) [1.3 nmol/l (0.3–2.4)], higher C-reactive protein (CRP) [1.0 nmol/l (0.4–1.5)], carrying a female fetus [9.2 nmol/l (1.8–16.5)], non-smoking [14.2 nmol/l (0.6–27.7)], sufficient sleep [8.5 nmol/l (0.9–16.1)], and being unemployed [12.7 nmol/l (2.2–23.2)]. None of the psychosocial stressors was significantly associated with serum cortisol levels in pregnancy. A total of 32% of all variance in cortisol was explained by gestational age, maternal age, time of day, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, CRP, fetal sex, smoking behavior, self-reported sleep sufficiency, and employment. Conclusions Our data suggest that maternal cortisol during pregnancy is mainly affected by biological and lifestyle factors, but not by psychosocial factors. We suggest that psychosocial stress in pregnancy might program the fetus through other mechanisms than through altering maternal cortisol levels.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Chronodisruption is an alteration in the human biological clock caused by sleep cycle disturbance, and has been implicated in chronic disease states such as cancer and obesity by causing metabolic derangements. The objective of this study was to assess the potential impact of chronodisruption on antral follicle count. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 135 women aged 18-44 with regular menstrual cycles were included. Women who were pregnant or who had a history of infertility, ovarian surgery, or major chronic illness were excluded. Patients completed a detailed lifestyle survey that included information regarding shift work and sleep and wake times on workdays and non-workdays. Antral follicle count (AFC) was obtained by transvaginal ultrasound. The mid-cycle sleep point was calculated for workdays and non-workdays as described in the validated Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) and the difference between the two was determined.1 If a 0.5 hour difference or greater in mid-cycle sleep point occurred, patients were classified as chronodisrupted. Chisquare and student's t-test were used to determine association among categorical and continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to control for confounding variables. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. RESULTS: Participants were a mean age of 31.1 ± 6.7 years, had a mean BMI of 28.1 ±7.3 kg/m2 and mean AFC of 26.7 ± 14.1. Mean difference in mid-cycle sleep point was 0.34 ± 0.72 hours. Shift workers (n=23) did not have a higher incidence of chronodisruption thannon-shiftworkers in this cohort (p=0.413). BMI and smoking were not associated with AFC. AFC was divided into tertiles, with the lowest tertile defined as<20. After controlling for age and BMI, chrono disrupted patients were significantly more likely to be in the lowest tertile and have an AFC <20 (p=0.04) (OR 3.17, 95%CI 1.06-9.52). CONCLUSIONS: Chronodisruption is associated with a lower AFC. Sleep cycle disturbances demonstrated by variation in mid-cycle sleep point has been shown to disrupt circadian rhythms and subsequently melatonin secretion. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that has a protective effect at the level of the ovary.2 Chronodisruption may contribute to decreased nocturnal melatonin secretion, leading to increased oxidative stress within the ovary. This is one potential mechanism contributing to the negative impact of chronodisruption on AFC as a marker of ovarian reserve.

N2  - Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common during pregnancy. This study investigated the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered in pregnancy. Thirteen pregnant women with insomnia participated in five weekly CBT-I group sessions. All participants completed the study and provided baseline and follow-up data. Significant reductions in insomnia symptoms and increases in subjective sleep quality were observed over the course of the study. Diary and actigraphy assessments of sleep also changed, such that participants reported less time in bed (TIB), shorter sleep onset latency (SOL), increased sleep efficiency (SE), and increased subjective total sleep time (TST). Additionally, symptoms of depression, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and fatigue all decreased over the course of treatment. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. CBT-I delivered during pregnancy was associated with significant improvements in sleep and mood. The next step in this area of inquiry is to better establish effectiveness via a randomized controlled trial.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the quality of women's sleep and outcomes in assisted reproductive technology DESIGN: A questionnaire survey study MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey questionnaire was conducted during June and July 2016, involving 208 patients, who had undergone Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment and consented to fill out a questionnaire. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) ranging from level 0 to 21 was used to evaluate quality of sleep, by measuring subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and any related daytime dysfunction during the previous month. The questionnaire also included questions regarding their duration of infertility, sensitivity to cold (especially in the extremities, such as feet and hands), job classification such as full-time, part-time or shiftwork, and occasional and/or moderate alcohol consumption. The PSQI was divided into three categories: a total score of “5” or less indicated no sleep difficulties; “6-8” indicated mild difficulties; “9” or more indicated severe difficulties. Based on the collected responses to the above questions, a statistical comparison of ART outcomes, in three PSQI categories, was performed by Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was subsequently conducted to assess the association of the conditions in the questions with ART outcomes, as represented by fertilization rates per ovum pick-up and blastocyst development rates. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with a total score of “5” or less (Group A) was 65.1% (136/209), with a total score of “6-8” (Group B) was 26.8% (56/209), and a total score of “9” or more (Group C) was 8.1% (17/209). Fertilization rates among the retrieved oocytes in Groups A, B and C were 67.1%, 63.1% and 48.6% respectively and a statistically significant association between PSQI categories and fertilization rates was detected (p=0.0018). Blastocyst development rates among the fertilized oocytes in Groups A, B and C were 62.9%, 57.1% and 48.4% respectively. The statistical difference of p=0.087 narrowly missed a technical classification of statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis identified that a lifestyle PSQI score of '5' or less and occasional and/or moderate alcohol consumption were significant predictors of successful fertilization. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey questionnaire found that a low quality of sleep has a negative impact on fertilization rates. Good sleep patterns can be one of the important daily habits for patients to improve their response to fertility treatments and increase their chances of pregnancy. Interestingly, occasional and/or moderate alcohol consumption had a positive impact on fertilization. This may be due to the beneficial effects of a moderate amount of alcohol, such as stress-relief and sleep-induction.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring is known to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes among both men and non-pregnant women. We examined the association of habitual snoring during early pregnancy with risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: A cohort of 1,579 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about snoring frequency during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic tests for IGT and GDM were abstracted from medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of IGT and GDM associated with snoring in early pregnancy. Results: Overall, women who snored “most or all of the time” had a 2.1-fold increased odds of IGT (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.31–3.35) and a 2.5-fold increased odds of GDM (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.34–4.67) as compared with women who never snored. Compared with lean women (pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2) who did not snore, lean snorers had a 2-fold increased odds of GDM (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.07–3.68). The odds of GDM risk was particularly elevated among overweight women (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) who snored (OR = 5.01; 95% CI 2.71–9.26). However, there was no evidence of an interaction between overweight and snoring with GDM risk (p-value = 0.144). Conclusions: These findings, if confirmed, may have important implications for tailoring prenatal care for overweight pregnant women, and /or those with a history of habitual snoring in early pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Using wrist worn wearable sensors, we assessed the differences in temperature, pulse rate, and heart rate variability ratio in early pregnancy compared to those of non-conceptive cycle late luteal phase. DESIGN: This is an intermediate analysis of a prospective longitudinal observational study conducted at the Department of Reproductive Endocrinology at the University Hospital Zurich. We included eumenorrheic, healthy, non-pregnant women, between 20 and 40 years old, who aimed for a pregnancy. Potential behavioral confounders were self-reported by the participants using an electronic diary. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants wore Ava bracelet (Ava AG, Zürich) which measures temperature, pulse rate, and heart rate variability ratio among other physiological parameters. Heart rate variability ratio is defined as the ratio between Low frequency/high frequency components resulting from the analysis of beat-to-beat variation in heart pulses. Day to day activities are known to affect all the aforementioned physiological parameters, hence, the participants wore the bracelet during sleep and the measurements were recorded. An LH home urine test was used to estimate the ovulation day. The late luteal phase was defined as ovulation+7 to the end of the cycle for the non-conceptive cycles. While for the conceptive cycles the early pregnancy period was considered as ovulation+10 to ovulation+18. The associations were evaluated using linear mixed effects models with a random intercept for the respective participant. RESULTS:We included 21 conceptive cycles and 137 non-conceptive cycles in the analysis. In comparison to the late luteal phase of nonconceptive cycles, early pregnancy was characterized by a significant increase in pulse rate (2.1 beats per minute, standard error (SE) 0.6), and a lower heart rate variability ratio (-0.15, SE 0.05). In addition, we observed an 0.2 ° Celsius elevation in skin temperature, however with a higher SE of 0.1, which could be due to the limited number of cases we observed. CONCLUSIONS: Current wearable sensors are capable of capturing known pregnancy associated physiological changes. Our findings could pave the way for the continuous assessment of the occurrence of pregnancy without any effort from the user and consequently add an innovative option for early pregnancy detection in a personal, clinical and scientific context.

Separate longitudinal parallel process models were calculated for each sleep state (active and quiet sleep) and growth (weight, length and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores) variable to estimate the associations between their developmental trajectories.Results:Significant associations were identified between the trajectories of quiet sleep and weight, active sleep and weight, quiet sleep and BMI, and active sleep and BMI. No statistically meaningful associations were identified between the trajectories of early childhood length and the preterm sleep states.Conclusion:Faster preterm period sleep development appears to predict more favorable early childhood growth trajectories, particularly for weight, indicating preterm sleep may be an important biomarker for subsequent growth outcomes.

N2  - This article uses the case of pregnancy testing in Britain to investigate the process whereby new and often controversial reproductive technologies are made visible and normalized in mainstream entertainment media. It shows how in the 1980s and 1990s the then nascent product placement industry was instrumental in embedding pregnancy testing in British cinema and television's dramatic productions. In this period, the pregnancy-test close-up became a conventional trope and the thin blue lines associated with Unilever's Clearblue rose to prominence in mainstream consumer culture. This article investigates the aestheticization of pregnancy testing and shows how increasingly visible public concerns about 'schoolgirl mums', abortion and the biological clock, dramatized on the big and small screen, propelled the commercial rise of Clearblue. It argues that the Clearblue close-up ambiguously concealed as much as it revealed; abstraction, ambiguity and flexibility were its keys to success.

N2  - Background: Infants born to asthmatic mothers have higher risk of bronchiolitis and inflammometry (eNO)-guided asthma management during pregnancy reduced parentreported bronchiolitis episodes at 12 months of age (Mattes et al Thorax 2013). The mechanisms for this effect are unknown. Objective: To test for an association between infant lung function at 6 weeks of age and the development of bronchiolitis in the first 6 months of life in a cohort of babies born to women with asthma during pregnancy. Methods: We performed tidal breathing volume loop (TBVL) measurements during quiet sleep in infants born to mother with asthma who participated in an ongoing multi-centre RCT of eNO-guided asthma management vs usual care, focussing on perinatal outcomes (Breathing for Life Trial). Results: 262 babies were recruited to date, 229 attended a clinical assessment, and 204 remained in quiet sleep during testing. 171 TBVL procedure were attempted (47% female; age 6 weeks, SD 1.3), 149 (87%) tests were technically acceptable. At the time of abstract submission, 107 were 6 months old and 34 of these infants had at least one episode of bronchiolitis and their mean PTEF/TE at 6 weeks of age was 27.49 (SD 7.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.1 to 29.9). In infants who had not developed bronchiolitis, mean PTEF/TE was 32.26 (SD 9.5; 95% CI 30.3 to 33.2). Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that lung function in early life affects bronchiolitis risk and that the preventative effect of eNO-guided asthma management during pregnancy on bronchiolitis could be associated with higher PTEF/TE.

N2  - Objectives: Hypoxia plays an important role in pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and in turn may result from persisting apnea and attenuated control of breathing during sleep. Our aim was to evaluate breathing patterns in preterm infants with BPD and PH at 35-43 weeks of postmenstrual age. Methods: Cardiorespiratory monitoring was performed in 29 preterm infants with BPD born at 23-31 weeks of gestation. Ten patients (4 with moderate and 6 with severe BPD) had PH. Infants were monitored just before discharge at 35-43 weeks of post-menstrual age (had not been routinely monitored for at least 5 days, had not been receiving oxygen for at least 8 days). AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events criteria were used. Results: Infants with BPD and PH were characterized by lower average SpO2 (92.4(89.0-96.0)%) compared to infants without PH (97.2(92.3-98.7)%) (p<0.001). Apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) and desaturation index did not differ between PH+ (5.9(0.4-27.6) and 48.9(29.5-133.5)) and PH-(6.8(0.0-38.6), p=0.2 and 27.6(1.0-98.0), p=0.9) groups. Majority of apnea were central and there was no difference in various apnea types occurrence between groups. Average apnea duration was 7.1(4.0-20.0) and 5.6(0.0-13.2) seconds, respectively, p>0.05. In 9 infants with PH apnea were accompanied by SpO2 falls into 81-90%, while in 14 infants without PH SpO2 during all apnea was >90%. Conclusion: Premature infants with BPD who had developed PH demonstrated lower average SpO2, but similar apnea characteristics compared to those with normal pulmonary artery pressure at the time of discharge.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder that often is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Patients with RLS describe an urge to move their legs, especially in the evenings and during periods of inactivity. The prevalence of clinically significant RLS is approximately 2% to 3% in adults in Europe and North America. RLS can be an independent disorder or may occur in conjunction with other conditions (eg, iron deficiency, pregnancy, chronic renal failure). Diagnosis is based on clinical history. Routine polysomnography typically is not recommended unless there is suspicion of other sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Management includes a combination of supportive measures, dopaminergic drugs, gabapentinoids, opioids, or benzodiazepines. Good sleep hygiene can help prevent development of insomnia related to RLS. Avoiding alcohol and reducing caffeine intake is recommended. If iron stores are low, iron supplementation may improve symptoms. The main pharmacologic options for RLS management are dopaminergic agonists (eg, pramipexole and ropinirole); gabapentinoids also are good options. Patients may experience augmentation, an increase in RLS symptom severity with increasing drug dosage, which is the main complication of dopaminergic drugs. There is no evidence to support use of vibratory devices that provide stimulation to the lower extremities.

N2  - Introduction Treatment of mild to moderate hypertension might not benefit maternal or fetal outcome. This pessimistic point of view may have come about by using non-validated methods for measuring blood pressure in pregnancy combined with inadequate methodology for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring effects. Aim To determine the association between AASI in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and preeclampsia, and to assess the ability of AASI to diagnose preeclampsia. Material and methods Repeated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed three times during pregnancy and once three months postpartum in 151 women with T1DM and 50 control women without diabetes. Circadian rhythm was evaluated as the night day ratio, night blood pressure divided by day blood pressure. Results Of the T1DM women, 33 developed preeclampsia, which was associated with AASI in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.05). The best predictor of preeclampsia in T1DM was an AASI of 0.35. The diurnal blood pressure was significantly higher in all trimesters in women who later had preeclampsia. A flattened circadian rhythm was present in T1DM women with preeclampsia compared to women without preeclampsia (night-day ratio: systole 2nd trimester: 0.94 ± 0.07 vs. 0.91 ± 0.05, women with and without preeclampsia, respectively, p = 0.015; diastole 2nd trimester: 0.89 ± 0.07 vs. 0.85 ± 0.07, p = 0.003). AASI was higher during pregnancy compared to postpartum in women with T1DM (0.31 ± 0.16, 0.31 ± 0.16 and 0.33 ± 0.18 vs. 0.25 ± 0.17; 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester vs. postpartum). Conclusion Women with T1DM and preeclampsia demonstrate increased arterial stiffness and had early manifestations in the non-dipping of blood pressure.

N2  - Objective Our goal is to test the efficacy of a family-based, multi-component intervention focused on infants of African-American (AA) mothers and families, a minority population at elevated risk for pediatric obesity, versus a child safety attention-control group to promote healthy weight gain patterns during the first two years of life. Design, participants, and methods The design is a two-group randomized controlled trial among 468 AA pregnant women in central North Carolina. Mothers and study partners in the intervention group receive anticipatory guidance on breastfeeding, responsive feeding, use of non-food soothing techniques for infant crying, appropriate timing and quality of complementary feeding, age-appropriate infant sleep, and minimization of TV/media. The primary delivery channel is 6 home visits by a peer educator, 4 interim newsletters and twice-weekly text messaging. Intervention families also receive 2 home visits from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant. Assessments occur at 28 and 37 weeks gestation and when infants are 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months of age. Results The primary outcome is infant/toddler growth and likelihood of overweight at 15 months. Differences between groups are expected to be achieved through uptake of the targeted infant feeding and care behaviors (secondary outcomes) and change in caregivers' modifiable risk factors (mediators) underpinning the intervention. Conclusions If successful in promoting healthy infant growth and enhancing caregiver behaviors, “Mothers and Others” will have high public health relevance for future obesity-prevention efforts aimed at children younger than 2 years, including interventional research and federal, state, and community health programs.

N2  - Caesarean sections, and especially elective Caesarean sections, are on the increase worldwide. The grey-matter volume of the foetal brain undergoes a linear increase of 1,4% per week from 29 weeks until 40 weeks of gestation. This is followed by an accelerated period of brain growth, during which 50% of the increase in cortical volume occurs, between 34 and 40 weeks of gestation. Between 37 and 40 weeks of gestation, cortical grey matter increases by 50% and myelinated white matter increases three-fold. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a baby is born prematurely if it is delivered before 37 completed weeks’ gestational age (GA), or before 259 days after the last normal menstrual period. As a result, the American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (ACOG) has adopted a new maturity classification that refers to babies born from 37 to 39 weeks as ‘early term’. Early-term neonates are at increased risk of morbidity. Prematurity is associated with impaired cortical development, and ex-premature infants never achieve the same degree of cortical folding as that seen in babies born at term. Prematurity is also a major risk factor for cerebral palsy, which occurs in 35% of cases. The increased risk is directly proportional to decreasing GA. The global prevalence of cerebral palsy is 2/1 000 births. Between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation, the risk increases to 6.75/1 000 births. Importantly for the timing of elective Caesarean section, there is still an increased risk of 1.35/1 000 births even after 36 weeks of gestation. Babies who are born in the early term period (between 37 and 39 weeks GA) will later constitute 5,5% of children with special educational needs (SEN). Even those babies born at 39 weeks GA carry an elevated risk and constitute 1,7% of total SEN cases. Normal vaginal delivery is associated with neonatal acquisition of a maternally derived microbiome that has a rich diversity. Through bacterial peptides, the microbiome stimulates immune, endocrine and neuronal cells to release cytokines and neurotransmitters, which access the central nervous system via the blood or the vagal nerve. In this way, enteric bacteria can influence mood and behaviour, sleep–wake cycles and feeding patterns. During Caesarean section, however, the foetus is colonised instead by bacteria from the mother’s skin. The microbiome that results from this has far less richness and diversity. This in turn is associated with significant risk for chronic inflammatory disorders in later life. New to our understanding of chronic inflammatory disorders that result from dysbiosis is a range of neuro-developmental problems in childhood and adults.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether changes in general pain, other regional pain, gastrointestinal, or affective symptoms reported during treatment of women with endometriosis-related pain varied by treatment type or impacted their study retention. DESIGN: Two-year prospective clinical trial comparing 1) doublemasked randomized 24 weeks of treatment with Leuprolide Acetate (Depot form 11.25mg IM q3months) or Norethindrone Acetate 5mg daily, followed by 2) all receiving 28 weeks of Norethindrone 5mg daily, and then 3) one year follow-up with the option to restart Norethindrone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 62 women with endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain were randomized to Leuprolide (N=31) or Norethindrone (N=31). Subjects completed symptom questionnaires at study visits occurring every 4 to 12 weeks. Responses were categorized as gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, bloating, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea), regional pain (dyspareunia, dyschezia, and painful bladder), general pain (other painful body areas), and affective symptoms (depression or disturbed sleep). The number of symptoms in each category was totaled for each study visit. Using repeated measures mixed modeling, an intent-to-treat analysis assessed symptom burden over time between treatment groups and in relation to subject drop-out. RESULTS: Women were predominantly Black (81%) and single (66%), had a mean age of 34.1 ±6.7 yr and reported pelvic pain for 14.3 ±8.0 yr. Groups did not differ in these characteristics, stage of endometriosis, gravidity, BMI, or pain scores upon entry. At baseline, women commonly reported gastrointestinal (86% vs 84%), pelvic regional pain (38% vs 45%), other general pain (79% vs 68%), or affective symptoms (31% vs 26%) in Leuprolide (A) and Norethindrone (B) groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in the number of symptoms by category reported by women in either treatment group at baseline or over time. However, when women completing the study were compared to those who dropped out, those who dropped out reported significantly more regional pain symptoms (p=0.0175). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical phenotype of women with endometriosisrelated chronic pelvic pain commonly included pelvic regional pain, other general pain, and gastrointestinal and affective symptoms, and may impact study retention. The burden of regional pain symptoms was more prevalent in women who discontinued the study suggesting that addressing these symptoms as part of endometriosis-related pain studies may improve study retention and perhaps patient outcomes. Confirming these findings and considering the clinical phenotype of these women may ultimately improve treatment of endometriosis-related pain.

N2  - Study objective The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of “apple body type” to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Sleep center setting. Patients Two hundred and eight subjects who were referred for an evaluation of possible OSA at Tulane Comprehensive Sleep Center. The exclusion criteria were age < 18 years old, incomplete or absent questionnaire, incomplete body type identification, polysomnography (PSG) refusal, and pregnant women. Interventions STOP-BANG items and body type data were collected on the initial clinic visit. An overnight PSG was performed on every participant. Measurements Descriptive analyses of the demographic data and PSG variables were performed. The predictive parameters of STOP and STOP-BANG without and with body type score (STOP-Apple and STOPBANG-Apple) were compared. Main results The STOP questionnaire's sensitivity/specificity/positive likelihood ratio (+ LR) (cut-off = 2) was 96%/11%/1.1, respectively whereas the STOP-Apple questionnaire (cut-off = 3) was 88%/39%/1.5. The STOP-BANG's sensitivity/specificity/+LR (cut-off = 3) was 96%/19%/1.2, respectively whereas the STOP-BANG-Apple questionnaire (cut-off = 4) was 90%/39%/1.5. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of STOP-Apple was comparable to the STOP-BANG (P = 0.25). The addition of the apple body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire in participants with a score ≥ 3 led to increased specificity (67.4%), increased the odds ratio of having OSA of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2–5.3) and odds ratio of having moderate-severe OSA of 4.7 (95% CI, 2.5–8.7). Conclusion In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.

N2  - Objective: Cardiovascular diseases remain the primary cause of death in women. Assessment of cardiovascular risk in women is specific and should take into account hormonal factors. Preventive measures must be implemented and diagnosis and therapeutic approaches improved. In order to upgrade women's health, a coordinated healthcare pathway, Heart, arteries and women, was initiated at the Lille University Hospital. The objective was to assess the relevance of the healthcare pathway at two years to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment in women at cardiovascular risk. Design and method: We undertook a retrospective and consecutive observational study based on a cohort of post-menopausal women followed through the healthcare pathway “Heart, arteries and women”, at the Lille University Hospital, between January 1st, 2013 and December 31st, 2015. Clinical presentation, medical management and follow-up were assessed. Results: Of the 201 women included, with a mean age of 62 years, 64 (32%) were at high cardiovascular risk and 136 (68%) at very high risk. Arterial hypertension was present in 188 (94%) and diabetes in 88 (44%). Sixty-one women (30, 3%) had experienced high blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy. Only eight women had current or previous hormone replacement therapy. Among the 91 women screened for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome by night polygraphy or polysomnography, 66 (73%) were positive. Among the 90 women who had a ischemic stress test, 11 (12%) were positive. Three women were diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease and 16 with a significant renal arterial stenosis. Medical therapies were optimized especially for women with atheroma in which 14.5% to 27% were properly treated (p < 0.05). Coordination between cardiologists and gynaecologists was improved: 20.4% of the gynecologists received conclusive reports versus 12% in the one year evaluation. Conclusions: At two years, our healthcare pathway, “Heart, arteries and women”, allowed optimizing medical therapy and clinical management of women. Coordination between cardiologists and gynaecologists should continue to improve.

N2  - Objective We evaluated the possible association between fetal gender and long-term pediatric neurological morbidity. Methods We performed a population-based retrospective cohort analysis comparing the risk of long-term neurological morbidity (up to age 18 years) of children born during the years 1991 to 2013 according to their gender. Neurological morbidity evaluated included hospitalizations in childhood involving pervasive developmental disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and infantile spasms and disorders of eating as recorded in the hospital files. Multiple pregnancies and fetal congenital malformations were excluded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare the cumulative neurological morbidity over the study period. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for obstetrical confounders, including gestational age at birth, birth weight, and maternal factors. Results During the study period, 240,953 newborns were included in the long-term analysis: 51.0% (n = 122,840) males and 49.0% (n = 118,113) females. Hospitalizations for neurological problems (up to age 18 years) were significantly more common in males compared with females (1.1% vs 0.8%, respectively, odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001). Specifically, pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea were found to be significantly more common in males, and cerebral palsy reached borderline significance (0.1% vs 0.04%, odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.9, P = 0.06). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated males to have a significantly higher cumulative incidence of total neurological morbidity as well as of pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea (all log-rank test P values <0.001). In the Cox regression model, male gender exhibited an independent association with long-term neurological morbidity, while adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, and other confounding variables (adjusted hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001). Conclusion Males are at an increased risk for pediatric neurological morbidity independent of gestational age at birth and birth weight.

N2  - Cardiorespiratory phase synchronisation (CRS) is a type of cardiorespiratory coupling that manifests through a prediliction for heart beats to occur at specific points relative to the phase of the respiratory cycle. It has been under investigation for nearly 20 years, and while it seems to be mostly occurring in relaxed states such as deep sleep and anesthesia, no clear clinical implications have been established. Cardiorespiratory coordination (CRC) is a recent development in this field where the relationship between the respiratory onset and heart beat is analysed in the time domain and the possible relationship of each heart beat is considered for both the previous and the next respiratory onset. This ostensibly closely related effect must not only show relevant information content but also do so independent of CRS in order to be relevant for future studies. In this paper, we investigate CRC and its relation to CRS mainly using graphical and statistical methods on two exemplary datasets: measurements from a pregnant woman participating in a preeclampsia study and those from a man suffering from sleep apnea. We show fundamental differences between the results of both approaches and are able to show a formerly unknown dependency between the heart activity and respiratory rate, potentially indicating heartbeat-initiated inspiration. Despite their differences, methods developed for the quantification of CRS can be adapted to CRC. Completing the comparison is an investigation into the relationship between CRC and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Similar to previous results for CRS, the two effects are found to be orthogonal, meaning that they can be observed independently or in conjunction.

N2  - Introduction The present study focuses on mother's spontaneous touch during the very first skin to skin kangaroo care with premature babies in NICU. The aim is to test the hypothesis according to which, compared to the usual installation where the baby is installed vertically in the mother's clothes between the breast, the innovative installation in Supported diagonal flexion (FDS) fosters a more positive qualitative mother's touch, a touch dedicated more to enriching and scaffolding interactions with the preemie and less focused on postural support. Method Twenty very preterm infants between 27 and 31 weeks gestation and their mothers were offered skin to skin sessions. The first 10 infants included were offered the usual vertical positioning and a breastfeeding pillow for support. The following ten were offered SDF. The first five minutes of the session were videotaped and coded with The Observer software. Results In the usual vertical positioning mother's hands were used 59% of the time to maintain infant posture (hold or contain infant's body), therefore using touch for mechanical reasons (vs 1% in SDF positioning; 95% CI 47.2–67.2). With the SDF positioning, mothers used their hands for affective touch (36% vs 20% in the usual vertical positioning; 95% CI 5.3–30.0) and to signal presence (39% vs 20% in the usual vertical positioning; 95% CI 7.8–31.4). Infants were mostly in active sleep, and drowsiness was lowered in the FDS group as compared to the “as usual” one. There was no quiet awake or active awake state during skin to skin's SDF positioning sessions. Our results also showed that affective touch took place on the head in the vertical group whereas it was more frequently directed on the face in the SDF group. Mothers in the SDF group tended spontaneously more to rock their baby. Conclusion With SDF positioning, mothers spontaneously used more active touch and expressed more affection through touch. The present study is part of a longitudinal follow-up from birth until 3 months corrected age. The vocal production and visual engagement of both partners are under analysis and will be considered in the light of the mothering touch interactions described here. Further research to describe interactions in all of their dimensions is necessary.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this paper is to report a unique situation that occured while a hypertensive patient was on ABPM measurement. Design and method: Following our previous report of a unique event during routine 24 ABPM measurement (Journal of Hypertension, 2009; 27 (Suppl 4)), we report another interesting case. A 58 years old female patient, recently diagnosed of hypertension stage 2 according to the recent ESH guidelines, drug naive, was referred to our center for further investigation of her dipping status and BP variability patterns. The patient was put on ABPM measurement, 15 minute intervals during wake period and 20 minute intervals during sleep period. While on the ABPM device, during the morning period, her 8 months pregnant daughter telephoned her, complaining of abdominal pains. The patient called a taxi and after 20 minutes was with her daughter. The abdominal pains started again, they called an ambulance and eventually the daughter gave birth at home with the assistance of the paramedics and the aid of our female patient. During all this period, the ABPM monitor continued to make measurements. We are reporting the results of this unique chance event. Results: Blood pressure measurements are reported in mm/Hg. (1) ABPM placed on patient, office window phase capturing 150-165/110-120 (2) Sleep period with 4 complete dipping periods >10% from 23:00 to 7:00 (3) at 7:00 the patient has breakfast and goes to the market with normal measurements (4) 9:00 daughter calls complaining of abdominal pains, patient has constantly increasing BP up to 170/110 until she arrives to the daughter (5) 11:00 they call ambulance, BP peaks at 175/115 (6) 11:45 paramedics arrive, BP decreases to 145/100 and it remains stable afterwards at 150/100. Conclusions: The patient is stage 2 hypertensive, with normal dipping pattern during the sleep period. During stressful conditions the blood pressure climbed and plateued at 175/115 mmHg with no further increases.

N2  - Neonatal lambs, as with human and other neonates, have low arrhythmic endogenous levels of melatonin for several weeks until they start their own pineal rhythm of melatonin production at approximately 2 weeks of life. During pregnancy, daily rhythmic transfer of maternal melatonin to the fetus has important physiological roles in sheep, nonhuman primates, and rats. This melatonin rhythm provides a circadian signal and also participates in adjusting the physiology of several organs in preparation for extrauterine life. We propose that the ensuing absence of a melatonin rhythm plays a role in neonatal adaptation. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of imposing a high-amplitude melatonin rhythm in the newborn lamb on (1) clock time-related changes in cortisol and plasma variables and (2) clock time-related changes of gene expression of clock genes and selected functional genes in the adrenal gland and heart. We treated newborn lambs with a daily oral dose of melatonin (0.25 mg/kg) from birth to 5 days of age, recreating a high-amplitude melatonin rhythm. This treatment suppressed clock time-related changes of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, clock gene expression, and functional genes in the newborn adrenal gland. In the heart, it decreased heart/body weight ratio, increased expression of Anp and Bnp, and resulted in different heart gene expression from control newborns. The interference of this postnatal melatonin treatment with the normal postnatal pattern of adrenocortical function and heart development support a physiological role for the window of flat postnatal melatonin levels during the neonatal transition.

N2  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) secondary to prematurity is treated with home oxygen therapy (HOT) after discharge from hospital. HOT supports infants, but is burdensome. Antenatal maternal smoking is a risk factor for BPD, but its impact upon duration of HOT in BPD is unknown. We aimed to understand the impact of prenatal maternal smoking upon the duration of HOT for infants with BPD in our clinic. Methods: Our clinic routinely collects data on maternal smoking, home oxygen prescription, and results of sleep studies in BPD for service planning. We do overnight saturation monitoring at approximately 4 weekly intervals guided by the clinical state to efficiently wean oxygen. We reviewed all cases for which we a smoking history for a 10 year period. We compared the time to cessation of HOT in a survival analysis with a log-rank test. Results: We have been referred 231 infants of which 197 have weaned off oxygen. Maternal smoking history was available for 157 cases. HOT duration was longer in the smoking group (p = 0.03, see fig. 1). This effect was most marked for those in oxygen the longest-at the 75th centile of oxygen duration, smoking was associated with an additional 20 days in oxygen. Conclusions: Antenatal smoking is associated with increased duration of home oxygen for infants with BPD. Future work will explore postnatal exposure to cigarette smoke and duration of oxygen therapy. (Figure Presented) .

N2  - Case/Program Description: The patient is a 31-year-old woman, who suffered a cardiac arrest at 7 weeks gestation with anoxic brain injury and bilateral cortical infarcts leading to a persistent vegetative state (PVS). Nine weeks later, she made a rapid and unexpected recovery to full consciousness. The patient, who had a history of coagulopathy and fertility treatment, was found unconscious in her home. She was resuscitated, intubated, and diagnosed with septic shock and abdominal compartment syndrome. Following emergent surgery, the patient had a complicated hospital course. Despite 5 days off sedation, the patient demonstrated no response to stimuli. Examination was significant for eyes open with inattention, lack of tracking, inability to follow commands, and quadriplegia. The patient was assessed as being in PVS. CT, MR and PET imaging demonstrated findings consistent with anoxia. The patient was commenced on amantadine in week 6 to enhance neuro-recovery. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital. Results: Nine weeks post-event, the patient suddenly regained con-sciousness and rapidly became alert and oriented. She was verbal, responsive to single step commands, and subsequently discharged to acute inpatient rehabilitation. She continues to make functional gains in therapy. Discussion: PVS is a clinical syndrome on the “disorders of con-sciousness” spectrum. It is characterized by unawareness of self or environment, without sustained, reproducible voluntary responses, but with an intact sleep-wake cycle. Prognosis is variable and guarded. Non-traumatic PVS carries a poorer prognosis than PVS resulting from trauma. After 3 months, atraumatic PVS is considered permanent. The longer the time spent in PVS, the lower the likelihood of recovery. There is a high mortality rate for the first year in PVS. Conclusions: This young patient in atraumatic PVS for nine weeks, with a poor prognosis, made a rapid and remarkable recovery from a profound state of disordered consciousness and was discharged to an acute brain injury unit.

N2  - This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms in first-time expectant fathers during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. As part of a prospective study examining depressive symptoms in men over the first postnatal year, 622 men (mean age = 34.3 years, ±5.0 years) completed standardized online self-report questionnaires measuring depressed mood, physical activity, sleep quality, social support, marital adjustment, life events, financial stress, and demographics during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. The Edinburgh Depression Scale was used to assess depressed mood. Partners also completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale in the third trimester. The results revealed that 13.3% of expectant fathers exhibited elevated levels of depressive symptoms during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. Significant independent factors associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in men were poorer sleep quality, family history of psychological difficulties, lower perceived social support, poorer marital satisfaction, more stressful life events in the preceding 6 months, greater number of financial stressors, and elevated maternal antenatal depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of including fathers in the screening and early prevention efforts targeting depression during the transition to parenthood, which to date have largely focused only on women. Strategies to promote better sleep, manage stress, and mobilize social support may be important areas to address in interventions tailored to new fathers at risk for depression during the transition to parenthood.

N2  - Case Presentation The elder sister (32 years old) was affected fist, when she was 6 years old, she had intermittent fever for a month and occasionally accompanied by black stools and anemia that was treated with intermittent application of iron therapy, but could not be fully corrected. At 11 years old, she made laparotomy for abdominal pain of unknown cause and cut a period of about 80 cm small intestine that partial villi disappeared and multiple ulcers had been shown. She was reoperation due to intestinal obstruction, perforated and necrosis, and excised about 2-meter intestine when she was 15-years-old. Since then, she appeared ileus once a year, but black stools disappear. Her younger sister, 30 years old, at age 17 years, she got unexplained abdominal discomfort with intermittent melena. She got anemia over 10 years, chalybeate supplement and blood transfusions just improved hemoglobin level temporarily. 4 years ago, she appeared pitting edema of both lower extremities. In recent 3 months, she suffered from unknown fever. She had hearing loss because of taking gentamicin in her childhood. Same with her sisters, she was amenorrhea over 5 months and never got pregnant during her 9 years marriage. The patient was pale appearance, hearing loss, communicated with people slightly slow and bumble, her lower limb visible skin dam age and pigmentation with palpable nodule, she also had severe pitting edema. There were no positive signs in cardiopulmonary and abdomen. Laboratory findings showed anemia and malnutri tion. Her hemoglobin was 53 g/L (MCV 75.4 fl, MCH 19.2 pg, MCHC 255 g/L), and serum albumin was 20.1 g/L. The patient's inflammatory makers were increased, ESR was 144 mm/h and CRP was 49 mg/L. Blood cultures were negative. Immunoglobulin showed IgG 5.51g/L, IgA 0.84g/L, IgM was normal. Rheumatoid factors raised at 20.50 IU/ml. other serum examinations were nor mal. Bone marrow puncture point: immature granulocytes and NAP points: 168. Gastroscopy examination diagnosed as vasculitis? The pathology just pointed to chronic mucous inflammation. Colonoscopy examination diagnosed as anemia intestinal. Then we took a wireless video capsule examination and double balloon endoscopy (DBE), which confirmed her small intestinal segmental edema, scattered superficial and longitudinal ulcers of varying sizes and lumen narrow which surrounding mucosal was hyperemia and lens body couldn't pass. And the pathology was shown chronic inflammation with mucosal dysplasia grade I. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed the presence of small-bowel multiple intestinal wall thickening and luminal stenosis obviously. That's why capsule couldn't been excreted. Then we treated her with prednisone and mesalazine was used for her, but abdominal distention still appeared, and finally she accepted laparotomy, The abdomen surgery confirmed that she had segmental stenosis of intestinal and macroscopic examination revealed that segmental intestinal mucosal shedding, partial bowel wall thickness and dif ferent size of shallow ulcers. Microscopic H.E. staining examination demonstrated: lesion defected typically structure of intestinal villi or mucosa ulcers and inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mono-cytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, submucosa was thickening due to fibrin and muscularis mucosa was thickening too. There also had inflammatory changes in the vessel wall. In addition, Sirius red staining and masson staining of intestine further confirmed submucosa was thickening due to fibrin and collagen. Finally, we diagnosis the patient as cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) based upon the clinical course and the charac teristic microscopic image. After surgery, patient's symptoms were resolved. One month later, her hemoglobin level raised at 91 g/L, serum total protein was 57.1 g/L, serum albumin was 34.8 g/L. Discussion In conclusion, CMUSE is a rare condition affecting small intestine. The main cause of CMUSE still unknown, many researcher consider it may associated with autoimmune reaction and Matsumoto et al confirmed it closely related to familial genetic, especially in of fspring produced by consanguineous mar riage. It is characterized by chronic and relapsing clinical course resulting from multiple small intestinal stenosis and superficial ulceration affecting the mucosa and submucosa. The pathology of CMUSE was important, these ulcers were only involving in mucosa and submucosa. In contrast, fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration can reach deep tissue resulting in submucosal thickening. Gluco-corticosteroids is the main treatment of CMUSE, but more cases of steroid-refractory had been reported. Other Methods include immunosuppressor, anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody and surgery.

N2  - Objective: Since the development of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), various studies have shown to be a very useful method in cardiovascular risk assessment and remains the only method of diagnosing a non- dipping blood pressure profile. It has been suggested that all forms of secondary hypertension, including renal / renovascular, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid excess, phaeochromocytoma and toxaemia in pregnancy are associated with blunted, eliminated or reversed nocturnal blood pressure fall. Design and method: We analysed 1621 patients referred to the Clinic of Endocrinology to be examined for secondary etiology of hypertension. ABPM revealed 268 subjects with white coat hypertension (WCH) so we didn't screened them for secondary hypertension. Meditech ABPM 05 device was used with appropriate cuff. We did all necessary analysis and tests in 1353 patients to see the aetiology of hypertension. The mean age was 42.6+/-10.8 years. There were 820 women and 533 men. Mean body mass index was 27 +/-8 kg/m2. Results: Screening for secondary hypertension revealed 68 patients with renovascular disease, 25 patients with all forms of hyperaldosteronism, 18 patients with pheochromocytoma including multiple endocrine neoplasia, 22 patients with glucocorticoid excess, 92 patients with obstructive sleep apnea. ABPM showed blunted or eliminated circadian blood pressure rhythm in 60 patients with renovascular disease or renal artery stenosis, 22 patients with all forms of hyperaldosteronism, 9 patients with pheochromocytoma including multiple endocrine neoplasia, 18 patients with glucocorticoid excess, every one of 92 patients with obstructive sleep apnea had blunted, eliminated or reversed nocturnal blood pressure fall. Conclusions: Results of our study indicate that nocturnal BP decrease was blunted or absent in a majority of patients with adrenal cause of hypertension. Nocturnal BP fall measured by ABPM may be very sensitive predictor of cardiovascular outcome and good method for screening for secondary hypertension.

N2  - Introduction: Physical and mental physiological changes associated with menopause is affected all the female body systems including the gastrointestinal tract that In fact, one of digestive disorders are constipation which in severe cases quality of life reduced. So this study was performed with the aim to determine constipation and its associated factors in postmenopausal Women in Roudan. Methods: Present study was cross sectional study. 450 postmenopausal subjects aging 46 to 65 years that referred to selected health centers in Roudan, were selected by convenience sampling in 2016. The data collection tools included a standard questionnaire based on the Rome III criteria by interviewing. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 16.0) software and data were analyzed using the dependent t-test, Chi-square tests and logistic regression. Results: The average age of participants was 56.88±4.74 years. The prevalence of constipation based on the Rome III criteria was 33.7% (168 individuals). There was a significant statistical relationship between constipation and the variables of education level, occupational status, marital status, economic situation, number of pregnancies, number of natural childbirths, history of pelvic floor surgery, daily sports activities, number of fruits and vegetables servings, number of milk and dairy products servings, and amount of sleep per day (by hour) (P<0.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of constipation in postmenopausal women is relatively high. Due to the increasing population of postmenopausal women and since constipation can significantly affect their quality of life. it is recommended that in aged care programs, more attention is paid to intestinal disorders (especially constipation).

N2  - During normal pregnancy, the mechanism by which the fetus escapes immunological rejection by the maternal womb remains elusive. Given the biological complexities, the immunological mechanism is unlikely to be simply an allograft response in acceptance or rejection of the early pregnancy. Circadian clock responsible for the mammalian circadian rhythm is an endogenously generated rhythm associated with almost all physiological processes including reproduction. There is now growing evidence to suggest that the circadian clocks are intricately linked to the immune system and pregnancy. When perturbed, the role of immune cells can be affected on maintaining the enriched vascular system needed for placentation. This alteration can be triggered by the irregular production of maternal and placental melatonin. Hence, the role of circadian rhythm modulators such as melatonin offers intriguing opportunities for therapy. In this review, we evaluate the complex interaction between the circadian clock and melatonin within the immune system and their roles in the circadian regulation and maintenance of normal pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Hormonal changes in pregnancy may result in impairment of labyrinth fluid homeostasis, which, together with changes in the sensitivity of the enzymatic receptors, influence the metabolism of the inner ear and can justify otological symptoms in women. Objective: Verify the incidence of dizziness in high risk pregnant women attended at a University Hospital, associating to pathologies. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional, preliminar descriptive study conducted between February and May 2017 in 16 puerperae, from 19 to 43 years old, attended at high risk prenatal care. Approved in the Ethics Committee under the CAE 16728013.0.0000.5346. A questionnaire about gynecological history, current gestation and balance complaints during pregnancy was applied. Results: In the preliminary results are 16 puerperae, mean age of 31.43 (±6.97), mean of 2.25 (±1.43) gestations. 62.5% of the pregnant women reported a dizziness complaint, 50% of the non-rotational type and 50% of the rotational type. Besides, 80% of pregnant women who reported dizziness reported associated pathology, but the chi-square test (p=0.55) did not present statistical difference. Patients with dizziness reported the following conditions: Pre-eclampsia, Systemic Arterial Hypertension, Specific Hypertensive Disease of Gestation, Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Mellitus Gestational, Hypothyroidism and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. of the women who presented dizziness during pregnancy, 40% had irregular sleep, with approximately six hours of sleep. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of dizziness in pregnant women attending the High Risk Prenatal Clinic of a University Hospital, usually concomitant with some pregnancy-associated pathology.

N2  - Objective Sleep during pregnancy involves a physiological challenge to provide sufficient gas exchange to the fetus. Enhanced ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia may protect from deficient gas exchange, but sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may predispose to adverse events. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep and breathing in healthy pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls, with a focus on CO2 changes and upper-airway flow limitation. Methods Healthy women in the third trimester and healthy non-pregnant women with normal body mass index (BMI) were recruited for polysomnography. Conventional analysis of sleep and breathing was performed. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) was determined for each sleep stage. Flow-limitation was analyzed using the flattening index and TcCO2 values were recorded for every inspiration. Results Eighteen pregnant women and 12 controls were studied. Pregnancy was associated with shorter sleep duration and more superficial sleep. Apnea–hypopnea index, arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation, flow-limitation, snoring or periodic leg movements were similar in the two groups. Mean SaO2 and minimum SaO2 were lower and average heart rate was higher in the pregnant group. TcCO2 levels did not differ between groups but variance of TcCO2 was smaller in pregnant women during non-rapid eye movement (NREM). TcCO2 profiles showed transient TcCO2 peaks, which seem specific to pregnancy. Conclusions Healthy pregnancy does not predispose to SDB. Enhanced ventilatory control manifests as narrowing threshold of TcCO2 between wakefulness and sleep. Pregnant women have a tendency for rapid CO2 increases during sleep which might have harmful consequences if not properly compensated.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an often-overlooked diagnosis, more prevalent in the obese population. Screening method accuracy, uptake and hence diagnosis is variable. There is limited data available regarding the obese pregnant population; however, many studies highlight potential risks of apnoeic episodes to mother and foetus, including hypertension, diabetes and preeclampsia. A total of 162 women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 were recruited from a tertiary referral hospital in the northwest of England. They were invited to attend three research antenatal clinics, completing an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire at each visit. A monitor measuring the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) was offered at the second visit. Data taken from consent forms, hospital notes and hospital computer records were collated and anonymized prior to statistical analysis. A total of 12.1% of women had an ESS score of >10, suggesting possible OSA. Rates increased throughout pregnancy, although unfortunately, the attrition rate was high; 29.0% of women used the RUSleeping (RUS) meter, and only one (2.1%) met pre-specified criteria for OSA (AHI ≥ 15). This individual had OSA categorized as severe and underwent investigations for preeclampsia, eventually delivering by emergency caesarean section due to foetal distress. The accuracy of the ESS questionnaire, particularly the RUS monitor, to screen for OSA in the pregnant population remains unclear. Further research on a larger sample size using more user-friendly technology to confidently measure AHI would be beneficial. There are currently no guidelines regarding screening for OSA in the obese pregnant population, yet risks to both mother and foetus are well researched.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This research examined the association between perceived everyday racial discrimination, as a psychosocial stressor, and perinatal sleep quality.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional (N=640) and longitudinal associations (N=133) between everyday experiences of discrimination and sleep quality were examined using a pregnancy and postpartum data registry.
PARTICIPANTS: We studied a sample of 640 unique women from the Perinatal Research Repository (PRR), a longitudinal study of mothers, fathers, and babies recruited from Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.
MEASUREMENTS: Discrimination and sleep quality were assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively.
RESULTS: Overall, everyday discrimination was associated with poorer global sleep quality and all but three sleep sub-measures of the PSQI cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. When stratified, the adverse effects of everyday discrimination varied by race and perinatal time period. Increases in everyday discrimination were independently associated with poorer sleep initiation, poorer sleep maintenance and poorer daytime dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the immediate stressors of everyday racial discrimination were independently associated with poorer sleep quality among pregnant women cross-sectionally. Poorer sleep quality has been associated with numerous adverse perinatal outcomes and this association may be important in understanding racial discrimination as a risk factor. Our failure to identify a longitudinal association makes the direction of causation uncertain, however. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify the association, given the potential importance of poor sleep quality in the pathogenesis of pregnancy complications.

N2  - The consequences of childhood maltreatment are profound and long lasting. Not only does the victim of abuse suffer as a child, but there is mounting evidence that a history of maltreatment places the next generation at risk for significant psychopathology. Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting this intergenerational transmission of trauma. However, emerging evidence suggests that part of this risk may be transmitted before birth, passed on via abuse-related alterations in the in utero environment that are as yet largely unidentified. To date, no study has directly assessed the influence of pregnant women's abuse history on fetal neurobehavioral development, nor considered trauma-associated poor sleep quality as a mediator reflecting established physiological dysregulation. Using data from 262 pregnant adolescents (ages 14-19), a population at elevated risk for childhood maltreatment, the current study examined maternal emotional abuse history and sleep quality in relation to third-trimester fetal resting heart rate variability, an index of parasympathetic nervous system functioning. The results indicate that maternal emotional abuse history is indirectly associated with lower fetal heart rate variability via abuse-related sleep disturbances. These data demonstrate an association between maternal abuse histories and fetal development, showing that at least part of the intergenerational transmission of risk occurs during pregnancy.

N2  - Sleep related breathing disorders include central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sleep-related hypoventilation, and sleep-related hypoxia. These disorders are frequent and growing in clinical relevance. The related chapter of the S3 guideline Non-restorative sleep/Sleep disorders, published by the German Sleep Society (DGSM), has recently been updated in November 2016. Epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutic procedures, and classification of sleep related disorders have been revised. Concerning epidemiology, a considerably higher mortality rate among pregnant women with OSA has been emphasized. With regards to diagnostics, the authors point out that respiratory polygraphy may be sufficient in diagnosing OSA, if a typical clinical condition is given. For CSA, recommendations were changed to diagnose CSA with low apnea rates present. Significant changes for treating CSA in patients with left ventricular dysfunction have been introduced. In addition, there is now to be differentiated between sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxaemia. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is discussed in more detail. This article sums up and comments on the published changes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Considering the lack of evidence on incidence and continuity of sleep problems from adolescence to young adulthood, this study explores sleep problems' incidence and their continuation rates from 14 to 21 years.
METHODS: Sleep data from the 14-year (n = 4,924) and 21-year (n = 3660) follow-up of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort were used. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychological conditions were explored for their role in sleep problems. Modified Poisson regression with a robust error variance was used to identify predictors. Inverse probability weights were used to account for attrition.
RESULTS: Of all subjects, 26.0% of the subjects at 14 years and 28.3% of the subjects at 21 years reported "often" sleep problems, with 41.7% of adolescent sleep problems persisting at 21 years. Perinatal and early-life maternal factors, for example, drug abuse (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.71), smoking, depression, and anxiety, were significant predictors of adolescent sleep problems. Female sex (IRR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.55-2.94), advanced pubertal stages, and smoking were the important predictors of sleep problems at 21 years. Adolescent depression/anxiety supported the continuity of sleep problems (IRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.40), whereas exercise was seen to exert a protective effect.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates high rates of sleep problems in young subjects, with around half of sleep problems originating in adolescence persisting in young adulthood. Therefore, early interventions are needed to manage sleep problems in young subjects and prevent further progression to other life stages. Future studies should explore if sleep problems in young adults also persist in later life stages and identify the factors supporting the continuity of sleep problems.

N2  - Background: Available evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that childhood maltreatment may be associated with a range of sleep disorders. However, these studies have not controlled for potential individual-, familial- and environmental-level confounders. Aim: To determine the association between childhood maltreatment and lower sleep quality after adjusting for potential confounders. Methods: Data for the present study were obtained from a pre-birth cohort study of 3778 young adults (52.6% female) of the Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy follow up at a mean age of 20.6 years. The Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy is a prospective Australian pre-birth cohort study of mothers consecutively recruited during their first obstetric clinic visit at Brisbane's Mater Hospital in 1981–1983. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the 21-year follow up. We linked this dataset to agency-recorded substantiated cases of childhood maltreatment. A series of separate logistic regression models was used to test whether childhood maltreatment predicted lower sleep quality after adjustment for selected confounders. Results: Substantiated physical abuse significantly predicted lower sleep quality in males. Single and multiple forms of childhood maltreatment, including age of maltreatment and number of substantiations, did not predict lower sleep quality in either gender in both crude and adjusted models. Not being married, living in a residential problem area, cigarette smoking and internalising were significantly associated with lower sleep quality in a fully adjusted model for the male–female combined sample. Conclusions: Childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict young adult poor sleep quality, with the exception of physical abuse for males. While childhood maltreatment has been found to predict a range of mental health problems, childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict sleep problems occurring in young adults. Poor sleep quality was accounted for by concurrent social disadvantage, cigarette smoking and internalising.

N2  - Background and Objective: In 2015, about 3700 infants died in the U.S. from sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID), including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), ill-defined deaths, and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed. SUID is defined as the death of an infant under one year of age whose cause of death is unexplained before a thorough case review, including examination of the death scene and review of the clinical history. The present study was conducted to examine any associations between maternal behaviors related to pregnancy and birth and sleep-related deaths. Methods: A case-control study of sleep-related infant deaths in Philadelphia during 2011-2013 contained in the Philadelphia vital statistics birth and death records. Smoking during pregnancy, prenatal care initiation, and breastfeeding initiation were examined with the occurrence of SUIDs. Results: A total of 630 infant deaths with the matching birth records were analyzed. The primary maternal risk/protective factors were examined to determine whether there were significant differences in smoking during pregnancy, adequate prenatal care, and breastfeeding initiation in infant died from the sleep-related causes compared to those infant deaths that were not sleep-related. NICU admission, birth weight and gestational age were analyzed to identify the role of adverse birth outcomes for sleep-related infant deaths. Conclusions: Our study showed that the certain maternal factors related to pregnancy and birth may help explain the risk of SUID. Future research should focus on exploring the way modifiable factors play a role in the occurrence of sudden death in infants and the implementation of certain protective measures and program interventions for parents and health providers.

N2  - Introduction: Benzodiazepines are prescribed inappropriately in up to 40% of outpatients. The purpose of this study is to describe a collaborative team-based care model in which clinical pharmacists work with primary care providers (PCPs) to improve the safe use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and sleep disorders and to assess the preliminary results of the impact of the clinical service on patient outcomes. Methods: Adult patients were eligible if they received care from the academic primary care clinic, were prescribed a benzodiazepine chronically, and were not pregnant or managed by psychiatry. Outcomes included baseline PCP confidence and knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine use, patient symptom severity, and medication changes. Results: Twenty-five of 57 PCPs responded to the survey. PCPs reported greater confidence in diagnosing and treating generalized anxiety and panic disorders than sleep disorder and had variable knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine prescribing. Twenty-nine patients had at least 1 visit. Over 44 total patient visits, 59% resulted in the addition or optimization of a nonbenzodiazepine medication and 46% resulted in the discontinuation or optimization of a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety symptom severity scores significantly improved ('2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): '3.57 to '0.43). Conclusion: Collaborative team-based models that include clinical pharmacists in primary care can assist in optimizing high-risk benzodiazepine use. Although these findings suggest improvements in safe medication use and symptoms, additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

N2  - Background and objective: Epidemiology of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is not well defined. There are a few case series and only one epidemiological research on asymptomatic patients older than 40 years old with IST. However, the prevalence in younger symptomatic patients is not well known. We evaluated 24 hours (h) Holter ECG (electrocardiogram) recordings for IST of patients who has admitted to our outpatient clinic for arrhythmic symptoms. Method: Retrospectively all 24 h Holter ECG recordings from September 2015 to November 2016 were screened. Rhythm, 24 h mean heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were recorded. Patients' medical histories were taken from hospital database. IST is defined as 24 h mean HR over 90 bpm, resting HR over 100 bpm and the absence of secondary causes for sinus tachycardia. Results: During study time 1817 patients had 1922 24 h Holter ECG recordings due to symptoms like palpitation, syncope and dyspnoea. From all, 28 had inadequate recording due to artefacts, 16 had different degrees of Atrio-ventricular blocks, 2 had a pacemaker and 429 had atrial or ventricular premature beats more than >1% of all heart beats in a day. Those patients were excluded. Sinus rhythm was seen in 1357 and 150 had 24h mean HR over 90 bpm. 41 with possible secondary causes of sinus tachycardia like hyperthyroid, anaemia, infection, pregnancy, sleep apnoea, heart failure were excluded. Total 99 patients were included and 33 had resting HR under 100 bpm. Overall 66 patients were defined as IST. Mean age was 40.33 (±18.2) years and 57.6% were female. Mean 24 h HR was 96.84 (±7. 28) bpm and mean resting HR was 111.74 (±8.4) bpm. Prevalence of IST in the whole study population was 3.63% and in only patients with sinus rhythm was 4.86%. We compared IST patients (n=66) with patients with sinus rhythm and 24 h mean HR under 90 bpm (n=799), female patients were higher in IST group (57.6% vs. 43.9% p=0. 031) and were younger (40.33±18.21 years vs. 47.32±17.59 years p=0. 046). Also HRV parameters were lower in IST group (SDNN: 98.32±36.2 vs. 135.41±46.89 p<0.001, SDANN: 91.02±38.14 vs. 120.61±43.68 p<0. 001, RMSSD: 23.26±10.1 vs. 34.81±20.13 p<0.001, HRV Triangular index: 24.59±8.71 vs. 36.24±13.12 p<0. 001, LF: 1290.88±3905.9 vs 1512.02±3442.1 p=0. 015, HF: 378.60±413.01 vs. 684.38±2081.45 p=0. 03) Major limitation of the study is retrospective design and the lack of patients long term fallow up data Conclusion: IST is not rare as previously reported. Prevalence is 4.86% among patients with sinus rhythm. It is mostly seen in younger women and they have diminished HRV parameters. IST is known as a benign situation but symptoms limit patients' daily life and there is also a small risk for development of tachycardiomyopathy. Cardiologist must be aware of this situation and they should keep in mind that it is more common than we expected.

N2  - Fertility preservation for atypical hyperplasia (AH) and endometrial cancer (EC) is effective and safe. However, poor counselling prior to the beginning of fertility preservation and unexpected side effects of progestin therapy can translate into poor therapeutic compliance and consequently increase the risk of recurrence or progression. Data were collected in a prospective cohort study of patients who underwent fertility preservation for AH or grade 1 EC in 2013-2014 in a reference centre in Paris, France. The validated EORTC-QLQ-INFO25 and questions from the validated scales EVAPIL, SATMED-Q and Decision Regret Scale were distributed during treatment to assess side effects, quality of information, satisfaction and decision regret. Twenty patients (aged 19-42 years) were eligible for inclusion, of which 16 responded. Sleep problems (61.5%), mood swings (60.0%), hot flushes (53.3%) and vaginal dryness (53.3%) were the most encountered side effects. Most women (62.5%) indicated that psychological support should be necessary. Two patients hesitated to stop treatment but 14 would choose again for conservative treatment. Overall, patients were satisfied with the amount and content of information they received but 31.3% of the patients would like to have received more information. Only 2 out of 8 patients who did not obtain pregnancy regretted their choice for fertility sparing management. Decision regret was not related to treatment outcome, live birth or information satisfaction. This study stresses the patient's needs for dedicated information and psychological support. Fertility sparing attempt permits young patients to better accept hysterectomy, even if pregnancy is not obtained.

N2  - Introduction: Recently, prenatal and perinatal life has been considered very important in development of wheeze and asthma. The aim of the study was to examine the impact of some prenatal and perinatal risk factors on asthma in childhood in The Republic of Macedonia, as a developing country with a high prevalence of maternal tobacco smoke and a low prevalence of asthma. Objectives: Methods: Data from 2310 children aged 5-15 years, obtained by parental-completed questionnaire on lung health, from randomly selected schools in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia, was used. The association between maternal prenatal tobacco smoking, maternal prenatal diabetes, Caesarean section delivery, prematurity, and small for gestational age (SGA) status with asthma-like symptoms and ever-diagnosed asthma was investigated after adjustment for confounders by multiple logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of pre- and perinatal risk factors was: maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy = 13.7%, prenatal maternal diabetes = 1.6%, Cesarean delivery = 31.3%, prematurity = 11.3%, and SGA = 3.6%. Wheeze ever was documented in 30.3% of children, current wheeze in 6.5%, current sleep-disturbing wheeze in 3.6%, current exercise-induced wheeze in 1.7%, current dry night cough apart from a cold in 12.2%, and diagnosed asthma in 2.3%. Maternal prenatal tobacco smoking significantly increased the risk of wheeze ever (aOR: 1.40; 1.08-1.81; P = .011) while prenatal maternal diabetes increased the risk of dry night cough (aOR: 2.32; 1.07-5.05; P = .034). The association between prematurity and ever wheeze, although positive, was not statistically significant (P = .081). Conclusions: The results suggest a positive association between maternal prenatal tobacco smoking and transient wheeze, but not with asthma or current asthma-like symptoms in schoolchildren. This finding further support the impact of prenatal tobacco smoke exposure on lung development and the importance of smoking secession campaign.

N2  - Learning Objectives 1. To learn about paradoxical drug reaction 2. To learn about the fluid management 3. To learn about red flags Ageing has a variable impact on body physiology, leading to altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of most sedative and analgesic drugs used in everyday clinical practice (1-4). The main physiologic alterations associated with advanced age are as follows (1-4): • Decreased muscle mass, decreased blood volume and increased body fat composition • Decreased cardiovascular compliance, increased sensitivity to hypovolaemia, increased sympathetic tone and decreased vascular auto-regulation • Decreased ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercarbia, increased lung residual volume, decreased muscle strength and reduced cough and airway reflexes (these modifications make the elderly more vulnerable to oxygen desaturation) • Presence of co-existing diseases (especially cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and hepatic diseases; disorders of the central nervous system, such as dementia and cognitive dysfunction), decreased glomerular filtration rate and urine concentration ability, decreased liver function and decreased albumin concentration affecting pharmacokinetics • Reduced drug metabolism and elimination; longer duration of some drugs' action • Systemic drug administration for multiple diseases; careful consideration of drug-to-drug interactions; special attention to anticoagulants, drugs acting on the cardiovascular system and drugs affecting the central nervous system There is lack of sufficient evidence to recommend a single 'best' sedative plan for the elderly (1-4). The selection of technique and appropriated agents depends on the nature and duration of the procedure, the individual's physiological status and co-existing diseases as well as the facilities of the department. However, the most relevant recommendation for the elderly is to 'start low, go slow', describing the necessity for the administration of low, incremental doses of selected sedative/analgesic drugs to achieve the optimal level of sedation with the minimum side effects (3). A careful history-taking and preoperative evaluation of the patient is essential, as in every case, focused especially on co-existing diseases and co-administered drugs that may interfere or interact with analgesics or sedatives. The presence of 'red flags' that may complicate sedation and require special care should also be assessed (see below) (1,2,5-11). Drug selection and titration Drugs with short half-life and rapid and predictable onset and recovery should be selected for the elderly. Drugs that do not have active metabolites and do not depend on renal or hepatic elimination are also preferable. The cognitive deterioration should always be considered (3,4). The elderly require careful titration of sedative/analgesic drugs. Incremental dosing increases patient comfort and reduces the risk of adverse effects (1,2,12). Sufficient time must elapse between doses to allow the effect of each dose to be assessed before subsequent drug administration. When routes other than intravenous are used (e.g. rectal, intramuscular and transmucosal), drug pharmacokinetics may be altered and unpredictable. Careful consideration of possible drug-to-drug interactions with other coadministered drugs, mostly affecting the central nervous system or the cardiovascular status, should be performed (1,3,4). Literature suggests that combinations of drugs may be used (most commonly combining a sedative with an opioid) but with extreme care in the elderly because of the increased additive pharmacodynamic sedational effect and the increased risk of adverse effects (1-4). Advanced age may be associated with increased vulnerability to ventilatory depression, hypoxia and haemodynamic deterioration. Ideally, each component should be administered individually and titrated to the desired effect, leaving the required amount of intervals between subsequent doses to allow each drug to reach its maximum effect. Most of the times, reduced dose of each drug is required when used in combinations because of additive pharmacodynamic effects. Paradoxical drug effect Benzodiazepines and propofol are widely used for sedation. They exhibit similar modes of action, mainly through the activation of the inhibiting GABA pathway. The rare effect of paradoxical agitation after administering these drugs may complicate an interventional procedure and necessitate more specialised management. The main features of paradoxical reactions include emotional deterioration, agitation, excessive movement and confusion, combined with or without exaggerated autonomic nervous system activation, tachycardia, hypertension and tachypnea. These reactions have mostly been described after the administration of benzodiazepines (1%-2%), but they have also been reported after the use of propofol in some cases. The main risk factors include alcoholism, extremes of age and psychiatric comorbidities (1,13). The paradoxical reactions should be a diagnosis of exclusion because in critically ill patients, symptoms may overlap with disease-related clinical features, such as hypoxia and hypovolaemia. Aetiology remains unclear but may be related to alterations of the GABAergic pathway and differences in receptor subunit composition. Management comprises discontinuing the offending agent and the addition of a non-GABA sedating medication (i.e. opioids, antipsychotics, dexmedetomidine and ketamine), whereas antagonism of the causal factor by a specific reversal agent (flumazenil in the case of benzodiazepines) has also been suggested (13). Red flags for sedation Practitioners who administer procedural sedation/analgesia should be aware that the transition process from complete consciousness to deep sedation does not always include discrete stages, especially in the elderly or patients with comorbidities (1,2,10,11). The margin of safety of drugs varies widely, and the major risks include the loss of consciousness and protective reflexes, which can occur rapidly or unexpectedly. Conditions that must alarm physicians of the possibility of difficulties during sedation or of extreme reactions/adverse effects that may require an advice by a specialist or even anaesthesiological assistance as follows (5-7,10-12): • History of apnoea or high risk of aponea (documented by sleep study, strong clinical history or apnoea monitor) • Respiratory-compromised patients (with recent <8 weeks pneumonia, active bronchitis, asthma exaggeration or respiratory infection) • Uncontrolled/unpredictable gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting that poses aspiration risk; any case of increased aspiration risk (increased intra-abdominal pressure, full stomach, pregnancy, etc.) • Craniofacial abnormality and history of difficult airway • Unstable cardiac disease (cyanotic cardiac disease, abnormal cardiac anatomy, depressed myocardial function, significant stenotic or regurgitation lesions or life-threatening arrhythmia) • Hypotonia or lack of head control (patient may not be able to maintain his/her airway without assistance) • Allergies to sedative/analgesic drugs • Anterior mediastinal mass • Tremors (unlikely to be ablated by sedation) • Prior failed sedation • Painful procedure that may be challenging to provide adequate analgesia without a general anaesthetic • High-risk procedure that may require the presence of an anesthesiologist for resuscitation • Procedure that requires absolute immobility • Procedure being performed in remote location where immediate emergency backup assistance would be impossible • Inadequately qualified personnel available to provide safe procedural sedation Fluid management Intravenous fluid administration should be based on the physiological status of the patient, the degree of hypovolaemia, the cardiovascular and renal reserve, and the nature of the procedure. Interventions that are accompanied by significant blood loss require special care of because of the possibility of coagulation disorders and the necessity of transfusion of blood products. Specialists' consultation should be available in cases in which hypovolaemia or acute haemorrhage is present. Fluid therapy should by 'goaldirected' and appropriately monitored (through standard BP and HR monitoring and urine output) using more sophisticated monitors in complicated cases (invasive BP measurement, CVP measurement, etc.) (1-4). There is no consensus regarding the optimal fluid management in the elderly because it should be individualised based on the nature of the procedure and the co-existing diseases. However, more 'restricted' strategies are commonly preferred over fixed-volume administration, aiming to maintain a stable cardiovascular status and a normal urine output (3,4). Key points • Procedural sedation is generally safe in the elderly, although they may be at high risk of oxygen desaturation. • The elderly usually require lower doses of medications. They tend to be more sensitive, with slower metabolism and less physiological reserve, because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations. • Paradoxical reactions to sedative drugs (benzodiazepines and propofol) may occur, requiring special management. • The risk of complications can increase when multiple agents are used. • Careful titration and adequate intervals between subsequent doses are required. • Physicians should take all the usual precautions and consider any comorbidities that can put the patient at more risk of adverse reactions. A thorough preoperative evaluation and the identification of possible red flags for sedation is the safest approach. Appropriate monitoring and precautions are necessary to guarantee the best outcome. • 'Start low, go slow'.

N2  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at ≤28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
