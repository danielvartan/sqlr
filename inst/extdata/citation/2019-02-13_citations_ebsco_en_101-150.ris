AB  - Background Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Methods An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA1c levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses. Results Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA1c (p=0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p=0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Conclusions Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA1c and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

AB  - Objective: Sleep is critical for glucose metabolism. Pregnant women often have sleep disturbances and extreme sleep duration. Investigations of the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have reported inconsistent results. The present study aimed to meta-analyze the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk.Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for studies that were published up to October 2017, that reported associations between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes for all studies. Heterogeneity and potential publication biases were assessed.Results: A total of 4366 papers were retrieved, among which seven studies assessed the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM development. The seven articles included 18,203 subjects at baseline and 1294 GDM cases during follow-up. Compared to normal sleep duration, extreme sleep duration during early and middle pregnant stages had a close relationship with GDM based upon pooled data from prospective and cross-sectional studies. Prospective results showed that long sleep duration during pregnancy was a risk factor for GDM, but not short sleep duration. Publication biases were found when analyzing the relationship between extreme sleep duration and GDM.Conclusions: Extreme sleep duration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. Moreover, long but not short sleep duration can predict the risk of developing GDM. These findings remind us of the importance of sleep duration control during pregnancy and help optimize early strategies for the prevention of GDM.

AB  - Objective: To estimate whether sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Methods: In this prospective cohort study, nulliparous women underwent in-home sleep-disordered breathing assessments in early (6-15 weeks of gestation) and midpregnancy (22-31 weeks of gestation). Participants and health care providers were blinded to the sleep test results. An apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or greater was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Exposure-response relationships were examined, grouping participants into four apnea-hypopnea index groups: 0, greater than 0 to less than 5, 5 to less than 15, and 15 or greater. The study was powered to test the primary hypothesis that sleep-disordered breathing occurring in pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, defined as preeclampsia and antepartum gestational hypertension, and GDM. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.Results: Three thousand seven hundred five women were enrolled. Apnea-hypopnea index data were available for 3,132 (84.5%) and 2,474 (66.8%) women in early and midpregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%. The prevalence of preeclampsia was 6.0%, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 13.1%, and GDM 4.1%. In early and midpregnancy the adjusted odds ratios for preeclampsia when sleep-disordered breathing was present were 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.51) and 1.95 (95% CI 1.18-3.23), respectively; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 1.46 (95% CI 0.91-2.32) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.52); and GDM 3.47 (95% CI 1.95-6.19) and 2.79 (95% CI 1.63-4.77). Increasing exposure-response relationships were observed between apnea-hypopnea index and both hypertensive disorders and GDM.Conclusion: There is an independent association between sleep-disordered breathing and preeclampsia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and GDM.

AB  - Objective:This prospective observational study explored the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and sleep studies.Study Design:Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen-positive subjects were referred for polysomnography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to estimate the relative risks of associations.Result:One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models (adjusted relative risk=1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.37).Conclusion:In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggests that the BQ but not the ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others. However, causative association of BQ with OSA cannot be assumed.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) describe the internal and external environmental demands of fatigue correlates in pregnant military women, and (2) determine the relationship between fatigue at 22-26 weeks gestation and the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Inclusion criteria included those designed to minimize confounders for preterm labor and delivery such as no history of preterm delivery. Data were collected prospectively at 22-26 weeks gestation by questionnaires including the Profile of Moods States, Visual Analog Scale-Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance Scale, Life Events Questionnaire, Support Behavior Index, and Occupational Fatigue Index (OFI). A fatigue diary was completed over 2 consecutive work days and mailed back to the Principal Investigator. Telephone follow up of hours worked per week was conducted until the participants delivered. Postpartum charts were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. The sample consisted of 359 women, predominantly White (62%), enlisted (91%), Navy (72%) with a mean age of 23.9 years. Hierarchical linear regression models with 11 variables explained 36% of the variance in fatigue while 14 variables explained 30% of the variance in energy. Independent variables making unique contributions to fatigue severity perception were sleep disturbance, negative life events and role demands. Hierarchical logistic regression models revealed no significant relationship between preterm birth (9.5%) and fatigue severity or occupational fatigue but a trend toward lower fatigue severity chi2 = 3.78, p = .0552) and posture subscale of the OFI (chi2 = 2.39, p = .12) with preterm labor (13.6%). When placed in multivariate models, neither fatigue or occupational fatigue were related to preterm labor and birth. However, officer rank was associated with both preterm labor (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.08, 6.98) and preterm birth (OR = 4.14, 95% CI = 1.54, 11.08). Low sleep disturbance (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.09, 5.07) and negative life events (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.08) were also related to preterm labor. These findings suggest that the military woman who is at risk for preterm labor is a high energy officer experiencing stress and that fatigue is protective against premature birth. The results support investigation of interventions which examine the pregnant officer and activities in a high energy group which may lead to preterm labor.

AB  - Shorter sleep duration is linked to obesity, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. Whether sleep deprivation during the postpartum period affects maternal postpartum weight retention remains unknown. This study examined the association of sleep at 6 months postpartum with substantial postpartum weight retention (SPPWR), defined as 5 kg or more above pregravid weight at 1 year postpartum. The authors selected 940 participants in Project Viva who enrolled during early pregnancy from 1999 to 2002. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios of SPPWR for sleep categories, controlling for sociodemographic, prenatal, and behavioral attributes. Of the 940 women, 124 (13%) developed SPPWR. Sleep distributions were as follows: 114 (12%) women slept < or =5 hours/day, 280 (30%) slept 6 hours/day, 321 (34%) slept 7 hours/day, and 225 (24%) slept > or =8 hours/day. Adjusted odds ratios of SPPWR were 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.42, 6.94) for < or =5 hours/day, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97) for 6 hours/day, and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) for > or =8 hours/day versus 7 hours/day (p = 0.012). The adjusted odds ratio for SPPWR of 2.05 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.78) was twofold greater (p = 0.02) for a decrease in versus no change in sleep at 1 year postpartum. Sleeping < or =5 hours/day at 6 months postpartum was strongly associated with retaining > or =5 kg at 1 year postpartum. Interventions to prevent postpartum obesity should consider strategies to attain optimal maternal sleep duration.

AB  - Objective: To assess sleep practices, and investigate their relationship with maternal and fetal outcomes, among pregnant Ghanaian women.Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana, between June and July 2011, postpartum women were interviewed within 48hours of delivery about sleep quality and practices during pregnancy. Interviews were coupled with a systematic review of participants' medical charts for key outcomes including maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, low birth weight, and stillbirth.Results: Most women reported poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Snoring during pregnancy was independently associated with pre-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.5; P=0.007). The newborns of women who reported supine sleep during pregnancy were at increased risk of low birth weight (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-20.2; P=0.025) and stillbirth (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.5-43.2; P=0.016). Low birth weight was found to mediate the relationship between supine sleep and stillbirth.Conclusion: The present findings in an African population demonstrate that maternal sleep, a modifiable risk factor, has a significant role in pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, and subsequently stillbirth.

AB  - Objective: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent restless legs syndrome (RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up.Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65,544 women (aged 41-58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs ≥ 5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review.Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15+ times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65-6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53-8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS.Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in non-obstetrical and obstetrical patients.Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of OSA and its relationship with pregnancy-related complications in a general obstetric population of Department of Defense beneficiaries receiving direct-care at military treatment facilities.Study Design: A retrospective cohort study of all women (N=305,001) who gave birth at a military treatment facility from 2008 to 2014. OSA cases were randomly selected and matched on age (3:1 ratio) to non OSA cases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes (cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, postoperative wound complications, hospital stay greater than five days, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, and stillbirth) between pregnant women with and without a diagnosis of OSA. Cases were identified using ICD-9 codes, while controlling for demographics, obesity, and medical comorbidities associated with OSA and the outcomes of interest.Results: We identified 266 cases of OSA (OSA rate=8.7 per 10,000; increased from 6.4 to 9.9 per 10,000 from 2009 to 2013). OSA was associated with a higher odds of cesarean delivery (AOR,1.60; 95% CI, 1.06-2.40), gestational hypertension, (AOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.30-4.68), preeclampsia (AOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.43-4.09), and preterm delivery (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.30).Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

AB  - Objective To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. Results Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P < .001). After adjustment for confounders including maternal depression, poor subjective sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs. ≤ 5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.02–2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR=1.18; 95% CI 1.08–1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=3.48; 95% CI 1.96–6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor. Conclusion Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

AB  - This cohort study examines mothers with a broad range of depression and anxiety symptom severity and performed magnetic resonance imaging on their 1-month-old infants to assess the association between exposre to prenatal depression and anxiety and offspring white matter microstructure. Key Points: Question: Are prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms associated with individual variations of offspring white matter microstructure? Findings: In this cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads, prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with infants' white matter microstructure at 1 month of age. Moreover, analyses suggest that prenatal maternal depression and anxiety may be differentially associated with infant male and female microstructure. Meaning: The prenatal environment is important to early brain development, and underlying white matter microstructure may be susceptible to the continuum of maternal depression and anxiety symptom exposure during the prenatal period. Importance: Maternal depression and anxiety can have deleterious and lifelong consequences on child development. However, many aspects of the association of early brain development with maternal symptoms remain unclear. Understanding the timing of potential neurobiological alterations holds inherent value for the development and evaluation of future therapies and interventions. Objective: To examine the association between exposure to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms and offspring white matter microstructure at 1 month of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads used a composite of depression and anxiety symptoms measured in mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy and measures of white matter microstructure characterized in the mothers' 1-month offspring using diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging performed from October 1, 2014, to November 30, 2016. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research facility during natural, nonsedated sleep. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the association between maternal depression and anxiety and 1-month infant white matter microstructure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging findings. Results: In the 101 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] age of mothers, 33.22 [3.99] years; mean age of infants at magnetic resonance imaging, 33.07 days [range, 18-50 days]; 92 white mothers [91.1%]; 53 male infants [52.5%]), lower 1-month white matter microstructure (decreased neurite density and increased mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) was associated in right frontal white matter microstructure with higher prenatal maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. Significant sex × symptom interactions with measures of white matter microstructure were also observed, suggesting that white matter development may be differentially sensitive to maternal depression and anxiety symptoms in males and females during the prenatal period. Conclusions and Relevance: These data highlight the importance of the prenatal period to early brain development and suggest that the underlying white matter microstructure is associated with the continuum of prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate relationships among obesity in pregnancy and plasma levels of tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenine (KYN), inflammatory markers, and depressed mood. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 374) were enrolled, and data were collected at a mean gestation of 20 weeks in this cross-sectional study. Plasma was analyzed for TRP, KYN, neopterin, and nitrite levels. Women completed demographic and mood scales. Results: There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TRP and positive correlations between BMI and KYN and the kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio. Neopterin was correlated with KYN/TRP, suggesting that the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) enzyme was activated. The correlations of neopterin and nitrite with BMI were too small to be clinically meaningful but may provide mechanistic insight. There was a correlation between depressed mood and nitrite levels. Depressed mood was also associated with lower TRP levels. When the sample was divided into pregnant women with or without obesity, TRP was significantly lower and the KYN/TRP ratio was significantly higher in the women with obesity. Conclusion: The pro-inflammatory state of obesity in pregnancy may drive activation of IDO-1, resulting in diversion of TRP away from serotonin and melatonin production and toward KYN metabolites. This alteration could contribute to depression, impaired sleep, increased production of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, and reinforcement of a pro-inflammatory state in pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Women of childbearing age (18–44 years) present an important group for understanding sleep, but few studies have focused on this population. No study has investigated the associations among sleep, overweight/obesity, and risk of type 2 diabetes among childbearing-age women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: Data were from NHANES, 2005–2008. The study population consisted of 18–44 year old women. Pregnant women and those diagnosed with sleep disorders were excluded. Sleep duration and quality were self-reported. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) measurements, and a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed by trained NHANES staff. An unadjusted linear regression analysis; a second adjusted for demographics only (partially adjusted model); and a third adjusted for demographics and variables associated with overweight/obesity and diabetes (fully adjusted model) were computed to assess associations among sleep duration/quality and BMI, WC, and 2-hour OGTT. Results: Total sample consisted of 2388 childbearing-age women. Only sleep duration was significantly associated with BMI and WC in the unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but was no longer significant in the fully adjusted model. Neither sleep duration nor quality was significantly associated with 2-hour OGTT in any of the models. Conclusions: Targeting sleep duration and sleep quality alone would not likely contribute to significantly lower BMI, WC, or risk of type 2 diabetes in US childbearing-age women. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones using objective measures of sleep, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Objectives Infant developmental outcomes may be influenced by a range of prenatal maternal characteristics. While there is some evidence to suggest that maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research and clinical practice. Methods Five electronic databases were systematically scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2) the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3) they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results Of the 968 papers identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low quality (<60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and low quality studies available. Conclusions Although maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the cross-sectional associations between musculoskeletal pain experience and measures of pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study.Participants and Methods: In total, 917 participants were eligible for analysis if they provided data pertaining to musculoskeletal pain status at the 22-year follow-up and had data for at least 1 valid pain sensitivity test. Standardized protocols were used to assess pressure pain threshold (4 sites: lumbar spine, tibialis anterior, upper trapezius, and wrist) and cold pain threshold (wrist). Four pain experience groups ("No pain" [n=562, 61.3%], "Low" [n=84, 9.2%], "Medium" [n=147, 16.0%], "High" [n=124, 13.5%]) were determined by latent class analysis using parameters of pain chronicity, frequency, intensity, and number of pain areas. Variables considered as confounders included sex, age, ethnicity, waist-hip ratio, psychological symptoms, sleep quality, physical activity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and income.Results: There were no associations between pain experience and pressure pain sensitivity after adjusting for confounders. The "Medium" and "High" pain experience groups demonstrated heightened cold pain sensitivity compared with the "No pain" group (P=0.023), adjusted for sex and smoking.Discussion: This study provides the most extensive investigation of the relationship between musculoskeletal pain experience and pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults. Heightened cold pain sensitivity in those classified as "Medium" and "High" pain experience may suggest altered nociceptive processing and has implications for clinical management.

AB  - Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period. A risk factor for mood disorders is poor sleep quality. In this study we investigate the effects of poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population.Methods: We analysed data from a subset of women taking part in a prospective cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes. The participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory between 26 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (Time 1) and at 3 months postpartum (Time 2), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Time 1. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, while adjusting for prenatal depressive/anxiety symptoms and education.Results: Although borderline-high depressive/anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictors of postnatal depressive/anxiety, independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality during pregnancy was also associated with borderline-high postnatal depressive symptoms, but not with postnatal anxiety.Limitations: Sleep quality and prenatal/postnatal mood were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias.Conclusion: Although treatment of symptoms of prenatal depression and anxiety will be the most important for reducing postnatal depression and anxiety, in addition to that, future studies may explore treatments improving prenatal sleep quality, particularly for women with antenatal depressive symptoms.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Clinic-based study. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (< or = 6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting < or = 6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (> or = 10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (< 5 h) and long (> or = 10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short and long sleep duration.

AB  - Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, little is known about the association of SDB with timing of delivery. We examined the association of snoring frequency, a key SDB marker, and snoring intensity, a correlate of SDB severity, with time-to-delivery among a cohort of pregnant women.Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 1483 third trimester pregnant women were recruited from the University of Michigan prenatal clinics. Women completed a questionnaire about their sleep, and demographic and pregnancy information was abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of those with hypertension or diabetes, 954 women were classified into two groups by their snoring onset timing, chronic or pregnancy-onset. Within each of these groups, women were divided into four groups based on their snoring frequency and intensity: non-snorers; infrequent-quiet; frequent-quiet; or frequent-loud snorers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery, adjusting for maternal characteristics.Results: Chronic snoring was reported by half of the pregnant women, and of those, 7% were frequent-loud snorers. Deliveries before 38 weeks' gestation are completed occurred among 25% of women with chronic, frequent-loud snoring. Compared with pre-pregnancy non-snorers, women with chronic frequent-loud snoring had an increased hazard ratio for delivery (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.45).Conclusions: Snoring frequency and intensity is associated with time-to-delivery in women absent of hypertension or diabetes. Frequent-loud snoring may have a clinical utility to identify otherwise low-risk women who are likely to deliver earlier.

AB  - Aims: A longitudinal birth cohort provides an opportunity to study the impact of childhood conditions persisting into adulthood. This study examines the cross-sectional association of asthma with sleep quality and snoring in the adolescent and young adult population and the extent to which asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years independently predict themselves or each other at 21 years.Methods: Data from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015 participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 and 21 years.Results: Poor sleep quality and snoring were independently associated with asthma at 14 years and 21 years, with stronger associations evident in women. At 21 years, associations were mediated by asthma symptom severity. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years each strongly and independently predicted themselves at 21 years. Asthma at 14 years predicted snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index.Conclusions: The relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21 years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns regarding potential harmful effect of medications on fetuses often result in inadequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy, whereas risks posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma are often underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on preterm delivery and fetal growth. METHODS: Study participants were individuals enrolled in the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study between February 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003. Pregnant women with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 719) evaluated their asthma control repeatedly during pregnancy based on symptom frequency and interference with daily activities and sleep and reported hospitalizations and unscheduled clinic visits for asthma exacerbations. The incidence of preterm delivery, the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, and mean birth weight were evaluated relative to asthma symptom control and exacerbation measures. RESULTS: The incidence of preterm delivery was significantly higher among patients with inadequate asthma symptom control during the first part of pregnancy (11.4%) compared with patients with adequate asthma control (6.3%; P = .02). Similarly, patients who were hospitalized for asthma during pregnancy had a higher incidence of preterm delivery (16.4%) compared with asthmatic women without a history of hospitalization (7.6%; P = .02). The effect seemed independent from use of systemic corticosteroids and other covariates. Neither the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction nor mean birth weight varied by any measures of asthma symptom control or exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a substantial risk for preterm delivery posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma and provides additional evidence regarding the importance of adequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy to maintain optimal asthma control.

AB  - This study aimed to explore attitudes towards family formation in single or cohabiting childless women of advanced age. The design comprised semi-structured qualitative interviews of 20 women aged 34–39 years attending the Fertility Assessment and Counselling Clinic, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. A sample of 10 single women and 10 cohabiting women was chosen with equal distribution of postgraduate education length. Data were analysed using content analysis following the method of Graneheim and Lundman and consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ). The general attitude towards family formation was characterized by a fear of the consequences of choosing motherhood on one hand, and a ‘ticking biological clock’ and a wish to establish a nuclear family on the other. The women idealized the perception of perfect mothering in terms of uncompromising expectations of child rearing and showed an increasing awareness of solo motherhood as a possible solution to advanced age, the wish of a child and single status compared to earlier studies. Our study contributes to knowledge and understanding of personal considerations related to childbearing in nullipara women in their mid- to late 30s and may be useful in a fertility assessment and counselling setting.

AB  - Auditory development in the fetus and infant entails the structural parts of the ears that develop in the first 20 weeks of gestation, and the neurosensory part of the auditory system develops primarily after 20 weeks' gestational age. The auditory system becomes functional at around 25 weeks' gestation. The cochlea of the middle ear and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are most important in the development of the auditory system. They are both easily affected by the environment and care practices in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). The period from 25 weeks' gestation to 5 to 6 months of age is most critical to the development of the neurosensory part of the auditory system. This is the time when the hair cells of the cochlea, the axons of the auditory nerve, and the neurons of the temporal lobe auditory cortex are tuned to receive signals of specific frequencies and intensities. Unlike the visual system, the auditory system requires outside auditory stimulation. This needs to include speech, music, and meaningful sounds from the environment. The preterm as well as the term infant cannot recognize or discriminate meaningful sounds with background noise levels greater than 60 dB. The more intense the background noise, especially low frequency, the fewer specific frequencies (pitch) can be heard and used to tune the hair cells of the cochlea. Continuous exposure to loud background noise in the NICU or home will interfere with auditory development and especially frequency discrimination. The initial stimulation of the auditory system (speech and music) needs to occur in utero or in the NICU to develop tonotopic columns in the auditory cortex and to have the critical tuning of the hair cells of the cochlea occur. The control of outside noise, the exposure to meaningful speech sounds and music, and the protection of sleep and sleep cycles, especially rapid eye movement sleep, are essential for healthy auditory development. The environment and care practices for the fetus in utero or the infant in the NICU are critical factors in the development of the auditory system. Copyright © 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: To investigate whether or not infants exposed to methamphetamine prenatally have impaired arousal responses from sleep.Methods: The polygraphic nap studies involved 42 infants aged 3 months exposed to methamphetamine in utero and a comparison group of 57 infants. A proportion of mothers in both groups smoked cigarettes and/or marijuana and drank alcohol during pregnancy. White noise from 50 to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10 dB intervals twice within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and arousal thresholds measured.Results: Combining groups, 306 tests were completed (128 and 178 within REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more likely to wake at lower thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95% CI, 3.78-8.23 p < 0.0001). No significant differences in arousal threshold were found between methamphetamine and comparison groups, before or after controlling for other substance use (NREM sleep; 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.59 and REM sleep; 1.03, 95% CI, 0.56-1.89).Conclusions: These findings suggest that arousal responses of methamphetamine-exposed infants remain intact, providing no support for the hypothesis that prenatal exposure could increase their vulnerability to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) through arousal deficits.

AB  - The two principal challenges of neonatal physiologic monitoring device are: (1) the development of computational strategies that consider the rudimentary forms of neonatal sleep state especially for preterm infants and (2) any physiologic monitoring device for clinical applications in a neonatal intensive care setting must be small, portable, and user-friendly. Our multicenter neonatal sleep consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over 370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index: quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals, spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.

AB  - HATA, T.,et al.: Autonomic Modulation of Sinus and Atrioventricular Nodes in Premature Low-Birth-Weight Infants. Respiratory vagal activity is expressed by heart rate variability (HRV) at approximately 1 month of age in premature low-birth-weight infants (PLBWI). However, the autonomic inputs into the sinus node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) in PLBWI are unclear. We evaluated the variability in PP and PR intervals at day zero (day 0) and 1 month (1 month) after birth in 16 PLBWI (gestation 32.3± 1.3 weeks, birth weight 1.578± 257 g). The polygraph was recorded during sleep on day 0 and at 1 month. PP and PR intervals and the number of respiratory cycles were measured, and frequency analysis was performed by auto-correlation fast Fourier transforms. Power spectral density (PSD: ms2) was calculated for the low frequency domain (LF: 0.036~0.146 Hz), high frequency domain (HF: 0.146~0.390 Hz), total frequency (TF: 0.036~2.000 Hz), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA: frequency bandwidth of 0.3 Hz with peak respiratory frequency as median), and the PSD ratio in the PP and PR intervals (LF/HF, RSA/TF) were compared. Compared with day 0, a decrease in the LF/HF ratio and an increase in the RSA/TF ratio in PP intervals were observed at 1 month, consistent with expression of respiratory vagal activity. For PR intervals, on the other hand, the LF/HF ratio increased, indicative of accentuated sympathetic activity. However, the respiratory vagal input was weak, and the RSA/TF ratio remained unchanged. These observations suggest that, in PLBWI at 1 month, AVN conduction was not predominatly influenced by respiratory-related vagal activity, but was controlled by autonomic regulation, independent of the SAN.(PACE 2005; 28:S288-S291)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of back pain and treatment satisfaction in a population of low-socioeconomic pregnant women. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design to determine the prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy for 599 women. Women completed an author-generated musculoskeletal survey in the second trimester of their pregnancy that addressed pain history, duration, location, and intensity, as well as activities of daily living, treatment frequency, and satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of the total population reported musculoskeletal pain, and nearly half presented with a multi-focal pattern of pain that involved 2 or more sites. Twenty-one percent reported severe pain intensity rated on a numerical rating scale. Eighty percent of women experiencing pain slept less than 4 hours per night and 75% of these women took pain medications. Importantly, 85% of the women surveyed perceived that they had not been offered treatment for their musculoskeletal disorders. CONCLUSION: Multi-focal musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy was prevalent in this underserved patient population. The pain in this population negatively affected sleep and treatment appeared inadequate.

AB  - This study explored the practises of Canadian obstetricians, family physicians, and midwives in recommending bed rest or activity restriction for women at risk for preterm birth and examined whether they had decisional conflict about using this therapy.A self-administered mail survey was sent to 1437 prenatal care providers. The questionnaire underwent expert review, content validity testing, revisions, translation into French and pre-testing. A proportionate stratified random sample of 30 percent was used for physicians. For midwives, a total population sample was taken in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec, and in Ontario a random sample of 30 percent was used. Using the Dillman protocol, each person in the sampling frame was contacted up to five times: pre-notice letter, first survey, reminder postcard, second survey, and third survey.Of the 1437 potential participants, 813 (56.6%) returned surveys. Of these, 1168 were eligible for the study and 516 (44.2%) completed surveys. Thirty-five percent of obstetricians, 42.7 percent of family practitioners and 21.4 percent of midwives recommended bed rest in hospital. Larger numbers recommended bed rest at home: 64.7 percent of obstetricians, 69.9 percent of family practitioners and 52.1 percent of midwives. Two-thirds of care providers indicated that bed rest was only 'fair to poor' in helping to prevent preterm birth. Cervical changes as compared to other warning signs of preterm labour led to increased use of bed rest at all gestational ages in singletons and multiples. Sixty-one percent of obstetricians, 71.7 percent of family physicians and 48.8 percent of midwives do NOT routinely recommend any sort of rehabilitative exercise program. The top five concerns about side effects associated with bed rest were deep vein thrombosis, stress, depression, sleep disturbances and economic problems. Care providers recommending bed rest have some decisional conflict as measured by the Provider Decision Process Assessment Instrument (mean score 30/60).Except for situations of multiple pregnancy, there is inconsistent practice in recommending bed rest. There is also inconsistency about the extent of activity restriction to recommend. This data provides some of the first Canadian perspective on the use of bed rest in pregnancy and the decisional conflict of care providers in recommending this therapy, and offers valuable background information for future clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the number 1 cause of postneonatal infant death. Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare. METHODS: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon's population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant 'always,' 'almost always,' 'sometimes,' or 'never.' Frequent bedsharing was defined as 'always' or 'almost always'; infrequent was defined as 'sometimes' or 'never.' RESULTS: Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse. CONCLUSIONS: Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death 'suffocation' or 'overlay asphyxiation' simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This 'diagnostic drift' may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.

AB  - The obstetric nurse returns to the scenery of reproductive health with their responsibilities enlarged, as strategy proposed by the OMS, for the reduction of the maternal and perinatal mortality rates, what increases the demands of better professional qualification, so that the interventions implemented for the protection of women's and children's health are effective and efficacious. In this perspective, we aimed to propose a behavior guideline for clinical actions of nurses in prenatal consultations based on the occurrence of Nursing phenomena in the physiological dimension, subsidized in the CIPE - alpha version. This study was developed in the Center of Natural Childbirth of the Center of Family Development of the Federal University of Ceara. The population was composed of 253 records of pregnant women that attended the prenatal nursing consultation in the period between July 2003 and August 2004 and the sample was composed of 62 records selected at random. The data were collected in the months of May and August 2004. The most prevalent phenomena in the pregnant women were: intermittent sleep (56,5%); functional dyspnea (51,6%); edema (37,1%); orthopnea (35,5%) and constipation (32,2%). The conduct guide's development made it possible to verify that the use of technologies is something accessible to Nursing and that the CIPE can contribute to a better organization of the nurse's actions during prenatal.

AB  - Sleep patterns and dream content may be affected by stressful life events such as pregnancy loss. Women who are pregnant subsequent to a prior pregnancy loss tend to have anxious and emotionally charged experiences during their pregnancies. Dreams can affect pregnancy outcomes, specifically premature birth. This qualitative study is the first investigation to explore sleep disturbances caused by dreams as experienced by a diverse group of women pregnant subsequent to a pregnancy loss. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 4 categories of dreams. We offer clinical assessment and intervention strategies to support these women prenatally and present suggestions for research to facilitate our understanding of their experiences.

AB  - The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.

AB  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.

AB  - Biological processes and functions in women are well organized in time, as evidenced by the expression of ultradian (high frequency), circadian ( approximately 24-hour), circamensual ( approximately monthly), and circannual ( approximately yearly) rhythms and by the changes that occur with menarche, reproduction, and menopause. Attributes of women's circamensual structure have been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease, and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse effects of prescription and nonprescription medications widely used by women can vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for their use. Medication trials must be comprehensive and representative of women and men of different life stages, ethnicities, and likely times (morning vs. evening) of drug use.

AB  - Previous research suggests that maternal psycho-social-behavioral factors (such as psychological distress and negative life events) and elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. However, studies to date have not examined the role of psycho-social-behavioral variables as predictors of elevated CRH. The goal of this study was to use multiple measures to obtain a more comprehensive picture of chronic maternal stress in an effort to more adequately evaluate the relationships between CRH and psycho-social-behavioral variables.One hundred twenty women, less than 20 weeks of gestation, were recruited, consented, and enrolled into the study. One hundred women had blood samples collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH. Eighty-five participants completed and returned self-administered questionnaires at 14-20 weeks gestation. Measures included perceived stress, depression, anxiety, social support, domestic violence/abuse, optimism levels, coping styles, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns.The findings indicate significant weak associations between CRH (low vs. high) and sleep hours/night, hours of standing/day, reports of adequacy of income to meet needs, and the coping styles of 'religion,' 'disengagement,' and 'humor' (p < .05). Logistic regression modeling identified three predictor variables (adequacy of income to meet needs, and coping styles of 'religion' and 'disengagement') accounting for 42.2% of the variance in CRH level.These findings are the first to examine psycho-social-behavioral variables as predictors of CRH level in pregnancy. Women who report that their family incomes do not meet their needs had almost three times the odds for high CRH levels. Women who used religion and disengagement coping styles also had higher odds (14 and 7, respectively) for high CRH levels. Psycho-social-behavioral factors, including those identified as weak predictors of elevated CRH in this study, warrant additional consideration preparatory to establishing interventions to prevent preterm birth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses when placed skin-to-skin on their mother's chests, called kangaroo care (KC), for the first 6 hours after birth, instead of having the neonates go to an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used in this descriptive study to enroll neonates who were given continuous KC beginning soon after birth in the delivery room and continuing for 6 hours. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, abdominal temperature, and behavioral state were recorded each minute. SETTING: Data were collected in the delivery room and in a private labor room in tropical Cali, Colombia. PARTICIPANTS: Six 34-36-week preterm neonates with 5-minute APGAR scores of 6 or more were enrolled. Two neonates had grunting respirations before KC was begun. RESULTS: Temperature rose rapidly to thermoneutral range. With few exceptions, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits; grunting respirations in two neonates disappeared with warmed humidified oxygen and continuous KC. Sleep predominated, and neonates were discharged home by 48 hours being fully breastfed, suggesting that KC was an environment conducive to recovery from fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that KC beginning in the delivery room can be given safely and perhaps with benefit to 34-36-week gestation neonates who appear healthy at birth. Kangaroo care was conducive to recovery from birth-related fatigue.

AB  - Rationale: Anxiety during pregnancy has been linked to adverse maternal health outcomes, including postpartum depression (PPD). However, there has been limited study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during pregnancy. Objectives: Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a 2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior. Results: Lower cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone throughout the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of allopregnanolone + pregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were elevated. Conclusions: These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLO + pregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote negative emotional responses.

AB  - The primary aim was to determine whether there was an inverse association between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the development of traits associated with asthma in children at age six years. A prospective cohort study of children from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a significant (p<0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio{OR}=1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis (hazard ratio{HR}1.22 {1.03-1.43}); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36 {1.17-1.59}) and; (vii) positive reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life. These findings are important for our understanding of the aetiology of and for the potential prevention of asthma in children.

AB  - Breastfeeding (BF) is a health-promoting behavior and exclusive BF has proven economic and ecologic benefits to individuals and societies. Yet Healthy People 2010 BF objectives for exclusive BF remain unmet and prevalence is lowest for low-income populations. The purpose of this descriptive longitudinal study of 126 predominantly low income and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads was to compare maternal and infant factors associated with nighttime BF behavior between exclusive BF dyads and supplemented dyads. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, independent t-tests, and Chi-square tests were used for analysis. BF behavior was categorized as either (1) exclusive BF, defined as 100% BF or breastmilk feeding on all three nights, or (2) supplementation, defined as any formula during any of the three nights.Compared to women in supplementation (n=59), women in exclusive BF (n=67) were older, more likely Caucasian, working at 36 weeks pregnant but not working at 1 month postpartum, in a relationship, and getting less help with baby at night. There was no group difference in objective sleep at the last month of pregnancy assessment. At one month postpartum, women in the supplementation group averaged 30 minutes less night sleep compared to women in the exclusive BF group.Compared to infants who were supplemented (n=54), infants who were exclusively breastfed (n=66) were significantly more likely to room-in with mothers in hospital and receive a home visit. They were statistically larger at birth, although the difference in size may not be clinically relevant.Assessment of sleep in new mothers is important for BF maintenance and more effort is needed to promote exclusive BF among younger women, African Americans and women of Asian descent. Rooming-in practice in the hospital after birth should be encouraged, as it was significantly associated with exclusive BF behavior at one month postpartum in this diverse sample of new families. Future research using a qualitative approach would be ideal to discover how nighttime feeding for new mothers evolves over time, their motivation for BF, and their network of influence in support of BF behavior. Findings from qualitative research will be useful in developing an effective intervention for BF maintenance.

AB  - Question: Does brief behavioural intervention aimed at modification of infant sleep patterns at age 8 months improve maternal depression and child sleep at age 2 years? Patients: 328 mothers reporting infant sleep problems at ageI 7 months. Mothers were recruited to the study when the infant was 4 months old but were only allocated to intervention or usual care if they reported infant sleep problems in a questionnaire administered at 7 months of age. Exclusions: infants born before 32 weeks' gestation; or mother's English too poor to complete self-report questionnaIre. Setting; Well child centres in six government areas (two low, two medIum and two hIghly disadvantaged), Melbourne, Australia. Recruitment October to November 2003. Intervention: Brief behavioural sleep intervention (n = 174) or usual well child care (n = 154). Sleep intervention was delivered by specially trained nurses who taught parents two main strategIes: either 'controlled crymg', where parents respond to the infant's cries at increased time intervals, or 'adult fading', where a parent sits with the infant until they fall asleep then slowly removes this presence over a few weeks. The nurse worked with the mother to develop an individual sleep management plan based on controlled crying, adult fading or simple strategies such as bedtime routine or pacifier use. Outcomes; Primary outcome: maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score community cut-off of >9 or clinical cut-off of > 12). Secondary outcomes: parenting practices (Parent Behaviour Checklist), child mental health (Child Behaviour Checklist) and mother's report of child sleep problems at 2 years or of persistent sleep problems (present at 10, 12 and 24 month assessments). Patient follow-up; Intervention, 82%; usual care, 84%. METHODS Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial (well child centres were the unit of randomisation). Allocation; Concealed. Blinding: Single blind (assessors blinded). Follow-up period: 17 months (until infant was 2 years old) MAIN RESULTS Of the 174 mothers offered the brief behavioural sleep intervention, 100 took up the offer of help. The controlled crying strategy was chosen by 53 families, adult fading by seven families and the remaining 40 families chose simple strategies such as bedtime routine. When the infants were 2 years old, mothers in the brief behavioural intervention group were less likely to report clinical levels of depression than mothers who received usual care (see online table). There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of children reported to have sleep problems at age 2 years (see table), in parenting practices (harsh discipline and nurturing) or in child mental health (externalising and internalising behavioural problems). CONCLUSIONS Brief behavioural strategies aimed at improving sleep patterns in infants with sleep problems can reduce depression in mothers.

AB  - Objective To assess satisfaction with maternity waiting home built spaces and features in women who are at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. residential facilities that temporarily house near-term pregnant mothers close to healthcare facilities that provide obstetrical care). Specifically we wanted to answer the questions: (1) Are built spaces and features associated with maternity waiting home user satisfaction? (2) Can built spaces and features designed to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function improve maternity waiting home user satisfaction? And (3) Which built spaces and features are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction? Design A cross-sectional study comparing satisfaction with standard and non-standard maternity waiting home designs. Between December 2016 and February 2017 we surveyed expectant mothers at two maternity waiting homes that differed in their design of built spaces and features. We used bivariate analyses to assess if built spaces and features were associated with satisfaction. We compared ratings of built spaces and features between the two maternity waiting homes using chi-squares and t -tests to assess if design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function were associated with higher satisfaction. We used exploratory robust regression analysis to examine the relationship between built spaces and features and maternity waiting home satisfaction. Setting Two maternity waiting homes in Malawi, one that incorporated non-standardized design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy, and function (Kasungu maternity waiting home) and the other that had a standard maternity waiting home design (Dowa maternity waiting home). Participants 322 expectant mothers at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. first-time mothers and those with no pregnancy risk factors) who had stayed at the Kasungu or Dowa maternity waiting homes. Findings There were significant differences in ratings of built spaces and features between the two differently designed maternity waiting homes, with the non-standard design having higher ratings for: adequacy of toilets, and ratings of heating/cooling, air and water quality, sanitation, toilets/showers and kitchen facilities, building maintenance, sleep area, private storage space, comfort level, outdoor spaces and overall satisfaction ( p  = <.0001 for all). The final regression model showed that built spaces and features that are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction are toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space ( R 2 = 0.28). Key conclusions and implications for practice The design of maternity waiting home built spaces and features is associated with user satisfaction in women at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes, especially related to toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space. Improving maternity waiting home built spaces and features may offer a promising area for improving maternity waiting home satisfaction and reducing barriers to maternity waiting home use.

AB  - A sample of 750 women were interviewed during pregnancy on their depression and anxiety symptoms, substance use and demographic variables. A subsample was seen again at the neonatal stage (n = 152), and their infants were observed for sleep-wake behavior. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to caffeine use. Mothers who consumed more caffeine also smoked more often, were younger, were less educated, reported less sleep effectiveness and more obstetric complications. Their newborns were lower birthweight, they spent less time in REM sleep, and they showed more stress behaviors including hiccups, tremors and jerkiness.

AB  - Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n ¼118 and 122) were randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample 1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with few resources.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To monitor preterm infants in a cot and a car seat and compare an observed car seat trial with polysomnography (PSG). DESIGN: Non-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Regional neonatal unit. PATIENTS: Preterm infants before discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Nap PSG respiratory and sleep variables were measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate. Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of the PSG and observed tests were predefined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG. RESULTS: 20 infants (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and arousals in the cot than the car seat (p = 0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively). Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG. CONCLUSIONS: Immature infants exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.

AB  - Background -- Being born preterm, small, and to a mother who smokes are common perinatal complications with major public health implications. Evidence suggests that each affects the body's structure and function in ways that could increase susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction later in life. Here, we used 2 routine stress reactivity tests to identify incipient 'silent' programming of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with adverse perinatal events.Methods and Results -- We studied 29 control babies born at term to nonsmokers, 18 term-born babies of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy (mean, 15 cigarettes a day), and 31 babies born preterm to nonsmokers. All infants were compared at the same age after conception (ie, at 40 to 42 weeks), during sleep. We analyzed blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to breathing 4% CO2 for 4 minutes or to passive head-up tilt to 60°. BP was measured continuously from a wrist cuff. CO2 exposure raised heart rate and BP in controls by 10%, and tilt increased their BP by 5%. CO2 elicited the expected BP but no heart rate response from preterm infants but a much-greater-than-expected BP and heart rate response from babies of smokers. Tilt elicited a 3- to 4-fold greater rise in BP from preterm and tobacco-exposed babies.Conclusions -- Vascular, cardiac, and blood pressure reactivity is heightened in babies born preterm or to smokers. The findings are consistent with in utero and early postnatal 'programming' of human cardiovascular dysfunction by adverse circumstances. This incipient dysfunction may be an early manifestation of processes that lead to other problems or complications later on (eg, higher BP or sudden infant death syndrome).

AB  - Preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at a rate more than double that of term infants. There is a need for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations (RRRs) for parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used. Two weeks before discharge, mothers completed a survey, addressing knowledge and plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen mothers, mean age 26.4 years, participated; 8 (53%) returned the postdischarge survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high. Mothers' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the module (P= .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home (P= .012). Mothers found the use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans for caring for their infant, with 28.6% of mothers always offering a pacifier before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7% who had planned to do this before discharge. However, only 71% of infants slept in parents' room after discharge and only 41% were receiving at least some breast milk, which are not consistent with SIDS RRRs.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of certified nurse‐midwives related to sudden infant death syndrome and infant safe sleep. However, this population is an important and trusted source of information for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these topics with certified nurse‐midwives to identify potential barriers as well as enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal health care environment. Methods: Participants in this cross‐sectional survey study were certified nurse‐midwives who provide prenatal health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse‐midwives listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333). Results: A total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two‐thirds had positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether they discussed this topic with their patients. Discussion: Certified nurse‐midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important that they are familiar with current evidence‐based recommendations on infant safe sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment.
