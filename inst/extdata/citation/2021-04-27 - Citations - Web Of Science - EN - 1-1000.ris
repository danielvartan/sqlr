TI  - Association of daytime napping in relation to risk of diabetes: evidence from a prospective study in Zhejiang, China
T2  - NUTRITION & METABOLISM
AB  - Background Diabetes was a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases. However, the associations between daytime napping and diabetes in the existing literature is still inconsistent. Methods The analysis included 53,916 participants aged 30-79 years of the China Kadoorie Biobank prospective study from Tongxiang. Incident diabetes were identified through linkage with incident diabetes surveillance systems, health insurance system, and death registries. Cox regressions were used to estimate the associations of daytime napping with diabetes. Results 5.11% of participants reported habitual daytime napping. During 488,233 person-years (median 9.4 years) of follow-up, 3333 incident diabetes, including 1249 males and 2084 females, were documented. After adjusting for socio-demographic status, behavioral lifestyle, BMI, waist circumference and snoring, as comparison with those without daytime napping, the hazard ratios for risk of diabetes were 1.39 (95% CI 1.21-1.59). The corresponding figures for males and females were 1.45 (95% CI 1.20-1.74) and 1.30 (95% CI 1.05-1.59), respectively. The corresponding figures for postmenopausal and premenopausal females were 1.41 (95% CI 1.08-1.80) and 1.13 (95% CI 0.78-1.59), respectively. Conclusions Habitual daytime napping is positively associated with risk of diabetes in adults, except premenopausal females.

TI  - The effect of group cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in postmenopausal women
T2  - JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
AB  - The menopausal period is associated with several complications in women. One of these complications is sleep disorders including insomnia disorder that can affect all aspects of personal life. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on insomnia severity and sleep quality among postmenopausal women. This was a randomised clinical trial in which 46 women were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups, one receiving CBT-I and a control group. The CBT-I group received six sessions of training, while the control group received only usual care. A demographic questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were used to collect the data. The ISI and PSQI were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks after intervention, and in a 4-week follow-up. The Independent t test, the chi-square test, generalised estimating equation models, and Bonferroni correction were applied to analyse the data. According to our results, in the CBT-I group compared to the control group, the mean ISI, PSQI, sleep onset latency, sleep time, and sleep quality score reduced continuously from baseline to week 3 and from week 3 to week 6, and remained constant from week 6 to week 10. The mean sleep efficiency score improved significantly from baseline to week 3 in the CBT-I group and remained unchanged until the end of the study. CBT-I could significantly improve insomnia severity and sleep quality in postmenopausal women. Therefore, using this method is recommended for menopausal women with insomnia.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: Yes, No or maybe?
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Over nine million breast cancer survivors worldwide suffer compromised quality of life attributable to estrogen depletion related symptoms of menopause and side effects of cancer therapy. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is very effective in managing these symptoms in general population and in breast cancer survivors. However, the concern of breast cancer recurrence as a result of HRT use keeps many oncologists from using this approach in symptom management. Evidence from randomized trials, observational studies and met-analyses on the impact of HRT use on breast cancer recurrence and survival remains controversial. Climacteric symptoms in breast cancer survivors should be delineated for type and severity for methodical management. Lifestyle modifications are effective for mild symptoms, while non-hormonal pharmaceutical approaches can be used as second-line therapy for control of hot flashes, vulvo-vaginal atrophy, arthralgia, mood swings, sleep disturbance, and depression. Evidence does not conclusively render HRT, as a contraindicated approach for these patients; informed consent and shared-decision-making is a reasonable approach for HRT use in symptomatic breast cancer survivors.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between Depression on Menopausal Symptoms and Personality Trails
T2  - INTERNATIONAL QUARTERLY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION
AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore the potential relationships between menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, hot flash, and depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women. A cross-sectional study was designed with 150 healthy postmenopausal women (45-60 years of age) who had referred to the menopausal clinic in Babol. The participants completed the following instruments throughout the study: the Beck Depression Inventory for depressive symptoms, the Modified Blatt-Kupperman Menopausal Index for measuring menopausal symptoms, and the NEO-FFI for identifying the personality traits. After controlling all the covariates, high depressive symptoms were found to be associated with moderate/sever menopausal symptoms, poor sleep quality, and the average and high level of neuroticism. The results also demonstrated that the risk of depressive symptoms was lower in menopausal women with high level extroversion, high level agreeableness, and the average and high level of conscientiousness. The findings of the present study indicated that personality traits, menopausal symptoms, and poor sleep quality in particular can partially account for depression in Iranian menopausal women. It is highly imperative that effective health education or implement appropriate strategies to improve the quality of life for these women.

TI  - Migraine Triggers: An Overview of the Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Atmospherics, and Their Effects on Neural Networks
T2  - CUREUS
AB  - We define a migraine trigger to be an endogenous agent or agency such as the menses or an exogenous agent or agency such as red wine or a drop in barometric pressure, and their ability to reduce the threshold of a migraine attack in those predisposed to migraine. This definition excludes agents with idiosyncratic mechanisms that may trigger a migrainous (migraine-like) headache in non-migraineurs such as benign cough headaches or headaches due to altitude-sickness. We also assume as axiomatic that migraine has as its basis the activation of the trigeminovascular pathway (TVP) and the key role of serotonin and the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The network activation of the visual/auditory association cortices and the rostrodorsal pons (locus ceruleus and raphe nucleus) are also accepted as key features of activation of the TVP. In addition, we outline the role of the superior salivatory nucleus-sphenopalatine ganglion-greater superficial petrosal nerve (SSN-SPG-GSPN) arc in migraine activation.
   We also explore how olfactory afferents intermingle with trigeminal nerve collaterals in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb thus allowing volatile molecules to activate the TVP and induce a migraine. The classification of migraine triggers is complex, as there is a wide panorama of inciting agents, including atmospheric conditions, a wide-ranging variety of foods and beverages, endogenous hormonal influences, synthetic alkaloids and dyes, and volatile molecules (odorants). We will explore the high-frequency migraine-provoking agents in each category. There are exciting and intriguing hypotheses regarding the role of atmospheric chemistry when the barometric pressure drops; the role of hot, dry desert winds and lightning discharges in the generation of cations and the turnover of serotonin in the nervous system. We will explore the effects of a drop in barometric pressure on the vestibular nuclei and the modulation of sympathetically mediated pain. The role of volatile odorants and their activation of the transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA-1) receptor will be outlined. We will streamline the highly complex role of estrogen fluctuation in the precipitation of migraine headaches, its pharmacodynamic effects, and the role of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) of the hypothalamus. We will also adumbrate the protean effects of alcohol and its congeners and the role of stress and sleep disturbances in the allostatic load model of salience network-pain perception.

TI  - Postmenopausal Symptoms and Management by Women in Delhi-NCR
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES
AB  - Menopause is defined as the complete cessation of the menstrual cycle in women for twelve consecutive months. Although menopause is an important aspect of the female reproductive health cycle, it is often ignored. Women may experience different menopausal and postmenopausal symptoms ranging from mild to severe. In the present study, a cross-sectional survey of 200 women in their postmenopausal years was conducted across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). A pretested questionnaire was given to a random population of postmenopausal women to record various postmenopausal symptoms and the coping strategies adopted by them. The mean age of menopause of the sample population was 47.48 years, and body mass index seemed to affect the age of onset of menopause. The majority of women experienced postmenopausal symptoms, with 95.28% experiencing more than one symptom, ranging from fatigue and sleep disturbances to severe symptoms such as anxiety attacks, palpitations and joint pains. Many women used different coping strategies, such as changes in lifestyle and social interaction with other women experiencing menopause. Very few women used hormone replacement therapy as a coping mechanism and most of them were ignorant about the same. Interestingly, both education and working status were observed to affect the adoption of coping strategies by women in Delhi-NCR. The results of the study emphasize the need of addressing the problems of the postmenopausal population and incorporating the same in the national healthcare programme.

TI  - Exposure to light at night (LAN) and risk of breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Background: With the unprecedented urbanization light pollution has emerged as a ubiquitous problem, and there has been accumulating evidence on the links between exposure to light at night (LAN) and breast cancer risk. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the associations between LAN exposure and breast cancer risk.
   Methods: We included all observational human studies wherein the exposure variable was LAN measured in indoor and outdoor environments, and the outcomewas breast cancer. Weemployed summary relative risks (SRR) for breast cancer by comparing highest versus lowest categories of LAN exposure within a random-effectsmodel. The National Toxicology Program's (NTP) Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating toolwas adopted to assess the risk of bias in individual studies and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guideline was employed to assess confidence in the body of evidence.
   Results: A total 14 studies comprising four cohorts (13,155 cases among 372,802 exposed subjects), nine casecontrol and one case-referent studies of female subjects (39,462 cases and 20,739 controls) across seven countries and published between 2001 and 20 were included for review. Participants in the highest LAN exposure category were associated with higher risk of breast cancer in reference to those in the lowest (SRR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.06-1.18; I-2=39% for outdoor LAN, and SRR: 1.13; 95%CI: 1.05-1.21; I-2=19% for indoor LAN). Pooled evidence identified relatively pronounced association of outdoor LAN exposure and breast cancer amongwomen with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumor (SRR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04-1.40) and premenopausal status (SRR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.06-1.37). The final rate of confidence in the body of evidence generated was graded as `moderate' based on GRADE guideline.
   Discussion: LAN exposure was consistently associated with higher breast cancer risk corroborating NTP's recommendations which anticipates excessive LAN as human carcinogen. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cognitive profiles in perimenopause: hormonal and menopausal symptom correlates
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Objective
   Perimenopause is associated with declines in attention, working memory and verbal memory; however, there are significant individual differences. Further, the contributions of hormones and menopausal symptoms to domain-specific cognitive functions remain unknown. This longitudinal study aimed to determine whether there were distinct cognitive profiles in perimenopause and to identify factors associated with each profile.
   Design
   In a sample of 85 women evaluated over 400 bi-annual visits, we administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, assessed menopausal symptoms and measured 17 beta-estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone. Multilevel latent profile analysis was used to identify cognitive profiles. Regressions were conducted to determine differences in hormones and symptoms by profile after adjusting for Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop + 10 (STRAW + 10) stage and demographic factors.
   Results
   Perimenopausal cognitive profiles consisted of cognitively normal (Profile 1; n = 162), weaknesses in verbal learning and memory (Profile 2; n = 94), strengths in verbal learning and memory (Profile 3; n = 98) and strengths in attention and executive function (Profile 4; n = 61). Profile 2 was differentiated by less hormonal variability and more sleep disturbance than Profile 1 (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions
   There is significant heterogeneity in cognition during perimenopause. While most women do not develop impairments, a significant minority experience weaknesses in verbal learning and memory. Profile analysis may identify at-risk populations and inform interventions.

TI  - The impact of cannabis use on vasomotor symptoms, mood, insomnia and sexuality in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Objective
   This study aimed to evaluate the published data on the effect of cannabis use in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women to alleviate menopausal symptoms, insomnia and anxiety.
   Methods
   Databases searched included Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, LILACS and AMED. Selected studies assessed perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, cannabis use impact and menopausal symptoms.
   Results
   A total of 564 studies were retrieved. Three studies met the inclusion criteria. One study controlled for participant cannabis use and reported on the effects of cannabis and placebo cigarette smoking on mood in 10 postmenopausal women. Another study assessed associations between drug use with hot flashes and insomnia in 120 HIV-infected women and found that menopausal status and cannabis use was crudely associated with the presence of hot flashes. The last study evaluated expectancies of 115 menopausal patients who endorsed lifetime cannabis use and reported that women expected cannabis to improve depression, anxiety, hot flashes and problems with sleep. None of these studies assessed quality of life as an outcome.
   Conclusion
   There is a paucity of literature on the impact of cannabis use in menopause. Research into cannabis consumption in menopause is essential, as it is frequently used to alleviate symptoms without evidence of its benefits.

TI  - Assessing the efficacy of a structured stress management program in reducing stress and climacteric symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of a structured education program on lifestyle habits, which is also incorporating teaching on deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided visualization, in the control of various components of the climacteric symptomatology in peri- and postmenopausal women. Sixty-one women aged 40-65 years with varying climacteric and stress symptoms were included in this study. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group (31) or the control group (30). The intervention group followed an 8-week stress management program. The following parameters were assessed at baseline and at the end of the 8-week follow-up period in both groups: climacteric symptoms (Green Climacteric Scale (GCS)), sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), mood status (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale), and health-related control (health locus of control (HLC)). A mixed-model ANOVA showed significant time x group x GCS interaction (within subjects: F = 23.830, p valueF = 39.078, p value<0.001). With regard to HLC, there was a non-significant between subjects but a significant within-subjects effect (HLC x group x time, F = 3.848, p value = 0.024). Regarding DASS scores, there was a significant between-subjects' effect (F = 10.258, p value = 0.003) but a non-significant within-subjects' effect. With regard to PSQI, the analysis showed significant within-subjects' effects (PSQI x group x time: F = 4.691, p value = 0.003) and non-significant between-subjects' effects (F = 0.022, p = 0.883). Finally, regarding RSS, there was a significant within-subjects' (RSS x group x time, F = 4.183, p value = 0.029) but non-significant between-subjects' effect (F = 1.582, p value = 0.213). Stress management may offer an alternative approach to the management of climacteric symptoms.

TI  - Effects of Menopause in Women With Multiple Sclerosis: An Evidence-Based Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Over two thirds of all individuals who develop multiple sclerosis (MS) will be women prior to the age of menopause. Further, an estimated 30% of the current MS population consists of peri- or postmenopausal women. The presence of MS does not appear to influence age of menopausal onset. In clinical practice, symptoms of MS and menopause can frequently overlap, including disturbances in cognition, mood, sleep, and bladder function, which can create challenges in ascertaining the likely cause of symptoms to be treated. A holistic and comprehensive approach to address these common physical and psychological changes is often suggested to patients during menopause. Although some studies have suggested that women with MS experience reduced relapse rates and increased disability progression post menopause, the data are not consistent enough for firm conclusions to be drawn. Mechanisms through which postmenopausal women with MS may experience disability progression include neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration from age-associated phenomena such as immunosenescence and inflammaging. Additional effects are likely to result from reduced levels of estrogen, which affects MS disease course. Following early retrospective studies of women with MS receiving steroid hormones, more recent interventional trials of exogenous hormone use, albeit as oral contraceptive, have provided some indications of potential benefit on MS outcomes. This review summarizes current research on the effects of menopause in women with MS, including the psychological impact and symptoms of menopause on disease worsening, and the treatment options. Finally, we highlight the need for more inclusion of MS patients from underrepresented racial and geographic groups in clinical trials, including among menopausal women.

TI  - Association of premature menopause with incident pulmonary hypertension: A cohort study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Several forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) disproportionately affect women. Animal and human studies suggest that estradiol exerts mixed effects on the pulmonary vasculature. Whether premature menopause represents a risk factor for PH is unknown.
   Methods and findings
   In this cohort study, women in the UK Biobank aged 40-69 years who were postmenopausal and had complete data available on reproductive history were included. Premature menopause, defined as menopause occurring before age 40 years. Postmenopausal women without premature menopause served as the reference group. The primary outcome was incident PH, ascertained by appearance of a qualifying ICD code in the participant's UK Biobank study record. Of 136,715 postmenopausal women included, 5,201 (3.8%) had premature menopause. Participants were followed up for a median of 11.1 (interquartile range 10.5-11.8) years. The primary outcome occurred in 38 women (0.73%) with premature menopause and 409 (0.31%) without. After adjustment for age, race, ever-smoking, body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, cholesterol-lowering medication use, C-reactive protein, prevalent type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, heart failure, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, venous thromboembolism, forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 second-to-FVC ratio, use of menopausal hormone therapy, and hysterectomy status, premature menopause was independently associated with PH (hazard ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.31-3.23, P<0.001). In analyses of alternate menopausal age thresholds, risk of PH appeared to increase progressively with younger age at menopause (P-trend <0.001), with 4.8-fold risk in women with menopause before age 30 years (95% CI 1.82-12.74, P = 0.002). Use of menopausal hormone therapy did not modify the association of premature menopause with PH.
   Conclusions
   Premature menopause may represent an independent risk factor for PH in women. Further investigation of the role of sex hormones in PH is needed in animal and human studies to elucidate pathobiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

TI  - Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in surgical menopause: subtypes and associated factors
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Objective
   The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subtypes, amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), in women with surgical menopause.
   Methods
   We obtained the database containing information for 200 women with surgical menopause from our previous study. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment - total score, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment - memory index score (MoCA-MIS) and their age, years since menopause, education, medical and surgical history, hormone therapy use, exercise, sleep duration, alcohol use, smoking and family history of dementia were obtained. All participants without the MoCA-MIS were excluded.
   Result
   The average age of the 164 participants was 56.3 +/- 6.9 years. The prevalence of MCI, aMCI and naMCI was 43.3%, 9.8% and 33.5%, respectively. The duration of education reduced MCI for 93% (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.20) of the women. In late postmenopause, hormone therapy >10 years showed 47% lower prevalence of MCI (age-adjusted odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.22-1.28). Finally, length of education was the only independent factor associated with MCI and its subtypes.
   Conclusion
   We found a high prevalence of MCI and the non-amnestic subtype in women with surgical menopause. Further study is needed to clarify the long-term effects of surgical menopause on cognitive function.

TI  - Relationship between sensitive skin and sleep disorders, fatigue, dust, sweating, food, tobacco consumption or female hormonal changes: Results from a worldwide survey of 10 743 individuals
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
AB  - Background Sensitive skin is related to environmental factors.
   Objectives We aimed to investigate the roles of poorly known associated and triggering factors on sensitive skin in a large global population.
   Methods A survey was administrated to a representative sample of the adult population aged 18-75 years in five different countries (Brazil, China, France Russia, and the United States). All participants answered a web-based questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, sensitive skin and environmental factors.
   Results Among the 10 743 included individuals (5285 men and 5458 women), 48.2% declared that they had sensitive skin. The group with sensitive skin reported significant increases in fatigue, dust or sweating and to a lesser extent food or tobacco consumption. The members of this group also declared that they experienced more sleep disorders than individuals without sensitive skin. Sensitive skin was very frequent in pregnant women, women with painful menstruations or women using contraceptive pills.
   Conclusions This large cohort study identified new factors, including female hormonal status, fatigue, sleep disorders and food, associated with sensitive skin. These associations suggest that sensitive skin is not restricted to an epidermal disorder but may be included in a larger context. The identified factors are potential upstream drivers of neurogenic inflammation in sensitive skin.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of PD with ADHD and psychological symptoms among adolescents. Another objective was to examine the PD related non-psychogenic factors and sleep quality.
   Materials and methods: Two hundred nine adolescent girls who applied to policlinics for various reasons were enrolled. All participants completed self-report questionnaires. Questionnaire for sociodemographic data, menstrual pattern and dysmenorrhea in adolescents, Visual analog scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, DSM-5 Level 2 Sleep Disorders Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Turgay Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition-Based Child and Adolescent Disruptive Behavior Disorders Screening and Rating Scale were used to measure outcomes.
   Results: A hundred and four (49.8%) adolescents reported having pain that affects daily activities during menstruation. These adolescents had worse sleep quality, more inattention and hyperactivity impulsivity problems, and other psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, somatization, negative self-perception, and hostility in comparison to others (P < 0.05). The menstrual pain severity, measured by VAS, was positively correlated with ADHD symptoms and all other psychological parameters (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: PD affecting daily-activities may be related to ADHD symptoms and psychiatric distress. Future studies are needed to support the association between ADHD and PD. Assessing the psychiatric problems of adolescents with dysmenorrhea is important.

TI  - The role of GABA neurotransmitter in the human central nervous system, physiology, and pathophysiology
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE NEUROCIENCIA
AB  - GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system (CNS) and one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in mammals is distributed in most areas of the brain and participates in 40% of the inhibitory synapses of adult vertebrates. It is produced in the CNS, through the decarboxylation of glutamic acid, catalyzed by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GABA exerts its inhibitory effect through two types of specific receptors, GABA A (ionotropic) and GABA B (metabotropic), which show different pharmacological, structural, and molecular differences. Even though GABA plays a key role in the physiology of the CNS modulating different processes, also is involved in some pathologies, furthermore, is a target for several therapeutics drugs. For instance, GABA has important involvement in sleep cycle regulation, and for decades benzodiaze-pines and gaboxadol have been prescribed for the treatment of insomnia. In epilepsy disease, the pharmacological and gene expression studies suggest a role in the prevention of seizures by blocking the regulation of GABA A receptors with specific antagonists. In depression and anxiety, studies indicate changes in the regulation of the genes which encoding GABA receptors. In the same way, GABA receptors have been associated with alcoholism and premenstrual syndrome. In conclusion, experimental evidence suggests, that the same subtype of GABA receptors showed a different pattern of cellular population and subcellular expression in different areas of the brain, modulating the excitability, and neuronal synchronization in different affection pathologies and conditions in humans.

TI  - Sleep Quality is associated with Central Arterial Stiffness in Postmenopausal Women: A Cross-sectional Pilot Study
T2  - ARTERY RESEARCH
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the associations between sleep quality and arterial stiffness in healthy postmenopausal women. A total of 31 healthy postmenopausal women aged between 50 and 74 years participated in this study. Objectively and subjectively measured sleep quantity and quality were concomitantly obtained by a waist-worn actigraphy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and daily sleep diary. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV), and femoral-ankle PWV (faPWV) were measured as indices of arterial stiffness. Based on the PSQI score, the participants were divided into good (PSQI < 5.5; n = 21) and poor (PSQI > 5.5; n = 10) sleepers. Self-reported sleep duration was significantly longer in poor sleepers than in good sleepers. However, there was no difference in total sleep time measured by actigraphy between the two groups. Additionally, sleep latency and wake after sleep onset significantly increased, and sleep efficiency significantly decreased in poor sleepers than in good sleepers. The cfPWV and baPWV were significantly higher in poor sleepers than in good sleepers, even after adjustment for risk factors (i.e., age, blood pressure, and physical activity), but no difference in faPWV. These results suggest that decreased sleep quality is associated with an increase in central arterial stiffness in postmenopausal women.

TI  - The impact of the 24-h movement spectrum on vascular remodeling in older men and women: a review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Aging is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, which are preceded by early, negative remodeling of the vasculature. Low physical activity is a well-established risk factor associated with the incidence and development of disease. However, recent physical activity literature indicates the importance of considering the 24-h movement spectrum. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine the impact of the 24-h movement spectrum, specifically physical activity (aerobic and resistance training), sedentary behavior, and sleep, on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes in older adults, with a focus on recent evidence (<10yr) and sex-based considerations. The review identifies that both aerobic training and being physically active (compared with sedentary) are associated with improvements in endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and cerebrovascular function. Additionally, there is evidence of sex-based differences in endothelial function: a blunted improvement in aerobic training in postmenopausal women compared with men. While minimal research has been conducted in older adults, resistance training does not appear to influence arterial stiffness. Poor sleep quantity or quality are associated with both impaired endothelial function and increased arterial stiffness. Finally, the review highlights mechanistic pathways involved in the regulation of vascular and cerebrovascular function, specifically the balance between pro- and antiatherogenic factors, which mediate the relationship between the 24-h movement spectrum and vascular outcomes. Finally, this review proposes future research directions: examining the role of duration and intensity of training, combining aerobic and resistance training, and exploration of sex-based differences in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes.

TI  - Autoimmune Diseases in Patients with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency-Our Current State of Knowledge
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), previously known as premature ovarian failure or premature menopause, is defined as loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 years. The risk of POI before the age of 40 is 1%. Clinical symptoms develop as a result of estrogen deficiency and may include amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, vasomotor instability (hot flushes, night sweats), sleep disturbances, vulvovaginal atrophy, altered urinary frequency, dyspareunia, low libido, and lack of energy. Most causes of POI remain undefined, however, it is estimated that anywhere from 4-30% of cases are autoimmune in origin. As the ovaries are a common target for autoimmune attacks, an autoimmune etiology of POI should always be considered, especially in the presence of anti-oocyte antibodies (AOAs), autoimmune diseases, or lymphocytic oophoritis in biopsy. POI can occur in isolation, but is often associated with other autoimmune conditions. Concordant thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and Grave's disease are most commonly seen. Adrenal autoimmune disorders are the second most common disorders associated with POI. Among women with diabetes mellitus, POI develops in roughly 2.5%. Additionally, autoimmune-related POI can also present as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS), a condition in which autoimmune activity causes specific endocrine organ damage. In its most common presentation (type-3), APS is associated with Hashomoto's type thyroid antibodies and has a prevalence of 10-40%. 21OH-Antibodies in Addison's disease (AD) can develop in association to APS-2.

TI  - Higher poultry consumption was associated with an earlier age at menarche
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - Aim: To examine the association between meat consumption and earlier age of menarche among schoolgirls in Shanghai.
   Methods: The study randomly selected 1981 schoolgirls aged 6-18 years in Shanghai using a two-stage random sampling design. Information on meat intake was collected using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Menarche age, household income, physical activity and other covariates were obtained by standardised questionnaires. Logistic regression was used to analyse the association between intake of meat and earlier age of menarche. Earlier age of menarche was defined as first menstruation before 12 years of age.
   Results: Among the 986 girls who had experienced menarche, 518/986 (52.5%) had earlier age of menarche. After adjusting for body mass index, age, physical activity, sleep, household income and parental education, consumption of poultry was positively associated with risk of earlier age of menarche (P-trend = .03). Girls who never consumed poultry had a lower risk of earlier age of menarche (odds ratio [OR]: 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.96). Neither the consumption of pork, beef, lamb, processed meat nor total meat consumption was associated with menarche age.
   Conclusion: Higher consumption of poultry was associated with an earlier age at menarche.

TI  - The effect of the menstrual cycle on the sense of touch, grip strength and manual dexterity of dental students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND ERGONOMICS
AB  - Objectives. This study aimed to evaluate through comparative tests the effect of the menstrual cycle on levels of depression, sleep quality and grip strength, fingertip touch and manual dexterity of students in the Dental Faculty. Methods. The study sample was formed from female students of the Dental Faculty. The total 70 participants comprised 31 from the first year and 39 from the final year. Evaluations were made in two different consecutive phases of the menstrual cycle. Data were collected using the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), handgrip and lateral grip strength measurements, fingertip two-point discrimination sensory measurement, the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, the O'Connor tweezers skill test and the Purdue pegboard test. Results. A statistically significant difference was determined between the menstrual and ovulation phase measurements of the BDI, PSQI, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test (right), the O'Connor tweezers skill test and Purdue pegboard test (right + left), and the Purdue Pegboard test (total and assembly) (p < 0.05). Conclusions. The menstrual cycle does not affect the sense of touch, grip strength and simple hand skills. However, task-focused skills requiring care and the manual dexterity needed for the use of instruments are affected.

TI  - A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Investigate the Effects of Kamishoyosan, a Traditional Japanese Medicine, on Menopausal Symptoms: The KOSMOS Study
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective. The KOSMOS study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, investigated the effects and safety of kamishoyosan (TJ-24), a traditional Japanese medicine, in the treatment of climacteric disorder. Methods. Japanese women with climacteric disorder were administered a placebo during a 4-week run-in period, after which they were classified as placebo responders (R group) if their score on the modified Questionnaire for the Assessment of Climacteric Symptoms in Japanese Women (m-QACS) with excitability and irritability as the primary outcome improved by >= 3 points and as placebo nonresponders (NR group) otherwise. Members of the NR group were randomly allocated to receive either TJ-24 or placebo. After 12 weeks, their m-QACS scores, anxiety and depression, sleep, and overall quality of life (QOL) were compared. Results. The TJ-24 and placebo arms in the NR group included 20 patients each. The change in the m-QACS scores of members of the NR group for excitability and irritability at 12 weeks versus baseline was -3.1 +/- 1.7 in the TJ-24 arm, a significant decrease, but compared with -2.7 +/- 2.2 in the placebo arm, no significant difference was between two arms. However, the proportion of participants whose score improved by >= 3 points was significantly higher in the TJ-24 arm. In the subgroup analysis of premenopausal women, the changes in the score for excitability and irritability were significantly larger in the TJ-24 arm. The incidence of adverse drug reactions or adverse events did not differ between the two arms, and no serious events were reported. Conclusion. Although no significant difference was identified for the primary outcome, a significantly higher proportion of patients who received TJ-24 displayed improvement. Its high level of safety and effects on excitability and irritability in premenopausal women suggest that TJ-24 may be a useful treatment.

TI  - Is Prolonged Stress Causes Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome? A Survey from Delhi, National Capital Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine ovarian disorder found to be affecting 6-26% of female respondents globally.(1) Symptoms include hirsutism, anovulation and psychological factors like severe mood swings, depression etc. Stress, which is majorly caused by unhealthy lifestyle, especially in prolonged cases alters the metabolism of body and causes severe diseases like PCOS and decreases the efficiency of females. This study aims to evaluate as to whether stress is one of the major hidden reasons for PCOS in the females of Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region).
   METHODS
   120 female students had given their consent to fill an online questionnaire made on Google forms and were distributed via WhatsApp. The form consisted of 31 questions distributed over stress and symptoms of PCOS.
   RESULTS
   Efficiency of 54.5 % of the respondents had decreased in the absence of sound sleep as they mostly experienced 'situational stress'. Recurrence of sleeplessness had led to anger in 71 % of above respondents. It was also observed that 55 % of the respondents had a sign of early reproductive / late adolescence and they experienced irregular menstrual cycle along with facial hair, stretch marks, acne and severe hair fall.
   CONCLUSIONS
   57 % of the respondents had both stress and symptoms of PCOS. Modifications in their lifestyles / dietary habits could control and improve the situation. Healthy lifestyle certainly helps in the treatment but is not a complete cure for PCOS.

TI  - Blood pressure variability in normotensive perimenopausal women: Non-dipping status, maximum blood pressure and arterial stiffness
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Postmenopausal women are more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension and are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with age-matched men. Blood pressure variability is emerging as a predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and may be implicated in the relationship between menopause and worsened vascular health in women. We conducted an observational study, BRAVE (Blood pRessure And Vascular hEalth around menopause) to study this relationship.
   Method: Normotensive perimenopausal women were recruited. Blood pressure variability was measured through 24-h blood pressure monitoring. Vascular health was assessed through arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity), carotid intima-media thickness and endothelial function (reactive hyperemic index). Multivariate models were performed to identify factors associated with blood pressure variability and arterial stiffness in perimenopausal women.
   Results: Forty-nine healthy women ( mean age 52.9 +/- 4.0, 63% postmenopausal) were recruited. There was a high prevalence (40%) of night non-dipping, a measure of an abnormal pattern of blood pressure variability. Aside from night dipping, other measures of blood pressure variability were similar between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In the multivariate analysis, body mass index was the only factor associated independently with different measures of blood pressure variability, including the maximum overnight blood pressure (beta = 1.95, p < 0.01). The latter was also significantly associated with arterial stiffness (beta = 0.035, p = 0.048). Finally, poor sleep was independently associated with an increase in arterial stiffness.
   Conclusions: Abnormal blood pressure variability, particularly night non-dipping, is common in normotensive perimenopausal women. Maximum overnight blood pressure is independently associated with arterial stiffness and may identify women at higher cardiovascular risk. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Who is managing menopausal symptoms, sexual problems, mood and sleep disturbance after breast cancer and is it working? Findings from a large community-based survey of breast cancer survivors
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Purpose To determine the nature and severity of vasomotor symptoms, sexual problems, mood and sleep disturbance in community-dwelling breast cancer patients, whether and where they received treatment for these symptoms and their satisfaction with treatment received. Methods Online cross-sectional survey distributed through Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA). Results 524/2286 women responded to the invitation to participate. Of these, 74% (385/523) reported symptoms of interest and were included in the analysis. Mean age was 55.2 years and mean time since breast cancer diagnosis was 5.7 years. Most (66%) had received chemotherapy and were taking endocrine therapy (64%). The most common symptoms were hot flushes/night sweats and sleep disturbance (both 89%), vaginal dryness (75%), mood swings (62%) and sexual problems (60%). Symptoms were mild (21-33%) or moderate (21-38%) in around one third and severe in up to one quarter (8-26%). Symptoms affected the ability to "get on with their life" for 36%, predicted by severity of hot flushes (OR 1.4), sleep disturbance (OR 1.3), mood disturbance (OR 1.3), and sexual problems (OR 1.3). Only 32% were offered treatment, mostly delivered by GPs (33%) or oncologists (26%). Only 49% found this "somewhat effective" and 34% found it ineffective. The majority (60%) wanted more support to manage their symptoms. Conclusion Menopausal symptoms, sexual problems, mood and sleep difficulties are common after breast cancer and often not effectively managed. There is an unmet need for coordinated care providing effective treatments.

TI  - Effects of environmental, social and surgical factors on ovarian reserve: Implications for age-relative female fertility
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - Objective To investigate new risk factors for female fertility by analyzing the effects of environmental, social, and surgical factors on antral follicle counts (AFC) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels.
   Methods A total of 1513 women aged 20-47 years who underwent in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic injection treatment in Southwest Hospital from December 2017 to December 2019 were included. Women were assessed for AFC and AMH levels, and completed a questionnaire. Ordinal logistic regression analyses with generalized linear mixed models were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for diminished ovarian reserve.
   Results Adnexal surgery was the only risk factor associated with low AFC in women aged 20-30 years. Younger age at menarche, alcohol drinking, and adnexal surgery are three independent risk factors for AMH decline in women aged 20-30 years. Intense exercise, sleep quality, and adnexal surgery are three independent risk factors for a low AFC in women aged 31-36 years. Alcohol drinking and adnexal surgery are two independent risk factors for AMH decline in women aged 31-36 years.
   Conclusion With age, female fertility becomes sensitive to high-intensity exercise and poor sleep quality. Adnexal surgery and alcohol drinking are two important risk factors for female fertility in women under age 37 years.

TI  - Association Between Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase and Mild Cognitive Impairment in Chinese Women
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Dementia, as a global public health problem, is becoming increasingly serious. As a precursor of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and prevention of dementia. Recent studies have found a correlation between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and cognitive function in men. The relationship between GGT levels and cognitive function in women remains unclear because GGT activity and expression differ between the sexes.
   Method: We recruited a total of 2,943 Chinese women from Jidong and Taian in 2019. We grouped the participants according to GGT levels, diagnosed MCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale, and modeled the study outcomes using logistic regression to explore the relationship between GGT level and MCI. We also analyzed the interaction of obesity, sleep duration, and hyperuricemia with GGT in the development of MCI.
   Results: The prevalence of MCI increased with increasing GGT level, from the lowest quartile to the highest quartile of GGT: 8.4% (66/786), 14.2% (119/840), 17.6% (108/613), and 21.4% (151/704), respectively. At the same time, as GGT levels increased, so did the risk of MCI. In the fully adjusted model, compared with those for participants in the lowest GGT quartiles, the odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MCI for participants in the second, third, and fourth GGT quartiles were 1.49 (1.04-2.12), 1.53(1.06-2.21), and 1.88 (1.33-2.65), respectively. The risk of developing MCI was further increased in people with high GGT levels who were obese (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.39-2.76, P < 0.001), slept less (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.35-2.71, P < 0.001), had high levels of uric acid (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03-2.32, P < 0.001), or after menopause (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 2.07-4.12, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: We found that MCI is more common in women with elevated GGT levels, so GGT could be a potential diagnostic marker for MCI. Meanwhile, our findings indicated that women with high GGT levels had an increased risk of MCI when they were obese, sleep deprived, had high serum uric acid (SUA) levels or underwent menopause.

TI  - Chronic modafinil therapy ameliorates depressive-like behavior, spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity impairments, and sleep-wake changes in a surgical mouse model of menopause
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Depression, cognitive deficits, and sleep disturbances are common and often severe in menopausal women. Hormone replacement cannot effectively alleviate these symptoms and sometimes elicits life-threatening adverse reactions. Exploring effective therapies to target psychological problems is urgently needed. In this work, we developed a mouse model of menopause by bilateral ovariectomies (OVXs) and investigated whether menopausal mental symptoms can be ameliorated by psychostimulant modafinil (MOD) as well as explored the underlying mechanisms. At similar to 3 weeks after OVXs, mice got daily intraperitoneal administrations of MOD at the beginning of the active phase. Several behavioral tests and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were conducted. Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical experiments were carried out to evaluate the synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, respectively. We found that chronic MOD administration in OVX mice significantly decreased immobility time. The spatial memory performance of OVX mice improved significantly in response to MOD administration in the Morris water-maze test. The OVX mice were characterized by an attenuation of hippocampal synaptic transmission and synaptic long-term potentiation and had fewer 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus, which were restored after MOD administration. Antagonists of dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors and GABA(A) receptor agonists were involved in MOD-exerted anti-depressant actions and augments of hippocampal neurogenesis in OVX mice. Moreover, night-dosed MOD therapy significantly promoted the night-time delta-band EEG power during wakefulness and the day-time rapid eye movement sleep amount, which were significantly reduced by OVXs. Collectively, these findings suggest that MOD is a promising therapeutic candidate for menopausal women.

TI  - Are the factors associated with overweight/general obesity and abdominal obesity different depending on menopausal status?
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Rapid modernization in China has impacted the daily lives and health of women, including a rise in obesity. However, little is known about the impact of menopausal status, behavior, and psychosocial factors on the risk of obesity for rural women in China. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors, including demographic information (education, family history of T2DM, menopausal status), obesity-related behavior, and psychosocial factors associated with overweight/general obesity and abdominal obesity. In a cross-sectional study design, participants had their weight, height, and waist circumference measured and completed questionnaires regarding family demographics, obesity-related health behaviors (physical activity, diet, sleep), and psychosocial information (stress, social support, and self-efficacy related to physical activity and healthy diet). A total of 646 women were included in this study; 46.6% were overweight/generally obese, and 48% had abdominal obesity. Postmenopausal women had a higher prevalence of general and central obesity. Regular physical activity decreased the risk for overweight/general obesity and abdominal obesity (OR = .41 and .31, respectively, p = .04) in premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women who had not breastfed their infants and reported moderate/high-stress had a higher risk for overweight/general obesity (OR = 3.93, and 2, respectively) and those who reported less than 6 hours of sleep per day increased their risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 2.08). Different factors associated with obesity were found in Chinese women, depending on menopausal status. Future studies should examine the impact of menopause on a woman's risk for obesity, as well as develop tailored interventions to improve health, well-being and reduce the risk of obesity.

TI  - One size does not fit all: Assuming the same normal body temperature for everyone is not justified
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Despite the increasing personalization of medicine, surprisingly similar to 37.0 degrees C (98.6 degrees F) continues as the estimate of normal temperature. We investigated between-subject and within-subject thermal variability, whether a significant percentage of individuals have a low mean oral temperature, and whether these differ by sex, age, time of day, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), or menstrual phase. Oral temperature was measured by Life Brand(R) Fast-Read Digital Oral Thermometers and sampled 14 times over two weeks, seven morning and seven evening readings. The volunteer sample consisted of 96 adults (42 men, 54 women; 27 couples, 42 singletons), ages 18-67 years. We found sizeable individual differences in body temperature and that the normal temperature of many individuals is considerably lower than 37.0 degrees C (98.6 degrees F). Mean temperatures ranged from 35.2 degrees C (95.4 degrees F) to 37.4 degrees C (99.3 degrees F). The mean temperature across all participants was 36.1 degrees C (97.0 degrees F)-lower than most studies have reported, consistent with recent evidence of temperature declining over decades. 77% had mean temperatures at least 0.55 degrees C (1 degrees F) lower than 37.0 degrees C (98.6 degrees F). Mean temperature did not differ by age, but women had higher temperatures than men, even within a couple with room temperature and warmth of clothing equated. Although oral temperature varied widely across individuals, it showed marked stability within individuals over days. Variability of temperature over days did not differ by sex, but was larger among younger adults. Using 37.0 degrees C (98.6 degrees F) as the assumed normal temperature for everyone can result in healthcare professionals failing to detect a serious fever in individuals with a low normal temperature or obtaining false negatives for those individuals when using temperature to screen for COVID-19, mistaking their elevated temperature as normal. Some have called for lowering the estimate of normal temperature slightly (e.g., 0.2 degrees C [0.36 degrees F]). That still seems an overly high estimate. More important, using any standardized "normal" temperature will lead to errors for many people. Individual differences are simply too great. Personalizing body temperature is needed. Temperature could be measured at yearly doctor visits, as blood pressure is now. That would be simple to implement. Since our results show marked thermal stability within an individual, sampling temperature only once yearly could provide an accurate indication of a person's normal temperature at that time of day. Such records over time would also provide a more accurate understanding of how temperature changes over the lifespan.

TI  - Effectiveness of Menosan (R) Salvia officinalis in the treatment of a wide spectrum of menopausal complaints. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Objective: To evaluate efficacy and safety of fresh Salvia officinalis extract tablets in relieving typical symptoms in menopausal women and to gain insight in the mode of action by measuring altered cerebral wave intensities.
   Methods: Randomized 80 menopausal women from 48 - 65 years of age received Menosano tablets [3'400 mg ethanolic extract of freshly harvested Salvia officinalis L.] or placebo under double-blind conditions for 4 weeks. An efficacy analysis evaluated the developments of the menopausal rating scale [MRS], hot flush severity score [HFS] and quantitative electroencephalography [qEEG] intensities in the per protocol population. Results were further corroborated by data from the intention to treat population including late postmenopausal women.
   Results: Salvia off. distinctly reduced MRS by 39.2% from 15.3 +/- 6.87 to 9.3 +/- 5.75 and significantly in comparison to placebo (p = 0.002). The HFS score decreased by 55.3% from 15.9 +/- 13.77 to 7.1 +/- 7.41, reaching significance on week 3 onwards (p = 0.028). Clinical effects of Salvia off. correlated with relevant reduction of frontal lobe beta2 wave qEEG intensities at electrodes F3/4/7/8 and are underpinned by secondary parameters and ITT analysis. Salvia off. within 4 weeks significantly reduced the somato-vegetative (e.g. hot flushes) and psychological MRS subscale (e.g. physical and mental exhaustion) subscale (p < 0.05) without a significant effect on the genito-urinary subscale. A positive impact of Salvia off. compared to placebo was furthermore seen on sleep quality, discontent and fatigue (p < 0.05) as evidenced by sleep and profile of mood state questionnaires. Tolerability was uniformly rated as very good for Salvia off. extract and placebo, with an overall incidence of three adverse events in total, none of which treatment-related.
   Conclusion: The results support the use of Salvia off. for the specific treatment of a wide range of somato-vegetative and psychological symptoms as experienced by menopausal women and correlate this effect to a restoration of associated dysbalanced brain waves.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Melissa Officinalis L. versus Citalopram on Quality of Life of Menopausal Women with Sleep Disorder: A Randomized Double-Blind Clinical Trial
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GINECOLOGIA E OBSTETRICIA
AB  - Objective The present study aimed to assess the effect of Melissa Officinalis L. (a combination of lemon balm with fennel fruit extract) compared with citalopram and placebo on the quality of life of postmenopausal women with sleep disturbance.
   Methods The present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo clinical trial among 60 postmenopausal women with sleep disturbance who were referred to a university hospital from 2017 to 2019. The participants were randomized to receive M. Officinalis L. (500 mg daily), citalopram (30 mg) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire was self-completed by each participant at baseline and after 8 weeks of the intervention and was compared between groups.
   Results The mean for all MENQOL domain scores were significantly improved in the M. Officinalis L. group compared with citalopram and placebo (p < 0.001). The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) after 8 weeks in the M. Officinalis L., citalopram and placebo groups was 2.2 +/- 0.84 versus 0.56 +/- 0.58 versus 0.36 +/- 0.55 in the vasomotor (p < 0.001), 1.02 +/- 0.6 versus 0.28 +/- 0.2 versus 0.17 +/- 0.1 in the psychomotor-social (p < 0.001), 0.76 +/- 0.4 versus 0.25 +/- 0.1 versus 0.11 +/- 0.1 in the physical and 2.3 +/- 1.0 versus 0.35 +/- 0.5 versus 0.41 +/- 0.5 in the sexual domain, respectively.
   Conclusions The results revealed that M. Officinalis L. may be recommended for improving the quality of life of menopausal women with sleep disturbance.

TI  - Improving translational research in sex-specific effects of comorbidities and risk factors in ischaemic heart disease and cardioprotection: position paper and recommendations of the ESC Working Group on Cellular Biology of the Hear
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH
AB  - Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is a complex disorder and a leading cause of death and morbidity in both men and women. Sex, however, affects several aspects of IHD, including pathophysiology, incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis as well as treatment and outcome. Several diseases or risk factors frequently associated with IHD can modify cellular signalling cascades, thus affecting ischaemia/reperfusion injury as well as responses to cardioprotective interventions. Importantly, the prevalence and impact of risk factors and several comorbidities differ between males and females, and their effects on IHD development and prognosis might differ according to sex. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these differences are still poorly understood, and their identification might have important translational implications in the prediction or prevention of risk of IHD in men and women. Despite this, most experimental studies on IHD are still undertaken in animal models in the absence of risk factors and comorbidities, and assessment of potential sex-specific differences are largely missing. This ESC WG Position Paper will discuss: (i) the importance of sex as a biological variable in cardiovascular research, (ii) major biological mechanisms underlying sex-related differences relevant to IHD risk factors and comorbidities, (iii) prospects and pitfalls of preclinical models to investigate these associations, and finally (iv) will provide recommendations to guide future research. Although gender differences also affect IHD risk in the clinical setting, they will not be discussed in detail here.

TI  - The "Tongmai Tiaoshen" abdominal massage therapy of traditional Chinese medicine improves sleep quality of chronic insomnia patients: A case report
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background and purpose: "Tongmai Tiaoshen" practices are effective for treating psychophysiological disorders. Herein, we report the treatment of a post-menopausal female patient with chronic insomnia using "Tongmai Tiaoshen" abdominal massage therapy.
   Materials and methods: A 62-year-old woman who had chronic insomnia due to deficiency of heart and spleen accompanied by anxiety and depression for 30 years was treated with "Tongmai Tiaoshen" abdominal massage therapy for six weeks. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores were recorded before and after treatment to evaluate treatment efficacy.
   Results: Compared with the baseline, PSQI, HDRS, and SAS scores were significantly lower after application of the abdominal massage therapy.
   Conclusion: The "Tongmai Tiaoshen" abdominal massage therapy may alleviate the symptoms of chronic insomnia caused by deficiency of heart and spleen, thus improving the quality of sleep and mitigating the state of anxiety and depression.

TI  - Identifying women who share patterns of reproductive hormones, vasomotor symptoms, and sleep maintenance problems across the menopause transition: group-based multi-trajectory modeling in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective:
   To identify groups of women who share levels and patterns of change in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), self-reported sleep maintenance problems, and frequent vasomotor symptoms (VMS) up to 10 years before and after their final menstrual period and to evaluate their premenopausal characteristics.
   Method:
   Group-based multi-trajectory modeling grouped 1,407 women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation who had an observed natural menopause and did not use hormone therapy, based on repeated measures of FSH, sleep maintenance problems, and frequent VMS relative to final menstrual period. Multivariable analyses assessed race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, and depressive symptoms as predictors of group membership.
   Results:
   Women formed five distinct groups: (1) low symptoms (low VMS/sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 552; 39.2%); (2) moderate VMS and sleep problems/low FSH rise (N = 169; 12.0%); (3) dominant sleep problems (lower VMS/high sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 203; 14.4%); (4) dominant VMS (high VMS/lower sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 297; 21.1%)); and (5) high symptoms (high VMS/high sleep problems)/intermediate FSH rise (N = 186; 13.2%)). Multivariate analyses showed that race/ethnicity, premenopausal body mass index and depressive symptoms, and increasing depressive symptoms during the early phase of the transition predicted group membership.
   Conclusions:
   Women can be classified based on shared levels and patterns of FSH, sleep maintenance problems, and frequent VMS across the menopause transition. Either VMS or sleep maintenance problems can be dominant in the face of high FSH. Experiencing one menopause-related symptom or hormone profile does not automatically imply that another is also being experienced.

TI  - Menopause symptoms delineated by HIV clinical characteristics in African American women with HIV
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective:
   To obtain data on prevalence and severity of climacteric symptoms in women with HIV (WWH) during the menopausal transition and early menopause and to evaluate for any differences in symptoms by CD4 count and viral load.
   Methods:
   We conducted an in-person survey of female patients attending the Johns Hopkins HIV clinic, ages 40 to 50 years with at least one menstrual period within 6 months before the survey. Interviews utilized the Greene Climacteric scale, a validated menopause questionnaire. We also queried patients, (1) if they were informing their primary care physician of menopause symptoms and (2) if their menopause symptoms were being treated. The study used nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum tests with significance defined as P Results:
   Twenty-three women aged 40 to 50 years were interviewed with a median age of 47 years [25 percentile = 46, 75 percentile = 49]. All were African American with median length of HIV diagnosis of 12 years [25 percentile = 7, 75 percentile = 20.5]. Most of the patients, 87% (n = 20), reported experiencing at least one menopause symptom with intense frequency and extreme detrimental effects on quality of life. All women interviewed, 100% (n = 23), reported hot flashes, ranging from infrequent to persistent. Sleeping difficulty was reported by 78% (n = 18) of women. Most women, 78% (n = 18), reported feeling tired or lacking energy with moderate frequency. The majority of the women, 87% (n = 20), said they reported menopause symptoms to their primary care provider. Of these, only 20% received treatment for menopause symptoms.
   Conclusions:
   These findings suggest that WWH undergoing the menopausal transition experience intense symptoms severely impacting quality of life. Although the majority of women reported experiencing menopause symptoms to medical providers, most remained untreated. An opportunity exists to educate providers caring for WWH on menopause medicine.

TI  - Serotonergic antidepressants for sleep disturbances in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Importance:
   Although previous meta-analyses mainly focused on the effects of hormonal treatment against menopausal sleep disturbances, the therapeutic role of antidepressants has not been systematically addressed.
   Objective:
   To study the therapeutic benefit and safety of antidepressants in menopausal sleep disturbances.
   Evidence review:
   Randomized controlled trials assessing the therapeutic effects of antidepressants against menopausal sleep problems were identified from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct databases from inception to March 1, 2020. Studies that were clinical trials with placebo controls were included. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to a random effects model.
   Findings:
   Analysis of seven eligible randomized controlled trials including a total of 1,949 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women showed the effectiveness of serotonergic antidepressants against sleep disturbances despite the small effect size (Hedge g = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.11-0.38). The efficacy remained significantly better than that of placebo for postmenopausal women (Hedge g = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.04-0.45), participants with hot flashes (Hedge g = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.02-0.34), and those without diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Hedge g = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.06-0.40). There was no difference in therapeutic benefit between sedating and nonsedating serotonergic antidepressants. Besides, the dropout rate did not differ between antidepressant and placebo groups.
   Conclusions and Relevance:
   Our results showed that serotonergic antidepressants were effective against sleep disturbances in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The efficacy remained significant for women without major depressive disorder. The dropout rates were also comparable between serotonergic antidepressants and placebo groups.

TI  - Efficacy of progestin-only treatment for the management of menopausal symptoms: a systematic review
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Importance: Menopause is associated with bothersome symptoms for many women, including mood changes, hot flushes, sleep problems, and fatigue. Progesterone is commonly prescribed in combination with estrogen therapy. Although monotherapy with progestins has been used as treatment of menopausal symptoms in women with contraindications to estrogens, the optimal route, and dosage of progestin monotherapy has not been established.
   Objective: To assess whether progestin as a standalone treatment is effective for treating vasomotor and mood symptoms associated with menopause.
   Evidence review: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Embase databases from January 1980 to January 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated different forms of progestin for the treatment of vasomotor or mood symptoms associated with menopause.
   Findings: A systematic search of 892 studies identified seven RCTs involving a total of 601 patients. The available literature was heterogeneous in terms of formulation and dose of progesterone; administration ranged from 5 to 60 mg of transdermal progesterone, 10 to 20 mg oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 300 mg of oral micronized progesterone. Duration of treatment also differed between studies, ranging from 21 days to 12 months (median: 12 wks). Three of seven RCTs reported that progestin therapy led to an improvement of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in postmenopausal women. The largest study administering oral progestin using 300 mg micronized progesterone reported a 58.9% improvement in VMS (vs 23.5% in placebo group, n = 133), whereas the largest study using transdermal progesterone reported no improvement (n = 230). No study reported an improvement of mood symptoms. Side effects, such as headaches and vaginal bleeding, were significant in five of seven RCTs and led to discontinuation of treatment in 6% to 21% of patients.
   Conclusions and relevance: A beneficial effect was reported in some trials with the transdermal route at longer duration and with oral treatment at higher doses for VMS for progesterone-only therapy. This report may help to inform future studies of progestin-only therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Aromatase Inhibitors in Postmenopausal Women with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: Profiles of Psychological Symptoms and Quality of Life in Different Patient Clusters
T2  - ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as adjuvant therapy after breast cancer (BC) surgery have demonstrated to reduce the risk of disease recurrence, to lower the risk of contralateral BC, and to improve survival when compared to tamoxifen in patients with limited-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) BC. However, AIs are associated with adverse events that can have a significant impact on patient quality of life (QoL). Aim: This study aimed to identify profiles of psychological symptoms and QoL in HR+ BC patients undergoing AI therapy. Method: Data were collected with questionnaires administered at three time points: AI initiation (t0); 3 months after AI initiation (t1); and 6 months after AI initiation (t2). The FACT-G, FACT-B, and FACT-ES questionnaires were used to assess QoL; psychological symptoms were assessed using the SCL-90-R. Results: 43 women were enrolled in the study (t0), and 37 completed the t1 evaluation and 29 the t2 evaluation. We found (1) a progressive decrease over time in FACT-G and FACT-ES scores, in particular in the Physical, Emotional, and Endocrine subscales, and an increase in the SOM (somatization) subscale of the SCL-90-R; (2) the presence of 4 clusters related to different psychological symptoms and QoL evolution over time; (3) that patients belonging to the cluster characterized by worsening symptoms and QoL during time differed from the others in the Emotional subscale of the FACT-B and in the GSI (Global Score), OCD (obsessive-compulsive), DEP (depression), ANX (anxiety), and SLP (sleep disorders) dimensions of the SCL-90-R and had significantly higher BMI levels; and (4) that 3 items from the SCL-90-R and 2 items from FACT Emotional Well-Being subscale were predictive of the "worst" cluster. Conclusions: Although larger studies are needed to confirm these results, our data open up new ways of investigation into the effects of AIs on QoL in HR+ BC patients.

TI  - Impact of progesterone on skin and hair in menopause - a comprehensive review
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - In clinical practice, micronized progesterone (MP) is frequently recommended to treat signs and symptoms of skin and hair aging in menopausal women. The aim of this comprehensive review was to evaluate whether topically or systemically applied MP may effectively prevent or slow down signs of skin and hair aging. Three out of six identified studies reported an impact of MP on skin aging markers in menopausal women. Of these, two studies reported a benefit: one for topically applied MP, another for systemically applied combined menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) comprising MP as progestogen for endometrial protection. Tolerability and safety of MP were good. However, there was no study investigating the impact of MP on menopausal scalp hair. In conclusion, delay of skin aging comprises lifestyle adjustment, antioxidants, and several esthetic procedures. In menopausal women, MHT displays beneficial effects on skin aging. There is poor quality but promising scientific evidence for MP displaying anti-aging skin effects in menopausal women. However, good quality studies are needed.

TI  - Daily, weekly, seasonal and menstrual cycles in women's mood, behaviour and vital signs
T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Dimensions of human mood, behaviour and vital signs cycle over multiple timescales. However, it remains unclear which dimensions are most cyclical, and how daily, weekly, seasonal and menstrual cycles compare in magnitude. The menstrual cycle remains particularly understudied because, not being synchronized across the population, it will be averaged out unless menstrual cycles can be aligned before analysis. Here, we analyse 241 million observations from 3.3 million women across 109 countries, tracking 15 dimensions of mood, behaviour and vital signs using a women's health mobile app. Out of the daily, weekly, seasonal and menstrual cycles, the menstrual cycle had the greatest magnitude for most of the measured dimensions of mood, behaviour and vital signs. Mood, vital signs and sexual behaviour vary most substantially over the course of the menstrual cycle, while sleep and exercise behaviour remain more constant. Menstrual cycle effects are directionally consistent across countries.

TI  - Beneficial effects of a high protein breakfast on fullness disappear after a night of short sleep in nonobese, premenopausal women
T2  - PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR
AB  - As insufficient sleep and obesity become more widespread, finding strategies to overcome changes in appetite and food cravings after sleep reduction is imperative. This study examined the effects of a high-protein (HP) and high-carbohydrate (HC) breakfast on appetitive sensations, food cravings, and dietary intake after nights of habitual (HS) and curtailed sleep (CS). Twenty-seven non-obese, premenopausal women who reported routinely eating breakfast participated in this randomized crossover study. Participants completed 4 laboratory visits with different combinations of sleep and breakfast conditions. Sleep was reduced by 33% on curtailed nights. At each visit, appetitive sensations were measured before breakfast and every 30 min thereafter throughout the 4-hour visit; area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Food cravings were assessed before and 3.5 h after breakfast. Intake of ad libitum lunch and daily dietary intake were measured. Regardless of the breakfast condition, CS increased hunger (p = 0.043) and desire to eat (p = 0.044) and decreased fullness (p = 0.035). The HP breakfast increased fullness AUC after HS (p = 0.022) but not CS. Regardless of the sleep condition, the changes in food cravings scores were significantly different based on breakfast condition (p = 0.009), with food cravings increased after the HC breakfast and decreased after the HP breakfast. However, breakfast condition did not influence hunger or desire to eat AUC after either sleep condition. Neither the breakfast condition nor the sleep condition influenced lunch and daily energy intake. In conclusion, it appears protein reduces food cravings regardless of sleep condition in this population but obtaining sufficient sleep is necessary to benefit from the effects of high protein intake on fullness.

TI  - The effects of pre-sleep consumption of casein protein on next-morning measures of RMR and appetite compared between sedentary pre- and postmenopausal women
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to compare next-morning responses of RMR and appetite to pre-sleep consumption of casein protein (CP) in pre- and postmenopausal women. The study was a randomised, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Seven sedentary premenopausal (age: 19 center dot 9 (sd 1 center dot 2) years; BMI: 23 center dot 1 (sd 2 center dot 6) kg/m(2)) and seven sedentary postmenopausal (age: 56 center dot 4 (sd 4 center dot 9) years; BMI: 26 center dot 3 (sd 3 center dot 5) kg/m(2)) women participated. During visit one, anthropometrics and body composition were measured. Following visit one, subjects consumed either CP (25 g) or placebo (PL) >= 2 h after their last meal and <= 30 min prior to sleep on the night before visits two and three. Visits two and three occurred >= 1 week after visit one and were 48 h apart. During visits two and three, RMR (VO2), RER and appetite were measured via indirect calorimetry and visual analogue scale, respectively. Anthropometrics and body composition were analysed by one-way ANOVA. RMR and measures of appetite were analysed using a 2 x 2 (menopause status x CP/PL) repeated-measures ANOVA. Significance was accepted at P <= 0 center dot 05. RMR was significantly lower in postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women under both conditions (P = 0 center dot 003). When consumed pre-sleep CP did not alter RMR, RER or appetite compared with PL when assessed next morning in pre- and postmenopausal women. These data contribute to growing evidence that pre-sleep consumption of protein is not harmful to next-morning metabolism or appetite. In addition, these data demonstrate that menopause may not alter next-morning RMR, RER or appetite after pre-sleep consumption of CP.

TI  - Effect of Mind-Body Approaches on Menopausal Symptoms among Women: A Community-Based Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND ALLIED SCIENCES NU
AB  - Introduction The process of women aging is characterized by a gradual transition from reproductive to nonreproductive life period. These changes in aging during menopause are accompanied by a wide range of physiological as well as psychological disturbing symptoms. The traditional therapeutic approach toward menopause management is hormone replacement therapy, which increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and coronary heart disease. However, the efficacy of complementary and alternative therapies like mind-body approach to troublesome hot flashes, anxiety, and depression is widely proven and it is used by many women. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the mind-body approach on menopausal symptoms among women.
   Methods A quantitative research approach with quasi-experimental pretest-post-test design was adopted in the study. A total of 20 samples between the ages of 48 to 55 years with menopausal symptoms were the participants. The intervention of mind body approach (Mindfulness meditation) was performed for 8 weeks, which includes 35 minutes of session per day.
   Results The majority (80%) of the participants were in the age group of 51 to 53 years and 50% of the participants attained menopause between 49 and 50 years. The results showed that the mean post-test menopausal symptom score was 15.60 2.633 which was lower than the mean pretest score 28.420 +/- 1.476 and the calculated t -value, t = 10.157 is greater than the table value ( p < 0.001) at 0.001 level of significance. Hence, it is evident that the practice of mind-body approach was effective in reducing the intensity of menopausal symptoms among women.
   Conclusion The study concludes that the practice of mind-body approach helped in reducing the menopausal symptoms on the domain of psychological and Somato vegetative scale like anxiety, depression, reduction in the intensity of hot flushes, and improved the sleeping pattern. Overall, the practice of Mindfulness meditation helped the participants to have a better quality of life. The study was found to be cost-effective and feasible to be made as a routine intervention for women to manage menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Associations between Diet and Sleep Duration in Different Menopausal Stages
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - This study aimed to determine which dietary factors were associated with habitual sleep duration in pre/peri- and post-menopausal women. Data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used (N = 1,783). Habitual sleep duration was categorized as very short (<5 h), short (5-6 h), normal (7-8 h), and long (>= 9 h). Diet assessment was performed following validated procedures. In pre/peri-menopausal women (n = 1,116), controlling for the confounders, fewer number of foods, less intake of protein, carbohydrates, thiamin (B1), food folate, total choline, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and selenium were significantly associated with a higher risk for very short sleep. Being on a low-salt diet was related to a lower risk for long sleep. In comparison, in post-menopausal women (n = 667), controlling for the confounders, more sugar intake, less intake of phosphorus and zinc were related to a higher risk for short sleep. There were novel associations between diet and sleep duration, particularly among pre/peri-menopausal women. Future research is needed to confirm those causal relationships.

TI  - Postural Tachycardia Syndrome in Children and Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY
AB  - Postural tachycardia syndrome is a chronic condition with frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance or sympathetic activation and excessive tachycardia while standing, without significant hypotension. Orthostatic symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurring of vision, near faints, weakness in legs, poor concentration, nausea, and headaches. Somatic symptoms include fatigue, sleep disorder, widespread pain, abdominal pain, and menstrual irregularities. Psychological problems may overlap with physical complaints. This review discusses the normal physiology of orthostatic change, different pathophysiological mechanisms of postural tachycardia syndrome, including hypovolemia, venous pooling, autonomic neuropathy, and hyperadrenergic responses. In addition, an outline for management tailored to the patient's clinical syndrome is presented, along with concluding thoughts on future research needs.

TI  - Functional and cognitive responses to caffeine intake in middle-aged women are dose depending
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Middle-aged women display many physiological and cognitive alterations resulting from aging and physical inactivity as well as other changes that occur as a function of menopause. Caffeine consumption is highest in this age with women having a particular greater sensitivity to caffeine than men. Its effects on functional and cognitive functions are controversial and seem to depend on the dose intake. This study aimed to assess the effect of low (100mg) and high (400mg) doses of caffeine consumption on cognitive (simple reaction time) and functional (upper and low body muscle endurance, aerobic endurance and functional mobility) performances. These performances were evaluated in 19 healthy middle-aged women by the 30-Second Chair Stand test for lower body muscle endurance, the 30sec Arm Curl Test for upper body muscle endurance, the 2-Minute Step test for aerobic endurance, The Timed Up and Go test for functional mobility and the simple reaction time test for reaction time, 60min after a treatment capsule intake (100mg caffeine/400mg caffeine/placebo). Low caffeine consumption significantly improved (p<.005) cognitive performance, while high caffeine consumption did not. However, the functional performance significantly improved (p<.05) after high caffeine consumption but not after low caffeine consumption. Except, the functional mobility performance significantly improved (p<.05) after both low and high caffeine consumption with better improvement (p< .05) after the high dose. In conclusion, low caffeine consumption improved cognitive performance and high caffeine consumption improved functional performance but the functional mobility improved after both low and high caffeine consumption in middleaged women.

TI  - Factors associated with a clinically relevant reduction in menopausal symptoms of a standardized acupuncture approach for women with bothersome menopausal symptoms
T2  - BMC COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE AND THERAPIES
AB  - BackgroundLittle is known about factors associated with a clinically relevant reduction in menopausal symptoms through a brief acupuncture approach for women with moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms.MethodsPost hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial where participants were allocated to early versus late standardized acupuncture. Both the early group and the late group are included in this study. The late group got an identical intervention parallel staged by 6weeks. By means of the relative importance, the effect was evaluated for both early versus late women with a 6-week follow-up. We included four symptom subscales from the validated MenoScores Questionnaire: hot flushes, day and night sweats, general sweating, menopausal-specific sleeping problems, as well as an overall score, which is the sum of the four outcomes in the analysis.Results67 women with moderate to severe menopausal symptoms were included of whom 52 (77.6%) experienced a clinically relevant reduction in any of the four surveyed symptom subscales or overall score. 48 (71.6%) women experienced a clinically relevant reduction in any of the vasomotor symptom subscales: hot flushes, day and night sweats, general sweating.Women with vocational education were most likely to experience improvement compared to women with higher education. Beyond education, other factors of some importance for a clinically relevant reduction were no alcohol consumption, two or more births and urinary incontinence.ConclusionsLevel of education was the most consistent factor associated with improvement. Beyond education, other factors of some importance were no alcohol consumption, two or more births and urinary incontinence.Trial registrationThis study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov at April 21, 2016. The registration number is NCT02746497.

TI  - Nocturia through the menopausal transition and beyond: a narrative review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction and hypothesis Nocturia, defined as the act of waking to pass urine during sleeping, is a common problem in older women and is associated with significant morbidity and impairments in health-related quality of life. The aim of this review was to synthesize the current evidence regarding the incidence, impact, pathophysiology, and specific diagnostic approach of nocturia in the postmenopausal population. Methods We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases to identify relevant studies published through June 2020. Reference lists of the reviews obtained were screened for other articles deemed pertinent by the authors. Results Genitourinary symptoms attributed to the menopause have been reported to occur in nearly 90% of postmenopausal women, and nocturia is one of the most common. The relative deficiency in endogenous estrogen production after the menopause is thought to exacerbate all major pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie nocturia, including reduced bladder capacity, nocturnal polyuria, global polyuria, and sleep disorders. Diminished estrogen may induce anatomical and physiological bladder changes, contributing to a reduction in functional bladder capacity. Excess nocturnal urine production can also be provoked by estrogen depletion, either via free water-predominant diuresis by an impaired secretion of antidiuretic hormone, or a salt-predominant diuresis owing to diminished activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Additionally, a relationship between the transition to menopause and impaired sleep has been described, mediated by increased incidence in vasomotor symptoms and obstructive sleep apnea signs during the menopause. Conclusion Further research is necessary to better characterize and manage nocturia in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Maturation of the Autonomic Nervous System in Premature Infants: Estimating Development Based on Heart-Rate Variability Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - This study aims at investigating the development of premature infants' autonomic nervous system (ANS) based on a quantitative analysis of the heart-rate variability (HRV) with a variety of novel features. Additionally, the role of heart-rate drops, known as bradycardias, has been studied in relation to both clinical and novel sympathovagal indices. ECG data were measured for at least 3 h in 25 preterm infants (gestational age <= 32 weeks) for a total number of 74 recordings. The post-menstrual age (PMA) of each patient was estimated from the RR interval time-series by means of multivariate linear-mixed effects regression. The tachograms were segmented based on bradycardias in periods after, between and during bradycardias. For each of those epochs, a set of temporal, spectral and fractal indices were included in the regression model. The best performing model has R-2 = 0.75 and mean absolute error MAE = 1.56 weeks. Three main novelties can be reported. First, the obtained maturation models based on HRV have comparable performance to other development models. Second, the selected features for age estimation show a predominance of power and fractal features in the very-low- and low-frequency bands in explaining the infants' sympathovagal development from 27 PMA weeks until 40 PMA weeks. Third, bradycardias might disrupt the relationship between common temporal indices of the tachogram and the age of the infant and the interpretation of sympathovagal indices. This approach might provide a novel overview of post-natal autonomic maturation and an alternative development index to other electrophysiological data analysis.

TI  - Fatigue, anxiety, and quality of life in breast cancer patients compared to non-cancer controls: a nationwide longitudinal analysis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Purpose Fatigue and anxiety are common and significant symptoms reported by cancer patients. Few studies have examined the trajectory of multidimensional fatigue and anxiety, the relationships between them and with quality of life. Methods Breast cancer patients (n = 580) from community oncology clinics and age-matched controls (n = 364) completed fatigue and anxiety questionnaires prior to chemotherapy (A1), at chemotherapy completion (A2), and six months post-chemotherapy (A3). Linear mixed models (LMM) compared trajectories of fatigue /anxiety over time in patients and controls and estimated their relationship with quality of life. Models adjusted for age, education, race, BMI, marital status, menopausal status, and sleep symptoms. Results Patients reported greater fatigue and anxiety compared to controls at all time points (p's < 0.001, 35% clinically meaningful anxiety at baseline). From A1 to A2 patients experienced a significant increase in fatigue (beta = 8.3 95%CI 6.6,10.0) which returned to A1 values at A3 but remained greater than controls' (p < 0.001). General, mental, and physical fatigue subscales increased from A1 to A2 remaining significantly higher than A1 at A3 (p < 0.001). Anxiety improved over time (A1 to A3 beta = - 4.3 95%CI -2.6,-3.3) but remained higher than controls at A3 (p < 0.001). Among patients, fatigue and anxiety significantly predicted one another and quality of life. Menopausal status, higher BMI, mastectomy, and sleep problems also significantly predicted change in fatigue. Conclusion Breast cancer patients experience significant fatigue and anxiety up to six months post-chemotherapy that is associated with worse quality of life. Future interventions should simultaneously address anxiety and fatigue, focusing on mental and physical fatigue subdomains.

TI  - Waist-to-height ratio and waist circumference as the main measures to evaluate obstructive sleep apnea in the woman's reproductive life stages
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder. In women, the frequency of OSA increases substantially during and after the menopause, as does the prevalence of obesity in this reproductive life stage. This cross-sectional study uses data from the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study (EPISONO, 2007), and comprises a sample of 500 women aged 20-80 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the factors associated with OSA in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. All participants underwent polysomnography, and obesity was assessed using the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body mass index, neck and waist circumference, measured using standard methods. WHtR was the factor most associated with a significant increase in risk of OSA in premenopausal women. Waist circumference was the factor most associated with OSA in postmenopausal women, for all severities of the disease. Anthropometric factors presented a high rate of accuracy in the classification of women with OSA. The study found that different obesity-related anthropometric measures should be considered in the diagnosis of OSA, according to the woman's reproductive stage.

TI  - DETERMINING MIGRAINE WITH AURA TRIGGER FACTORS TOWARD IMPROVING THE PRACTICE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY FROM SAUDI ARABIA
T2  - PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA
AB  - Background: Primary headache is one of the most common disorders treated in neurology clinics. Globally, it has been estimated that the current prevalence of headache disorder in adults symptomatic, at least once within the last year, is about 50%. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, migraine was ranked as the third most common cause of disability worldwide. One of the significant migraines is migraine with aura, a frequent headache that occurs after or with sensory disturbances. Aim: This study aimed to identify and compare triggers in previously diagnosed patients with migraine with aura (MwA) to those who have not been identified with migraine with aura before but diagnosed according to a questionnaire survey distributed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: Adults aged 18-50 years were randomly selected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to participate in this non-interventional, multicentre, cross-sectional study. The study data was collected via an online questionnaire using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders 2018 and the Cleveland Clinic Canada headache questionnaire. Results and Discussion: Of the 4.140 potentially eligible individuals, 302 were not previously diagnosed with migraine with aura but were diagnosed with a questionnaire (Group A), while 71 participants were already diagnosed (MwA) (Group B). A significant relationship was found among MwA and stress and anxiety, sleep disturbance, noisy places, exposure to lots of lights, prolonged computer work, hunger, fasting, studying for exams, and menstruation in Group A. Group B experienced all of the previous triggers in addition to weather changes, certain odors, and the consumption of cheese, bananas, and hotdogs. Conclusions: The trigger factors are common in individuals with MwA. Awareness of these triggers is essential for preventing the severe complications of MwA, hence, enhance the quality of life of patients.

AB  - Background: Women's health has been a global concern for many decades. As menopause is midway between the challenges of adulthood and despair of old age, comes the changes of menopause in women. The menopause rating scale (MRS) is widely used to assess menopause-related symptoms. The MRS was first published in 1990 for assessing menopause symptoms. However, no reliable and valid tools are available in the Gujarati language to assess the individuals with menopause symptoms. Aim: The aim of the study was to translate and find out reliability and validity of the Gujarati version of MRS in postmenopausal women. Methods: The study was carried out in three phases: The first phase was the translation of scale into the Gujarati language; the second phase was a pilot study on 30 postmenopausal women age assesses the comprehensibility of the prefinal version; and the third phase was to find out the reliability and validity of the final version of scale. Results: The total value of intraclass correlation coefficient of test-retest reliability was 0.88, with the all items having individual intraclass correlation coefficients score ranging from 0.74 to 0.92. Reliability estimated by internal consistency reached a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94 and ranging from 0.85 to 0.95 test-retest. Conclusion: The Gujarati version of MRS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing the menopausal symptoms and health-related quality of life in Guajarati-speaking populations.

TI  - The relationship between dysmenorrhea and sleep quality
T2  - CUKUROVA MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhea and the relationship between dysmenorrhea and sleep quality.
   Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 250 volunteer female university students, who met the inclusion criteria, participated in this study. To collect data a questionnaire form, the Visual Analog (VAS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used.
   Results: The prevalence of dysmenorrhea in students was 82.4%. Eighty-two percent of the students withdysmenorrhea had poor sleep quality. It was determined that 96.8% of the students with sleep division in the menstrual period and 96.3% of those with difficulty falling asleep had dysmenorrhea. In participants with dysmenorrhea, there were different level of correlation between poor sleep quality and the number of sleep divisions, severity of dysmenorrhea), and less duration of sleep.
   Conclusion: Dysmenorrhea has a negative effect on sleep quality. In accordance with these results, it is advisable to identify students with dysmenorrhea and to give training on methods of coping with it to improve their sleep quality.

TI  - International feasibility study for the Women's Wellness with Type 2 Diabetes Programme (WWDP): An eHealth enabled 12-week intervention programme for midlife women with type 2 diabetes
T2  - DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Aims: The current study aimed to examine feasibility of participant recruitment and retention rates for the Women's Wellness with Type 2 Diabetes program (WWDP), and to assess initial efficacy of the program in improving wellbeing outcomes.
   Methods: 70 midlife women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participated in a 12-week wellness-focused intervention, the WWDP. The WWDP involved a structured book (with participatory activities), an interactive website and nurse consultations. This study had an Australian and a UK arm. Analyses were conducted using chi-square, McNemar, paired t-test, and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests.
   Results: The attrition rate for the sample was 22.2%. Overall, significant improvement was observed in diabetes distress (DD), diabetes self-efficacy, weight, BMI, menopausal symptoms and sleep symptoms from baseline to program completion at 12 weeks. Australian participants were also more likely to meet fruit recommendation guidelines and had significant waist- and hip-circumference reductions.
   Conclusions: Good retention rates and initial efficacy findings indicated feasibility of the WWDP as a promising 12-week health and wellness program for women with T2DM. They also suggest incorporating a focus on self-efficacy and gendered information may be important in improving wellness and health outcomes related to distress and menopause. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Women temporarily synchronize their menstrual cycles with the luminance and gravimetric cycles of the Moon
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB  - Many species synchronize reproductive behavior with a particular phase of the lunar cycle to increase reproductive success. In humans, a lunar influence on reproductive behavior remains controversial, although the human menstrual cycle has a period close to that of the lunar cycle. Here, we analyzed long-term menstrual recordings of individual women with distinct methods for biological rhythm analysis. We show that women's menstrual cycles with a period longer than 27 days were intermittently synchronous with the Moon's luminance and/or gravimetric cycles. With age and upon exposure to artificial nocturnal light, menstrual cycles shortened and lost this synchrony. We hypothesize that in ancient times, human reproductive behavior was synchronous with the Moon but that our modern lifestyles have changed reproductive physiology and behavior.

TI  - Long-term resveratrol supplementation improves pain perception, menopausal symptoms, and overall well-being in postmenopausal women: findings from a 24-month randomized, controlled, crossover trial
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Following concerns about hormone therapy, postmenopausal women need alternative options to manage menopause-related symptoms and improve their well-being. A 14-week pilot study has shown that supplementation with resveratrol, a phytoestrogen with circulatory benefits, can improve aspects of well-being including chronic pain, which is a common complaint in postmenopausal women. We aimed to confirm these benefits in a larger, long-term study.
   Methods: The Resveratrol for Healthy Ageing in Women study, a 24-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover intervention trial of resveratrol supplementation (75 mg BID) was conducted in 125 healthy postmenopausal women to evaluate effects on cognitive performance (results published elsewhere). Aspects of well-being including pain perception, mood and depressive symptoms, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, and quality of life were assessed with questionnaires as secondary outcomes of the study. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to hypercapnia was measured as a surrogate marker of cerebrovascular function.
   Results: Resveratrol supplementation reduced composite pain score (P < 0.001), especially in overweight individuals; this was associated with improvements in cerebrovascular responsiveness to hypercapnia (R = -0.329, P = 0.014). Somatic menopausal symptoms (P = 0.024) and general well-being (P = 0.010) were also improved after resveratrol supplementation.
   Conclusions: These results confirm the pilot study finding that resveratrol supplementation can reduce chronic pain in age-related osteoarthritis and improve menopause-related quality of life in postmenopausal women. These improvements are sustained by supplementation for at least 12 months and are associated with enhancement of circulatory function.

TI  - Behavioral and psychological health inequities in income disparate perimenopausal women: a brief report
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To assess differences in behavioral and psychological health characteristics in perimenopausal women delineated by income disparity.
   Methods: A hypothesis generating secondary data analysis was conducted in 33 women, using public health insurance enrollment as a proxy for income. Sociodemographic characteristics were assessed. Study outcomes included behavioral health characteristics: current cigarette smoking, substance abuse history, current exercise, obesity (BMI >= 30); psychological health characteristics, and sleep: depressed mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]). Group comparisons were assessed via the Student t test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test or Chi-square test, and multivariable models.
   Results: Forty-two percent (n = 14) were designated as income disparate, and sociodemographic characteristics were similar between groups; nearly half were Black/African American. More income disparate women reported current cigarette smoking [71% (10) vs 21%(4), P = 0.004] and substance abuse history [79%(11) vs 5%(1), P < 0.0001]. Fewer income disparate women reported current exercise [57%(8) vs 89%(17), P = 0.03] and more were obese [BMI >= 30; 50%(7) vs 11%(2), P = 0.01]. Income disparate women experienced significantly higher CES-D scores [13.5 (11.75, 23.75) vs 6 (0, 9), P < 0.0001], GAD-7 scores [5.5 (2, 8.75) vs 2 (0, 4), P = 0.04], and ISI scores [11 (5.55) vs 5 (4.36), P = 0.004].
   Conclusions: Findings from this preliminary analysis evidence inequities in behavioral, psychological, and sleep characteristics in perimenopausal women. Awareness of how the social determinants of health impact outcomes among vulnerable perimenopausal women is critical to developing equitable aging opportunities, including customized preventive health screenings and interventions that engage income disparate perimenopausal women.

TI  - Prevalence of hormone-related mood disorder symptoms in women with ADHD
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - This is the first study to assess the prevalence of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), episodes of postpartum depression symptoms (PPD) after first childbirth, and climacteric mood symptoms in AttentionDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). 209 consecutive women (18-71 years) with ADHD completed the PMDD chapter of the Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus version 5.0.0 to assess PMDD, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to assess PPD, and the Greene Climacteric Scale to assess climacteric symptoms. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, medication use, and chronobiological sleep characteristics were also assessed. The prevalence of PMDD and PPD were high in ADHD, compared to the general population. PMDD symptoms were associated with less use of contraceptives. Antidepressants were associated with more PMDD symptoms. The following GCS scores were significant increased: anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction, vasomotor and somatic complaints. No significant differences were found in sleep characteristics or current comorbidity between the groups with and without PPD or PMDD, or increased climacteric scores. The prevalences of PMDD, PPD and climacteric scores were high in women with ADHD. This is the first study in women with ADHD that suggests that female ADHD patients suffer from significant PMDD symptoms, experience PPD during the first child birth, and experience more severe climacteric symptoms.

TI  - Sleep Characteristics and Risk of Ovarian Cancer Among Postmenopausal Women
T2  - CANCER PREVENTION RESEARCH
AB  - Several studies have assessed the relationship between sleep duration and ovarian cancer risk, but the results are conflicting. Importantly, no studies addressed the relationship between sleep disturbance or sleep quality and ovarian cancer incidence. Moreover, few studies have examined the relationships between sleep measures and subtypes of ovarian cancer. This study included 109,024 postmenopausal women ages 5079 from the Women's Health Initiative during 1993-1998 and followed through 2018. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted HRs for the associations between sleep habits and the incidence of ovarian cancer and its subtypes. No association was observed between sleep duration, sleep quality, sleep disturbance, or insomnia and risk of overall ovarian cancer, serous/nonserous, or type I/type II ovarian cancer subtype. However, compared with women with average sleep quality, women with restful or very restful sleep quality had a significantly lower risk of invasive serous subtype [HR: 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-0.90] while insomnia was associated with a higher risk of invasive serous subtype (HR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.12-1.66). Associations with insomnia differed significantly by serous and nonserous subtypes, and type I and type II subtypes (P-heterogeneity = 0.001 and P-heterogeneity <0.001, respectively). This study provides no evidence on association between sleep habits and overall ovarian cancer risk among postmenopausal women. However, restful or very restful sleep quality was associated with a lower risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer, and insomnia was associated with a higher risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer. Associations with insomnia differed by subtypes.
   Prevention Relevance: This study shows no association between sleep duration, sleep quality, or insomnia with the risk of overall ovarian cancer among postmenopausal women. However, restful sleep quality was associated with a lower risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer, and insomnia was associated with a higher risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer.

TI  - Updating the biological interest of Valeriana officinalis
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN BOTANY
AB  - Valeriana officinalis L. (Caprifoliaceae) has been traditionally used to treat mild nervous tension and sleep problems. The basis of these activities are mainly attributed to valerenic acid through the modulation of the GABA receptor. Moreover, V. officinalis is claimed to have other biological activities such as cardiovascular benefits, anticancer, antimicrobial, and spasmolytic. The current review aims to update the biological and pharmacological studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials) of V. officinalis and its major secondary metabolites to guide future research.
   Databases PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus were used for literature search, including original papers written in English and published between 2014 and 2020. There have been identified 33 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of these works were performed with V. officinalis extracts, and only a few papers (in vitro and in vivo studies) evaluated the activity of isolated compounds (valerenic acid and volvalerenal acid K). In vitro studies focused on studying antioxidant and neuroprotective activity. In vivo studies and clinical trials mainly investigated the nervous system activity (anticonvulsant activity, antidepressant, cognitive problems, anxiety, and sleep disorders). Just a few studies were focused on other different activities, highlight effects on symptoms of premenstrual and postmenopausal syndromes.
   Valeriana officinalis continues to be one of the medicinal plants most used by today's society for its therapeutic properties and whose biological and pharmacological activities continue to arouse great scientific interest, as evidenced in recent publications. This review shows scientific evidence on the traditional uses of V. officinalis on the nervous system.

TI  - Development and Effects of College-Based Lifestyle Modification Program for Menstrual Health of Young Adult Women with Irregular Menses: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to develop the 'College-based Lifestyle Modification Program' (College-based LMP) for young adult women with irregular menstruation and examine its effects after intervention. Methods: The College-based LMP consisted of small group education, individual physical exercise counseling/training, individual diet counseling, and feedback and support. Participants were comprised of 38 females who reported less than 10 irregular menstruations in a year and were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The primary outcome variables consisted of menstrual cycle index (MCI), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and androgenic profile (testosterone-T, free androgen index-FAI), while the outcome variables included premenstrual symptoms (PMS), menstrual volume, body composition parameters, glycemic parameters (fasting blood sugar-FBS, insulin, HOMA-IR), sleep duration, perceived stress, and nutrient intake.. Results: There were no significant differences in primary outcome variables (MCI, SHBG, T, and FAI). In the variables, there were no significant differences except for the partial domain of PMS (symptoms of depression and anxiety) and sleep duration. Conclusions: The study was significant in that it demonstrated the importance of lifestyle, which could provide ordinary young adult women with healthy menstruation. The College-based LMP needs to be elaborated with further studies.

TI  - Shiftwork and Light at Night Negatively Impact Molecular and Endocrine Timekeeping in the Female Reproductive Axis in Humans and Rodents
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Shiftwork, including work that takes place at night (nightshift) and/or rotates between day and nightshifts, plays an important role in our society, but is associated with decreased health, including reproductive dysfunction. One key factor in shiftwork, exposure to light at night, has been identified as a likely contributor to the underlying health risks associated with shiftwork. Light at night disrupts the behavioral and molecular circadian timekeeping system, which is important for coordinated timing of physiological processes, causing mistimed hormone release and impaired physiological functions. This review focuses on the impact of shiftwork on reproductive function and pregnancy in women and laboratory rodents and potential underlying molecular mechanisms. We summarize the negative impact of shiftwork on female fertility and compare these findings to studies in rodent models of light shifts. Light-shift rodent models recapitulate several aspects of reproductive dysfunction found in shift workers, and their comparison with human studies can enable a deeper understanding of physiological and hormonal responses to light shifts and the underlying molecular mechanisms that may lead to reproductive disruption in human shift workers. The contributions of human and rodent studies are essential to identify the origins of impaired fertility in women employed in shiftwork.

TI  - Do health behaviors mediate associations between personality traits and diabetes incidence?
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: Personality traits have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. The objective of this study was to examine whether and to what extent the associations between personality traits (dispositional optimism, hostility, and negative emotional expressiveness) and risk of T2DM were mediated by health behaviors and obesity.
   Methods: Postmenopausal women (n = 110,992) aged 50-79 years without diabetes at enrollment in the Women's Health Initiative study (1993-1998) were followed up to 25 years. Incident diabetes was assessed via a validated self-report of physician-diagnosed diabetes treated with insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. Mediation analyses were performed using approaches under a counterfactual framework.
   Results: An inverse association of optimism with diabetes was significantly mediated by a factor primarily extracted from physical activity, diet quality, and sleep quality with a mediated proportion of 28%. Positive associations for hostility and negative emotional expressiveness were substantially mediated by a factor primarily composed of body mass index and waist circumference with mediated proportions of 32% and 44%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our data revealed that less than half of the associations between personality traits and risk of T2DM were explained by indirect health behavior pathways. Women's personality traits should be considered in prevention of diabetes in addition to promoting health behaviors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dysmenorrhea Symptom-Based Phenotypes A Replication and Extension Study
T2  - NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - Background
   Dysmenorrhea is a prevalent pain condition among women and a risk factor for other chronic pain conditions. Individuals vary in dysmenorrhea pain severity, the number of painful sites, and co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms. Three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes were previously identified using latent class analysis; however, there is a need to validate these in an independent sample, so they can be used in mechanistic and interventional research. There is also a need to further characterize dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes in terms of demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics so they can be used to inform precision dysmenorrhea treatment. Objectives
   The study objectives were to (a) determine whether the same dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes would be found in a new sample; (b) determine whether including demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral covariates in latent class analyses would change individuals' phenotype memberships; and (c) investigate relationships between dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes and demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics. Methods
   This cross-sectional survey study included 678 women (aged 14-42 years) with dysmenorrhea. Participants reported dysmenorrhea symptom severity, demographic, clinical (comorbid chronic pain and gynecological conditions), and psychobehavioral characteristics (perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing). We used latent class analysis to identify symptom-based phenotypes. We compared analyses with and without covariates (i.e., demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics) to determine if individuals' phenotype memberships changed. We then examined associations between phenotypes and demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics. Results
   We reproduced three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes: the "mild localized pain" phenotype (characterized by mild abdominal cramps), the "severe localized pain" phenotype (characterized by severe abdominal cramps), and the "multiple severe symptoms" phenotype (characterized by severe pain at multiple locations and gastrointestinal symptoms). Analyses with and without covariates had little effect on individuals' phenotype membership. Race, comorbid chronic pain condition, endometriosis, and pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with the dysmenorrhea phenotypes. Discussion
   Findings provide a foundation to further study mechanisms of dysmenorrhea symptom heterogeneity and develop dysmenorrhea precision treatments. The three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes were validated in a second sample. Demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral factors were associated with dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes.

TI  - Characterizing nocturia among Belgian healthy postmenopausal women: Prevalence, degree of bother, etiology and risk factors for nocturia
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Introduction: Limited literature concerning nocturia in early postmenopausal women is available. However, due to the lack of endogenous estrogen in these women, an increased prevalence of nocturia is expected.
   Material and methods: This prospective observational trial recruited 210 'early' postmenopausal women consulting the Ghent University menopause clinic. Postmenopausal status was biochemically confirmed. Women completed 3 questionnaires: the ICI questionnaire on nocturia (ICIQ-N); 'Targeting the individual's Aetiology of Nocturia to Guide Outcomes' (TANGO) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Moreover, information concerning women's age, anthropometrics and lifestyle was collected. Nocturia was defined as two or more nocturnal voids.
   Results: Nocturia was reported in 24.8% (52/210) of the postmenopausal women. Bother increased with every nocturnal void. Women with two or more nighttime voids were found to have significantly increased prevalence of urgency compared with women with only one (p 0.001; 38.5% versus 22.7%). Trouble initiating sleep at the start of the night and insomnia during the night were significantly different in women with a different nocturnal frequency (initiating sleep p = 0.09, no voids 34.4 %, 1 void 39.2 %, 0.001; no voids 1.6%, 1 void 22.7 %, 2 voids 53.8 %). In addition to bladder and sleep dysfunctions, waist circumference was a risk factor for nocturia (OR 1.04; 95 % CI: 1.01-1.08).
   Conclusion: Nocturia is an important problem in early postmenopausal women, affecting a quarter of the questioned women. Etiology of nocturia in this population is multifactorial as estrogen withdrawal is accompanied by bladder and sleep dysfunctions.

TI  - Chinese women's health and wellbeing in middle life: Unpacking the influence of menopause, lifestyle activities and social participation
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Objectives: To examine Chinese middle-aged women's health and wellbeing and the associated biosocial correlates.
   Study design: This study used a cross-sectional design, including selected retrospectively collected information on the final menstrual period, drawn from the 2013 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Women aged 45 to 59 were selected.
   Main outcome measures: Factor analysis of 16 menopausal symptom ratings yielded four different and independent measures of pre-/peri-menopausal and early postmenopausal women's health. These were: negative mood (feel frustrated, sad, lonely, worried, bored, angry, tired and stressed), positive emotions (feel enthusiastic, content and happy), musculoskeletal pain (shoulder/neck pain, knee and other joint pain, and back pain), and sleep and memory problems (trouble sleeping and poor memory).
   Results: Menopausal status was positively associated with sleep and memory problems, whilst the number of years since the final menstrual period was positively associated with musculoskeletal pain. In contrast, lifestyle activities and social participation were linked to positive emotions. The association between selected biosocial factors and negative mood was not significant after controlling for other demographic and social background factors.
   Conclusions: Musculoskeletal health as well as sleep and memory problems are positively associated with menopausal biological factors amongst Chinese mid-life women. Maintaining active social engagement contributes to positive wellbeing among middle-aged women.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics and Management of Headache: A Real-Life Prospective, Observational Study From a Tertiary Care Center in Eastern India
T2  - CUREUS
AB  - Objective: To describe clinical profile and management pattern of headache in patients presenting to a tertiary care center.
   Methods: In this observational study, demographics, radiological investigations, triggers, and treatment pattern in patients aged >= 14 years presenting with headache were recorded. Disability and severity of headache were assessed with Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) in case of migraineurs and VAS and HIT-6 for all other headache disorders. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after three and six months post-treatment.
   Results: Out of 400 patients (60.25% females and 39.75% males), 277 (69.25%) had primary headache among whom 119 (42.96%) had migraine without aura. Stress, menstruation, fasting, and inadequate sleep were common triggers for migraine. Nausea, vomiting, photo-phonophobia and neck pain were the most common accompanying symptoms in patients with headache. Out of 106 (38.3%) patients with tension-type headache, 68.9% were episodic. In the migraine subset, 81% presented with moderate to severe disability at baseline, which changed to minimal to mild disability at three and six months post-treatment (p < 0.001). For abortive treatment, 130 (79.7%) patients were prescribed naproxen, domperidone, and sumatriptan. In 69 (42.3%) patients, valproic acid/divalproex was used for prophylaxis. Most common causes of secondary headaches (30.75%) were intracranial bleeds and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Most common abnormalities on computerized tomography were intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, sinusitis, and space- occupying lesions (SOLs).
   Conclusion: In our study, migraine was the most common etiology of headache. Headache was more common in females than males, and primary headache was more common than secondary headache. Sodium valproate was the commonly used prophylaxis in migraine.

TI  - Assessment of Parental Choice Predisposition for Tonsillectomy in Children
T2  - JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
AB  - Importance The decision to proceed with tonsillectomy to treat pediatric obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (OSDB) often falls on individual families. Despite emphasis on shared decision-making between parents and surgeons about tonsillectomy for OSDB, the extent to which parents have already decided about surgery prior to the child's consultation is not known. Objective To identify predictors of parent choice predisposition for surgical treatment of OSDB with tonsillectomy and describe its association with parent-clinician communication. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational cohort study conducted at 3 outpatient clinical sites (urban-based outpatient center, suburban off-site outpatient center, and community-based medical center) associated with a large academic center. A total of 149 parents of children undergoing their initial otolaryngology consultation for OSDB were identified through clinic scheduling records and deemed eligible for participation in this study. Of the 149 parents, a volunteer sample of 64 parents (42.9%) agreed to participate and have their consultation audiorecorded. Of these 64 participants, 12 parents were excluded because their child had previously been evaluated for OSDB by a specialist. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes and measures were treatment choice predisposition scale (a measure of the strength of a patient's treatment decision prior to entering a medical consultation), parent communication behaviors coded in consultation audiorecordings (substantive questions asked, introduced medical jargon, expression of treatment preference, and scores on the OSDB and Adenotonsillectomy Knowledge Scale for parents). Results A total of 52 parent participants were included in the final analysis. Most parent participants were female (n = 48; 92%); 50% (n = 26) of parents were non-Hispanic White, 37% (n = 19) were Black, 10% (n = 5) were Hispanic/Latino, and 4% (n = 2) self-reported race/ethnicity as "Other." Mean (range) choice predisposition was 6.84 (2-10), with 22 parents (42%) more predisposed to choose tonsillectomy. Parents more predisposed to choose tonsillectomy used more medical jargon during the consultation (odds ratio [OR], 3.95; 95% CI, 1.16-15.15) and were less likely to ask questions (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.87). Parental predictors of greater predisposition toward choosing surgery were White race (OR, 7.31; 95% CI, 1.77-39.33) and prior evaluation by a pediatrician for OSDB (OR, 6.10; 95% CI, 1.44-33.34). Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of parents of children with OSDB, many parents were predisposed to choose treatment with tonsillectomy prior to initial surgical consultation, which may lessen engagement and influence 2-way communication. In this cohort, greater predisposition for tonsillectomy was observed in non-Hispanic White parents and parents of patients who had been previously evaluated by a pediatrician for OSDB. Understanding parent choice predisposition for surgery may promote improved communication and parental engagement during surgical consultations. It may also help direct education about sleep and tonsillectomy to nonsurgical forums.
   This cohort study identifies predictors of parent choice predisposition for surgical treatment of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing with tonsillectomy in children.
   Questions What factors contribute to parent choice predisposition for treatment of pediatric obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (OSDB), and how is choice predisposition associated with parent-clinician communication? Findings In this cohort study including audiorecorded consultations of 52 parent-clinician dyads, non-Hispanic White parents and parents of patients who had been previously evaluated by a pediatrician for their OSDB were more predisposed to surgical treatment with tonsillectomy. Parents more predisposed to tonsillectomy demonstrated greater familiarity with OSDB but engaged less with clinicians during consultations. Meaning Understanding parent choice predisposition for surgical treatment with tonsillectomy may guide counseling by promoting clinician engagement of parents, identifying patient and external factors associated with surgical decisions, and sharing of information to improve knowledge about disease and treatment alternatives.

TI  - Impact of menstrual cycle phase and oral contraceptives on sleep and overnight memory consolidation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
AB  - Sleep spindles benefit declarative memory consolidation and are considered to be a biological marker for general cognitive abilities. However, the impact of sexual hormones and hormonal oral contraceptives (OCs) on these relationships are less clear. Thus, we here investigated the influence of endogenous progesterone levels of naturally cycling women and women using OCs on nocturnal sleep and overnight memory consolidation. Nineteen healthy women using OCs (M-Age = 21.4, SD = 2.1 years) were compared to 43 healthy women with a natural menstrual cycle (follicular phase: n = 16, M-Age = 21.4, SD = 3.1 years; luteal phase: n = 27, M-Age = 22.5, SD = 3.6 years). Sleep spindle density and salivary progesterone were measured during an adaptation and an experimental night. A word pair association task preceding the experimental night followed by two recalls (pre-sleep and post-sleep) was performed to test declarative memory performance. We found that memory performance improved overnight in all women. Interestingly, women using OCs (characterized by a low endogenous progesterone level but with very potent synthetic progestins) and naturally cycling women during the luteal phase (characterized by a high endogenous progesterone level) had a higher fast sleep spindle density compared to naturally cycling women during the follicular phase (characterized by a low endogenous progesterone level). Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between endogenous progesterone level and fast spindle density in women during the luteal phase. Results suggest that the use of OCs and the menstrual cycle phase affects sleep spindles and therefore should be considered in further studies investigating sleep spindles and cognitive performance.

TI  - Changes in Resting-State Cerebral Activity in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Functional MR Imaging Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Background
   Previous studies have found that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have some degree of brain function change as well as cognitive function and emotions, such as poor executive functioning and memory, anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these alterations have not yet been clarified.
   Method
   Fasting serum hormone testing, neuropsychological testing and resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were performed in 41 women with newly diagnosed PCOS and 41 healthy controls matched by age and education during their 2-5 days of menstrual period. Analysis of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was used to calculate the seed points. Then, the functional connectivity (FC) values between these abnormal seed points and other voxels in the whole brain were calculated. Finally, the correlations among clinical indexes, neuropsychological evaluation scores, and neuroimaging data were analyzed.
   Results
   Compared with the control group, the PCOS group showed higher luteinizing hormone (LH) and serum insulin levels, worse sleep quality, increased depressive and anxiety state scores, and memory and executive function impairments. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the decreased ALFF value in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG.L), which is related to poor executive performance and depressive disorders, was negatively correlated with the plasma insulin level in subjects with insulin resistance. Furthermore, the increased FC strength between the MFG.L and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.L) was positively correlated with the serum testosterone level. The enhanced FC strength between the left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG.L) and triangular part of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFGtriang.L) was negatively correlated with the plasma LH level. When use the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG.R) as the seed point, the FC strength with the right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG.R), which is associated with impaired memory, was decreased.
   Conclusion
   The ALFF and FC results elucidated brain functional abnormalities at the regional and network levels in women with PCOS, while correlation analyses simultaneously demonstrated that these alterations were associated with serum hormones and cognitive function. These results may provide useful information regarding the potential mechanisms of cognitive impairment and emotional changes in this population.

TI  - The Masters athlete in Olympic weightlifting: Training, lifestyle, health challenges, and gender differences
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Olympic weightlifting requires strength, speed, and explosive power. Vigorous physical activity such as Olympic weightlifting, for older adults has many benefits from improved strength, social interactions, and a healthy and independent lifestyle. Little is known about the training habits, health, and lifestyle of Masters weightlifters that includes top level athletes as well as beginners, and there is a dearth of data on women.
   Objectives
   The primary aim was to describe demographics, training habits, and health including prevalence of injury and chronic disease in male and female Masters athletes in Olympic weightlifting. The secondary aim was to study gender differences and the age and impact of menopause on participation in the sport.
   Results
   The 958 participants (46% men), ages 34 to 87, mostly train 3 to 4 days per week in 1 to 2 hour sessions. This is a highly educated and affluent group, 84% are white, 72% are married, 85% are post-secondary graduates. Exercise can also increase the risk of injury compared to less active older adults, but the rates of injury in weightlifting affecting training are lower than seen in other sports. The prevalence of depression and mental health is similar to a general population. Stress levels and sleep disturbances are more common among women than men. Women reach menopause at a similar age as women in industrialized countries, but menopausal symptoms constrained the training.
   Conclusion
   Older athletes are capable of rigorous training programs and top performances while adjusting to changes due to biological aging. Weightlifting athletes, coaches, and health professionals must be aware of patterns of injuries and gender differences to incorporate successful prevention strategies. Knowledge of presentations of menopause and impact of menopausal symptoms on training allows women and health care providers to make informed treatment decisions.

TI  - Association of Outdoor Artificial Light at Night With Mental Disorders and Sleep Patterns Among US Adolescents
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Key PointsQuestionAre levels of outdoor artificial light at night associated with adolescent sleep patterns and past-year mental disorder? FindingsIn a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of US adolescents, higher levels of outdoor artificial light at night, measured via satellite, were associated with later weeknight bedtimes; those in the lowest quartile of nighttime light reported the longest weeknight sleep durations. Adolescents in areas with greater levels of nighttime light also had higher prevalence of past-year mood and anxiety disorders. MeaningFuture studies of adolescent mental and sleep health should consider contextual-level measures of light at night, in addition to individual-level exposure.
   This cross-sectional study combines data from satellites and the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement to measure the association of outdoor artificial light at night with self-reported sleep duration and past-year anxiety and mood disorders in adolescents.
   ImportanceIndoor nighttime light exposure influences sleep and circadian rhythms and is known to affect mood-associated brain circuits in animals. However, little is known about the association between levels of nighttime outdoor light and sleep and mental health in the population, especially among adolescents. ObjectiveTo estimate associations of outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) with sleep patterns and past-year mental disorder among US adolescents. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis population-based, cross-sectional study of US adolescents used the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted from February 2001 through January 2004. A probability sample of adolescents aged 13 to 18 years was included. Analyses were conducted between February 2019 and April 2020. ExposuresLevels of outdoor ALAN, measured by satellite, with means calculated within census block groups. ALAN values were transformed into units of radiance (nW/cm(2)/sr). Main Outcomes and MeasuresSelf-reported habitual sleep patterns (weeknight bedtime, weeknight sleep duration, weekend bedtime delay, and weekend oversleep) and past-year mood, anxiety, behavior, and substance use disorders, measured via an in-person structured diagnostic interview. Parent-reported information was included in behavior disorder diagnoses. ResultsAmong 10123 adolescents (4953 boys [51.3%]; mean [SE] age, 15.2 [0.06] years [weighted]; 6483 for behavior disorder outcomes), ALAN was positively associated with indicators of social disadvantage, such as racial/ethnic minority status (median [IQR] ALAN: white adolescents, 12.96 [30.51] nW/cm(2)/sr; Hispanic adolescents: 38.54 [47.84] nW/cm(2)/sr; non-Hispanic black adolescents: 37.39 [51.88] nW/cm(2)/sr; adolescents of other races/ethnicities: 30.94 [49.93] nW/cm(2)/sr; P<.001) and lower family income (median [IQR] ALAN by family income-to-poverty ratio <less than or equal to>1.5: 26.76 [52.48] nW/cm(2)/sr; >6: 21.46 [34.38] nW/cm(2)/sr; P=.005). After adjustment for several sociodemographic characteristics, as well as area-level population density and socioeconomic status, this study found that higher ALAN levels were associated with later weeknight bedtime, and those in the lowest quartile of ALAN reported the longest weeknight sleep duration. Those in the highest quartile of ALAN went to bed 29 (95% CI, 15-43) minutes later and reported 11 (95% CI, 19-2) fewer minutes of sleep than those in the lowest quartile. ALAN was also positively associated with prevalence of past-year mood and anxiety disorder: each median absolute deviation increase in ALAN was associated with 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00-1.14) times the odds of mood disorder and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.16) times the odds of anxiety disorder. Further analyses revealed associations with bipolar disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.35]), specific phobias (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.11-1.26]), and major depressive disorder or dysthymia (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.15]). Among adolescent girls, differences in weeknight bedtime by ALAN (third and fourth quartiles vs first quartile) were greater with increasing years since menarche (F-3, 8.15; P<.001). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, area-level outdoor ALAN was associated with less favorable sleep patterns and mood and anxiety disorder in adolescents. Future studies should elucidate whether interventions to reduce exposure to ALAN may positively affect mental and sleep health.

TI  - Multidimensional sleep health is not cross-sectionally or longitudinally associated with adiposity in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)
T2  - SLEEP HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: The association between sleep and adiposity (indexed by body mass index or waist-to-hip ratio) has typically been evaluated using a single dimension of self-reported sleep. However, other dimensions and behavioral measures of sleep may also be associated with adiposity. This study evaluated whether multidimensional sleep health calculated from actigraphy and self-report was longitudinally associated with adiposity in a sample of midlife women who have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances and adiposity.
   Design: Longitudinal study with 11-14 years of follow-up time between the sleep health assessment and body mass index/waist-to-hip ratio measurements.
   Participants: Two hundred and twenty-one midlife women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study.
   Measurements: Multidimensional sleep health was quantified using actigraphy (M[SD] = 29.1[7.2] nights) measures of sleep efficiency, midpoint, duration, regularity, and self-report measures of alertness and satisfaction. Each component was dichotomized and summed; higher values indicated better sleep health. Height, body weight, and waist and hip circumference were measured at the sleep study and at follow-up. Linear regression models were used to assess associations between sleep health and adiposity, adjusting for demographic and menopausal covariates.
   Results: There was no substantial within-person change in adiposity over time. Better sleep health was cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with lower adiposity in unadjusted, but not in adjusted, models. Individual sleep health components were not associated with adiposity after adjustment.
   Conclusion: We did not observe cross-sectional or longitudinal associations between multidimensional sleep health and adiposity. The sleep-adiposity link may be weaker in midlife adults than in other age groups. (C) 2020 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of Chlorogenic Acids on Menopausal Symptoms in Healthy Women: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Parallel-Group Trial
T2  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - A reduction in estrogen levels in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods causes various symptoms in women, such as hot flushes, sweats, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Chlorogenic acids (CGAs), which are phenolic compounds widely present in plants such as coffee beans, have various physiological functions. However, the effects of CGAs on menopausal symptoms are unknown. To examine the effects of CGAs on menopausal symptoms, especially hot flushes, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted in healthy women. Eighty-two subjects were randomized and assigned to receive CGAs (270 mg) tablets or the placebo for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of intake, the number of hot flushes, the severity of hot flushes during sleep, and the severity of daytime sweats decreased significantly in the CGA group compared to the placebo group. The modified Kupperman index for menopausal symptoms decreased significantly after 2 weeks in the CGA group compared to the placebo group. Adverse effects caused by CGAs were not observed. The results show that continuous intake of CGAs resulted in improvements in menopausal symptoms, especially hot flushes, in healthy women.

TI  - The prevalence and associated factors of depression during pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal period among the middle-aged women of Dhaka city
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Depression is a serious mental health issue and a major concern among middle-aged women, especially during the menopause transition time. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of depression among the middle-aged women of the menopause transition in Dhaka.
   Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 41 to 60 years older women in Dhaka city using a multistage cluster sampling technique and face to face interview.
   Result: In total 326 middle-aged women participated in the study, and among them, 30.4% had major depression. No statistically significant association was observed between menopause status and major depression. However, peri-(34.2%) and post-menopausal (33.3%) groups were more depressed compared to pre-menopausal (26.8%) groups. Our adjusted analysis indicates, marital status (p = 0.004), having salaried job (p < 0.001), number of offspring (p = 0.003), sedentary hours (p = 0.002), smoking habit (p = 0.012), hypertension (p = 0.012), chronic disease other than diabetes/hypertension (p = 0.006), vasomotor symptoms (p = 0.004) and sleep problem (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with depression status.
   Conclusion: The study result indicates a high prevalence of major depression among middle-aged Bangladeshi women during the menopause transition. Therefore, depression should be routinely evaluated among middle-aged women for the monitoring and prevention of depression.

TI  - Symptoms assessed in studies on perimenopausal depression: A narrative review
T2  - SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE
AB  - The menopausal transition constitutes a phase of major biopsychosocial changes associated with an elevated risk for the development of depression. Perimenopausal depression is highly prevalent and usually characterized by core symptoms of a major depressive disorder combined with menopausal complaints such as vasomotor symptoms or other physical complaints. However, a distinct definition of the condition is lacking. The aim of this review is to portray the symptoms assessed in studies on perimenopausal depression in order to provide relevant information on the current understanding of this condition.
   A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. A total of 37 studies were included.
   Various assessment tools have been used to measure symptoms related to perimenopausal depression. Fifteen symptoms were identified. Depressed mood was assessed across all studies. Low energy or sleep disturbances, as acknowledged symptoms of a major depressive disorder, were surveyed in most studies. However, the assessment of menopausal complaints was rather heterogeneous. While vasomotor symptoms were often measured, other menopausal symptoms such as mood swings or pain were investigated less frequently. Sexual problems were only rarely assessed.
   Studies on perimenopausal depression regularly include the assessment of core symptoms of a major depressive disorder, but the assessment of menopausal complaints is inconsistent. While certain symptoms are commonly measured, others are not assessed. Such inconsistencies underline an ambiguous understanding of perimenopausal depression, which in turn affects the evaluation and treatment of the condition. Thus, the use of the existing guidelines on perimenopausal depression is recommended.

TI  - The Effect of Aromatherapy on Sleep and Quality of Life in Menopausal Women with Sleeping Problems: A Non-Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Menopause is the termination of menstruation and fertility. Women commonly experience sleeping problems during the menopausal period. Aromatherapy is among the complementary therapies used to remedy sleeping problems. Methods:This study aims to investigate the effects of lavender oil on sleep and quality of life of menopausal women through steam inhalation. This study was quasi-experimental with pre-test/post-test placebo control groups. It was conducted with 57 women, 27 of whom were subject to aromatherapy and 30 to a placebo. Data were collected using the Questionnaire Form, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL). Results: For the intervention group, the PSQI median scores after the administration of aromatherapy were found to be significantly lower than those before the administration (p < 0.001) and those of the placebo group (p < 0.001). Similarly, for the intervention group, the total median MENQOL scores after the administration of the aromatherapy were found to be significantly lower than the scores prior to the administration (p < 0.001) as well as the scores of the placebo group (p < 0.001). Conclusion: It was found that aromatherapy involving lavender-scented steam inhalation increased sleep quality and quality of life in women with sleep deprivation problems during menopause.

TI  - Advanced Oxidation Protein Products and the CLOCK 3111T/C Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in Menopausal Women with Insomnia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess the dependence of the advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) levels on the genotype of the CLOCK 3111T/C SNP in Caucasian menopausal women with and without insomnia.
   Methods and Results: The study involved 105 Caucasian menopausal women volunteers aged between 45 and 60 years. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were employed. The study of the CLOCK 3111T/C SNP (rs1801260) was performed by PCR. The blood level of AOPPs was detected by IEMA. Based on the results of a clinical-anamnestic examination, the women were divided into two groups: the main (with insomnia) and the control (without insomnia). Given the small number of women carrying the CC genotype of the CLOCK 3111T/C SNP, the.. carriers and TC carriers were combined into one group as the carriers of the minor 3111C allele.
   There were no statistically significant differences in the AOPP levels between carriers of different genotypes (TT genotype and TC+CC genotypes) in controls and patients. A comparative analysis of AOPP levels in the women of the main and control groups showed higher AOPP levels in women with insomnia carrying the TT genotype than in the control of the same genotype (P=0.013).
   Conclusion: Insomnia in menopausal women is associated with increased protein oxidation only in carriers of the TT genotype of the CLOCK 3111T/C SNP.

TI  - Night Shift Among Women: Is It Associated With Difficulty Conceiving a First Birth?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Asynchrony in circadian processes alters many physiological systems, including female reproduction. Thus, there are possible reproductive consequences of night shift work for women including menstrual irregularity, endometriosis, and prolonged time to conception. This study examined whether women who worked night shift were more likely than those who did not to require fertility treatment to conceive a first birth, whether they had specific infertility diagnoses, and if such relationships were age-specific.
   Methods: In a retrospective data linkage study of 128,852 primiparous women, fertility treatment data were linked to the state perinatal registry for South Australia (1986-2002). Potential exposure to night shift work was assessed using a job-exposure matrix. First, the association between night shift work and fertility treatment was assessed among (1) all women, then (2) women in paid employment, using logistic regression. Interactions between age and shift work status were also examined. Secondly, among women who conceived with fertility treatment, we assessed associations between night shift work and type of infertility diagnosis. Potential confounders were considered in all analyses.
   Results: Among women <= 35 years, night shift workers were more likely to require fertility treatment (all: OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.19-1.64; in paid employment: OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.08-1.50). There were no associations among women >35 years. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status and smoking did not affect these results. Among women who underwent fertility treatment, night shift workers were more likely than day workers to have menstrual irregularity (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.05-1.91) or endometriosis (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.00-1.80).
   Conclusions: Night shift work may contribute to increased need for fertility treatment in younger women. This increased risk may reflect young women's vulnerability in terms of poor tolerance of night shift work, and/or lack of control and choice about shift schedule.

TI  - Sustained effects of a brief and standardised acupuncture approach on menopausal symptoms: post hoc analysis of the ACOM randomised controlled trial
T2  - ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background
   Our objective was to investigate whether the effect of a brief and standardised acupuncture approach persists after the end of the acupuncture treatment (post-treatment effect) and whether the anticipation of future acupuncture treatment affects menopausal symptoms (pre-treatment effect).
   Method
   This study is a post hoc analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial where women with moderate to severe menopausal symptoms were offered weekly acupuncture treatment over five consecutive weeks and randomised (1:1) to an early intervention group that received treatment immediately and a late intervention group with a 6-week delay. The acupuncture style was Western medical, administered at CV3, CV4 and bilateral LR8, SP6 and SP9. Acupuncturists were general practitioners. The effect was evaluated repeatedly during and after the interventions using scales from the validated MenoScores Questionnaire (MSQ) for hot flushes (HF), day and night sweats (DNS), general sweating (GS) and menopausal-specific sleeping problems (MSSP) with a 26-week follow-up period (corresponding to 21 or 15 weeks post-treatment for the early and late intervention groups, respectively). Multivariable linear mixed models were used to analyse the extent and duration of effects.
   Results
   Seventy participants were included in the study. Four participants dropped out. Furthermore, one participant was excluded from the short- and long-term follow-up analyses after the insertion of a hormonal intrauterine device, and nine participants were excluded from the long-term follow-up analysis due to the initiation of co-interventions. For each of the four outcomes, the effect was sustained up to 21 weeks post-treatment with an effect size that was only slightly diminished. A small, but significant, pre-treatment effect was observed in the HF scale scores. The same trend, although not significant, was observed in the DNS and MSSP scale scores. No serious harms were reported.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrated that the overall effect of a brief and standardised acupuncture treatment on menopause-relevant outcomes was sustained up to 21 weeks post-treatment and that there was a small pre-treatment effect.

TI  - The association between menarche and myopia and its interaction with related risk behaviors among Chinese school-aged girls: a nationwide cross-sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB  - Nearly 80% of new cases of myopia arise between 9 and 13 years old when puberty development also progresses rapidly. However, little is known about the association between myopia and puberty. We aim to evaluate the association between myopia and menarche, the most important puberty indicator for girls, and to test whether menarche could modify the effects of myopia-related behaviors. The participants came from two consecutive national surveys conducted in 30 provinces in mainland China in 2010 and 2014. We included 102,883 girls (61% had experienced menarche) aged 10-15 years. Risk behaviors for myopia which included sleep duration, homework time, and outdoor activity were measured by self-administrated questionnaire. Myopia was defined according to a validated method, and its relationships with menarche status and behaviors were evaluated by robust Poisson regression models based on generalized estimated equation adjusting for cluster effect of school. We found that postmenarche girls were at 13% (95% confidence interval: 11%-16%) higher risk of myopia than premenarche girls, after adjusting for exact age, urban-rural location, survey year, and four behavioral covariates. Short sleep duration (<7 h/d), long homework time (>1 h/d) and low frequency of weekend outdoor activity tended to be stronger (with higher prevalence ratios associated with myopia) risk factors for myopia in postmenarche girls than in premenarche girls, and their interaction with menarche status was all statistically significant (P < 0.05). Overall, our study suggests that menarche onset may be associated with increased risk of myopia among school-aged girls and could also enhance girls' sensitivity to myopia-related risk behaviors.

TI  - Prior depression affects the experience of the perimenopause-findings from the Swiss Perimenopause Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: There is a prevalence peak of depression in the perimenopause, with this reproductive phase being considered a window of vulnerability due to major biopsychosocial changes. Depression has been associated with physical and psychosocial impairment. Prior depression has been shown to be a risk factor for the devel-opment of several somatic and mental diseases. We assume that women with prior depression will exhibit increased burdensome symptoms in the perimenopause compared to women without prior depression.
   Methods: A total of 135 perimenopausal women aged 40-56 years participated in the longitudinal Swiss Perimenopause Study. For the purpose of this investigation, a cross-sectional design was chosen. A wide range of validated psychosocial questionnaires were used to compare women with and without prior depression regarding their experience of the perimenopause. Findings were statistically adjusted for multiple testing.
   Results: Women with prior depression showed significantly more depressive symptoms (U = 1215.5, p < .01), more menopausal symptoms (U = 1395.0, p < .01), and more sleep disturbances (U = 1583.5, p < .05) than women without prior depression. Moreover, women with a history of depression reported lower subjective mental health (U = 1573.0, p < 05) and felt more isolated (U = 1524.0, p < .05) than those without prior depression.
   Limitations: Self-report data may affect the results. Furthermore, due to the cross-sectional design, causality cannot be inferred.
   Conclusions: Prior depression affects women's experience of the perimenopause. Women with prior depression exhibit significantly more negative health outcomes in the perimenopause than those without prior depression.

TI  - Mind-body medicine in integrative oncology State of evidence and fields of application
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
AB  - Background Diagnosis, treatment and survival of cancer are associated with a complex set of stress factors. To promote emotional and physical well-being and also reduce psychological stress, mind-body therapies are often used in integrative cancer treatment. Objectives A survey of the state of evidence and fields of application of mind-body medicine in integrative oncology are presented. Results During and after completion of primary therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) shows positive effects on anxiety, stress, fatigue, and menopausal symptoms, while quality of sleep and cognitive performance are increased. The effects of yoga, especially on fatigue in patients with breast cancer during and after completion of primary therapy, have been well documented. Yoga also improves sleep disorders and menopausal symptoms. Hypnosis reduces pain, psychological stress, nausea/vomiting and fatigue perioperatively, under radiotherapy and in advanced stages of the disease. Relaxation techniques and meditation primarily reduce stress, while multimodal services combining various evidence-based concepts of mind-body therapies can improve quality of life on many levels. Conclusions There is broad evidence for the safety and efficacy of MBSR in improving treatment-related symptoms and reducing psychological stress. Yoga helps alleviate fatigue and menopausal symptoms, while improving sleep and cognitive performance. Furthermore, relaxation training and meditation reduce depression and improve stress management, and hypnosis reduces pain and mental stress.

TI  - Traditional Chinese medicine in integrative oncology Study situation and fields of application
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
AB  - Background Therapies from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are increasingly being integrated into western treatment concepts within the framework of integrative oncology. The focus is on reducing side effects caused by oncological treatment, improving the quality of life and promoting a healthy lifestyle. The aim is not to achieve a cure but to strengthen and harmonize the patient. The TCM can therefore be a useful supplement to conventional treatment. Objective This article gives a brief survey of the state of evidence as well as the fields of application of TCM in integrative oncology. Results There is good evidence for acupuncture and acupressure especially for pain: chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (CIPN) aromatase inhibitor (AI)-induced arthralgia and cancer-related pain. There are also positive data on the improvement of nausea, sleep disorders, hot flashes and cognitive impairments with acupuncture/acupressure; however, more recent data on improving fatigue and global quality of life are not entirely conclusive. Taking TCM herbs is not recommended from a scientific point of view, only ginseng for fatigue and ginger against chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can be tried. Conclusion There is good evidence for a number of TCM procedures, especially for acupuncture/acupressure for pain relief (caused by chemotherapy, aromatase inhibitors or the cancer itself). Sleep, cognition and menopausal symptoms can also be improved by acupuncture/acupressure. As a single drug, ginseng can be tried against fatigue and ginger against nausea.

TI  - What Your Nose Knows: Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Responses to the Scent of Another Person
T2  - CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB  - People readily perceive and react to the body odors of other people, which creates a wide range of implications for affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses. In this article, we provide an overview of recent research in this area. We summarize the process by which people associate body odors with different kinds of interpersonally relevant information, briefly review two lines of research on responses to strangers' body odors (research on olfactory cues and emotions, research on olfactory cues and impression formation), and review new research on the psychological consequences of smelling loved ones' odors-including consequences for stress reduction and sleep enhancement. We conclude with a discussion of emerging research questions and methodological considerations that may help guide future inquiry into the various ways that the odors of other people influence one's emotions, cognitions, relationships, and health.

TI  - Ultradian rhythms in heart rate variability and distal body temperature anticipate onset of the luteinizing hormone surge
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The menstrual cycle is characterized by predictable patterns of physiological change across timescales. Although patterns of reproductive hormones across the menstrual cycle, particularly ultradian rhythms, are well described, monitoring these measures repeatedly to predict the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge is not practical. In the present study, we explored whether non-invasive measures coupled to the reproductive system: high frequency distal body temperature (DBT), sleeping heart rate (HR), sleeping heart rate variability (HRV), and sleep timing, could be used to anticipate the preovulatory LH surge in women. To test this possibility, we used signal processing to examine these measures in 45 premenopausal and 10 perimenopausal cycles alongside dates of supra-surge threshold LH and menstruation. Additionally, urinary estradiol and progesterone metabolites were measured daily surrounding the LH surge in 20 cycles. Wavelet analysis revealed a consistent pattern of DBT and HRV ultradian rhythm (2-5 h) power that uniquely enabled anticipation of the LH surge at least 2 days prior to its onset in 100% of individuals. Together, the present findings reveal fluctuations in distal body temperature and heart rate variability that consistently anticipate the LH surge, suggesting that automated ultradian rhythm monitoring may provide a novel and convenient method for non-invasive fertility assessment.

TI  - A practical nutritional guide for the management of sleep disturbances in menopause
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCES AND NUTRITION
AB  - Sleep disturbances (SD) represent one of the main symptoms of menopause and they are caused by several factors. Hormonal changes such as the reduction of oestrogen levels and the consequent vasomotor symptoms (VMS) along with psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety could contribute to the onset of SD. Furthermore, obesity per se or through the obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) could blunt sleep. Moreover, in menopause is usual a reduction in melatonin, that could contribute to SD. Nutritional strategies are paramount because they could contribute to manage menopause-related SD, in particular tackling obesity and overweight. Furthermore, some foods, such as soy, fish, whole grains, vegetables and fruit could decrease symptoms like depression and VMS, correlated with SD in postmenopausal women. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current evidence on SD in menopause and to provide nutritional strategies for managing SD in this context.

TI  - Voice perturbations under the stress overload in young individuals: phenotyping and suboptimal health as predictors for cascading pathologies
T2  - EPMA JOURNAL
AB  - Verbal communication is one of the most sophisticated human motor skills reflecting both-the mental and physical health of an individual. Voice parameters and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient profiling.

TI  - Physiologic and psychosocial changes of the menopause transition in US Latinas: a narrative review
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Latinos comprise the fastest-growing minority group in the USA, with Hispanic women (Latinas) constituting 17% of women aged 45-54 years. The menopause transition (MT) is associated with many physiological, behavioral, and psychosocial changes that can affect disease risk in women. While several epidemiologic investigations have enhanced our understanding of the MT, to date, menopause research has mostly focused on non-Latina White women. As a consequence, there is a dearth of information on strategies for managing menopause-related issues in Latinas and important factors to consider to provide culturally appropriate care and promote lifestyles that may reduce adverse health outcomes. This narrative review summarizes existing evidence of the MT in Latinas, with a focus on hormonal alterations, menopausal symptoms, mental health, cognition, and cardiometabolic health. The clinical and research implications of the current literature will also be discussed.

TI  - Poor Sleep Quality and Its Consequences on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Background
   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected the whole of Italy. The extreme virulence and the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress, and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and to evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. Methods
   By means of an Internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole of the COVID-19 lockdown (from March 10-1st phase to May 4-2nd phase). We investigated the sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study-sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. Results
   A total of 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers revealed several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died because of COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythms characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, and extremely severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion
   This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole of the lockdown period in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits due to elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be undertaken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the lockdown for the COVID-19 outbreak.

TI  - Assessment of nutritional-dietary status, body composition, eating behavior, and perceived image in rhythmic gymnastics athletes
T2  - NUTRICION HOSPITALARIA
AB  - Introduction: among adolescent gymnasts some concern for body weight has been observed, with diets inadequate in energy and some nutrients in the search for maximum performance.
   Objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary-nutritional status, body composition, eating behavior, and perceived body image concerns of female gymnasts at sub-national competition levels. In addition, to study the relationship between the prevalence of the risk of eating disorders and variables such as substance use, irregular menstruation, fatigue, and hours of sleep.
   Materials and method: a total of 33 female subelite gymnasts participated (age: M = 14.52, SD = 1.85), with age ranging from 11 to 18 years. Anthropometric evaluations (restricted profile) were made, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) and Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) were administered, and the subjects were then interviewed for collecting sociodemographic, socio-sports, health, and food intake data.
   Results: the results showed that their diet was deficient, among other micro- and macro-nutrients, in water, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins D and E, fiber, iron and calcium, whereas they ingested an excess of vitamin A and sodium. These athletes had normal weight, high muscle mass values, low fat mass levels, and intermediate somatotype components (balanced endomorph with a tendency to central). Two cases at risk for an eating disorder, and concerns related to perceived body image in a quarter of the sample were identified.
   Conclusion: the risk of having an eating disorder is related to the consumption of prohibited drugs or addictive substances, irregular menstruation, tiredness, and fewer hours of sleep.

TI  - Psychosocial and stress-related risk factors for abnormal menstrual cycle pattern among adolescent girls: A case-control study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Menstruation is a normal physiological process among reproductive age group females. Although some of them show the abnormal menstrual pattern, which is influenced by several factors, including sociodemographic status, psychosocial stress, improper sleep level, etc. The identification of these risk factors associated with abnormal menstrual patterns may permit risk stratification among adolescent girls. This study was planned to determine various factors which depict menstrual cycle pattern among adolescent girls in urban India.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A school-based case-control study was carried out in urban India from May to December 2019. Urban locality and schools were randomly selected, and data were collected in two phases. Adolescent girls in the age group of 10-19 years studying in government and private (both Hindi medium and English medium) schools of urban India were screened for the abnormal menstrual pattern. Equal numbers of age-matched controls were also enrolled. Data were collected with the help of self-administered predesigned pretested semi-structured questionnaire. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, unpaired t-test, and McNemar tests were used to analyze data using SPSS version 23.0.
   RESULTS: A total of 100 cases and 100 age-matched controls (mean age 14.8 +/- 1.5 years) were included in the study, almost half of the cases and controls have normative menarche. Improper sleep patterns increased stress levels, and low education status of mothers show statistically significant (P = 0.047) association with abnormal menstrual patterns.
   CONCLUSION: More stress, improper sleep levels, and low education status of mothers among school-going adolescent girls were strongly associated with abnormal menstrual patterns with more symptoms during menstruation.

TI  - Prevalence and associated risk factor of low back pain among medical student of Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia: Cross-sectional study
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Low back pain is an incredibly Complaint experienced by different individuals ages. In 2015, the worldwide point commonness of movement constraining low back torment was 7.3%, suggesting that 540 million individuals were influenced at any one time. Low back pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from a few diverse known or obscure irregularities or sicknesses. It is characterized by the area of agony, regularly between the lower rib edges and the butt cheek creases. Aim: To determine the prevalence of low-back pain and explore factors associated with MSP among medical students at Umm Al-Qura4 University Saudi Arabia. Method: A cross-sectional survey was performed among medical students in Umm Al-Qura University during the period from 12 June 2020 to 12 October, 2020. The survey included 366 students whose ages ranged from 18 to 25 years old. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 was used in the analysis. Results: A total of 366 students were involved in this study, 249 (68%) of them were females 68%. As for BMI, exact of 236 (64.5%) were at normal weight while 45 (12.3%) were obese. Exact of 277 (75.7%) students complained of LBP during the last period related to trauma. As for aggravating factors, the long sitting session was the most reported factor (75.2%) followed by wrong sleep position (58.5%), sedentary lifestyle (45%), inappropriate lifting (28.7%), and stress (27.9%), while long-standing (4.7%), and menses (2.3%) were the least reported factors. The most-reported red flags of back pain were neck pain (39.1%) followed by weakness (16.7%), leg weakness (11.6%), numbness (10.1%), and loss of knee reflex (4.7%). Conclusion: LBP was more among females and mainly related to inappropriate sleep, setting, or even studying positions. Neck pain was the most reported with a low mood. Lack of exercise with long study hours was remarkably reported. Also, irrespective of the high prevalence of reported LBP, but there was no considerable effect on student's scholastic performance.

TI  - Associations between sex hormones, sleep problems and depression: A systematic review
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Sleep problems and depression are both common and have a high impact on quality of life. They are also strongly associated and commonly occur together. During the reproductive age, both sleep problems and depression are almost twice as common in women than men. Epidemiological studies show that women experience more sleep problems and depressive symptoms around times when sex hormones change, such as puberty and menopause, but it is unclear what effect sex hormones have on sleep problems and depression.
   This systematic review aims to summarize and evaluate studies that investigated the relationship between sex hormones, sleep and depression.
   Systematic search resulted in 2895 articles, of which 13 met inclusion criteria.
   Depressed patients showed worse sleep than controls, but no significant difference in endogenous hormone levels was found. Additionally, higher endogenous estrogen was associated with better sleep in controls, but associations between endogenous sex hormones and depressive symptoms were inconclusive. More research on the effect of sex hormones on sleep and depression is necessary.

TI  - Associations of physical fitness and physical activity with sleep among middle-aged women
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is an important component of health. Sleep disturbances increase in women as they enter menopause. Physical activity has been associated with improved sleep among older populations. The purpose of this study was to determine if physical activity and/or physical fitness are associated with sleep quantity and quality in middle-aged women.
   METHODS: This study recruited 114 healthy women, aged 30-55 (43 +/- 8 y) from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, from 2015-2019. Sleep quantity and quality were evaluated. Participants were classified on their aerobic fitness, based on estimated peak aerobic capacity, as high or low grip strength and, as active or inactive.
   RESULTS: The high aerobic fitness group had a greater mean sleep duration of 7.04 +/- 1.02 h compared to the low fit group 6.61 +/- 1.00 h after adjusting for age, Body Mass Index, waist circumference and menstrual status (P=0.01). The percentage of high aerobic fitness women who felt rested was greater than low aerobic fitness women (67 +/- 6% vs. 45 +/- 7%, P=0.03), after adjusting for age, Body Mass Index, waist circumference and menstrual status. Our study found a significant difference between women with higher aerobic fitness levels getting more sleep each night and feeling more rested.
   CONCLUSIONS: The continued examination of physical fitness and its relationship to sleep holds importance for women's health.

TI  - A Prospective Cohort Study to Evaluate the Impact of Diet, Exercise, and Lifestyle on Fertility: Design and Baseline Characteristics
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Diet, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors might influence fertility for men and women, although evidence is mixed, and couple-based approaches are needed for assessing associations with reproductive outcomes. The Impact of Diet, Exercise, and Lifestyle (IDEAL) on Fertility Study is a prospective cohort with contemporaneous detailed follow-up of female partners of men enrolled in the Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial studying couples seeking infertility treatment (2016-2019). Follow-up of men continued for 6 months, while female partners were followed for 9 months while attempting pregnancy and throughout any resulting pregnancy (up to 18 months). Longitudinal data on diet, physical activity (including measurement via wearable device), sleep, and stress were captured at multiple study visits during this follow-up. A subset of women (IDEALplus) also completed daily journals and a body fat assessment via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. IDEAL enrolled 920 women, and IDEALPIus enrolled 218. We demonstrated the ability to enroll women in a prospective cohort study contemporaneous to a partner-enrolled randomized trial. In combination with data collected on male partners, IDEAL data facilitates a couple-based approach to understanding associations between lifestyle factors and infertility treatment outcomes. We describe in detail the study design, recruitment, data collection, lessons learned, and baseline characteristics.

TI  - Identifying the Factors That Affect Depressive Symptoms in Middle-Aged Menopausal Women: A Nationwide Study in Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Depressive symptoms do not persistently negatively affect functioning throughout the life span, but they may affect quality of life (QOL), especially in middle-aged women. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the factors associated with depressive symptoms in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. This descriptive study was a secondary analysis of the data from the seventh Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that was conducted in 2016. Of the 8150 participants, the analysis included 644 premenopausal women and 459 postmenopausal women aged 40-60 years. The factors associated with depressive symptoms in the participants were examined using multivariate regression analysis. It was found that the depressive symptoms of postmenopausal middle-aged women were greater than those of premenopausal women. While a high perceived stress status and high pain-related discomfort were factors that influenced depressive symptoms among the premenopausal group, a high level of discomfort due to anxiety/depression, a poor perceived health status, shortened weekend sleep time, and smoking were associated with depressive symptoms in the postmenopausal group. Thus, it is necessary to develop an intervention to decrease depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women that considers their QOL, which is associated with depression, their subjective health status, sleep time, and smoking cessation.

TI  - The comparison of the effect of soybean and fish oil on supplementation on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background: The effect of soybean and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on menopausal symptoms in post-menopausal women was investigated.
   Materials and methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial postmenopausal women were randomly given either soybean (Soygan 500 mg capsule; n = 60), or omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-rex 1000 mg soft gel; n = 60), or placebo (n = 60) daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a change on the menopause rating scale score (MRS), while the secondary outcome was any adverse symptoms and effect was effect of soybean or omega-3 fatty acid supplements on the blood lipids and thyroid hormone.
   Results: Based on the results of post-hoc in terms of overall MRS score there was a significant difference between the control and Soygan (p < 0.001) and Omega-rex groups (p = 0.03); however, there was no significant difference between the two intervention groups (p = 0.86). Soygan and Omega-rex had no effects on the blood lipids and thyroid hormone.
   Conclusion: Soygan and Omega-rex reduced the MRS score and improved menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Isoflavone Supplementation Does Not Potentiate the Effect of Combined Exercise Training on Resting and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Non-Obese Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial-A Pilot Study
T2  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - Physical exercise and isoflavone supplementation are potential strategies to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases in postmenopausal women. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are additive effects of isoflavone supplementation when associated with combined aerobic and resistance exercise on resting and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and in blood pressure variability (BPV). Thirty-one non-obese postmenopausal women were randomly allocated into two groups: placebo and exercise (Placebo n = 19); and isoflavone supplementation (100 mg/day) and exercise (isoflavone n = 19). ABPM and BPV were evaluated before and after 10 weeks of moderate combined (aerobic and resistance) exercise training. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) with Bonferroni correction and intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare the effects of interventions on resting BP, ABPM and BPV. Combined exercise training decreased resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and reduced 24 h and awake ambulatory SBP, DBP and mean blood pressure over time, with no additional effects of isoflavone supplementation. No changes were observed in sleep period, or in BPV indexes (Standard Deviation of 24 h (SD), daytime and nighttime interval (SDdn) and average real variability (ARV) in both groups. We conclude that isoflavone supplementation does not potentiate the effects of combined training on resting and ambulatorial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in non-obese postmenopausal women.

TI  - Physiologic vasomotor symptoms are associated with verbal memory dysfunction in breast cancer survivors
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), sleep disturbance, and cognitive complaints are common among women with a history of breast cancer and contribute to decreased quality of life. Studies in healthy women showed an association between verbal memory performance and physiologic VMS measured with ambulatory skin conductance monitors but not with VMS by self-report. We hypothesized that we would find a similar association in women with breast cancer.
   Methods: Participants included 30 female breast cancer survivors (mean age 52.7 y; 26.7% African-American) with moderate-to-severe VMS enrolled in a larger clinical trial of a nonhormonal intervention for VMS. At baseline, participants completed assessments of physiologic VMS, actigraphy-based assessments of sleep, questionnaires about mood, and two tests of verbal memory - Logical Memory (LM) and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Using baseline data, we conducted multivariate regression analyses to examine the association between VMS and memory, controlling for sleep and other factors.
   Results: On average, women reported 46% of total physiologic VMS. A higher frequency of physiologic VMS - but not reported VMS - was significantly associated with lower scores on the California Verbal Learning Test short-delay free recall (r[28] = -0.41, P = 0.03), long-delay free recall (r[28] = -0.42, P = 0.03), and total clustering, (r[28] = -0.39, P = 0.04). These associations were independent of sleep, mood, and other factors.
   Conclusions: Independent of their effect on sleep, VMS may be a modifiable contributor to memory difficulties in women with breast cancer. These findings underscore the importance of objective measurement of VMS in cognitive studies.

TI  - Association of phthalate exposure and endogenous hormones with self-reported sleep disruptions: results from the Midlife Women's Health Study
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol (E-2) have been associated with sleep in midlife women, however, few studies have examined the association of other hormones or environmental chemical exposure such as phthalates, with self-reported sleep quality. We assessed the relationship of self-reported sleep with hormones and phthalates. Methods: In total, 762 women (aged 45-54 y, 459 premenopausal, and 303 perimenopausal) from the Midlife Women's Health Study answered self-reported questions regarding the frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep. Serum E-2, progesterone, testosterone, serum hormone binding globulin, free E-2 index, free testosterone index, E-2:progesterone, and E-2:testosterone were measured. Summary measures of phthalate mixtures, including the phthalates from plastic sources (sumPLASTIC), personal care products (sumPCP), di-(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate (sumDEHP), anti-androgenic phthalates (sumAA), and all phthalate metabolites measured (sumALL), were calculated from urinary phthalate metabolites. Ordinal logistic regression was used to fit each outcome sleep measure with all hormones and summary phthalates. Results: Progesterone and testosterone were significantly negatively associated with the frequency of sleep disturbances and insomnia. Free testosterone index was also negatively associated with insomnia frequency. E-2:progesterone was positively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances and restless sleep in self-reported nonsmokers. SumPCP and sumALL were significantly negatively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep. SumDEHP and sumPLASTIC were negatively associated with insomnia frequency. Further, the direction of association between phthalates and sleep appears to be dependent on the quartile of phthalate exposure. All significant associations between phthalates and sleep were in self-reported nonsmokers or former smokers. Conclusions: Our study supports previous literature that hormones beyond follicle-stimulating hormone and E-2 are associated with sleep disruptions in menopause. Further, we are among the first to show that phthalate exposure is associated with sleep disruptions in midlife women.

TI  - The severity of vasomotor symptoms and number of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women and select clinical health outcomes in the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D randomized clinical trial
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: This study evaluated whether vasomotor symptom (VMS) severity and number of moderate/severe menopausal symptoms (nMS) were associated with health outcomes, and whether calcium and vitamin D (CaD) modified the risks.
   Methods: The Women's Health Initiative CaD study was a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which tested 400 IU of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D and 1,000 mg of calcium per day in women aged 50 to 79 years. This study included 20,050 women (median follow-up of 7 y). The outcomes included hip fracture, colorectal cancer, invasive breast cancer, all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular death, and total cardiovascular disease (CVD). MS included: hot flashes, night sweats, dizziness, heart racing, tremors, feeling restless, feeling tired, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, mood swings, vaginal dryness, breast tenderness, migraine, and waking up several times at night. Associations between VMS severity and nMS with outcomes were tested.
   Results: No association between VMS severity and any outcome were found. In contrast, nMS was associated with higher stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.89 for >= 2 MS vs none; HR 1.20 95% CI 0.89-1.63 for 1 MS vs none, P trend = 0.03) and total CVD (HR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.18-1.54 for >= 2 MS vs none; HR 0.99, 95% CI, 0.87-1.14 for 1 MS vs none P trend < 0.001). CaD did not modify any association.
   Conclusion: Severity of VMS was not associated with any outcome. Having >= 2 moderate or severe MS was associated with an increased risk for CVD. The number of moderate/severe MS may be a marker for higher CVD risk.

TI  - The association of depressive symptoms to sleep-related symptoms during menopausal transition: racial/ethnic differences
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: Despite an increasing number of studies reporting significant associations of depression to sleep problems in general, few studies have been conducted on racial/ethnic variations in the associations among midlife women in their menopausal transition. The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between depressive symptoms and sleep-related symptoms in a multiethnic group of midlife women while considering the women's race/ethnicity and menopausal status. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the data from 1,054 midlife women in two larger studies. The depression index for midlife women and the sleep index for midlife women were used to measure sleep-related symptoms and depressive symptoms. Descriptive and inferential statistics including hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used for data analyses. Results: In the regression models by race/ethnicity, the total numbers (0.294 in non-Hispanic [NH] African Americans <= beta <= 0.410 in NH Asians), and total severity scores (0.141 in Hispanic <= beta <= 0.365 in NH Whites) of depressive symptoms were positively associated with the total severity of sleep-related symptoms (all P < 0.01). In the regression models by menopausal status, the total numbers (beta = 0.106 in premenopausal and 0.443 in postmenopausal) and total severity scores (0.272 <= beta <= 0.561) of depressive symptoms were positively associated with the total severity scores of sleep-related symptoms (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Further studies with diverse groups of midlife women using objective measurements and biomarkers are warranted to confirm the findings.

TI  - Perimenopausal vasomotor symptoms and the cortisol awakening response
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are associated with a poorer cardiovascular risk profile. Although the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood, alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis have been hypothesized to play a role. This study examined the within- and between-subject relationship between VMS and cortisol in a sample of healthy perimenopausal women.
   Methods: A total of 101 perimenopausal women, ages 45 to 55 years, were included in the study. Once a week for 12 weeks, participants completed a 24-hour hot flash diary assessing frequency and severity of VMS. They also provided two saliva samples for the measurement of the cortisol awakening response (CAR) - immediately upon waking and 30 minutes postwaking - and collected a urine sample for the measurement of a urinary metabolite of estradiol and progesterone: estrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol glucuronide, respectively. General linear models examined the between-subject relationship between mean VMS symptoms and mean CAR, whereas multilevel modeling was used to examine the relationship between within-person weekly changes on weekly CAR.
   Results: Within-subject weekly change in VMS bother, frequency, and severity were not significantly related to weekly CAR. Several significant between-subject effects of VMS on the CAR were, however, observed such that total number of hot flashes, overall VMS severity, and VMS bother, were each associated with a blunted CAR. Results remained significant despite statistically adjusting for levels of estrone-3-glucuronide, pregnanediol glucuronide, and self-reported sleep quality.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that women who suffer from more severe and bothersome perimenopausal VMS exhibit alterations in HPA axis activity. Within an individual, short-term changes in VMS are, however, not associated with concurrent changes in HPA axis functioning. Further research investigating the role of the HPA axis in linking VMS and increased cardiovascular disease risk is warranted.

TI  - Insomnia symptoms in relation to menopause among middle-aged Chinese women: Findings from a longitudinal cohort study
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Objective: Our study aims to investigate the differences in insomnia between Chinese and Western women during menopause to fill the gaps in the research on menopause in Chinese women, and to examine the premenopausal factors predictive of moderate to severe insomnia during menopause.
   Study Design: This is a longitudinal cohort study conducted in an urban Chinese community with a total of 458 participants.
   Main Outcome Measures: Presence of insomnia symptoms (trouble falling asleep, waking up early); vasomotor symptoms; anxiety and depression assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; and menopausal stages.
   Results: Multivariable analysis showed that compared with that in premenopause, the prevalence of trouble falling asleep was significantly higher in menopausal transition (P = 0.029) and postmenopause (P < 0.001), and the prevalence of early-morning awakenings also significantly increased in menopausal transition (P = 0.003) and postmenopause (P = 0.011). In multivariable analysis anxiety (P = 0.022) and depression (P = 0.005) were independently and significantly positively associated with trouble falling asleep. Anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P = 0.018), and levels of follicle stimulating hormone (P-0.031) were independently and significantly positively associated with trouble falling asleep. Women who experienced insomnia in pre -menopause had a significantly higher risk of moderate to severe insomnia in menopausal transition (P = 0.003) and postmenopause (P = 0.047) than those who did not.
   Conclusion: This study showed that the prevalence of sleep disturbance significantly increased during and after menopause. Women with anxiety and depression had a higher risk of insomnia. Difficulty in sleep initiation in the premenopausal period was a strong predictor of moderate to severe insomnia at menopausal transition and postmenopause.

TI  - Footbath as a safe, simple, and non-pharmacological method to improve sleep quality of menopausal women
T2  - RESEARCH IN NURSING & HEALTH
AB  - Due to the adverse effects of medication we decided to provide a safe, economic, and easy intervention to decrease sleep problems in menopausal women. This trial aimed to determine the effect of footbath on sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women. One hundred menopausal women were randomly stratified using a permuted block randomization procedure by Random Allocation Software, and assigned to one of two study groups: control (without intervention, n = 50) and intervention (footbath, n = 50). The footbath group was asked to lie their feet into the warm water for 20 min in a container with a depth of 10 cm one hour before the usual sleeping time for 6 weeks. To assess sleep quality, we used the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). To evaluate severity of menopause symptoms, the Greene scale was applied. Before the intervention, 96% of the subjects in the footbath group and 94% in the control group were poor sleepers. The results of analysis of covariance showed significant improvement in sleep quality and decrease in severity of menopause signs in the footbath group compared to the control group. At the baseline, there was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of menopause signs and the global score of PSQI in all study individuals (p <= .001, r = .464). The present study findings showed that footbath intervention enhanced sleep quality in menopausal women. Thus, footbath as a safe, simple, and non-pharmacological application can improve quality of life in postmenopausal women and inhibit problems due to inadequate sleep quality.

TI  - What Are the Factors Affecting Total Sleep Time During Video Polysomnography in Infants?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objective The aim of the study is to investigate factors affecting total sleep time (TST) during infant polysomnography (PSG) and assess if <4 hours of TST is sufficient for accurate interpretation.
   Study Design Overall, 242 PSGs performed in 194 infants <6 months of chronological age between March 2013 and December 2015 were reviewed to identify factors that affect TST, including age of infant, location and timing of study, presence of medical complexity, and presence of nasal tubes. A continuum of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in relation to TST was reviewed. Data were examined in infants who had TST <4 hours and low AHI.
   Results Greater TST ( p < 0.001) was noted among infants during nocturnal PSGs, at older chronological and post-menstrual ages, and without medical complexity. The presence of nasogastric/impedance probes reduced TST ( p = 0.002). Elevated AHIs were identified even in PSGs with TST <4 hours. Short TST may have affected interpretation and delayed initial management in one infant without any inadvertent complications.
   Conclusion Clinical factors such as PMA and medical complexity, and potentially modifiable factors such as time of day and location of study appeared to affect TST during infant PSGs. TST < 4 hours can be sufficient to identify high AHI allowing physician interpretation.

TI  - Dietary intake and menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a systematic review
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Despite literature pointing to a relation between dietary intake and menopausal symptoms, most studies have evaluated either only supplements or only specific nutrients or foods. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review of the literature regarding the association between dietary intake and menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase to identify studies published between 2009 and 2019. We identified 3828 studies; after screening, 73 studies were reviewed and 19 of these investigated nutrient and food intake and eating patterns associated with the intensity of menopausal symptoms. Studies evaluating diet quality or dietary patterns showed an association between lower intensity of psychological symptoms, sleep disorders, and vasomotor, urogenital, and somatic symptoms and higher consumption of vegetables, whole grains, and unprocessed foods. Also, the intensity of these symptoms is associated with high-processed foods, saturated fats, and sugars. Regarding nutrient and/or specific food, the studies indicated an association between caffeine intake and type of fat intake and the intensity of menopausal symptoms. Dietary intake was found to be associated with the severity of menopausal symptoms; however, evidence for the association between dietary intake and menopausal symptoms is inconsistent and inconclusive, and is provided by a small number of studies.

TI  - Midlife Factors Related to Psychological Well-Being at an Older Age: Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background:Psychological well-being (PWB) is predictive of future health and mortality. Midlife is a pivotal time in women's lives and may impact future PWB. This study, based on a longitudinal cohort of women, sought to identify how personal and social resources and modifiable behaviors at midlife relate to women's PWB in later life, and to determine if psychological resilience in later life moderates the impact of health problems on PWB. Materials and Methods:We assessed the association of midlife factors with PWB similar to 9 years later in 1693 women from the multiracial/ethnic Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) cohort. PWB was a composite score with cognitive and affective components. Midlife factors included sociodemographics, health, menopause-related, and psychosocial factors collected over the course of midlife. Results:In a multivariable model, greater PWB at an older age was associated with the following at midlife: less financial strain, greater physical activity, not smoking, better physical functioning, and fewer sleep problems. More positive attitudes toward menopause and aging, less cynicism, greater optimism, less trait anxiety, greater spirituality, and greater resilience were also independently associated with better PWB. Chinese women reported lower PWB compared with whites. Later life resilience moderated the impact of sleep problems on PWB. Conclusions:Several modifiable factors at midlife are associated with better PWB in older women and highlight the importance of healthy behaviors such as physical activity and good sleep hygiene at midlife. Interventions to increase optimism, spirituality, and resilience are also worth exploring.

TI  - Oxygen saturation during sleep as a predictor of inflammation in anovulatory women
T2  - SLEEP AND BREATHING
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the inflammatory profile of premenopausal women with anovulatory cycles, regular menstrual cycles, or using contraceptives, and the associations with sleep and health-related parameters. Methods Subjects completed questionnaires including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth sleepiness scale, underwent whole-night polysomnography, and had blood collected for analysis of inflammatory, cardiovascular, and hormonal parameters. Women of reproductive age were categorized into three groups for comparisons: anovulatory menstrual cycles, regular menstrual cycles, and hormonal contraceptive use. Results Women with anovulatory menstrual cycles (n= 20) had higher circulating levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 compared with women who had regular menstrual cycles (n= 191) and those on hormonal contraception (n= 72). No other classical marker of low-grade inflammation was significantly different. Subjective and objective sleep data were similar among groups. However, the mean peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) during sleep was reduced in anovulatory women. The analysis of associated variables of the inflammatory profile demonstrated that mean SpO2 during sleep was a predictive factor of IL-6 levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that in premenopausal women with anovulation, a proinflammatory condition mediated by IL-6 is associated with lower oxygen levels during sleep. These findings reflect the balance between gynecological status, the immune system, and sleep, pointing to the need to control for these factors in clinical practice and research contexts.

TI  - The associations between different sleep patterns and osteoporosis based on the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians
T2  - ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS
AB  - Based on the use of Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) to assess osteoporosis risk, we found that short sleep duration and taking a daytime nap had an increased risk of osteoporosis.
   Purpose To explore the associations between different sleep patterns with osteoporosis.
   Methods 3659 postmenopausal women (average age of 60 years) were divided into low, middle, and high osteoporosis risk categories based on the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA). After having collected by a standard questionnaire, total and nocturnal sleep duration was collapsed to form categories of <= 6 h, > 6 h and <= 7 h, > 7 h and <= 8 h, > 8 h and <= 9 h, > 9 h, and daytime nap duration of 0 h and > 0 h.
   Results As a categorical variable, the total sleep duration of <= 6 h per day (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.72), nocturnal sleep duration of <= 6 h per night (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.24-2.18), and taking a daytime nap (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.09-1.64) had higher osteoporosis risk after adjustment for covariates. As a continuous variable, after the adjustment for covariates, both longer total (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.94) and nocturnal sleep duration (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91) had lower risk of osteoporosis risk while taking longer daytime nap (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.19) had higher osteoporosis risk.
   Conclusions Postmenopausal women with both short total and nocturnal sleep duration (6 h or less) and taking a daytime nap had increased osteoporosis risk as assessed by OSTA.

TI  - Changes in the objective measures of sleep between the initial nights of menses and the nights during the midfollicular phase of the menstrual cycle in collegiate female athletes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: Sleep is an important recovery period for athletes. Women, including athletes, have reported sleep disturbances around menses. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the changes in objective sleep parameters in the nights during menses and in the midfollicular phase of the menstrual cycle of young female athletes.
   Methods: Female collegiate athletes with regular menstrual cycles were recruited. The participants underwent home electroencephalogram monitoring during the first and second nights after the onset of menses (M1 and M2, respectively) and during one night between the 7th and the 10th night after menses onset (midfollicular phase).
   Results: Data from 45 athletes were analyzed. The total sleep time was significantly reduced, and sleep onset latency was significantly prolonged in M2 compared with those in the night during the midfollicular phase. Sleep efficiency was significantly reduced in M1 compared with that in the night during the midfollicular phase. Changes in the percentage of deep sleep across menstrual cycles differed among the participants with and without menstrual symptoms or concerns for sanitary products; moreover, such participants spent a lower percentage of time in deep sleep in M1 compared with the other nights.
   Conclusions: Collegiate female athletes with regular menstrual cycles are likely to have trouble falling asleep, tend to sleep less, and when concerned about sanitary products, have less deep sleep during menses. Even in young female athletes with regular menstrual cycles, sleep can be disturbed during menses. Interventions to restore or improve sleep should be considered.

TI  - Menopausal symptoms among Chinese peri- and postmenopausal women: a large prospective single-center cohort study
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Background: The prevalence and intensity of menopausal symptoms differ depending on ethnicity, culture, and country. Epidemiological data from China are scarce.
   Objective: To compare the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal Chinese women.
   Methods: This was a prospective two year cohort study that included all eligible women from 31 Chinese provinces attending our 'Menopause Clinic', the first official specialized center in China. Structured questionnaires containing seven domains with 41 items in total were used to assess the following menopausal symptoms using descriptive analysis: negative mood, cognitive symptoms, sleep disorder, vasomotor symptoms (VMS), urogenital symptoms, autonomic nervous disorder, and limb pain/ paresthesia.
   Results: A total of 4063 women with a mean age of 50.53 +/- 6.57 (n = 2107 perimenopausal and 1956 postmenopausal) participated. All menopausal symptoms were more severe in postmenopausal women (p<.05). Independent of menopausal status, urogenital symptoms, often combined with sexual problems, were the most common complaints (in prevalence and severity), followed by sleep disorder, cognitive symptoms (especially hypomnesia), negative mood, autonomic nervous disorder, limb pain/paresthesia and, as the rarest complaint, VMS.
   Conclusions: Urogenital symptoms among midlife Chinese women are common, frequently also in combination with sexual dysfunction, although many do not often complain about these in the first place. Postmenopausal women presented more prevalent and severe menopausal symptoms. In contrast to Western countries, VMS are rare among our population. A multidisciplinary approach and use of hormonal and non-hormonal therapies should be considered for these women.

TI  - An Overview of the Pathophysiology of Metabolic Changes and Their Sequence of Occurrence in Obese Diabetic Females: A Narrative Review
T2  - CUREUS
AB  - Obesity and diabetes both mediate their effects through insulin resistance and frequently co-exist. Insulin resistance is one of the key factors in the development of the metabolic syndrome. Adult females tend to develop obesity more frequently than males. One of the factors causing this difference is the pattern of changes that occur as females age from pre-menopausal to the post-menopausal stage, causing a change in the pattern of accumulation of fats. Several studies have explored and described the association between obesity and metabolic syndrome and their effect on type II diabetes.
   We conducted our literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar as our primary databases. We selected a total of 49 articles for review after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria and removing the duplicate articles. We chose the full-text articles that were published in the English language only. The selected studies were randomized controlled trials and review papers. The reviewed articles showed that visceral fat, central obesity, and fasting blood sugar of post-menopausal is higher than in pre-menopausal women and needs adequate management. More studies are needed in the future to explore the patterns of the metabolic changes in obese females to provide early and better management of diabetes and prevent related complications.

TI  - Effects of forehead cooling and supportive care on menopause-related sleep difficulties, hot flashes and menopausal symptoms: a pilot study.
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objective/Background This pilot study explored the efficacy of a novel forehead cooling device for perceived sleep difficulties and hot flashes in menopausal-age women. Participants 20 women (55.1 +/- 4.2 years; 19 post-menopausal) with insomnia symptoms and self-reported two or more hot flashes per day. Methods Participants completed daily assessments of sleep and hot flashes (via diaries) across 1 baseline week and 4 weeks of open-label, in-home, nightly treatment with a forehead cooling device (15-18 degrees C) along with sleep hygiene instructions. They also completed ratings of insomnia and menopausal symptoms using standardized questionnaires. Results Women reported reductions in sleep onset latency (SOL), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), and nocturnal hot flash severity during the first week of treatment (SOL: 25.7 +/- 18.4 min; WASO: 36.3 +/- 27.3 min; hot flash severity: 3.0 +/- 2.8) compared with baseline (SOL: 38 +/- 26.3 min; WASO: 52.2 +/- 35.6 min; hot flash severity: 6.8 +/- 3.7), with further improvements after 2-4 weeks of use (p< .001). There were also clinically meaningful reductions in insomnia severity and hot flash-related daily interference and lower psychological and physical symptom scores on the Greene climacteric scale after treatment (all p's<0.001). Conclusions This exploratory, naturalistic, pilot study shows that nightly use of a forehead cooling device produces improvements in self-reported sleep and reductions in insomnia, hot flash, and other menopausal, symptoms. Controlled studies are warranted to determine the role of this therapy in the management of sleep difficulties and menopausal symptoms in women. Further mechanistic studies are needed to understand the physiological impact of forehead cooling on sleep and menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Mechanism for the Increase in Human Growth Hormone with Administration of a Novel Test Supplement and Results Indicating Improved Physical Fitness and Sleep Efficiency
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL FOOD
AB  - An oral test supplement increases serum human growth hormone (hGH) levels after acute administration in healthy adults. We investigated the mechanism for the increase in hGH and the effect of continued daily administration of the test supplement on measures of physical fitness and sleep efficiency. In Study 1, serum triiodothyronine (T3) was measured in samples from a prior placebo-controlled, double-blind study in which 16 healthy participants received both placebo and the test supplement in a crossover design; treatment order was randomized, and treatments were separated by a 1-week washout. In Study 2, physical fitness (VO(2)max) was measured at baseline and after 2 weeks of daily administration of the test supplement (N = 12 healthy participants). Study 3 assessed daily sleep onset latency and time awake during 3 weeks of daily administration of the test supplement (N = 15 healthy participants). A fall from baseline in T3 was observed with placebo (-6.1 +/- 8.5 ng/dL,P = .01). Of note, the change in T3 was smaller with the test supplement (-3.3 +/- 10.7 ng/dL,P = not significant) but was not statistically different from placebo. Mean VO(2)max increased by 6% from baseline after 2 weeks (P = .02). Sleep-onset latency and time awake during the night were reduced from baseline to week 3 by 22% and 65%, respectively (P = .01 andP = .02). The conservation of T3 levels suggests that the mechanism for increased hGH secretion by the test supplement is through somatostatin inhibition. Furthermore, pilot studies indicated that daily administration of the supplement improved physical fitness and sleep efficiency from baseline, effects consistent with increased endogenous hGH release.

TI  - Modeling circadian regulation of ovulation timing: age-related disruption of estrous cyclicity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The circadian clocks within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis control estrous cycles in female rodents. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where the central clock is located, generates daily signals to trigger surge release of luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn induces ovulation. It has been observed in aged rodents that output from the SCN such as neuronal firing activity is declined, and estrous cycles become irregular and finally stop. Circadian clock mutants display accelerated reproductive aging, suggesting the complicated interplay between the circadian system and the endocrine system. To investigate such circadian regulation of estrous cycles, we construct a mathematical model that describes dynamics of key hormones such as LH and of circadian clocks in the SCN and in the ovary, and simulate estrous cycles for various parameter values. Our simulation results demonstrate that reduction of the amplitude of the SCN signal, which is a symptom of aging, makes estrous cycles irregular. We also show that variation in the phase of the SCN signal and changes in the period of ovarian circadian clocks exacerbates the aging effect on estrous cyclicity. Our study suggests that misalignment between the SCN and ovarian circadian oscillations is one of the primary causes of the irregular estrous cycles.

TI  - Development and Internal Validation of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Episodic Migraine Attacks Based on Daily Trigger Exposures
T2  - HEADACHE
AB  - Objective To develop and internally validate a multivariable predictive model for days with new-onset migraine headaches based on patient self-prediction and exposure to common trigger factors. Background Accurate real-time forecasting of one's daily risk of migraine attack could help episodic migraine patients to target preventive medications for susceptible time periods and help decrease the burden of disease. Little is known about the predictive utility of common migraine trigger factors. Methods We recruited adults with episodic migraine through online forums to participate in a 90-day prospective daily-diary cohort study conducted through a custom research application for iPhone. Every evening, participants answered questions about migraine occurrence and potential predictors including stress, sleep, caffeine and alcohol consumption, menstruation, and self-prediction. We developed and estimated multivariable multilevel logistic regression models for the risk of a new-onset migraine day vs a healthy day and internally validated the models using repeated cross-validation. Results We had 178 participants complete the study and qualify for the primary analysis which included 1870 migraine events. We found that a decrease in caffeine consumption, higher self-predicted probability of headache, a higher level of stress, and times within 2 days of the onset of menstruation were positively associated with next-day migraine risk. The multivariable model predicted migraine risk only slightly better than chance (within-person C-statistic: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.58). Conclusions In this study, episodic migraine attacks were not predictable based on self-prediction or on self-reported exposure to common trigger factors. Improvements in accuracy and breadth of data collection are needed to build clinically useful migraine prediction models.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated With Cerebro-Vascular Accident Ischemic Stroke In Young And Elderly Population.
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCE AND PHARMA RESEARCH
AB  - Cerebral ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage in a artery that supplies blood to the brain. The blockage reduces the blood flow and oxygen to the brain leading to the damage or death of brain cells. Aim of our study is to identify and analyze the risk factors of cerebral ischemic stroke in young and elderly patients. The known Non modifiable risk factors are Age, Gender, Race,, Family history of stroke, Low birth weight. Modifiable and well documented risk facrors are Hypertension, Sickle cell disease, Atrial fibrillation symptomatic carotid stenosis, Diabetes, Post menopausal hormone therapy, Dyslipidemia. Life style factors-associated with stroke risk Cigarette smoking, Obesity, Over Alcohol consumption, Physical inactivity. Potentially modifiable but less documented risk factors are usage of Oral contraceptives, Migraine,, Drug and alcohol abuse,, Homocysteine condition, Sleep disordered breathing. A Prospective observational study on risk factors of cerebral ischemic stroke in young and elderly patients was performed from September 2018-February 2019 i.e for 6 months duration in In-patient department of General Medicine in Gandhi Hospital.140 CVA cases were collected, documented, analyzed and results are obtained as follows. Young subjects HTN (60.9%), Alcohol consumption (78%), Smoking (48%), History of stroke (36%), Diabetes mellitus (24%), Obesity (14.6%), Cardio-Vascular diseases (4.8%). Elderly subjects HTN (82.8%), Smoking (79%), Alcohol consumption (72.7), History of stroke (33.3%), Diabetes mellitus ( 27.2), Obesity (8.8%), Cardio-Vascular diseases (8%). Reporting of Stroke cases in young adults in India was uncommon in few years ago. But our studies now indicate that the incidence of young stroke is on the rise. It has been observed that for the past 4-5 years the occurrence of stroke is seen at age less than 45years.And lifestyle modifications can reduce the rate of risk.

TI  - Comparative study on the intervention of 'Spice' Mixture (SM) prepared by Natural Food Additives (NFA) alone or intervention of SM with mind calming exercise in the management on female obesity
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE
AB  - Obesity has become huge health problem in the entire world. In Sri Lanka, the prevalence of obesity is estimated to be 20.3% in men and 36.5% in women in four provinces. Further, the highest prevalence rate in Western Province, especially in Colombo was estimated to be 32.2%, among adults. Obesity is associated with osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, gall stones, and hiatus hernia. In addition to this obesity is related to numerous other problems, such as menstrual and mental disorders and varicose vein etc. According to the concept of Unani four treatment modalities are there; they are known as Dieto therapy (Ilaj Bil Ghiza), Pharmaco therapy (Ilaj Bil Dawa), Regimental therapy (Ilaj Bit Tadbeer) and Surgery (Ilaj Bil Yad). Biomarkers such as Lipid profile (VLDL, LDL, HDL And Serum triglycerides), Haemoglobin percentage, SGPT and SC (Serum Creatinine) were considered. Blood sample analysis was performed at NATH (National Ayurvedic Teaching Hospital), Borella, National Diabetic Centre, Rajagiriya and Asiri Hospitals Ltd. According to Unani or Greco-Arabic medical concept, improper digestion may play a main role to cause obesity. Improper digestion was corrected by using a 'spice' mixture made by Natural Food Additives (NFA), which possesses the actions of carminative, digestive and strengthens the gastro-intestinal tract. The preparation of 'spice' mixture included Natural Food Additives (NFA). They are Cumin (Cuminum cyminum), Garlic (Allium sativum), Curry Leaves (Murraya koenigii), Ceylon Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and Black Pepper (Piper nigram). Studies revealed that waist circumferences (WC) is closely linked to CV disease risk factors. Also, WHO Expert Committee on Obesity in Asian and Pacific populations suggested that revised cutoff points for WC: 90 cm for men and 80 cm for women to identify patients with abdominal obesity. South Asians are more prone to insulin resistance and dyslipidaemic state of abdominal obesity. Study concluded that the intervention of 'spice' mixture reduces obesity and the effective mind calm exercises would give more beneficial effect in weight reduction.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy as a preclinical intervention for peri-menopausal depressive moods - An observational study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Peri-menopausal women may experience a range of symptoms which affect quality of life and for which there may be no treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention delivered to peri-menopausal women could alleviate preclinical symptoms of depressive moods.
   Methods: Patients presenting in a gynaecology department were screened for peri-menopausal symptoms. Women with preclinical anxiety, depression and/or sleep disturbance who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Group training was held twice a week for eight weeks; self-practice was assigned and reported. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and upon completion. Participants' reports on self-practice were collected besides the 16 -h class contact.
   Results: Of all 128 enrolled women, 7 (5.5 %) did not complete the program and were excluded. Baseline scores (N = 121) were 63.42 +/- 5.54 (mean +/- SD) for anxiety; 68.31 +/- 4.72 for depression; and 18.37 +/- 2.24 for sleep disturbance. Upon completion of the program, symptoms were improved, and symptom scores lower (p < 0.01): 48.26 +/- 6.47 for anxiety, 50.27 +/- 6.54 for depression, and 10.64 +/- 4.38 for sleep disturbance. Besides group training, 59 participants (48.8 %) did self-practice at least 3 times/week; 39 participants (32.2 %) did 1-2 times/week; and 23 participants (19.0 %) did none. Frequency of self-practice was associated with magnitude of symptom relief (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: MBSR may be a useful self-care tool for peri-menopausal women experiencing depressive moods. Clinical trials and follow-up studies are needed to understand the pattern of incorporating MBSR in self-management, and any long-term health effects.

TI  - Fecundability in relation to use of mobile computing apps to track the menstrual cycle
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: To what extent does the use of mobile computing apps to track the menstrual cycle and the fertile window influence fecundability among women trying to conceive?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: After adjusting for potential confounders, use of any of several different apps was associated with increased fecundability ranging from 12% to 20% per cycle of attempt.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Many women are using mobile computing apps to track their menstrual cycle and the fertile window, including while trying to conceive.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) is a North American prospective intemet-based cohort of women who are aged 21-45 years, trying to conceive and not using contraception or fertility treatment at baseline.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We restricted the analysis to 8363 women trying to conceive for no more than 6 months at baseline; the women were recruited from June 2013 through May 2019. Women completed questionnaires at baseline and every 2 months for up to I year. The main outcome was fecundability, i.e. the per-cycle probability of conception, which we assessed using self-reported data on time to pregnancy (confirmed by positive home pregnancy test) in menstrual cycles. On the baseline and follow-up questionnaires, women reported whether they used mobile computing apps to track their menstrual cycles ('cycle apps') and, if so, which one(s). We estimated fecundability ratios (FRs) for the use of cycle apps, adjusted for female age, race/ethnicity, prior pregnancy, BMI, income, current smoking, education, partner education, caffeine intake, use of hormonal contraceptives as the last method of contraception, hours of sleep per night, cycle regularity, use of prenatal supplements, marital status, intercourse frequency and history of subfertility. We also examined the impact of concurrent use of fertility indicators: basal body temperature, cervical fluid, cervix position and/or urine LH.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among 8363 women, 6077 (72.7%) were using one or more cycle apps at baseline. A total of 122 separate apps were reported by women. We designated five of these apps before analysis as more likely to be effective (aue, Fertility Friend, Glow, Kindara, Ovia; hereafter referred to as 'selected apps'). The use of any app at baseline was associated with 20% increased fecundability, with little difference between selected apps versus other apps (selected apps FR (95% CI): 1.20 (1.13, 1.28); all other apps 1.21 (1.13, 1.30)). In time-varying analyses, cycle app use was associated with 12-15% increased fecundability (selected apps FR (95% CI): 1.12 (1.04, 1.21); all other apps 1.15 (1.07, 1.24)). When apps were used at baseline with one or more fertility indicators, there was higher fecundability than without fertility indicators (selected apps with indicators FR (95% CI): 1.23 (1.14, 1.34) versus without indicators 1.17 (1.05, 1.30); other apps with indicators 1.30 (1.19, 1.43) versus without indicators 1.16 (1.06, 1.27)). In time-varying analyses, results were similar when stratified by time trying at study entry (<3 vs. 3-6 cycles) or cycle regularity. For use of the selected apps, we observed higher fecundability among women with a history of subfertility: FR 1.33 (1.05-1.67).
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Neither regularity nor intensity of app use was ascertained. The prospective time-varying assessment of app use was based on questionnaires completed every 2 months, which would not capture more frequent changes. Intercourse frequency was also reported retrospectively and we do not have data on timing of intercourse relative to the fertile window. Although we controlled for a wide range of covariates, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding (e.g. choosing to use an app in this observational study may be a marker for unmeasured health habits promoting fecundability). Half of the women in the study received a free premium subscription for one of the apps (Fertility Friend), which may have increased the overall prevalence of app use in the time-varying analyses, but would not affect app use at baseline. Most women in the study were college educated, which may limit application of results to other populations.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Use of a cycle app, especially in combination with observation of one or more fertility indicators (basal body temperature, cervical fluid, cervix position and/or urine LH), may increase fecundability (per-cycle pregnancy probability) by about 12-20% for couples trying to conceive. We did not find consistent evidence of improved fecundability resulting from use of one specific app over another.

TI  - Melatonin as a Potential Prophylactic Therapy for Menstrual-Related Migraine Headache: A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - ARCHIVES OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Migraine is a common disabling and chronic neurological disorder affecting women aged 25-55 with a considerably higher frequency. It has been shown that migraine attack rates change according to the hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. A study showed that reduced progesterone levels, especially during the end days of the luteal phase and menstruation, are associated with increased episodes of attacks in more than half of the migraine patients. Moreover, another study suggested that the melatonin level changes are positively correlated with the progesterone blood level. Previous studies indicated that the level of nocturnal urinary melatonin is lower in patients with menstrual-related migraine than in healthy subjects.
   Objectives: Considering the potential role of melatonin in the circadian system and its relationship with gonadal steroid blood level changes in patients, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin in patients with menstrual-related migraines.
   Methods: An open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted (IR code: IRCT20121110011424N4). Patients with menstrual-related migraine referring to the Neurology Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital were evaluated and randomly assigned to either naproxen (250 mg every 12 hours) or melatonin (3 mg, half an hour before sleep) treatment groups. At the end of the first and third menstrual bleeding phases, the patients were assessed by a migraine diary, Visual Analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the Berlin questionnaire.
   Results: The study evaluated 56 patients (26 in the melatonin arm and 30 in the naproxen arm). Attack days (P < 0.0 01) and the headache severity (P < 0.001) improved in both groups compared to baseline. A significant difference was found between the melatonin and naproxen treatment groups in sedative and analgesic drug use (P < 0.05). Also, melatonin significantly changed the snoring rate and post-sleep tiredness compared to baseline (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively) whereas no improvement was observed in the naproxen treatment group concerning the sleep quality.
   Conclusions: We showed the beneficial role of melatonin in reducing the attack frequency and severity in migraine patients with menstrual-related headaches. Preventive therapy with melatonin also showed a significant reduction in the number of sedative drug use during attacks and improved the patients' sleep quality when compared to naproxen.

TI  - Frequent epileptic apnoea in a patient with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome
T2  - EPILEPTIC DISORDERS
AB  - Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is a rare genetic disease, characterised by severe intellectual disability, distinctive dysmorphic features, epilepsy and distinctive breathing abnormalities during wakefulness. Here, we describe the case of a 22-year-old woman with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome who presented with intractable generalised tonic seizures from the age of 11 years, which increased in frequency with age and onset of menstruation despite usage of some anticonvulsant drugs. From the age of 16 years, polysomnography and video-EEG led to the detection of frequent epileptic apnoea during sleep. Although the frequency of generalised tonic seizure clusters was reduced by treatment with phenobarbital and potassium bromide, epileptic apnoea persisted. Furthermore, frequent epileptic apnoea observed in our patient was regarded as a factor for aspiration and deterioration of respiratory function. This study indicates that patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome require close monitoring for epileptic apnoea. Moreover, long-term EEG and respiratory monitoring are necessary to distinguish epileptic apnoea from other respiratory disorders in patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome.

TI  - The association between weight-promoting medication use and weight gain in postmenopausal women: findings from the Women's Health Initiative
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: With the rise in obesity, there has been a concomitant increase in prescription medications associated with weight gain. The objective of this study is to quantify the magnitude of association between putative weight-promoting medications and 3-year weight change in a diverse cohort of postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).
   Methods: This is a prospective observational cohort study, considering 40 sites in the WHI and a cohort of seventy six thousand two hundred fifty-two postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years, with weight measured at both baseline and 3 years, in the WHI-Observational Study. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were measured at baseline and 3 years. An in-clinic medication inventory identified prescribed medications, including antidepressants, beta-blockers, insulin, and/or glucocorticosteroids. Generalized linear models evaluated if intermittent or persistent use of weight-promoting drugs was associated with increased BMI and WC during a 3-year follow up.
   Results: Women with overweight or obesity at baseline were more likely to be taking antidepressants, beta-blockers, and/or insulin. Taking at least one putative weight-promoting medication was associated with a greater increase in BMI (0.37 vs 0.27 kg/m(2), P = 0.0045) and WC (1.10 cm vs 0.89 cm, P = 0.0077) over the course of 3 years compared to women not on these medications. Both BMI and WC increased with the number of weight-promoting drugs prescribed (P for trend per medication used < 0.00001 for both variables). Those who took either antidepressants or insulin, or a combination of antidepressants and beta-blockers, were most likely to have a significant increase in BMI compared to nonusers.
   Conclusions: Antidepressants, beta-blockers, and insulin were associated with weight gain in postmenopausal women. This information may help to inform clinical decision-making and efforts to mitigate medication-related weight gain.

TI  - Potential Role of Lycopene in the Prevention of Postmenopausal Bone Loss: Evidence from Molecular to Clinical Studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by reduced bone mineral density, which affects the quality of life of the aging population. Furthermore, disruption of bone microarchitecture and the alteration of non-collagenous protein in bones lead to higher fracture risk. This is most common in postmenopausal women. Certain medications are being used for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, these may be accompanied by undesirable side effects. Phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables are a source of micronutrients for the maintenance of bone health. Among them, lycopene has recently been shown to have a potential protective effect against bone loss. Lycopene is a lipid-soluble carotenoid that exists in both all-trans and cis-configurations in nature. Tomato and tomato products are rich sources of lycopene. Several human epidemiological studies, supplemented by in vivo and in vitro studies, have shown decreased bone loss following the consumption of lycopene/tomato. However, there are still limited studies that have evaluated the effect of lycopene on the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the relevant literature on the potential impact of lycopene on postmenopausal bone loss with molecular and clinical evidence, including an overview of bone biology and the pathophysiology of osteoporosis.

TI  - Interpreting Morphological Adaptations Associated with Viviparity in the Tsetse Fly Glossina morsitans (Westwood) by Three-Dimensional Analysis
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary
   Tsetse flies, the sole transmitters of African Sleeping Sickness parasites, have a unique reproductive biology. They only develop one offspring at a time, they carry that offspring in their uterus for its entire immature development and provide nourishment for that offspring via milk-like secretions. This specialized reproductive biology has required dramatic modifications to the morphology of the reproductive organs in these and related flies. Here, we use phase contrast micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) to visualize these adaptations in three dimensions for the first time. These adaptations include cuticular modifications allowing increased abdominal volume, expanded abdominal and uterine musculature, reduced egg development capacity, structural features of the male seminal secretions and detailed visualization of the gland responsible for synthesis and secretion of "milk" to feed intrauterine larvae. The ability to examine these tissues within the context of the rest of the organ systems in the fly provides new functional insights into how these changes have facilitated the evolution of the mating and reproductive biology of these flies.
   Tsetse flies (genus Glossina), the sole vectors of African trypanosomiasis, are distinct from most other insects, due to dramatic morphological and physiological adaptations required to support their unique biology. These adaptations are driven by demands associated with obligate hematophagy and viviparous reproduction. Obligate viviparity entails intrauterine larval development and the provision of maternal nutrients for the developing larvae. The reduced reproductive capacity/rate associated with this biology results in increased inter- and intra-sexual competition. Here, we use phase contrast microcomputed tomography (pcMicroCT) to analyze morphological adaptations associated with viviparous biology. These include (1) modifications facilitating abdominal distention required during blood feeding and pregnancy, (2) abdominal and uterine musculature adaptations for gestation and parturition of developed larvae, (3) reduced ovarian structure and capacity, (4) structural features of the male-derived spermatophore optimizing semen/sperm delivery and inhibition of insemination by competing males and (5) structural features of the milk gland facilitating nutrient incorporation and transfer into the uterus. Three-dimensional analysis of these features provides unprecedented opportunities for examination and discovery of internal morphological features not possible with traditional microscopy techniques and provides new opportunities for comparative morphological analyses over time and between species.

TI  - Therapeutic Effects of Citrus aurantium Components on Psychological States: A Systematic Review
T2  - CRESCENT JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objectives: Citrus aurantium L., frequently known as the sour or bitter orange, is native to Asia and, nowadays, is widely cultivated in different regions such as the Mediterranean. Different parts of C. aurantium are consumed as an alternative medicine in some areas to treat some diseases, and various recent studies have proven the potential of this medicinal plant. This review examined the therapeutic effects of C. aurantium components.
   Methods: Tactful and progressive search strategies were developed to determine the studies. To this end, a large number of databases were evaluated, including Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar (2010 to April 2019). Finally, 12 clinical trial studies were selected for evaluation and analysis, and the JADAD scale was used to evaluate the quality of the papers.
   Results: Of 546 papers found in the preliminary search, 12 clinical trials (1132 participants), which were written in English, were selected for structured reviews. The researches consisted of those which evaluated the therapeutic role of the plants in anxiety, depression, sleep quality, premenstrual syndrome, and menopausal symptoms.
   Conclusions: The review of clinical trials brings some evidence that different components of C. aurantium, especially its flower have therapeutic effects on particularly psychological states like anxiety, depression, and insomnia and aromatherapy by the essential oil is considered as the most used method of prescription. Therefore, C. aurantium can confidently be used in various disorders which have these psychological aspects among their symptoms.

TI  - Relationship between Symptoms in Women with Endometriosis and Lifestyles: a Qualitative Interview Study
T2  - EUROBIOTECH JOURNAL
AB  - Endometriosis is a common condition that affects reproductive-aged women and is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity with nodules and lesions. The study aimed to analyze lifestyles of women affected by endometriosis in relation with their symptoms. In this observational study, 735 Italian women have been interviewed online through a questionnaire structured in two parts. The first part was mainly anamnestic, focused on gathering information about the age, the stage of disease, comorbidities, involved organs, symptomatology, chirurgical treatment, induced menopause. The second part focused on the individual characteristics and lifestyle of the patients such as the body mass index, physical activity, quality of sleep, and the diet. The results showed how a healthy diet and a regular physical activity reduce drastically the symptoms of the patients.

TI  - Persistent Night Sweats: Diagnostic Evaluation
T2  - AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
AB  - Night sweats are a nonspecific symptom that patients commonly experience but rarely discuss with their physicians without prompting. Although many life-threatening causes such as malignancies or infections have been described, most patients who report persistent night sweats in the primary care setting do not have a serious underlying disorder. Conditions commonly associated with night sweats include menopause, mood disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperthyroidism, and obesity. If a clinical diagnosis is apparent based on the initial history and physical examination, specific treatment for four to eight weeks may be offered. When the history and physical examination do not reveal a specific cause, physicians should proceed with a systematic and cost-conscious strategy that uses readily available laboratory and imaging studies, such as a complete blood count, tuberculosis testing, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, HIV testing, C-reactive protein level, and chest radiography. Additional tests that could be considered selectively include computed tomography of the chest and/or abdomen, bone marrow biopsy, polysomnography, and/or additional laboratory studies if indicated. If these results are normal, and no additional disorders are suspected, reassurance and continued monitoring are recommended. The presence of night sweats alone does not indicate an increased risk of death. Copyright (C) 2020 American Academy of Family Physicians.

TI  - Comparison of various menopausal symptoms and risk factor analysis in Korean women according to stage of menopause
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and their related risk factors among middle-aged Korean women according to their reproductive stages.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 3039 Korean women, aged 45-65 years, who attended their routine health checkup. Their scores from the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were compared and participants were categorized into four groups according to stage of menopause: premenopause, early menopause (<= 2 years from their last menstruation), mid-menopause (2-8 years), and late menopause (> 8 years).
   Results: The mean age of the participants was 52.81 +/- 5.39 years, and 98.5 % of them reported one or more symptoms included in the MRS. The most common symptom was physical/mental exhaustion, experienced by 86.7 % of participants. The prevalence of moderate to severe symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, heart discomfort, sleep problems, sexual problems, vaginal dryness, and joint/muscular discomfort, increased in the early menopausal period. This increased in the late menopausal period compared with its prevalence at premenopause. The prevalence of moderate to severe psychological symptoms, heart discomfort, and sleep problems followed a U-shaped trend after menopause: high at early menopause, low at mid-menopause, and high again at late menopause. A low level of physical exercise was an independent risk factor for a high total MRS score; however, the menopausal stages, age, and weight were also variously associated with menopausal symptoms.
   Conclusions: Several menopausal symptoms remain severe, or are aggravated, until the late menopausal period among Korean women. More attention is warranted to manage these symptoms in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Manual acupuncture versus sham acupuncture and usual care for the prevention of primary dysmenorrhea (PD): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - BackgroundPrimary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a leading cause of dysmenorrhea among adolescent girls. Manual acupuncture may be considered as an effective treatment for PD, but high-quality evidence remains limited. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the prevention of PD as compared with sham acupuncture and usual care.Methods/designThis is a three-arm, randomized, controlled clinical trial in which the patients, assessors, and statisticians will be blinded. A total of 300 acupuncture-naive patients who were diagnosed as PD will be randomly allocated to the verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or usual care groups in a 2:2:1 ratio. Patients in the verum acupuncture group will receive manual acupuncture at specific acupuncture points with penetrating needling, while those in the sham acupuncture group will receive non-penetrating needling at non-acupuncture points. They will be given five sessions over a menstrual cycle for 3 menstrual cycles. Patients in the usual care group will receive health education and informed to receive manual acupuncture for free after waiting for 7 menstrual cycles. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline in the Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale Score (CMSS). The secondary outcomes will be the changes in Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS), visual analog scale (VAS), Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI- II), Acupuncture Expectancy Scale (AES), 60-item NEO Personality Inventory-Short Form (NEO-FFI), and acute medication intake. The adverse events will be recorded at every visit. The analyses will be performed base on a full analysis set (FAS) and a per-protocol set (PPS).DiscussionThis study may provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of manual acupuncture for PD. In addition, the results of this study will help to identify the efficacy of acupuncture due to the specific effects of acupuncture or placebo effects of acupuncture ritual.Trial registrationClinical Trials.gov NCT02783534.

TI  - Prevalence, risk factors, and trajectories of sleep disturbance in a cohort of African-American breast cancer survivors
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
AB  - Purpose Sleep disturbance may be an overlooked modifiable risk factor for health disparities among African-American breast cancer survivors (AABCS). This study aimed to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for sleep disturbance in a cohort of AABCS. Methods The study was conducted among participants in the Women's Circle of Health Follow-up Study, a longitudinal study of breast cancer in 10 counties in New Jersey. Cases were identified shortly after diagnosis by the New Jersey State Cancer Registry. Self-reported sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and other factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, menopausal status) were assessed at pre-diagnosis (n= 637), 10 months post-diagnosis (n= 261), and 24 months post-diagnosis (n= 632). Clinical data were obtained via medical record abstraction, and height and weight were measured by study staff. Results Most AABCS (57%) reported clinically significant sleep disturbance before diagnosis, and this rate remained largely unchanged at 10 months (53%) and 24 months post-diagnosis (61%). Average sleep disturbance scores indicated clinically significant disturbance at all three assessments (Mrange = 6.67-7.57). Most reported sleeping fewer than the recommended 7 hours per night at each assessment (range 57-65%). Risk factors for sleep disturbance were identified at each assessment, including pre-diagnosis (less education), 10 months post-diagnosis (lack of insurance, treatment with chemotherapy), and 24 months post-diagnosis (younger age, less education, lower income, obesity, and lymphedema). Treatment with endocrine therapy was a protective factor at 10 months post-diagnosis. Conclusion Most AABCS report clinically significant sleep disturbance from before diagnosis through 24 months post-diagnosis. These rates appear indicate AABCS experience significant sleep-related disparities.

TI  - Gender differences in adolescent sleep neurophysiology: a high-density sleep EEG study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - During adolescence, differences between males and females in physiology, behavior and risk for psychopathology are accentuated. The goal of the current study was to examine gender differences in sleep neurophysiology using high-density sleep EEG in early adolescence. We examined gender differences in sleep EEG power and coherence across frequency bands for both NREM and REM sleep in a sample of 61 adolescents (31 girls and 30 boys; mean age = 12.48; SD = 1.34). In addition, sleep spindles were individually detected and characterized. Compared to boys, girls had significantly greater spindle activity, as reflected in higher NREM sigma power, spindle amplitude, spindle frequency and spindle density over widespread regions. Furthermore, power in higher frequency bands (16.2-44 Hz) was larger in girls than boys in a state independent manner. Oscillatory activity across frequency bands and sleep states was generally more coherent in females as compared to males, suggesting greater connectivity in females. An exception to this finding was the alpha band during NREM and REM sleep, where coherence was higher (NREM) or not different (REM) in boys compared to girls. Sleep spindles are generated through thalamocortical circuits, and thus, the greater spindle activity across regions in females may represent a stronger thalamocortical circuit in adolescent females as compared to males. Moreover, greater global connectivity in females may reflect functional brain differences with implications for cognition and mental health. Given the pronounced gender differences, our study highlights the importance of taking gender into account when designing and interpreting studies of sleep neurophysiology.

TI  - Relationship between premenstrual syndrome and sleep quality among nursing and medical students
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN PSYCHIATRIC CARE
AB  - Purpose This study was performed to determine relationship between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and sleep quality among nursing and medical students. Design and Methods This descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study was completed with 313 students attending the nursing department and medical faculty. Data were collected using the premenstrual syndrome scale (PMSS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Findings The PSQI was positively correlated with PMSS and its subscales scores. Sleep changes were the strongest predictor, followed by depressive thoughts (p < .01), depressive mood, bloating and total PMSS (p < .05) for sleep quality. Practice Implications Training should be organized about PMS for university students to provide information and skills about managing symptoms, and to increase the awareness about this syndrome. Interventional studies should be planned to increase sleep quality in PMS.

TI  - Internet addiction belief, but not Internet use time, is independently associated with menstrual pain severity and interference to social life among adolescents. a cross-sectional study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PAIN
AB  - Introduction: Problematic Internet use is a serious health issue for modern adolescents who have developed and matured in a global Internet environment. This study aimed to examine whether Internet use time and Internet addiction beliefs were independently associated with menstrual pain severity and its interference among Japanese adolescents.
   Methods: We recruited 1166 adolescents at two high schools to complete questionnaires on Internet use and menstrual pain. The explanatory variable was self-reported average Internet use time per day and Internet addiction beliefs ('none' (reference) 'somewhat', 'moderate' and 'severe'). The outcome variables were moderate-to-severe menstrual pain and interference. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) for moderate-to-severe menstrual pain and interference. Adjustment variables were age, body mass index, belonging to a community or school sports club, sleep duration and Internet addiction beliefs/Internet use time.
   Results: Internet addiction belief, but not Internet use time, was independently associated with menstrual pain severity and interference to social life in a dose-response manner. ORs (95% Cls) of moderate-to-severe menstrual pain for slight, moderate and severe Internet addition beliefs were 1.43 (1.02-1.99), 1.89 (1.31-2.74) and 1.88 (1.10-3.23), respectively. ORs of moderate-to-severe disability due to menstrual pain for slight, moderate and severe Internet addition beliefs were 1.25 (0.75-1.82), 1.72 (1.01-2.92) and 2.21 (1.11-4.40), respectively, after adjusting for average Internet use time.
   Conclusion: Internet addiction belief was associated with higher prevalence of moderate-to-severe menstrual pain among adolescents, beyond the variance accounted for by Internet use time.

TI  - Sleep deficiency and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women in the California teachers study (CTS)
T2  - CANCER CAUSES & CONTROL
AB  - Purpose There is provocative, yet inconsistent, evidence that sleep deficiency may influence the development of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with sleep deficiency among postmenopausal women in the California Teachers Study (CTS). Methods We conducted a case-control study of 2,856 invasive breast cancer cases and 38,649 cancer-free controls, nested within the CTS. Self-administered questionnaires were used to ascertain several components of sleep deficiency, including quality, latency, duration, disturbance and use of sleep medications. Additionally, a Global Sleep Index (GSI) was created by summing the individual sleep components and categorizing into quartiles. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI). Results Increased breast cancer risks were associated with sleep deficiency. With the exception of duration, linear increases in risk were associated with all the other individual components of sleep deficiency (p-trend <= 0.002). The OR for the highest GSI quartile vs. lowest was 1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.38;p-trend < 0.001). Conclusions Sleep deficiency may be a risk factor for breast cancer. Additional prospective studies and those aimed at elucidating underlying mechanism are warranted.

TI  - Quiet Sleep Organization of Very Preterm Infants Is Correlated With Postnatal Maturation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background:Sleep is an important determinant of brain development in preterm infants. Its temporal organization varies with gestational age (GA) and post-menstrual age (PMA) but little is known about how sleep develops in very preterm infants. The objective was to study the correlation between the temporal organization of quiet sleep (QS) and maturation in premature infants without severe complications during their neonatal hospitalization. Methods:Percentage of time spent in QS and average duration of time intervals (ADI) spent in QS were analyzed from a cohort of newborns with no severe complications included in the Digi-NewB prospective, multicentric, observational study in 2017-19. Three groups were analyzed according to GA: Group 1 (27-30 weeks), Group 2 (33-37 weeks), Group 3 (>39 weeks). Two 8-h video recordings were acquired in groups 1 and 2: after birth (T1) and before discharge from hospital (T2). The annotation of the QS phases was performed by analyzing video recordings together with heart rate and respiratory traces thanks to a dedicated software tool of visualization and annotation of multimodal long-time recordings, with a double expert reading. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR). Correlations were analyzed using a linear mixed model. Results:Five newborns were studied in each group (160 h of recording). Median time spent in QS increased from 13.0% [IQR: 13-20] to 28.8% [IQR: 27-30] and from 17.0% [IQR: 15-21] to 29.6% [IQR: 29.5-31.5] in Group 1 and 2, respectively. Median ADI increased from 54 [IQR: 53-54] to 288 s [IQR: 279-428] and from 90 [IQR: 84-96] to 258 s [IQR: 168-312] in Group 1 and 2. Both groups reach values similar to that of group 3, respectively 28.2% [IQR: 24.5-31.3] and 270 s [IQR: 210-402]. The correlation between PMA and time spent in QS or ADI were, respectively 0.73 (p< 10(-4)) and 0.46 (p= 0.06). Multilinear analysis using temporal organization of QS gave an accurate estimate of PMA (r(2)= 0.87,p< 0.001). Conclusion:The temporal organization of QS is correlated with PMA in newborns without severe complication. An automated standardized continuous behavioral quantification of QS could be interesting to monitor during the hospitalization stay in neonatal units.

TI  - Assessment of side effects after serial intralesional steroid injections for idiopathic subglottic stenosis
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
AB  - Purpose To assess the incidence and severity of 12 systemic side effects of serial intralesional steroid injections (SILSI) in patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS). Methods This retrospective study included patients with iSGS who underwent SILSI with Triamcinolone 40 mg/dL. After SILSI, the patients were asked to answer 12 questions regarding frequently encountered systemic side effects of steroids. Each answer was rated as mild, moderate, or severe. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and present the findings. Results The study included 49 patients (42 female and 7 male) with a mean age of 59.1 years (range 21-83 years). Post-SILSI treatment, 27 (55%) reported experiencing side effects while 22 (45%) patients reported no side effects. The most frequent side effect reported in women of reproductive age (n: 8) was menstrual irregularities (3/8, 37%). Other frequently reported side effects were feeling joyful and sleeping difficulties, each reported by 30% of the patients. All side effects resolved after the completion of SILSI. Conclusions SILSI can be administered with minimal tolerable side effects. Clinicians should make their patients aware of the most frequent side effects. Special attention should be given to women of reproductive age to inform them of the possibility of menstrual irregularities during SILSI.

TI  - A Review of Advancement on Influencing Factors of Acne: An Emphasis on Environment Characteristics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background:Acne vulgaris is known as a commonly-seen skin disease with a considerable impact on the quality of life. At present, there have been a growing number of epidemiological, medical, demographic and sociological researches focusing on various influencing factors in the occurrence of acne. Nevertheless, the correlation between environmental factors and acne has yet to be fully investigated. Objective:To assess the impacts of individual, natural and social environmental factors on acne and to construct a framework for the potential impact of built environment on acne. Methods:A thorough review was conducted into the published social demographical, epidemiological, and environmental studies on acne through PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science, with reference made to the relevant literature. Results:The influencing factors in acne are classed into four major categories. The first one includes individual socio-economic and biological factors, for example, gender, age, economic level, heredity, obesity, skin type, menstrual cycle (for females), diet, smoking, cosmetics products, electronic products, sleep quality and psychological factors. The second one includes such natural environmental factors as temperature, humidity, sun exposure, air pollution and chloracne. The third one relates to social environment, including social network and social media. The last one includes built environmental factors, for example, population density, food stores, green spaces, as well as other built environment characteristics for transport. Acne can be affected negatively by family history, overweight, obesity, oily or mixed skin, irregular menstrual cycles, sugary food, greasy food, dairy products, smoking, the improper use of cosmetics, the long-term use of electronics, the poor quality of sleep, stress, high temperature, sun exposure, air pollution, mineral oils and halogenated hydrocarbons. Apart from that, there are also potential links between built environment and acne. Conclusions:It is necessary to determine the correlation between the built environment and acne based on the understanding of the impact of traditional factors (sociology of population and environment) on acne gained by multidisciplinary research teams. Moreover, more empirical studies are required to reveal the specific relationship between built environment and acne.

TI  - Higher poultry consumption was associated with an earlier age at menarche
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - Aim To examine the association between meat consumption and earlier age of menarche among schoolgirls in Shanghai. Methods The study randomly selected 1981 schoolgirls aged 6-18 years in Shanghai using a two-stage random sampling design. Information on meat intake was collected using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Menarche age, household income, physical activity and other covariates were obtained by standardised questionnaires. Logistic regression was used to analyse the association between intake of meat and earlier age of menarche. Earlier age of menarche was defined as first menstruation before 12 years of age. Results Among the 986 girls who had experienced menarche, 518/986 (52.5%) had earlier age of menarche. After adjusting for body mass index, age, physical activity, sleep, household income and parental education, consumption of poultry was positively associated with risk of earlier age of menarche (P-trend = .03). Girls who never consumed poultry had a lower risk of earlier age of menarche (odds ratio [OR]: 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.96). Neither the consumption of pork, beef, lamb, processed meat nor total meat consumption was associated with menarche age. Conclusion Higher consumption of poultry was associated with an earlier age at menarche.

Although menopausal hormone therapy is the most effective treatment, many women prefer non-pharmacological treatments, such as physical activity. The effectiveness of physical activity has been inconclusive when assessed by randomised controlled trials, and it remains unclear how women feel about it as a possible treatment approach. The aim of the study was to explore symptomatic menopausal women's views and experiences of physical activity as a treatment for vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms.MethodsAn in-depth qualitative study was embedded within a randomised controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness of physical activity as a treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms in previously inactive vasomotor symptomatic women. Participants were randomised to one of two physical activity interventions or a usual care group. Both physical activity interventions involved two one-to-one consultations, plus either supporting materials or access to physical activity support groups, over 6 months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 purposively selected participants from all three trial groups after they had completed trial follow-up. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed by constant comparison.ResultsAll participants talked positively about physical activity as a treatment for their menopausal symptoms, with most reporting participation had improved their hot flushes and night sweats. They reported that they had experienced improved sleep, physical health and psychological well-being. Those who received the physical activity plus social-support intervention reported their ability to cope with their menopausal symptoms had improved. Many participants commented that they would prefer doctors to discuss physical activity as a possible treatment for their hot flushes and night sweats, before offering medication.ConclusionsBased on the views and experiences of the women who participated in this study, healthcare professionals should continue discussing physical activity as a potential first treatment option with menopausal women. Furthermore, healthcare professionals should ensure they prepare, support, and encourage these women both physically and emotionally.Trial registrationISRCTN ISRCTN06495625 Registered 10/11/2010

TI  - Phase-amplitude coupling of delta brush unveiling neuronal modulation development in the neonatal brain
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB  - Introduction: Delta brushes are an indicator of brain maturity on a neonatal EEG. We investigated phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between slow delta waves and superimposed alpha-beta activity in delta brushes to elucidate the spatiotemporal developments of the delta brush with post-menstrual weeks (PMW).
   Methods: The subjects were 18 neurologically intact patients (seven girls). We analyzed EEG within 42 PMW. Patients were divided into four age groups as follows: PMW <= 30w; 31-34 w; 35-38 w; and 39-42 w. We selected up to three epochs of 2-minute EEG segments including delta brushes. We calculated the modulation index (MI), direct mean vector length (dMVL), and mean of phase angle of coupling by PAC between slow waves (0.5-1.5 Hz) and fast activities (8-25 Hz) in four regions (F: Fp1 and Fp2, C: C3 and C4, T: T3 and T4, O: O1 and O2).
   Results: We collected data from 18 patients and 31 epochs between 29 and 42 PMW, which comprised one, four, five, and eight patients, and two, seven, eight, and 14 epochs in the <= 30w, 31-34 w, 35-38 w, and 39-42 w groups, respectively. There were significant differences in the dMVL between the four regions in age groups <= 30w (P = 0.033) and 31-34w (0.017). Both MI and dMVL showed that delta brushes became higher in the occipital region from 32 to 36 PMW. The mean phase angle of coupling concentrated around either 0 degrees or 180 degrees for all age groups.
   Conclusions: PAC analysis revealed the spatiotemporal relations of alpha-beta activities that are modulated by slow delta waves in neonatal delta brushes. The delta brushes appeared to be at a maximum around 32-36 PMW with the predominant occipital distribution. The PAC of the delta brush might represent the cortical neuronal fast activity that is modulated by slow delta waves of subcortical regions during a particular neonatal period.

TI  - The influence of socioeconomic status on menarcheal age among Chinese school-age girls in Tianjin, China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - The association between socioeconomic status and the onset age of menarche is still not conclusive. This cross-sectional study was conducted among primary and middle school girls aged 7 to 16 years old in Tianjin, China, to explore the distribution of menarcheal age and its association with socioeconomic status. A self-designed structured questionnaire was completed by students and their parents to collect information on socioeconomic status (i.e., family income, parental education level, living residence), menarcheal status, and covariates (weight status of girls and their parents, sleeping hours per day, physical activity). Information on menarcheal status included whether or not menarche had occurred (Yes/No) and the exact age at menarche. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the association between socioeconomic status and menarcheal age before and after covariate adjustment. Among 1485 eligible girls with complete information, 445 had experienced menarche, with an overall menarche rate of 30%. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 years (95% confidence interval 12.8-13.0). Urban girls experienced menarche earlier than rural girls did (12.1 years vs. 13.5 years). Univariate analysis showed that urban residence and higher parental education were associated with earlier onset of menarche. After covariate adjustment, the significance still existed. However, after adjusting further for residence, the significant association with the parental education disappeared. Only urban residence was still significantly associated, even after further adjustment for parental education and family income, with adjusted regression coefficients (95% confidence interval) of - 1.087 (- 1.340,-0.834), indicating that the onset age of menarche among urban girls was 1.087 years (0.834, 1.340) younger than that among rural girls. Family income was not related to the onset age of menarche in any analyses.
   Conclusion: Urban-rural differences played a more important role in the early onset of menarche than socioeconomic differences between families.
   What is Known:
   center dot The age at menarche varies by race and country, but the global trend is towards earlier onset as a result of changes in nutrition, family structure, socioeconomic status, and physical condition.
   What is New:
   center dot Urban girls experienced menarche earlier than rural girls, but this urban-rural difference could not be explained by family income, parental education, weight status of the participants and their parents, participants' physical exercise and sleeping hours.
   center dot Higher parental education was associated with earlier onset of menarche, but this association disappeared after adjustment for living residence.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Risk for Incident Vertebral and Hip Fracture in Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH
AB  - Recent studies suggest a positive association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a disorder associated with intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, and derangements in bone metabolism. However, no prospective study to date has investigated the association between OSA and fracture risk in women. We conducted a prospective study examining the relation between OSA and risk of incident vertebral fracture (VF) and hip fracture (HF) in the Nurses' Health Study. History of physician-diagnosed OSA was assessed by self-reported questionnaires. A previous validation study demonstrated high concordance between self-reports and medical record identification of OSA. OSA severity was further categorized according to the presence or absence of self-reported sleepiness. Self-reports of VF were confirmed by medical record review. Self-reported HF was assessed by biennial questionnaires. Cox proportional-hazards models estimated the hazard ratio for fracture according to OSA status, adjusted for potential confounders, including BMI, physical activity, calcium intake, history of osteoporosis, and falls, and use of sleep medications. Among 55,264 women without prior history of fracture, physician-diagnosed OSA was self-reported in 1.3% in 2002 and increased to 3.3% by 2012. Between 2002 and 2014, 461 incident VF cases and 921 incident HF cases were documented. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for confirmed VF for women with history of OSA was 2.00 (95% CI, 1.29-3.12) compared with no OSA history, with the strongest association observed for OSA with daytime sleepiness (HR 2.86; 95% CI, 1.31-6.21). No association was observed between OSA history and self-reported HF risk (HR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.49-1.43). History of OSA is independently associated with higher risk of confirmed VF but did not have a statistically significant association with self-reported HF in women. Further research is warranted in understanding the role of OSA and intermittent hypoxia in bone metabolism and health that may differ by fracture site.

TI  - An atlas on risk factors for type 2 diabetes: a wide-angled Mendelian randomisation study
T2  - DIABETOLOGIA
AB  - Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomisation (MR) to identify the causal risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
   Methods We first conducted a review of meta-analyses and review articles to pinpoint possible risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Around 170 possible risk factors were identified of which 97 risk factors with available genetic instrumental variables were included in MR analyses. To reveal more risk factors that were not included in our MR analyses, we conducted a review of published MR studies of type 2 diabetes. For our MR analyses, we used summary-level data from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis consortium (74,124 type 2 diabetes cases and 824,006 controls of European ancestry). Potential causal associations were replicated using the FinnGen consortium (11,006 type 2 diabetes cases and 82,655 controls of European ancestry). The inverse-variance weighted method was used as the main analysis. Multivariable MR analysis was used to assess whether the observed associations with type 2 diabetes were mediated by BMI. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method that controls false discovery rate for multiple testing.
   Results We found evidence of causal associations between 34 exposures (19 risk factors and 15 protective factors) and type 2 diabetes. Insomnia was identified as a novel risk factor (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.11, 1.23]). The other 18 risk factors were depression, systolic BP, smoking initiation, lifetime smoking, coffee (caffeine) consumption, plasma isoleucine, valine and leucine, liver alanine aminotransferase, childhood and adulthood BMI, body fat percentage, visceral fat mass, resting heart rate, and four plasma fatty acids. The 15 exposures associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes were plasma alanine, HDL- and total cholesterol, age at menarche, testosterone levels, sex hormone binding globulin levels (adjusted for BMI), birthweight, adulthood height, lean body mass (for women), four plasma fatty acids, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and education years. Eight associations remained after adjustment for adulthood BMI. We additionally identified 21 suggestive risk factors (p < 0.05), such as alcohol consumption, breakfast skipping, daytime napping, short sleep, urinary sodium, and certain amino acids and inflammatory factors.
   Conclusions/interpretation The present study verified several previously reported risk factors and identified novel potential risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes should be considered from multiple perspectives on obesity, mental health, sleep quality, education level, birthweight and smoking.

TI  - Efficacy of Lobisio pumila and Eurycomo longifolia standardised extracts on hot flushes, quality of life, hormone and lipid profile of peri-menopausal and menopausal women: a randomised, placebo-controlled study
T2  - FOOD & NUTRITION RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Interest in herbal medicines and non-hormonal therapies for the treatment of menopausal symptoms has increased since the publication of adverse effects of estrogen replacement therapy. Vasomotor symptoms are the most characteristic and notable symptoms of menopause.
   Objective: To investigate the changes in the frequency and severity of hot flush and associated vasomotor symptoms experienced by pefi-menopausal and menopausal women supplemented with the herbal formulation (Nu-femme (TM)) comprising Labisia pumila (SLE+(R)) and Eurycoma longifolia (Physta (R)) or placebo.
   Design: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week study enrolled 119 healthy women aged 41-55 years experiencing peri-menopausal or menopausal symptoms and supplemented with Nufemme (TM) or placebo. The primary endpoint was comparative changes between treatment groups in the change in the frequency and severity of hot flushes. The secondary objectives were to assess the changes in the frequency and severity of joint pain, Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire domain scores. Concentrations of serum hormone, lipid profile, bone markers, sleep quality and vitality were also studied as secondary objectives.
   Results: At week 12, significant (P < 0.01) improvements in hot flush symptoms were observed in Nu-femme (TM) and placebo groups. Even though there was no significant difference between groups, higher percentage of improvement, 65%, was seen in Nu-femme"' compared to 60% in placebo. Significant improvements (P < 0.001) in MRS and MENQOL scores at weeks 12 and 24 were observed in both groups, respectively. Luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) at weeks 12 and 24, respectively, compared to baseline in the Nu-femme (TM) group, with no significant changes observed in the placebo group. There were significant (P < 0.05) reductions in serum low-density lipid and triglycerides levels at week 12 in Nu-femme (TM) group, but no changes seen in placebo group. At the end of week 24, changes in haematology and clinical chemistry parameters remained within normal clinical ranges in both groups.
   Conclusion: Herbal formulation consists of L. pumila and E. longifolia (Nu-femme (TM)) may support reduction in hot flushes and improvements in hormone and lipid profile in healthy peri-menopausal and menopausal women.

TI  - The epidemiology of hidradenitis suppurativa
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease defined clinically by multiple, painful inflammatory lesions occurring predominantly in flexural sites. Onset is typically soon after puberty; however, it remains unknown whether the menopause induces remission. In North American and European patients with HS the female-to-male ratio is approximately 3 : 1 but the ratio is 1 : 2 in South Korean patients. It may be that some elements of HS epidemiology cannot be generalized across all populations. Elements of HS epidemiology in the USA and Europe are well established, including strong associations with obesity and smoking, which may increase disease severity. There are associations between HS and other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. People with HS have double the risk of death from CVD compared with those without HS and 1 center dot 5 times the risk compared with patients with psoriasis. Depression and anxiety are associated with HS and completed suicide rates in those with HS are more than double the rates in controls. Associations exist between HS and other chronic inflammatory conditions, particularly inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis. Case-control studies demonstrate associations with pilonidal sinus, polycystic ovary syndrome, Down syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea and pyoderma gangrenosum. Population-based studies using routinely collected healthcare data from the USA estimate a prevalence of 0 center dot 1%, suggesting HS is relatively uncommon. European studies include undiagnosed patients and typically estimate prevalence of 1% or more, suggesting a common condition. Resolving the controversy surrounding a greater than 10-fold difference in HS prevalence estimates remains a high priority.

TI  - Acute and chronic effects of combined exercise on ambulatory blood pressure and its variability in hypertensive postmenopausal women
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effects, and their correlation, after combined aerobic and resistance exercises in blood pressure (BP) and its variability (BPV) in hypertensive postmenopausal women. Fourteen hypertensive postmenopausal women monitored BP at rest and during 24 h by ambulatory BP monitoring in a control day without exercise performance a pretraining (baseline), after an acute exercise session (acute), and after a chronic exercise training for 10 weeks (chronic). After exercise training, systolic BP (SBP, Delta = -150 mmHg.24 h), diastolic BP (DBP, Delta = -96 mmHg.24 h), and mean BP (MBP, Delta = -95 mmHg.24 h) area under the curve were smaller than baseline measurements (P < 0.05) with no difference between acute and baseline measurements. The SBP (Delta SD24 = -2, Delta SDdn = -1.7, and Delta ARV24 = -1.9 mmHg), DBP (Delta SD24 = -0.9, Delta SDdn = -0.8, and Delta ARV24 = -0.9 mmHg), and MBP (Delta SD24 = -1.5, Delta SDdn = -1.3, and Delta ARV24 = -1.2 mmHg) variability reduced in acute session in relation to baseline, with no chronic effects. There are moderate correlations between acute and chronic responses in wake SBP, sleep DBP, and SD24. In conclusion, combined exercise reduces ambulatory BP chronically but not acutely. In contrast, BPV decreases after an acute session but not chronically. Awake SBP, sleep DBP, and SD24indices are promising candidates to predict individual cardiovascular responses to exercise.

TI  - Effect of Forest Therapy for Menopausal Women with Insomnia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Female hormone changes during menopause can affect the autonomic nervous system, circadian rhythm, and secretion of cortisol/melatonin, resulting in a vulnerability to insomnia. In this light, therapy has been gaining attention as a way to reduce stress hormones by stabilizing the autonomic nervous system. Thus, this study aims to objectively and scientifically analyze the impact of forest therapy in postmenopausal insomnia patients. The forest therapy program lasted 6 days, wherein 35 postmenopausal women performed activities such as trekking, leg massages, stretches, and bathing in warm and cold water. They also underwent serologic tests, participated in polysomnography (PSG), and answered sleep questionnaires before and after the program. Further, a statistical analysis compared the results. Serologic tests showed a significant reduction of cortisol from 10.2 +/- 3.79 to 7.75 +/- 2.81, while PSGs showed how sleep efficiency increased to 89.3 +/- 4.3% (p< 0.01), and how waking after sleep onset reduced to 47.4 +/- 22.3 min(p <0.01). The total sleep time also increased to 428.5 min and sleep latency was 11.1 +/- 11.0 min. Despite its limitations, forest therapy could be a good alternative to nonpharmacological treatment for mitigating insomnia in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Effects of Mind-Body Interventions Involving Meditative Movements on Quality of Life, Depressive Symptoms, Fear of Falling and Sleep Quality in Older Adults: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The aim of the present systematic meta-analytical review was to quantify the effects of different mind-body interventions (MBI) involving meditative movements on relevant psychological health outcomes (i.e., quality of life (QoL), depressive symptoms, fear of falling (FoF) and sleep quality) in older adults without mental disorders.Methods: A structured literature search was conducted in five databases (Ovid, PsycINFO, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science). Inclusion criteria were: (i) the study was a (cluster) randomized controlled trial, (ii) the subjects were aged >= 59 years without mental illnesses, (iii) an intervention arm performing MBI compared to a non-exercise control group (e.g., wait-list or usual care), (iv) psychological health outcomes related to QoL, depressive symptoms, FoF or sleep quality were assessed and (v) a PEDro score of >= 5. The interventions of the included studies were sub-grouped into Tai Chi/Qigong (TCQ) and Yoga/Pilates (YP). Statistical analyses were conducted using a random-effects inverse-variance model.Results: Thirty-seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (comprising 3224 participants) were included. Small to moderate-but-significant overall effect sizes favoring experimental groups (Hedges'g: 0.25 to 0.71) compared to non-exercise control groups were observed in all outcomes (allpvalues <= 0.007), apart from one subdomain of quality of life (i.e., social functioning,p= 0.15). Interestingly, a significant larger effect on QoL and depressive symptoms with increasing training frequency was found for TCQ (p= 0.03;p= 0.004).Conclusions: MBI involving meditative movements may serve as a promising opportunity to improve psychological health domains such as QoL, depressive symptoms, FoF and sleep quality in older adults. Hence, these forms of exercise may represent potential preventive measures regarding the increase of late-life mental disorders, which need to be further confirmed by future research.

TI  - Complementary and Alternative Medicine Methods Used for Sleep Disturbance in Menopause
T2  - JOURNAL OF TURKISH SLEEP MEDICINE-TURK UYKU TIBBI DERGISI
AB  - Objective: One of the most common complaints observed during the menopausal period is sleep disorders, affecting 40%-60% women. In this study, we aimed to determine complementary and clternative medicine (CAM) for menopausal women experiencing sleep disturbances, and the prevalence and influencing factors of sleep disturbance.
   Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, we included menopausal women experiencing sleeplessness [>= 4 degree of discomfort according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)] (n=201). A questionnaire and the CAM Scale were used to collect data. The necessary institutional and ethical committee permissions were obtained.
   Results: The mean age of the menopausal women was 47.23 +/- 4.53 [minimum (min)- maximum (max), 30-60] years, and their mean VAS for insomnia was 5.20 +/- 1.12 (min-max, 4-9). The following methods were used by the women to overcome insomnia: herbal supplements (96.6%), dietary supplements (98.8%), religious practices (95.7%), and mind-body practices (76.9%). The most common methods were fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products, honey, linden tea, rosehip, prayer, pray, and music. Approximately 70.5% women expressed that the method they used was effective.
   Conclusion: Almost all menopausal women used any method of CAM. Further studies on the effectiveness of these methods as well as the training to be provided and the information dissemination by healthcare professionals are recommended.

TI  - Women with low quality of life by cervantes-short form scale choose menopausal hormone therapy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess whether women who choose to use menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) have lower quality of life (QoL) than those who do not initiate it using Cervantes short form scale (C-SF), and analyze sociodemographic factors associated with lower QoL in women.
   Study design: A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was made in four hundred and eighty women with climacteric symptoms.
   Results: Mean age was 51.1 years. Two hundred and sixty-one women (54.3 %) started MHT. The samples global mean in C-SF score was 51.3 +/- 13.9. Women who choose to use MHT have higher score in C-SF (lower QoL) than women who reject it (58.7 +/- 15.9 vs 46.7 +/- 12.8; p < 0.001). We found higher score in women with early menopause (53.7 +/- 15.9 vs 49.7 +/- 13.1; p = 0.037); with no obesity ( 30 vs 30 BMI) (52.8 +/- 13.5 vs 41.0 +/- 8.2; p = 0.002); with previous malignancies (56.2 +/- 18.2 vs 50.2 +/- 13.5; p = 0.020) and without sexual activity (58.0 +/- 25.4 vs 50.4 +/- 13.1; p = 0.009. No differences were found in C-SF score with respect to tobacco habits or physical activity. In the multivariate analysis, the variable independently associated to lower QoL by C-SF (high score) was to be a woman who want to initiate MHT (p = 0.004).
   Conclusions: Women who choose to use MHT due to menopausal symptoms have lower quality of life measured by C-SF scale. Women with early menopause, with no obesity (<30 BMI), without sexual activity and with previous malignances have lower quality of life measured by C-SF scale. Women with early menopause have more psychic symptoms like nervousness, fatigue and sleep complaints by C-SF scale than women with natural menopause. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Objective sleep disturbance is associated with poor response to cognitive and behavioral treatments for insomnia in postmenopausal women
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study objectives: To determine whether insomnia patients with objective sleep disturbance are less responsive to cognitive and behavioral treatments than those without objective sleep disturbance, characterize effects of insomnia therapy on objective sleep, and determine whether reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal correspond to changes in objective sleep.
   Methods: Secondary analysis of a single-site, randomized controlled trial. 113 postmenopausal women (56.40 +/- 5.34 years) with menopause-related insomnia disorder were randomized to three treatment conditions: cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), sleep restriction therapy (SRT), or sleep education control. Primary outcomes were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and polysomnography (PSG) sleep parameters and were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up.
   Results: Patients with lower pretreatment PSG sleep efficiency had lower rates of insomnia remission after active treatment relative to those with higher sleep efficiency (37.8% vs 61.8%). Neither CBTI and SRT produced clinically meaningful effects on PSG sleep. Exploratory analyses revealed that reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal were associated with decreases in PSG sleep latency, but not wake after sleep onset.
   Conclusions: Our findings support an emerging literature suggesting that insomnia patients with objective sleep disturbance may have blunted response to insomnia therapy. Research is needed to enhance treatments to better improve insomnia in patients with objective sleep disturbance. A lack of observed CBTI and SRT effects on PSG sleep suggests that these therapies may be presently ill-designed to improve objective sleep. Nocturnal cognitive arousal may represent an entry point to improve objective sleep latency in insomnia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sleep and Prospective Memory: A Retrospective Study in Different Clinical Populations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Prospective memory (PM) is essential in everyday life because it concerns the ability to remember to perform an intended action in the future. This ability could be influenced by poor sleep quality, the role of which, however, is still being debated. To examine the role of sleep quality in PM in depth, we decided to perform a retrospective naturalistic study examining different clinical populations with a primary sleep disorder or comorbid low sleep quality. If sleep is important for PM function, we could expect poor sleep to affect PM performance tasks both directly and indirectly. We examined a total of 3600 nights, recorded using actigraphy in participants belonging to the following groups: primary insomnia (731 nights); narcolepsy type 1 (1069 nights); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (152 nights in children and 239 in adults); severe obesity (232 nights); essential hypertension (226 nights); menopause (143 nights); healthy controls (808 nights). In a naturalistic activity-based PM task, each participant originally wore an actigraph around the non-dominant wrist and was requested to push the event-marker button at two specific times of day: bedtime (activity 1) and get-up time (activity 2). Each clinical group showed significantly lower sleep quality in comparison to the control group. However, only narcolepsy type 1 patients presented a significantly impaired PM performance at get-up time, remembering to push the event-marker button around half the time compared not only to healthy controls but also to the other clinical groups. Overall, the present results seem to point to sleep quality having no effect on the efficiency of a naturalistic activity-based PM task. Moreover, the data indicated that narcolepsy type 1 patients may show a disease-specific cognitive deficit of PM.

TI  - Role of Ovarian Hormones in the Modulation of Sleep in Females Across the Adult Lifespan
T2  - ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Ovarian hormones, including 17 beta-estradiol, are implicated in numerous physiological processes, including sleep. Beginning at puberty, girls report more sleep complaints than boys, which is maintained throughout the reproductive life stage. Sleep problems are exacerbated during the menopausal transition, evidenced by greater risk for sleep disorders. There is emerging evidence that menopause-associated hormone loss contributes to this elevated risk, but age is also an important factor. The extent to which menopause-associated sleep disturbance persists into postmenopause above and beyond the effects of age remains unknown. Untreated sleep disturbances have important implications for cognitive health, as they are emerging as risk factors for dementia. Given that sleep loss impairs memory, an important knowledge gap concerns the role played by menopause-associated hormone loss in exacerbating sleep disturbance and, ultimately, cognitive function in aging women. In this review, we take a translational approach to illustrate the contribution of ovarian hormones in maintaining the sleep-wake cycle in younger and middle-aged females, with evidence implicating 17 beta-estradiol in supporting the memory-promoting effects of sleep. Sleep physiology is briefly reviewed before turning to behavioral and neural evidence from young females linking 17 beta-estradiol to sleep-wake cycle maintenance. Implications of menopause-associated 17 beta-estradiol loss is also reviewed before discussing how ovarian hormones may support the memory-promoting effects of sleep, and why menopause may exacerbate pathological aging via effects on sleep. While still in its infancy, this research area offers a new sex-based perspective on aging research, with a focus on a modifiable risk factor for pathological aging.

TI  - Lessons from KEEPS: the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine the effects of hormone treatments (menopausal hormone treatments [MHTs]) on the progression of carotid intima-medial thickness (CIMT) in recently menopausal women. Participants less than 3 years from menopause and without a history of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as no clinical CVD events and coronary artery calcium < 50 Agatston units, received either oral conjugated equine estrogens (0.45 mg/day) or transdermal 17 beta-estradiol (50 mu g/day), both with progesterone (200 mg/day for 12 days/month), or placebo pills and patches for 4 years. Although MHT did not decrease the age-related increase in CIMT, KEEPS provided other important insights about MHT effects. Both MHTs versus placebo reduced the severity of menopausal symptoms and maintained bone density, but differed in efficacy regarding mood/anxiety, sleep, sexual function, and deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain. Additionally, genetic variants in enzymes for metabolism and uptake of estrogen affected the efficacy of MHT for some aspects of symptom relief. KEEPS provides important information for use of MHT in clinical practice, including type, dose, and mode of delivery of MHT recently after menopause, and how genetic variants in hormone metabolism may affect MHT efficacy on specific outcomes.

TI  - Insomnia and menopause: a narrative review on mechanisms and treatments
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - The menopausal transition is associated with an increased frequency of sleep disturbances. Insomnia represents one of the most reported symptoms by menopausal women. According to its pathogenetic model (3-P Model), different predisposing factors (i.e. a persistent condition of past insomnia and aging per se) increase the risk of insomnia during menopause. Moreover, multiple precipitating and perpetuating factors should favor its occurrence across menopause, including hormonal changes, menopausal transition stage symptoms (i.e. hot flashes, night sweats), mood disorders, poor health and pain, other sleep disorders and circadian modifications. Thus, insomnia management implies a careful evaluation of the psychological and somatic symptoms of the individual menopausal woman by a multidisciplinary team. Therapeutic strategies encompass different drugs but also behavioral interventions. Indeed, cognitive behavioral therapy represents the first-line treatment of insomnia in the general population, regardless of the presence of mood disorders and/or vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Different antidepressants seem to improve sleep disturbances. However, when VMS are present, menopausal hormone therapy should be considered in the treatment of related insomnia taking into account the risk-benefit profile. Finally, given its good tolerability, safety, and efficacy on multiple sleep and daytime parameters, prolonged-released melatonin should represent a first-line drug in women aged >= 55 years.

TI  - Effects of a wearable technology-based physical activity intervention on sleep quality in breast cancer survivors: the ACTIVATE Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER SURVIVORSHIP
AB  - Introduction Physical activity interventions can improve sleep quality in breast cancer survivors. This paper examines the effects of the ACTIVATE Trial, a wearable-based physical activity intervention (Garmin Vivofit2 (R) coupled with behavioral feedback, goal setting, and health coaching) on sleep outcomes. Methods Post-primary treatment, inactive, postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were recruited and randomized to primary intervention or waitlist. Wrist-worn actigraphy (sleep onset latency, SOL; total sleep time, TST; sleep efficiency, SE; wake after sleep onset, WASO; and number of awakenings, NWAKE) and questionnaire-derived sleep measures (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were assessed at baseline (T1), 12 weeks (end of primary intervention and start of waitlist intervention, T2), and at 24 weeks (T3). Results Eighty-three women (mean age = 62 years) were randomized; trial retention was 94% at T2 and 87% at T3. At T2, primary intervention participants had greater improvements in WASO (- 5.7 min, 95% CI - 11.7 to - 0.2) and NWAKE compared with the waitlist arm (- 2.0, 95% CI - 3.6 to - 0.4). At T3, within-group improvements were observed for SE (both groups), WASO (both groups), NWAKE (primary intervention group only), total PSQI score (primary intervention group), and sleep efficacy (primary intervention group). Conclusions The intervention reduced actigraphy-measured sleep disturbances. Within-group analyses suggest that improvements in sleep quality are sustained over a longer duration, and there may be similar benefits from an abridged intervention (wearable device only). Actigraphy-measured effects appeared stronger in participants who were poor sleepers at study entry. Implications for Cancer Survivors Wearable technology can increase physical activity and improve sleep for breast cancer survivors.

TI  - Polycystic ovary syndrome and aging: Health implications after menopause
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with heterogenous clinical manifestations. The evidence indicates that PCOS is associated with long-term health risks including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, endometrial cancer, and mood disorders. Although cardiometabolic risk factors are more common among women with PCOS, currently there is no strong evidence for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. The effect of menopausal transition on the long-term health consequences of PCOS is mostly uncertain. The PCOS phenotype improves with aging in affected women. Accordingly, the differences in the cardiometabolic risk profiles of PCOS patients and of the general population seem to disappear after menopause. However, it is not clear whether this phenotype amelioration is associated with changes in other long-term health risks after the menopause. There are also gaps in our knowledge about the impact of long-term use of oral contraceptives on the prevalence of PCOS-related comorbidities. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the long-term health consequences of PCOS and their clinical implications in peri- and postmenopause, and highlights areas for future research.

TI  - Cortisol Awakening Response and Heart Rate Variability in the Menstrual Cycle of Sportswomen
T2  - RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine the activities of heart rate variability (HRV) and cortisol secretion as markers of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) during the menstrual cycle in female athletes.Method: Saliva samples of the participants (n = 28) were collected successively at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after awakening to assess cortisol awakening response (CAR) during each of four phases of the menstrual cycle (the menstruation, ovulation, luteal, and premenstrual phases). Diurnal saliva samples were collected at noon, in the evening (17:00) and 22:00 for cortisol analysis. HRV was measured in the menstrual and premenstrual phases at rest (12:00-14:00).Results: There was no difference betweenCARparameters in the menstrual phases.CARparameters and diurnal cortisol levels were significantly correlated with each other throughout the menstrual cycle. Mean cortisol was a strong predictor of the area under the curve (AUC: S = 0.042; R-Sq = 98.4%). Time-dependent parameters of HRV (standard deviation of the N-N interval [SDNN;P= .049] and the root mean square of the successive R-R differences [rMSSD;P= .038]) were significantly higher in the menstrual phase. There were no correlations betweenCARand HRV parameters.Conclusions: We suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and the autonomic nervous system work in a separate manner that is not affected by the menstrual phases in sportswomen. The present study contributed to a better understanding of the relationship between the dynamics of cortisol release and the autonomic nervous system in different phases of the menstrual cycle in female athletes.

TI  - Associations of depression status with plasma levels of candidate lipid and amino acid metabolites: a meta-analysis of individual data from three independent samples of US postmenopausal women
T2  - MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Recent animal and small clinical studies have suggested depression is related to altered lipid and amino acid profiles. However, this has not been examined in a population-based sample, particularly in women. We identified multiple metabolites associated with depression as potential candidates from prior studies. Cross-sectional data from three independent samples of postmenopausal women were analyzed, including women from the Women's Health Initiative-Observational Study (WHI-OS,n = 926), the WHI-Hormone Trials (WHI-HT;n = 1,325), and the Nurses' Health Study II Mind-Body Study (NHSII-MBS;n = 218). Positive depression status was defined as having any of the following: elevated depressive symptoms, antidepressant use, or depression history. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (21 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 7 lysophosphatidylethanolamines, 5 ceramides, 3 branched chain amino acids, and 9 neurotransmitters). Associations between depression status and metabolites were evaluated using multivariable linear regression; results were pooled by random-effects meta-analysis with multiple testing adjustment using the false discovery rate (FDR). Prevalence rates of positive depression status were 24.4% (WHI-OS), 25.7% (WHI-HT), and 44.7% (NHSII-MBS). After multivariable adjustment, positive depression status was associated with higher levels of glutamate and PC 36 : 1/38 : 3, and lower levels of tryptophan and GABA-to-glutamate and GABA-to-glutamine ratio (FDR-p < 0.05). Positive associations with LPE 18 : 0/18 : 1 and inverse associations with valine and serotonin were also observed, although these associations did not survive FDR adjustment. Associations of positive depression status with several candidate metabolites including PC 36 : 1/38 : 3 and amino acids involved in neurotransmission suggest potential depression-related metabolic alterations in postmenopausal women, with possible implications for later chronic disease.

TI  - The Interplay Between the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System and Parathyroid Hormone
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the regulatory system by which renin induces aldosterone production. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main effector substance of the RAAS. The RAAS regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance by controlling blood volume and peripheral resistance. Excessive activation of the RAAS is an important factor in the onset of cardiovascular disease and the deterioration of this disease. The most common RAAS abnormality is primary aldosteronism (PA). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a peptide secreted by the main cells of the parathyroid gland, which promotes elevated blood calcium (Ca2+) levels and decreased blood phosphorus (Pi) levels. Excessive secretion of PTH can cause primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Parathyroidism is highly prevalent in postmenopausal women and is often associated with secondary osteoporosis. PA and PHPT are common endocrine system diseases. However, studies have shown a link between the RAAS and PTH, indicating a positive relationship between them. In this review, we explore the complex bidirectional relationship between the RAAS and PTH. We also point out possible future treatment options for related diseases based on this relationship.

TI  - Sleep medications and sleep disturbances across middle aged pre- orperi-menopausalwomen of different race and ethnicities: ASWANpharmacoepidemiology cohort study
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
AB  - Purpose Sleep disturbances are common, particularly in middle aged women. Prescription medications for this indication are increasingly used, despite uncertain safety. This study assessed prescription medication use for sleep among a cohort of women with and without sleep disturbances. Methods We examined reports of sleep disturbance and sleep medication use among pre- and early peri-menopausal womenassessed annually or biennially since 1996. Women self-reported medications at visits, and we identified medications that have been used primarily for sleep disturbances. They reported on difficulties falling and staying asleep, and early morning wakening. Sleep medication use across 20 years of follow-up was examined for all women and by race/ethnicity. Women who reported data for both sleep disturbance and sleep medication use were included in the analyses.. Results Among participants in a cohort of 3302 women who were enrolled prior to their menopause transition, 3082 women were included in the analytic sample and 2531 (82%) reported sleep disturbances. They were more likely to endorse higher anxiety and pain scores and more comorbid conditions than women without sleep disturbances. Baseline characteristics were similar among women who did and did not use sleep medications. Among women reporting a sleep disturbance at baseline, 2.5% reported sleep medication use, increasing to 8% over 20 years. However, the proportion of women reporting sleep medication use who did not report a sleep disturbance remained low, approximately 1% to 2% over the entire follow-up. Increases in sleep medication use was observed across women of all race/ethnicities. Conclusions The use of sleep medications among women reporting sleep disturbance grew over the last 20 years. Growth was observed across women of all race/ethnicities.

TI  - Healthier dietary patterns are associated with better sleep quality among midlife Mexican women
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: To evaluate whether dietary patterns are associated with sleep quality in Mexican midlife women.
   Methods: The study population included 4,467 Mexican women from a longitudinal study of teachers. In 2008, a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered. Principal components analysis identified 3 dietary patterns: Fruits and Vegetables, Western (meat and processed), and Modern Mexican (tortillas and soda, low in fiber and dairy). Starting in 2012, follow-up questionnaires included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which yields a score ranging from 0 to 21 (higher scores = worse quality). Modified Poisson regression analyses examining the association between dietary patterns (categorized into quartiles) and poor sleep quality (score > 5) were conducted, adjusting for socio-demographic and lifestyle confounders and baseline comorbid conditions.
   Results: Women were 41.0 +/- 7.1 years at baseline, with an average follow-up of 5.5 +/- 0.7 years. In fully adjusted models, women in the least-healthy quartile of the Fruits and Vegetables pattern compared with the most were 21% more likely to have poor quality sleep at follow-up (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.42), while those in the highest quartiles of the Modern Mexican pattern were 23% more likely to have poor quality sleep compared with the lowest quartiles (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.43, respectively).
   Conclusions: A fruit and vegetable-based dietary pattern was associated with higher sleep quality, while an unhealthier diet pattern was associated with worse sleep quality in midlife women.

TI  - Heart Rate, Brain Imaging Biomarkers and Cognitive Impairment in Older (>= 63 years) Women
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Evidence on the relations between heart rate, brain morphology, and cognition is limited. We examined the associations of resting heart rate (RHR), visit-to-visit heart rate variation (VVHRV), brain volumes and cognitive impairment. The study sample consisted of postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study and its ancillary MRI sub-studies (WHIMS-MRI 1 and WHIMS-MRI 2) without a history of cardiovascular disease, including 493 with one and 299 women with 2 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. HR readings were acquired annually starting from baseline visit (1996-1998). RHR was calculated as the mean and VVHRV as standard deviation of all available HR readings. Brain MRI scans were performed between 2005 and 2006 (WHIMS-MRI 1), and approximately 5 years later (WHIMS-MRI 2). Cognitive impairment was defined as incident mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia until December 30, 2017. An elevated RHR was associated with greater brain lesion volumes at the first MRI exam (7.86 cm3 [6.48, 9.24] vs 4.78 cm3 [3.39, 6.17], p-value <0.0001) and with significant increases in lesion volumes between brain MRI exams (6.20 cm3 [4.81, 7.59] vs 4.28 cm3 [2.84, 5.73], p-value = 0.0168). Larger ischemic lesion volumes were associated with a higher risk for cognitive impairment (Hazard Ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.02 [1.18, 3.47], p-value = 0.0109). Neither RHR nor VVHRV were related to cognitive impairment. In sensitivity analyses, we additionally included women with a history of cardiovascular disease to the study sample. The main results were consistent to those without a history of cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, these findings show an association between elevated RHR and ischemic brain lesions, probably due to underlying subclinical disease processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Association of snoring and body composition in (peri-post) menopausal women
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background Little attention has been paid to whether snoring frequency is associated with body composition in menopausal women, particularly in China. This study objected to investigate the association between self-reported snoring and body composition in (peri-post) menopausal Chinese women as well as metabolic indicators. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 715 participants aged 40-67 years from the Menopause Clinic in the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital. Participants were categorized into four subgroups stratified by self-reported snoring frequency: never, rarely (< 1 night per week), occasionally (1-2 nights per week), regularly (>= 3 nights per week), while body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Besides, blood sample were collected to test the glycolipid indicators. Results In our sample of investigation, regular snoring (>= 3 nights per week) was found to be an independent risk factor for higher fat mass (total, upper limbs, trunk), with the highest risk of 2.4 times for fat mass of trunk after adjusting for metabolic confounders(p = 0.003). Meanwhile, regular snoring was independently associated with higher fat mass (total and each segment) only in menopausal transition (p = 0.023). Conclusions We suggested that self-reported regular snoring may be taken as a simple alternative to predict higher fat mass (>= 17.11 kg, upper quartile) in menopausal women. Similarly, body composition should be attached to the great importance to those who in menopausal transition in order to help to prevent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

TI  - Effects of endometriosis on sleep quality of women: does life style factor make a difference?
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background This study aimed to compare the lifestyle factors and SQ between women with and without endometriosis. Also in this essay, the influence of food intake, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on sleep quality of women with endometriosis was determined. Methods Of the 156 infertile women approached for the study, 78 women had endometriosis and 78 were included in the control group. At first, each participant completed a checklist including questions about demographics, physical activity, reproductive and menstrual status. SQ was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Dietary data were collected using a validated 147-item semi-quantitative FFQ. Results Irregular menstrual status, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, history of abortion, family history of endometriosis were associated with endometriosis risk (P < 0.05). In women with physical activity more than 3 h per week, high consumption of the dairy product, and fruit endometriosis is less common (P < 0.05). The total PSQI score, and the scores for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep disturbance domains were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05). In women with endometriosis, poor SQ was associated with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, physical activity, and low consumption of the dairy product, fruit, and nut (p < 0.05). Conclusion In endometriosis women, SQ was lower than healthy individuals. Lifestyle factors can effect on SQ of these patients.

TI  - "Tomorrow, I'll Be Fine": Impacts and coping mechanisms in adolescents and young adults with primary dysmenorrhoea
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aims To understand the experiences of adolescents and young adults with primary dysmenorrhoea through the lens of structured frameworks extant in contemporary pain literature. Design Descriptive qualitative study. Methods Thirty-nine adolescents and young adults (ages 16-24 years) with primary dysmenorrhoea participated in semi-structured in-person interviews. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed using deductive thematic analysis from November 2018 to April 2019. Results Two overarching themes, each with subthemes, were identified. The first theme, primary dysmenorrhoea impacts the whole person, contained the following subthemes: biological, social, and psychological. The second theme, coping mechanisms of women with primary dysmenorrhoea, contained the following subthemes: primary, secondary, and passive coping. Conclusion Women experience several primary dysmenorrhoea-related impacts on their biological, social, and psychological functioning. Women employ a variety of coping mechanisms to manage their primary dysmenorrhoea pain. Impact This study emphasizes the significant effects of primary dysmenorrhoea on nearly every aspect of women's lives and contributes to an understanding of the ways women cope with this pain. The findings of this study underscore the need for continued consideration of primary dysmenorrhoea as a debilitating pain process as well as the need for additional interventions to help women manage this condition.

TI  - The effects of a new, improved Chinese medicine, Gengnianchun formula granules, on hot flushes, depression, anxiety, and sleep in Chinese peri- and postmenopausal women: a randomized placebo-controlled trial
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a new, improved herbal formula of a traditional Chinese medicine, improved Gengnianchun (I-GNC), on hot flushes, depression, anxiety, and sleep in peri- and postmenopausal women in China.
   Methods: A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial of peri- and postmenopausal women with Kupperman Index (KMI) scores of 15 or higher was conducted for 12 weeks. Hot flush frequencies, KMI scores, Hamilton depression scale scores, Hamilton anxiety scale scores, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were evaluated. Each outcome was evaluated every 4 weeks.
   Results: Ninety-eight participants completed the study. The I-GNC formula significantly reduced the mean (SD) frequency of hot flushes from 7 (4.554) to 1.2 (1.675) in the I-GNC group and from 6.74 (3.43) to 3.66 (2.635) in the placebo group (P < 0.01). The KMI (P < 0.01), Hamilton depression scale (P < 0.01), and Hamilton anxiety scale (P < 0.01) scores decreased in both groups after treatment, and significant differences were observed between the two groups (P < 0.01); however, no significant difference in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was observed. I-GNC had no effect on serum follicle-stimulating hormone or E-2 levels. There were no obvious adverse effects.
   Conclusions: The traditional Chinese medicine herbal formula I-GNC can alleviate the symptoms of menopausal syndrome and improve quality of life among peri- and postmenopausal women. I-GNC is safe and has no notable adverse effects.

TI  - Can walking exercise programs improve health for women in menopause transition and postmenopausal? Findings from a scoping review
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Our goal was to explore the range and characteristics of published papers on therapeutic walking programs for menopausal women and to identify program features that resulted in successful outcomes including reduced symptoms and improved long-term wellness.
   Methods: We searched biomedical and exercise-related databases for articles published up to June 1, 2017, using keywords related to menopause and walking. Data were collected into EndNote X8 reference manager to identify and remove duplicates. The final selection included all articles that studied walking as a health intervention for women in menopause transition or postmenopausal.
   Results: A total of 3,244 papers were collected from the six databases. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 96 articles were charted, including 77 different walking programs. Walking interventions ranged from 4 weeks to 3 years with an average weekly frequency of 3.8 +/- 1.8 and were applied to a variety of symptoms and their biological markers and risk factors. Overall, 91% of the programs showed a beneficial outcome in at least one menopause-related medical issue. Information on menopause-specific symptoms, especially vasomotor symptoms and sleep problems, was scarce.
   Conclusion: The scoping review highlights the growing interest in walking programs as therapies for menopause and related symptoms and provides evidence of their possible benefit as a wellness option for women in menopause and beyond. Further research would be recommended to establish the therapeutic value of walking programs for women with specific focus on typical menopause symptoms at different stages of menopause.

TI  - Sleep disordered breathing and metabolic comorbidities across sex and menopausal status in East Asians: the Nagahama Study
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
AB  - It is well known that the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is increased in patients with obesity or metabolic comorbidities. However, the way in which the prevalence of SDB increases in relation to comorbidities according to the severity of obesity remains unclear.
   This cross-sectional study evaluated 7713 community participants using nocturnal oximetry >= 2 nights. SDB was assessed by the 3% oxygen desaturation index corrected for sleep duration obtained by wrist actigraphy (acti-ODI3%). SDB severity was defined by acti-ODI3%. Obesity was defined as body mass index >= 25 kg.m(-2).
   The prevalence of SDB was 41.0% (95% CI 39.9-42.1%), 46.9% (45.8-48.0%), 10.1% (9.5-10.8%) and 2.0% (1.7-2.3%) in normal, mild, moderate and severe SDB, respectively, with notable sex differences evident (males>post-menopausal females>premenopausal females). Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome were independently associated with the prevalence of moderate-to-severe SDB, and coincidence of any one of these with obesity was associated with a higher probability of moderate-to-severe SDB (hypertension OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.6-10.2; diabetes OR 7.8, 95% CI 5.6-10.9; metabolic syndrome OR 6.7, 95% CI 5.2-8.6). Dyslipidaemia in addition to obesity was not additively associated with the prevalence of moderate-to-severe SDB. The number of antihypertensive drugs was associated with SDB (p for trend <0.001). Proportion of a high cumulative percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry <90% increased, even among moderate-to-severe SDB with increases in obesity.
   Metabolic comorbidities contribute to SDB regardless of the degree of obesity. We should recognise the extremely high prevalence of moderate-to-severe SDB in patients with obesity and metabolic comorbidities.

TI  - Medicalization Defined in Empirical Contexts -A Scoping Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Medicalization has been a topic of discussion and research for over four decades. It is a known concept to researchers from a broad range of disciplines. Medicalization appears to be a concept that speaks to all, suggesting a shared understanding of what it constitutes. However, conceptually, the definition of medicalization has evolved over time. It is unknown how the concept is applied in empirical research, therefore following research question was answered: How is medicalization defined in empirical research and how do the definitions differ from each other?
   Methods: We performed a scoping review on the empirical research on medicalization. The 5 steps of a scoping review were followed: (1) Identifying the research question; (2) Identifying relevant studies; (3) Inclusion and exclusion criteria; (4) Charting the data; and (5) Collating, summarizing and reporting the results. The screening of 3027 papers resulted in the inclusion of 50 empirical studies in the review.
   Results: The application of the concept of medicalization within empirical studies proved quite diverse. The used conceptual definitions could be divided into 10 categories, which differed from each other subtly though importantly. The ten categories could be placed in a framework, containing two axes. The one axe represents a continuum from value neutral definitions to value laden definitions. The other axe represents a continuum from a micro to a macro perspective on medicalization.
   Conclusion: This review shows that empirical research on medicalization is quite heterogeneous in its definition of the concept. This reveals the richness and complexity of medicalization, once more, but also hinders the comparability of studies. Future empirical research should pay more attention to the choice made with regard to the definition of medialization and its applicability to the context of the study.

TI  - Hot Flashes Clinical summary of the ONS Guidelines (TM) for cancer treatment-related hot flashes in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
AB  - Cancer-related hot flashes are often a lasting and distressing side effect of hormone-blocking therapies that are most often experienced by women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer treated with these therapies. Hot flashes have been defined as a sensation of heat that may be accompanied by facial flushing, perspiration, chills, heart palpitations, night sweats, and feelings of anxiety. The frequency and intensity of hot flashes can cause fatigue and sleep disturbances that diminish quality of life and reduce adherence with prescribed therapies that block estrogens or androgens. Hot flashes are reported to be significantly more frequent and severe in women treated for breast cancer than in women undergoing natural menopause. They also commonly occur in men treated for prostate cancer with surgical or chemical castration to block the synthesis of androgens that can fuel cancer growth.

TI  - Secondary Data Analysis on the Factors Influencing Premenstrual Symptoms of Shift Work Nurses: Focused on the Sleep and Occupational Stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN ACADEMY OF NURSING
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine premenstrual symptoms (PMS) of shift nurses and identify the association between PMS, sleep, and occupational stress. Methods: This study was conducted with a secondary data analysis that used data from the Shift Work Nurse's Health and Turnover study. The participants were 258 nurses who were working in shifts including night shifts. PMS, sleep patterns (sleep time and sleep time variability), sleep quality, and the occupational stress of each participant were measured using the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, a sleep diary, an actigraph, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Korean Occupational Stress Scale, respectively. Data were analyzed using SPSS 23 and STATA 15.1 to obtain descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficients, multiple linear regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) and Baron and Kenny's mediating analysis. Results: The average PMS score, average sleep time, average sleep time variability, average sleep quality score, and average occupational stress score of the participants was 53.95 +/- 40.45, 7.52 +/- 0.89 hours, 32.84 +/- 8.43%, 12.34 +/- 5.95, and 49.89 +/- 8.98, respectively. A multiple linear regression analysis with GEE indicated that sleep time variability (B = 0.86, p = .001), and sleep quality (B = 2.36, p<.001) had negative effects on nurses' PMS. We also found that sleep quality had a complete mediating effect in the relationship between occupational stress and PMS. Conclusion: These findings indicate that both sleep time variability and sleep quality are important factors associated with PMS among shift work nurses. To improve shift nurses' PMS status, strategies are urgently needed to decrease sleep time variability and increase sleep quality.

TI  - An integrate-and-fire model for pulsatility in the neuroendocrine system<?A3B2 show [editpick]?>
T2  - CHAOS
AB  - A model for pulsatility in neuroendocrine regulation is proposed which combines Goodwin-type feedback control with impulsive input from neurons located in the hypothalamus. The impulsive neural input is modeled using an integrate-and-fire mechanism; namely, inputs are generated only when the membrane potential crosses a threshold, after which it is reset to baseline. The resultant model takes the form of a functional-differential equation with continuous and impulsive components. Despite the impulsive nature of the inputs, realistic hormone profiles are generated, including ultradian and circadian rhythms, pulsatile secretory patterns, and even chaotic dynamics.

TI  - Prevalence of Screening High Risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Among Urogynecology Patients
T2  - FEMALE PELVIC MEDICINE AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB  - Objectives There is limited knowledge on the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among urogynecology patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of screening high risk of OSA (HR-OSA) in an ambulatory urogynecology clinic. Methods Women presenting for a new patient visit to a single outpatient urogynecology clinic for any indication were screened for eligibility. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older, English speaking, nonpregnant, and not using treatment for OSA. Participants completed the STOP-BANG questionnaire to screen for OSA and additional questionnaires to assess the presence and classification of nocturia and urinary incontinence. Results Among 130 participants, the prevalence of screening HR-OSA was 38.5%. Characteristics associated with screening HR-OSA included hypertension (P< 0.001), diabetes (P=0.003), untreated sleep apnea (P< 0.001), body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2)(P< 0.001), and age >50 years (P< 0.001). Participants who screened HR-OSA were more likely to have bothersome bladder symptoms of nocturia (P< 0.001), nocturnal enuresis (P< 0.001), higher urinary distress inventory scores (P< 0.001), and incontinence severity index scores (P< 0.001). On multivariable analysis, age >50 years (odds ratio [OR], 7.54), hypertension (OR, 4.04), body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2)(OR, 3.98), and nocturial enuresis (OR, 2.26) remained significantly associated with screening HR-OSA. Average time to complete the STOP-BANG was 1.2 minutes. Conclusions The prevalence of OSA among urogynecology patients is high, and screening is not time prohibitive. Patients who screen HR-OSA have more bothersome bladder symptoms. Providers should consider screening urogynecology patients for OSA, especially patients who are 50 years or older, are obese, and have nocturnal enuresis.

TI  - Sleep, premenstrual mood disorder, and women's health
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Women experience increased vulnerability for both mood and sleep disorders, and the female menstrual cycle represents one fundamental mechanism related to risk. This review evaluates recent literature integrating female reproduction, sleep, and mood. For as many as one third of women, sleep is disrupted premenstrually, and sleep disturbances are particularly prevalent in those with premenstrual mood disorders. Variation in sleep patterns, circadian rhythm alterations, and decreased melatonin secretions due to hormonal fluctuations during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle could explain sleep complaints and have been linked to menstrual irregularity. Menstrual irregularity is also independently associated with increased risk of mood complaints and poor sleep. Therefore, there is growing evidence for the interactional relationships between poor sleep, circadian rhythm disruption, and mood in reproductive-age women, although further research relating to specific mechanisms of risk are needed.

TI  - Fluoride exposure and CALCA methylation is associated with the bone mineral density of Chinese women
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Excessive exposure to fluoride has been reported to affect bone mineral density (BMD). CALCA expression plays a critical part in bone formation. However, the role of CALCA in the association between fluoride and BMD is not known. We conducted a cross-sectional study and recruited 722 women in rural areas of Henan Province, China, to assess the relationship between fluoride exposure, CALCA methylation, and BMD. Urinary levels of fluoride, CALCA methylation, and BMD were measured by a fluoride ion-selective electrode, standalone ultrasound bone densitometer, and quantitative methylation-specific polymerases chain reaction, respectively. The association among fluoride exposure, CALCA methylation, and BMD was age-specific. Specifically, BMD was negatively correlated with methylation (beta: -0.008; 95% CI: -0.016, 0.000) and fluoride exposure (beta: -0.063; 95% CI: -0.129, -0.002) in women over 45 years and 50-54 years of age, respectively, whereas methylation was positively correlated with fluoride exposure (beta: 4.953; 95% CI: 1.162, 8.743) in women aged 40-44 years. Besides, increased BMD in women aged 45-49 years induced by the interactive effect of the highest methylation of CALCA exon 1 (tertile 3) and fluoride exposure was observed (P for interaction < 0.05). Our findings suggest an age-specific association between exposure to excessive fluoride, CALCA methylation, and BMD in a rural population of women in China. Notably, the susceptibility of BMD to fluoride exposure may be modified by CALCA methylation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of nurse-led groupCBTfor hot flushes and night sweats in women with breast cancer: Results of theMENOS4randomised controlled trial
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
AB  - Objective Troublesome hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) are experienced by many women after treatment for breast cancer, impacting significantly on sleep and quality of life. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to be effective for the alleviation of HFNS. However, it is not known if it can effectively be delivered by specialist nurses. We investigated whether group CBT, delivered by breast care nurses (BCNs), can reduce the impact of HFNS. Methods We recruited women with primary breast cancer following primary treatment with seven or more HFNS/week (including 4/10 or above on the HFNS problem rating scale), from six UK hospitals to an open, randomised, phase 3 effectiveness trial. Participants were randomised to Group CBT or usual care (UC). The primary endpoint was HFNS problem rating at 26 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included sleep, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Results Between 2017 and 2018, 130 participants were recruited (CBT:63, control:67). We found a 46% (6.9-3.7) reduction in the mean HFNS problem rating score from randomisation to 26 weeks in the CBT arm and a 15% (6.5-5.5) reduction in the UC arm (adjusted mean difference -1.96, CI -3.68 to -0.23,P= .039). Secondary outcomes, including frequency of HFNS, sleep, anxiety and depression all improved significantly. Conclusion Our results suggest that specialist nurses can be trained to deliver CBT effectively to alleviate troublesome menopausal hot flushes in women following breast cancer in the NHS setting.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is the commonest dermatological problem internationally and nationally. Its incidence is increasing every year in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Though it is not a major health issue but it significantly affects the patient cosmetically, psychologically and socially. Previous studies have shown its association with lifestyle (age, diet, stress, sleep, smoking, exercise, obesity, etc.) and family history. By simple cost-effective lifestyle modification, its occurrence and late consequences could be minimized. Few hospital-based studies are done on this issue in Hail City, KSA. Hence present cross-sectional study was designed where data was collected by Google-Form from 484 residents of Hail City. Results have revealed that 65% of our respondents were suffering from mild to moderate Acne. Thirty percent of the respondents had BMI equal to more than 30. Majority of respondents (81%) had acne on whole face. Similarly, dairy products were also consumed by more than 50%. Majority of respondents (more than 50%) took chocolates, fast foods, oily foods and sea-foods. Nuts were taken quite often by 37% of respondents. Age between 21-25 years and oily skin have a highly significant association (p = 0.000) with development of acne. Other variables that show significant association with acne were being obese, stressful, irregular menstrual cycles and excessive intake of nuts.
   Hence there is a need to address this issue in order to design recommendations for the general public to minimize the incidence and consequences of acne vulgaris by simple lifestyle modifications.

TI  - Sex-specific associations between erythrocyte measures and obstructive sleep apnea
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: Hypoxemic effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been implicated in changes in erythropoiesis and hence erythrocyte measures. Sex differences are evident in both OSA and erythropoiesis. Whether sex modulates the relationship between severity of OSA and erythrocyte measures has not previously been studied.
   Methods: We examined a sample of 976 patients (38% women) who underwent overnight polysomnography and measurement of red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Patients were divided into primary snoring and mild, moderate, and severe OSA groups, separately by sex.
   Results: In multiple regression models, we found significant interactions between sex and oxygen desaturation index and apnea-hypopnea index on erythrocyte measures. Higher oxygen desaturation index and higher apnea-hypopnea index were independently associated with higher red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in women but not in men. Further ordinal logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between oxygen desaturation index (odds ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.66) and apnea-hypopnea index (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.84) and red blood cell count in women only. Correlation analysis also showed that erythrocyte measures and markers of cardiometabolic risk were more closely correlated in women than in men.
   Conclusions: This study provides novel data suggesting a significant association between erythrocyte measures and OSA severity in women but not in men. Similarly, the relationship between hematologic metrics and cardiometabolic risk markers was more pronounced in women than in men. Our findings suggest a sex-specific impact of OSA on erythrocyte measures and on their relationship with indexes of cardiometabolic risk.

TI  - Prospective association of obstructive sleep apnea risk factors with heart failure and its subtypes in postmenopausal women: The Women's Health Initiative
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heart failure (HF) incidence in postmenopausal women has been understudied, given the limited representation of women in heart failure studies. We investigated the relationship between OSA risk factors and HF and its subtypes in postmenopausal women.
   Methods: We performed a prospective analysis on the adjudicated HF outcomes in the Women's Health Initiative from enrollment (1993-1998) to September 30, 2016. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were defined as adjudicated acute HF hospitalization with EF >= 45% or <45%, respectively. We employed Cox regression to examine the association between OSA risk factors and symptoms (individually and using a summary risk score) and time to first hospitalized HF.
   Results: Of 42,362 women, 2,205 (5.21%) developed all HF, 1,162 (2.74%) women developed HFpEF, and 679 (1.60%) developed HFrEF. Individual OSA risk factors and symptoms, including obesity (hazard ratio = 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.48), snoring (hazard ratio = 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.46), and hypertension (HR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.35-1.56), were positively associated with risk of HF and HFpEF, but only hypertension was associated with HFrEF. When examined as a summary risk score compared with those with none of the OSA risk factors, presence of each additional factor was significantly associated with increased risk of hospitalized HF in a dose-response fashion for HFpEF (P trend < .001), but not HFrEF (P trend = .26).
   Conclusions: OSA risk factors and symptoms were associated with HFpEF, but not HFrEF, among postmenopausal women and are largely dependent on body mass index, snoring, and hypertension.

TI  - The association between sleep duration and prostate cancer A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - The association between sleep duration and prostate cancer (PCa) risk is still unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore if sleep duration is associated with PCa in men. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in November 2019 based on the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. After extracting the data, the random effects model was used to calculate the pooled Risk Ratio (RR) and it's 95% confidence interval (CI) to represent the correlation between sleep duration and PCa risk. Overall, we included 6 studies in our meta-analysis. Our pooled results showed that neither short sleep (RR = 0.99; 95%CI:0.91-1.07,P = .74) nor long sleep (RR = 0.88; 95%CI:0.75-1.04,P = .15) was associated with the risk of PCa. Sleep duration has no significant effect on PCa risk. Long sleep may have a potential protective effect on PCa incidence.

TI  - Melatonin attenuates light-at-night effects on systolic blood pressure and body temperature but does not affect diastolic blood pressure and heart rate circadian rhythms
T2  - BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH
AB  - Aim of the present study is to assess whether 1.5mg of exogenous melatonin provided under modified CR in constant light (similar to 400 lx) is capable to mimic effects of dark phase. Forty-six young adults (YA), 17-24 years old of both genders were studied under amodified CR protocol for 26 h. Initially, participants were investigated under constant light (CR-LL) and 2 weeks later under the same conditions though 1.5mg melatonin (Melaxen) was given orally at 22:30. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and body temperature (BT) were measured every 2 h. To verify the effect of constant light, formerly published results obtained under light-dark conditions (CR-LD) were reanalyzed. Administration of 1.5 mg of exogenous melatonin modified the 24 h patterns of BT and SBP within short 3.5 h time window but did not influence DBP and HR. A short-term reduction of SBP and BT for 1.5-3.5 hours was observed. The values in the CR-LL+M group were significantly lower than in CR-LL at 2:00 h. Hence, exogenous melatonin did mimic the scotophase. Though this effect was gender-specific and found only in female YA. Results of this study prompt further research to qualify and quantify dosage-, duration- and time-dependent differences of melatonin effects, to discern between short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) melatonin administration, and to clarify its underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy for menopausal symptoms
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - This article describes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for women with problematic menopausal symptoms, and provides the evidence from clinical trials of women going through the menopause, women with breast cancer treatment-induced symptoms and women with problematic symptoms in a work context. The CBT focus is primarily on vasomotor symptoms (VMS) but it also targets stress, low mood and sleep problems. CBT is a brief therapy (four to six sessions) that is theory- and evidence-based; it is acceptable to women and effectively reduces the impact of VMS, improves sleep and has benefits to quality of life. VMS frequency is also reduced significantly in some trials but not others. CBT has been found to be consistently effective when delivered in groups, self-help book and on-line formats (with or without additional support). The MENOS 1 and MENOS 2 CBT protocols are recommended for the treatment of VMS by the North American Menopause Society (2015); CBT has been recommended for the treatment of anxiety and depression for women during the menopause transition and post menopause (NICE, 2015); and telephone CBT has been shown to be an effective treatment for insomnia.

TI  - Burning mouth syndrome in postmenopausal women with self-reported sleep problems
T2  - CRANIO-THE JOURNAL OF CRANIOMANDIBULAR & SLEEP PRACTICE
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to investigate possible relationships among hematologic factors, psychological dimensions, the presence of self-reported sleep problems, and clinical characteristics in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Methods Twenty-five postmenopausal female patients with primary BMS (aged 55.2 +/- 9.6 years) were included. All participants underwent clinical and psychological evaluations and blood sampling. The patients were subdivided according to the absence or presence of the self-reported sleep problems. Results Pain intensity of BMS patients with sleep problems was significantly higher than those without sleep problems, and the severity of oral complaints was correlated with the presence of depression, anxiety, hostility, phobia, and psychosis. Estradiol levels were significantly lower, and FSH and LH levels were higher in BMS patients with sleep problems than those without sleep problems. Discussion BMS patients with sleep problems may suffer inharmonious psychoneuroendocrinological interactions that might worsen oral BMS symptoms.

TI  - Effects of Open-Label, Adjunctive Ganaxolone on Persistent Depression Despite Adequate Antidepressant Treatment in Postmenopausal Women: A Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: The neuroactive steroid metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, is a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors and a putative treatment for mood disorders. This pilot study was performed to determine whether an oral allopregnanolone analog (ganaxolone) may be effective adjunctive therapy for persistent depression despite adequate antidepressant treatment in postmenopausal women.
   Method: Ten postmenopausal women (mean +/- SD age: 62.8 +/- 6.3 years; range, 53-69 years) with persistent depression despite adequate antidepressant treatment (current DSM-IV-TR major depressive episode per the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score >= 16, and treated with an adequately dosed antidepressant for = 6 weeks) were studied from December 2016 to April 2018. Open-label ganaxolone (225 mg twice daily, increased to 450 mg twice daily if tolerated) was administered for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week taper.
   Results: Mean +/- SEM total MADRS score (primary endpoint) decreased by 8 weeks (24.4 +/- 1.6 to 12.8 +/- 2.9, P = .015), and the decrease persisted over the 2-week taper (P = .019); of the 9 subjects who completed the full 8-week treatment period, 44% (4/9) experienced response (MADRS score decrease = 50%) and remission (final MADRS score < 10), which persisted in 100% and 50% of subjects at 10 weeks, respectively. Secondary endpoints showed significant improvement, including Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report score (P = .003), MADRS reduced sleep subscale score (P < .001), total Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) score (P = .012), and scores on SDQ subscales for disruptions in sleep quality (P = .003) and changes in appetite and weight (P = .009) over 8 weeks. No significant effects were observed on quality of life or sexual function. All subjects experienced sleepiness and fatigue; 60% experienced dizziness.
   Conclusions: In this open-label, uncontrolled pilot study, adjunctive ganaxolone appears to exert antidepressant effects but produces sedation with twice-daily dosing. Ganaxolone may also improve sleep, which may be useful in patients with depression and insomnia.

TI  - Obesity, estrogens and adipose tissue dysfunction - implications for pulmonary arterial hypertension
T2  - PULMONARY CIRCULATION
AB  - Obesity is a prevalent global public health issue characterized by excess body fat. Adipose tissue is now recognized as an important endocrine organ releasing an abundance of bioactive adipokines including, but not limited to, leptin, adiponectin and resistin. Obesity is a common comorbidity amongst pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, with 30% to 40% reported as obese, independent of other comorbidities associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea). An 'obesity paradox' has been observed, where obesity has been associated with subclinical right ventricular dysfunction but paradoxically may confer a protective effect on right ventricular function once pulmonary hypertension develops. Obesity and pulmonary arterial hypertension share multiple pathophysiological mechanisms including inflammation, oxidative stress, elevated leptin (proinflammatory) and reduced adiponectin (anti-inflammatory). The female prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension has instigated the hypothesis that estrogens may play a causative role in its development. Adipose tissue, a major site for storage and metabolism of sex steroids, is the primary source of estrogens and circulating estrogens levels which are elevated in postmenopausal women and men with pulmonary arterial hypertension. This review discusses the functions of adipose tissue in both health and obesity and the links between obesity and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Shared pathophysiological mechanisms and the contribution of specific fat depots, metabolic and sex-dependent differences are discussed.

TI  - Psychological Climacteric Symptoms and Attitudes toward Menopause among Emirati Women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Menopause is an inevitable developmental event that women encounter at an age of 42-54 years. The drop of estrogen levels that accompanies cessation of menstruation is associated with multiple vasomotor, physical, neuropsychological, and sexual symptoms, which may hamper quality of life. This study aimed to examine the severity of psychological symptoms and their correlates among peri- and postmenopausal Emirati women (N = 60, mean age = 54.88 +/- 6 years). Participants were interviewed using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) and attitudes toward menopause scale (ATMS). In four path analysis models, vasomotor symptoms, weight gain, and fatigue had significant direct effects on symptoms of anxiety, depression (only weight gain and fatigue), and psychological distress. Fatigue significantly mediated the effects of vasomotor symptoms and weight gain on symptoms of anxiety, depression (only vasomotor symptoms), psychological distress, and memory problems. These models explained 47.6%, 44.5%, 56.6%, and 29.1% of the variances in anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and memory problems, respectively. Participants with more severe menopausal symptoms expressed more negative attitudes toward menopause though regression analysis revealed that only vasomotor symptoms could significantly contribute to ATMS scores. In conclusion, psychological distress is widespread among menopausal women, and it is associated with vasomotor symptoms, fatigue, and change of body composition (obesity). Psychological symptoms, along with vasomotor symptoms, express a key link to negative attitudes toward menopause. Therefore, interventional strategies that target psychological distress may promote coping with midlife transition and improve mental health among menopausal women.

TI  - Long-term hydroxychloroquine therapy improves the quality of sleep in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome: a real-world study
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) often suffer from sleep disturbance. Studies suggest it may be related to symptoms, including xerostomia and dry eyes. Clinical studies have confirmed that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has a definite effect on pSS, but there is no clear report about its effect on sleep disorders in pSS patients.
   Methods: A total of 383 pSS patients were enrolled and followed up. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the sleep quality of the patients, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) scale was used to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of patients. The European League assessed the patient's condition against Rheumatism Sjogren's syndrome patients reported index (ESSPRI). According to PSQI, patients were divided into two groups: good sleep group (GSG) and poor sleep group (PSG). The risk factors of sleep disorder are analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The patients were further divided into HCQ-administered group and non-administered group, and the differences of baseline characteristics and outcome in follow-up between the two groups were compared.
   Results: There were 208 patients with PSG (54.3%) and 175 patients with GSG (45.7%). Further, there is no statistical difference between the two groups in baseline data. Also, there were 112 cases (53.8%) and 118 cases (67.4%) taking HCQ in the two groups, respectively, P=0.007. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that long-term use of HCQ, menopause, and income were related to sleep quality. The patients were divided into the HCQ-administered group (n=230) and non-administered group (n=153) according to whether they took HCQ. One hundred eighteen patients (51.3%) in the HCQ-administered group had a good sleep, and 58 patients in the non-administered group had a good sleep (37.9%), P<0.05. At follow-up, the PSQI of the two groups were 7.3 +/- 2.1 vs. 8.1 +/- 2.4, respectively, P<0.05 and the ESSPRI were 4.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.3, P<0.05. The QoL of the two groups of patients was statistically different in all four dimensions, P<0.05.
   Conclusions: Long-term use of HCQ can reduce the risk of sleep disturbance in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome.

TI  - Associations of Urinary Phytoestrogen Concentrations with Sleep Disorders and Sleep Duration among Adults
T2  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - Current evidence on the relationship of phytoestrogens with sleep is limited and contradictory. In particular, studies on individual phytoestrogens and sleep have not been reported. Thus, this study aimed to appraise the associations of individual phytoestrogens with sleep disorders and sleep duration. This cross-sectional study comprising 4830 adults utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010. Phytoestrogens were tested in urine specimens. Sleep disorders and sleep duration were based on a self-reported doctor's diagnosis and usual sleep duration. The main analyses utilized logistic and multinomial logistic regression models and a restricted cubic spline. In the fully adjusted model, compared with tertile 1 (lowest), the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of sleep disorders for the highest tertile of urinary concentrations of enterolactone, enterodiol, and O-desmethylangolensin were 0.64 (0.41-1.00), 1.54 (1.07-2.21), and 1.89 (1.26-2.85), respectively. Linear inverse, approximatively linear positive, and inverted L-shaped concentration-response relationships were found between enterolactone, enterodiol, and O-desmethylangolensin and sleep disorders, respectively. Compared with normal sleep (7-8 h/night), the relative risk ratio (RRR) (95% CI) of very short sleep for enterolactone was 0.56 (0.36-0.86), and the RRR (95% CI) of long sleep risk for genistein was 0.62 (0.39-0.99). Furthermore, negative associations of genistein with sleep disorders and enterolactone with long sleep risk, as well as positive associations of enterodiol with both long and very short sleep, were observed in the stratified analysis by age or gender. Finally, a notable finding was that urinary O-desmethylangolensin concentration was positively related to sleep disorders in both females aged 40-59 years and non-Hispanic Whites but inversely associated with sleep disorders in both females aged 60 years or over and other Hispanics. Our findings suggested that enterolactone and genistein might be beneficial for preventing sleep disorders or non-normal sleep duration among adults, and enterodiol might be adverse toward this goal. However, the association of O-desmethylangolensin with sleep disorders might be discrepant in different races and females of different ages.

TI  - Association between Gait Variability and Gait-Ability Decline in Elderly Women with Subthreshold Insomnia Stage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This study investigates the gait characteristics of elderly women, aged more than 65 years, with subthreshold insomnia stage at various walking speeds. A total of 392 participants (insomnia: 202 and controls: 190) wearing shoe-type inertial measurement units completed walking tests on a treadmill for a duration of 1 min at slower, preferred, and faster speeds. The insomnia group indicated lower pace parameters (range of Cohen'sd: 0.283-0.499) and the single support phase (Cohen'sd: 0.237), greater gait variability (range of Cohen'sd: 0.217-0.506), and bilateral coordination (range of Cohen'sd: 0.254-0.319), compared with their age-matched controls; the coefficient of variance (CV) of the stance phase at the faster speed condition was a crucial variable for distinguishing between insomnia and control groups. In addition, the insomnia group demonstrated insufficient gait adaptation at the slower and preferred speeds, as indicated by the CVs of the stride length, stride time, and step time. In particular, participants with worsened insomnia symptoms or sleep problems showed that these worse gait patterns may increase the potential risk of falling in elderly women. Thus, elderly women with subthreshold insomnia stage need to improve their sleep quality to enhance their physical functions.

TI  - Mindfulness and Menopause- A Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Mind-body therapies hold several advantages from the viewpoint of security, fulfilment, implementation, and possible ancillary social and psychological health benefits. Side effects and risks of mind-body practice are generally nominal, implementation costs are little and most mind-body therapies can be performed by a broad range of populations, including overweight and sedentary menopausal women. The use of mind-body therapies for the alleviation of a menopausal symptoms is becoming increasingly common because of the perceived therapeutic benefits. The practice of mindfulness allows the participants to be aware of the present moment without concern for past or future consequences. Several researchers have discovered that being mindful may be helpful for menopausal women struggling with irritability, anxiety, and depression. The present study aimed at reviewing the literature which studies the impact of the mindfulness-based training on menopausal symptoms among women during their climacteric period. Many midlife women try out practices like relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, and yoga to help them get through these difficult times during their transitional period of life. Although these daily practices probably do not relieve symptoms such as hot flashes, they might improve overall wellbeing and help them sleep better. The literature was searched using databases such as CINAHL, Pub Med, Pro-Quest, and Google scholar. The search terms used were: menopause, menopausal symptoms, mindfulness, quality of life, and midlife transition. In India, the practice of mindfulness is not very well known among the menopausal women, so the aim of this review was to show a pathway to the primary health care workers like physicians, counsellors and the nurses, who can guide them about the practice of mindfulness thereby improving the quality of life.

TI  - NAMS 2019 Pre-Meeting Symposium, September 2019, Chicago Illinois: The Perimenopause
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - The North American Menopause Society held the 2019 Pre-Meeting Symposium on September 25, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois, to review the current state of the science related to the physiology of the perimenopause and to address management of the most prevalent and pressing clinical issues. The perimenopause, as defined by the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop + 10, encompasses the menopause transition as well as the first year following menopause, the final menstrual period. This phase in the continuum of women's reproductive lives had been one of the least well understood. Fortunately, contributions from a number of prospective, longitudinal, decades-long studies have provided a better understanding of the perimenopause, whereas posing important new questions related to symptom interaction and linkages between symptoms and long-term health. There is now added clarity to distinguish the effects of reproductive hormonal changes from aging. The variation in symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, among women over time including differences in experiences by ethnicity and race, provides paradigm shifts in clinical perspective. Refinements in understanding the character, timing, and potential predictive markers for menstrual cycles during the transition have emerged. From the perspective of myriad clinical management challenges, significant progress in recommendations for evaluation and therapeutic approaches has been achieved. Finally, recognizing the menopause transition as an opportunity to initiate positive lifestyle changes to enhance future health was emphasized.

TI  - Diet quality in adolescents with premenstrual syndrome: A cross-sectional study
T2  - NUTRITION & DIETETICS
AB  - Aim Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a complex of symptoms that can seriously affect the quality of life in women. It has been suggested that the nutritional status of adult women may influence the presence and/or severity of PMS symptoms. However, little is known about this association in adolescents. The present study aimed to examine the relationship between diet quality and the presence/severity of PMS symptoms in adolescents.
   Methods A case-control study of 272 female students, aged 13-18 years, was conducted in a high school. PMS was diagnosed and the symptoms were recorded using Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS)-2006 in 2 consecutive months. Dietary intake was assessed with 24-hour-dietary intake recall method and Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) score was calculated as an indicator of diet quality. Anthropometric measurements, including body weight, height, waist circumference and hip circumference were taken.
   Results PMS was diagnosed in 56.9% of the study sample. The mean HEI-2010 score was significantly lower in the PMS group (47.5 +/- 23.95) when compared to the control group (53.5 +/- 20.98), P = 0.034. The PMS symptoms, anxiety (P = 0.009), depressive feelings (P = 0.016) and changes in sleeping pattern (P = 0.000) were associated with lower diet quality scores in the PMS group. No significant difference in anthropometric measurements was observed between the groups.
   Conclusions The present study suggested that adolescents with a high-quality diet might experience depressive feelings, anxiety or changes in sleeping less when compared to those with a low quality diet. Therefore, the causal relationship between diet quality and presence/severity of PMS should be investigated in further studies.

TI  - Characteristics of women with different perinatal depression trajectories
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Maternal perinatal depression (PND), a common mental disorder with a prevalence of over 10%, is associated with long-term health risks for both mothers and offspring. This study aimed at describing characteristics related to background and lifestyle, pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum of different PND trajectories defined according to the onset of depressive symptoms. Participants were drawn from a large population-based cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden (n = 2,466). Five trajectory groups of depressive symptom onset were created using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale >= 13 (pregnancy) or >= 12 points (postpartum): (a) healthy (60.6%), (b) pregnancy depression (8.5%), (c) early postpartum onset (10.9%), (d) late postpartum onset (5.4%), and (e) chronic depression (14.6%). In multinomial logistic regressions, the associations between trajectories and the included characteristics were tested using the healthy trajectory as reference. Background characteristics (younger age, lower education, unemployment) were primarily associated with pregnancy depression and chronic depression. Characteristics associated with all PND trajectories were smoking prior to pregnancy, migraine, premenstrual mood symptoms, intimate partner violence, interpersonal trauma, negative delivery expectations, pregnancy nausea, and symphysiolysis. Nulliparity, instrumental delivery, or a negative delivery experience was associated with early postpartum onset. Postpartum factors (e.g., infantile colic, lack of sleep, low partner support, and bonding difficulties) were associated with early and late postpartum onset together with chronic depression. The findings suggest that different PND trajectories have divergent characteristics, which could be used to create individualized treatment options. To find the most predictive characteristics for different PND trajectories, studies with even larger and more diverse samples are warranted.

TI  - Symptoms at midlife among women in Nagaland, India
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives This article highlights the prevalence of symptom frequencies in Nagaland, India, with a focus on depressed mood and hot flashes. We also examine how symptoms cluster together among Naga women and identify factors associated with symptom experience. We hypothesized an elevated frequency of depressed mood because of the stresses associated with social responsibilities within a patriarchal culture, and a low frequency of hot flashes because of the thinness of the population. Methods Standardized questionnaires with close-ended questions were used to determine the frequency of symptoms and sociodemographic and health parameters among women aged 35 to 65 years (n = 352). Factor analysis was used to examine the relations among symptoms. Bivariate analyses and linear regressions were also employed to identify sociodemographic and health factors associated with symptoms. Results Menopausal symptoms, such as feeling dizzy or faint, anxiety or panic, and excitable, were significantly higher in premenopausal women; hot flashes in perimenopausal women; and feeling tired or lack in energy, headaches, difficulty in sleeping, and muscle or joint pain in postmenopausal women. Four symptom factors were identified: symptoms related to the loss of estradiol, psychosomatic symptoms, uneasiness, and depressed mood. After adjusting for menopausal status, socioeconomic status, education, and self-reported health status, body mass index was observed to be inversely associated with the depressed mood factor but not other factors. Conclusion In the context of Nagaland, India, having extra weight may contribute to emotional well-being; however, further research is warranted.

TI  - Neuropsychological function is related to irritable bowel syndrome in women with premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
AB  - Background There is increasing evidence demonstrating the co-occurrence of primary dysmenorrhea (PD), premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women. This study aimed to investigate whether women who have symptoms of IBS in addition to PD and PMS also report more severe or frequent menstruation-associated symptoms and psychological complications compared to women with PD and PMS alone. Methods The study group included 182 female University students aged 18-25 years. IBS was diagnosed using the Rome III criteria. The severity of PMS and PD was determined using a 10-point visual analog scale and PSST (Premenstrual Syndrome Screening Tool), respectively. Neuropsychological functions including cognitive function, depression score, anxiety score, stress, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, quality of life and personality were assessed using standard questionnaires. Results Of the 182 young females, 31 (17.0%) had IBS. Average days of bleeding during the menstrual cycle and mean pain severity on the PSST scale were significantly greater in the group with IBS compared to the non-IBS group (p < 0.01). The non-IBS individuals scored more favorably than the women with IBS with respect to severity of depression, insomnia, daytime sleepiness (p < 0.05). The PSST scores were significantly correlated with scores for depression (r = 0.29;p < 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.28;p < 0.001), stress (r = 0.32;p < 0.001), insomnia (r = 0.34;p < 0.001) and daytime sleepiness (r = 0.31;p < 0.001); while, they were negatively correlated with cognitive abilities (r = - 0.20;p = 0.006) and quality of life (r = - 0.42;p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that the PSST scores were possibly significant factors in determining the scores for depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life, insomnia and daytime sleepiness (p < 0.05). Conclusion IBS is related to psychological comorbidities, in particular depression, sleep problems and menstrual-associated disorders. IBS may exacerbate the features of PMS which should be taken into account in the management of PMS.

TI  - High-Fat Diet Alters Circadian Rhythms in Mammary Glands of Pubertal Mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Childhood obesity in girls is associated with early puberty and menarche. Breast tissue exhibits circadian rhythms. These rhythms may be altered by environmental factors. We hypothesized that a high-fat diet (HFD) disrupts circadian rhythms in pubertal mammary glands. Weanling female C57BL/6 mice were fed the standard AIN93G diet or a HFD (providing 16% or 45% of energy from soybean oil) for 3 weeks. Mammary glands were harvested from 6-week-old mice every 4 h on Zeitgeber time over a 48-h period; rhythmic expressions of circadian genes and genes encoding estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were analyzed by using the Cosinor model. HFD, compared to AIN93G diet, altered diurnal oscillations of circadian genes in pubertal mammary glands. These included changes in amplitude ofPer2, Cry1(reduced),Clock, Rev-erb alpha, andPer1(elevated), a delay in acrophase (the hour at which the rhythm peaks) ofBmal1by 2.2 h, and changes in mesor (the mean of the rhythm from peak to trough) ofBmal1, Per2, Cry1(reduced),Rev-reb alpha, andPer1(elevated). Furthermore, HFD altered diurnal expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor at both mRNA and protein levels. These findings indicate that HFD alters circadian regulation in pubertal mammary glands, which may contribute to the disturbance of hormonal homeostasis and lead to early development and growth of mammary glands in pubertal mice.

TI  - Both objective and paradoxical insomnia elicit a stress response involving mitokine production
T2  - AGING-US
AB  - Chronic insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in the elderly population. From 9 to 50% of patients suffer of paradoxical insomnia, with the same symptoms and ailments, though characterized by normal sleep patterns. We have investigated the level of parameters related to stress in a group of post-menopausal female patients (age range 55-70 years) suffering by either objective or paradoxical insomnia, in particular we have measured 24-hours urinary cortisol, allostatic load index, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, and, for the first time, mitokines (mitochondria) stress response molecules) such as FGF21, GDF15 and Humanin (HN). Results show that the two groups are different as far as sleep efficiency score, as expected, but not for stress parameters, that in some cases resulted within the normality range, although quite close to the top threshold (such as cortisol) or much higher with respect to normality ranges (such as PSS). Therefore, the consequences of paradoxical insomnia on the expression of these parameters are the same as objective insomnia. As far as the level of mitokines, we showed that FGF21 and HN in particular resulted altered (decreased and increased, respectively) with respect to control population, however with no difference between the two groups of patients.

TI  - 17 beta-Estradiol augments the neuroprotective effect of agomelatine in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in ovariectomized rats
T2  - PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Rationale and objective Estradiol decline has been associated with depression and anxiety in post-menopausal women. Agomelatine (Ago) is an agonist of the melatonergic MT1/MT2 receptors and an antagonist of the serotonergic 5-HT2c receptors. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of combining Ago with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on ovariectomy (OVX)-induced depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in young adult female rats. Methods OVX rats were treated with Ago (40 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 10 days starting 1 week after surgery alone or combined with two doses of E2 (40 mu g/kg/day, s.c.) given before behavioral testing. Results Co-administration of E2 enhanced the anti-depressant and anxiolytics effects of Ago as evidenced by decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test, as well as increased time spent in the open arms and number of entries to open arms in the elevated plus-maze. In parallel, Ago increased hippocampal norepinephrine, dopamine, melatonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Meanwhile, Ago-treated rats exhibited reduced hippocampal nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) P65 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine level. Ago upregulated estrogen receptor (ER alpha and beta) mRNA expression in the hippocampus of OVX rats and elevated serum estradiol levels. Co-administration of E2 with Ago synergistically decreased NF-kB P65 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased BDNF levels. Conclusion E2 augmented the neuroprotective effect of Ago in OVX rats via its anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects. The combined treatment of E2 and Ago should be further investigated as a treatment of choice for depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances associated with menopause.

TI  - Effect of zinc supplementation on quality of life and sleep quality in young women with premenstrual syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
AB  - Introduction Premenstrual syndrome is a prevalent disorder affecting a large number of women in their reproductive ages. Nutritional importance of zinc has been known for a long time and studies have shown that zinc can positively affect psychological disorders. Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of zinc supplementation on quality of life and sleep quality of young women diagnosed with premenstrual syndrome. Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out on 60 young university women that were allocated into two groups of intervention who took 30 mg/day of elemental zinc or placebo for three months. Pre- and post-intervention, participants completed the questionnaires of quality of life and Pittsburgh sleep quality. Results After supplementation, quality of life score in the intervention group was increased (+ 9.185 +/- 7.29, P < 0.001), however, in comparison with the control group, results were not significant; Physical aspects of quality of life score were significantly enhanced (+ 5.55 +/- 3.71 vs. + 0.13 +/- 2.87, P < 0.001). Sleep quality was marginally improved just in the zinc group (- 1.48 +/- 4.12, P = 0.07). Conclusion Zinc supplementation for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on physical aspects of quality of life in young women with premenstrual syndrome.

TI  - Outdoor light at night and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in the NIH-AARP diet and health study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Circadian disruption may play a role in breast carcinogenesis. Previous studies reported relationships between outdoor light at night (LAN) and the breast cancer risk, but their findings are mixed. There is also a need to examine LAN and breast cancer incidence according to different individual and environmental characteristics to identify subpopulations at greater risk associated with LAN exposure. We studied residential outdoor LAN estimated from satellite imagery at baseline (1996) in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer incidence over similar to 16 years of follow-up in 186 981 postmenopausal women including 12 318 incident postmenopausal breast cancer cases in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the relationship between quintiles of LAN and postmenopausal breast cancer risk, overall and by hormone receptor status and cancer stage. We found that when compared to women in the lowest quintile of baseline LAN, those in the highest quintile had a 10% increase in postmenopausal breast cancer risk (HR (95% CI), 1.10 (1.02, 1.18), P-trend, .002). The association appeared to be stronger for estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (1.12 [1.02, 1.24], .007) than for ER-negative cancer (1.07 [0.85, 1.34], .66). Our findings also suggested that the relationship between LAN and breast cancer risk may differ by individual characteristics, such as smoking, alcohol drinking, sleep duration and BMI, and neighborhood environment. In conclusion, our study suggests that higher outdoor LAN exposure may be a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer.

TI  - Sex Differences of Migraine: Results of a Nationwide Home-based Study in Turkey
T2  - NOROPSIKIYATRI ARSIVI-ARCHIVES OF NEUROPSYCHIATRY
AB  - Introduction: The prevalence of migraine was found to be more than three-fold higher in women as compared with men, and in addition to differences in prevalence rates, the characteristics and associated features might also differ between the sexes. The aim of this study was to compare sex-specific features of migraine and demographic parameters in a nationwide population-based study in Turkey.
   Methods: Among 5323 subjects, a total of 871 patients who were diagnosed as having definite migraine according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders-III (ICHD-III) were included in our study. The demographic characteristics, associated features, and triggers of migraine were examined with regard to sex.
   Results: The study group comprised 640 women (73.5%) and 231 men (26.5%), with a female to male ratio of 2.8:1. Attack duration, mean migraine disability assessment scores (MIDAS), frequencies of nausea, vomiting, osmophobia, vertigo/dizziness, and allodynia were found significantly different between women and men. When we compared these parameters between men and postmenopausal women, all these parameters were still significant except nausea. Odor was statistically more frequent as a reported trigger in women, whereas excessive sleep was a statistically more frequent triggering factor in men. The rates of depression and allergy were significantly higher in women when compared with men.
   Conclusion: Longer attack duration, higher MIDAS scores, and the frequencies of nausea, vomiting, osmophobia, vertigo/dizziness, and allodynia were more significant in women and this variance in sex persisted after menopause. Also, some trigger factors and co-morbidities differed between the sexes. These findings might result from complex genetic factors besides sociocultural influences, biologic, and sociocultural roles. Future studies should continue to explore biologic and genetic factors with respect to sex in migraine.

TI  - Implementing of mental health training programs for promotion of health affected teenage girls to premenstrual syndrome: A community-based study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental health is one of the major determinants of a person's health which has a significant impact on the quality of life. Implementing of mental health training programs for promotion of health affected teenage girls to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in Shiraz, southern Iran: a community-based study.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is randomized controlled trial done on 100 teenage girls affected to PMS in Shiraz-Iran (selected from400 girls). Multistage cluster sampling method was used f or sampling. In the intervention group, six training sessions were held twice a week for 2 h. For data collection, Standard Goldberg Mental Health Questionnaire-28 and Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool were used. For data analysis, independent t-test and Chi-square statistics were used at significant level of 0.05.
   RESULTS: The average age was (16.56 +/- 0.92) and (16.24 +/- 1.45) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The average intensity of physical complaints, level of anxiety and sleep disorder, level of social functions disorders and depression were significantly lower in the group of training classes than control group (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: Appropriate training-care programs are effective in reducing stress and improving mental health, prevention and treatment of mental disorders, emotional growth, and development of communication skills among female students with premenstrual syndrome.

TI  - Lung cancer aggressiveness in an intermittent hypoxia murine model of postmenopausal sleep apnea
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Intermittent hypoxia (IH)-a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-enhances lung cancer progression in mice via altered host immune responses that are also age and sex-dependent. However, the interactions of menopause with IH on tumor malignant properties remain unexplored. Here, we aimed to investigate lung cancer outcomes in the context of ovariectomy (OVX)-induced menopause in a murine model of OSA. Methods: Thirty-four female mice (C57BL/6, 12-week-old) were subjected to bilateral OVX or to Sham intervention. Six months after surgery, mice were pre-exposed to either IH or room air (RA) for 2 weeks. Then, 10(5)lung carcinoma (LLC1) cells were injected subcutaneously in the left flank, with IH or RA exposures continued for 4 weeks. Tumor weight, tumor invasion, and spontaneous lung metastases were assessed. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were isolated and subjected to flow cytometry polarity evaluation along with assessment of TAMs modulation of LLC1 proliferation in vitro. To determine the effect of IH and OVX on each experimental variable, a two-way analysis of variance was performed. Results: IH and OVX promoted a similar increase in tumor growth (similar to 2-fold;P = 0.05 and similar to 1.74-fold;P < 0.05, respectively), and OVX-IH further increased it. Regarding lung metastasis, the concurrence of OVX in mice exposed to IH enhanced the number of metastases (23.7 +/- 8.0) in comparison to those without OVX (7.9 +/- 2.8;P < 0.05). The pro-tumoral phenotype of TAMS, assessed as M2/M1 ratio, was increased in OVX (0.06 +/- 0.01;P < 0.01) and IH (0.06 +/- 0.01;P < 0.01) compared with sham/RA conditions (0.14 +/- 0.03). The co-culture of TAMS with naive LLC1 cells enhanced their proliferation only under IH. Conclusion: In female mice, both the IH that is characteristically present in OSA and OVX as a menopause model emerge as independent contributors that promote lung cancer aggressiveness and seemingly operate through alterations in the host immune response.

TI  - Comparison of diurnal variation, anatomical location, and biological sex within spontaneous and driven dynamic cerebral autoregulation measures
T2  - PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB  - Presently, the literature describing the influence of diurnal variation on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) metrics is sparse. Additionally, there is little data with respect to dCA comparisons between anterior/posterior circulation beds and biological sexes using squat-stand maneuvers. Eight male and eight female participants (n = 16) performed 5 min of spontaneous upright rest and squat-stand maneuvers at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz across seven time points throughout the day. All testing sessions commenced at 8:00 a.m. each day and dCA parameters were quantified across the cardiac cycle (diastole, mean, and systole) using transcranial Doppler ultrasound to insonate cerebral blood velocity within the middle and posterior cerebral arteries (MCA, PCA). No cardiac cycle alternations were seen spontaneous (all p > .207) while a trend was noted in some driven (all p > .051) dCA metrics. Driven dCA produced much lower coefficient of variances (all <21%) compared with spontaneous (all <58%). Moreover, no sex differences were found within driven metrics (all p > .096). Between vessels, PCA absolute gain was reduced within all spontaneous and driven measures (all p < .014) whereas coherence, phase, and normalized gain were unchanged (all p > .099). There appears to be little influence of diurnal variation on dCA measures across the day (8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.). Absolute gain was blunted in the PCA relative to the MCA and consistent with previous literature, driven methods demonstrated vastly improved reproducibility metrics compared to spontaneous methods. Finally, no dCA differences were found between biological sexes, demonstrating that males and females regulate in a harmonious manner, when females are tested within the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated with Low Back Pain among A Group of 1510 Pregnant Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Low Back Pain (LBP) is a frequent, very common, and costly health problem. LBP, which occurs during pregnancy, may become a lifelong problem. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with LBP in pregnant women. Methods: The study included 1510 pregnant women. A questionnaire assessing demography, lifestyle, prevalence, and characteristics was designed and used in the study. Pain intensity was assessed with the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). The RMDQ (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) was used to assess the effect that low back pain had on the functional capacity of a pregnant woman. Middle (thoracic) and low back pain disability was measured with the help of the ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) questionnaire. Results: The study confirmed that lying/sleeping (49.6%) and sitting positions (38.7%) as well as walking (37.2%) are the most significant factors causing LBP. It was also found that women who had not engaged in physical activity were more likely to experience LBP. Conclusions: Predisposing factors for LBP in pregnancy are LBP in previous pregnancies, back pain during menstruation, a younger age and a lack of physical activity. Most women in pregnancy with LBP experienced minimal and mild disability.

TI  - Sleep characteristics and white matter hyperintensities among midlife women
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Sleep disturbance is common among midlife women. Poor self-reported sleep characteristics have been linked to cerebrovascular disease and dementia risk. However, little work has considered the relation of objectively assessed sleep characteristics and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), a marker of small vessel disease in the brain. Among 122 midlife women, we tested whether women with short or disrupted sleep would have greater WMH, adjusting for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, estradiol, and physiologically assessed sleep hot flashes.
   Methods: We recruited 122 women (mean age = 58 years) without a history of stroke or dementia who underwent 72 h of actigraphy to quantify sleep, 24 h of physiologic monitoring to quantify hot flashes; magnetic resonance imaging to assess WMH; phlebotomy, questionnaires, and physical measures (blood pressure, height, and weight). Associations between actigraphy-assessed sleep (wake after sleep onset and total sleep time) and WMH were tested in linear regression models. Covariates included demographics, CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes), estradiol, mood, and sleep hot flashes.
   Results: Greater actigraphy-assessed waking after sleep onset was associated with more WMH [B(SE)=.008 (.002), p = 0.002], adjusting for demographics, CVD risk factors, and sleep hot flashes. Findings persisted adjusting for estradiol and mood. Neither total sleep time nor subjective sleep quality was related to WMH.
   Conclusions: Greater actigraphy-assessed waking after sleep onset but not subjective sleep was related to greater brain WMH among midlife women. Poor sleep may be associated with brain small vessel disease at midlife, which can increase the risk for brain disorders.

TI  - Neonatal EEG sleep stage classification based on deep learning and HMM
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Objective. Automatic sleep stage scoring is of great importance for investigating sleep architecture during infancy. In this work, we introduce a novel multichannel approach based on deep learning networks and hidden Markov models (HMM) to improve the accuracy of sleep stage classification in term neonates.Approach. The classification performance was evaluated on quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) stages, each with two sub-states, using multichannel EEG data recorded from sixteen neonates with postmenstrual age of 38-40 weeks. A comprehensive set of linear and nonlinear features were extracted from thirty-second EEG segments. The feature space dimensionality was then reduced by using an evolutionary feature selection method called MGCACO (Modified Graph Clustering Ant Colony Optimization) based on the relevance and redundancy analysis. A bi-directional long-short time memory (BiLSTM) network was trained for sleep stage classification. The number of channels was optimized using the sequential forward selection method to reduce the spatial space. Finally, an HMM-based postprocessing stage was used to reduce false positives by incorporating the knowledge of transition probabilities between stages into the classification process. The method performance was evaluated using the K-fold (KFCV) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategies.Main results. Using six-bipolar channels, our method achieved a mean kappa and an overall accuracy of 0.71-0.76 and 78.9%-82.4% using the KFCV and LOOCV strategies, respectively.Significance. The presented automatic sleep stage scoring method can be used to study the neurodevelopmental process and to diagnose brain abnormalities in term neonates.

TI  - Sleep Quality, Anxiety, and Depression Are Associated with Fall Risk Factors in Older Women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Gait, dynamic balance, and functional mobility problems are well-known fall risk factors. Furthermore, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression are prevalent among older women. This study aimed to analyze the associations of sleep quality, anxiety, and depression with functional mobility, gait speed, and dynamic balance in community-dwelling postmenopausal women aged >= 60 years. A total of 271 women (69.18 +/- 5.69 years) participated in this study. Functional mobility (Timed Up-and-Go Test), dynamic balance (3-meter tandem walk test), gait speed (OptoGait (R) optical detection system), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were assessed. Our results showed that poor sleep efficiency and the use of sleeping medication were related to decreased gait speed (R-2 = 0.072). Poor functional mobility was linked to depression and the use of sleeping medication (R-2 = 0.159). Additionally, increased symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated with worsened dynamic balance (R-2 = 0.127). In conclusion, poorer sleep quality is associated with slower gait speed and reduced functional mobility, which is also related, along with impaired dynamic balance, to higher levels of anxiety and depression.

TI  - Polysomnographic Pattern of Melatonin Therapy in Perimenopausal Women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Earlier, we described our own study results of the chronobiological circadian rhythm of salivary fluid melatonin secretion in menopausal women, which allowed us pathogenetically to substantiate the use of melatonin drugs for insomnia in the perimenopausal period. The aim of this research was to evaluate the sleep quality using polysomnographic monitoring in perimenopausal women with sleep disorders (SDs) before and after 3 months of melatonin therapy.
   Methods and Results: The study involved 21 perimenopausal women with complaints of SDs. All women completed a questionnaire to assess the subjective severity of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI) and underwent a clinical-anamnestic and gynecological examination. Polysomnography (PSG) was performed before and after 3 months melatonin therapy in a daily dose of 3 mg. After melatonin intake, PSG demonstrated improvement in sleep latency, overall sleep efficiency, and an increase of REM sleep. A statistically significant number of EEG activation reactions indicate a decrease in sleep fragmentation and an improvement in sleep segmental structure.
   Conclusions: The use of melatonin in a dose of 3 mg/day for 3 months is one of the main methods for treatment of SDs in age-related estrogen-deficient situations. The main clinical effect, which significantly improves the quality of life, is associated with the elimination of pre- and intrasomnic disorders.

TI  - Clinical profile of comorbid dysmenorrhea and bladder sensitivity: a cross-sectional analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antecedents of chronic pelvic pain are not well characterized, but pelvic organ visceral sensitivity is a hallmark of these disorders. Recent studies have identified that some dysmenorrhea sufferers are much more likely to exhibit comorbid bladder hypersensitivity. Presumably, these otherwise healthy women may be at higher risk of developing full-blown chronic bladder pain later in life. To encourage early identification of patients harboring potential future risk of chronic pain, we describe the clinical profile of women matching this putative pain-risk phenotype.
   OBJECTIVE(S): The objectives of the study were to characterize demographic, menstrual, pelvic examination, and psychosocial profiles of young women with comorbid dysmenorrhea and bladder hypersensitivity, defined using a standardized experimental visceral provocation test, contrasted with healthy controls, pure dysmenorrhea sufferers, and women with existing bladder pain syndrome.
   STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study acquired data on participants with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea (n = 212), healthy controls (n = 44), and bladder pain syndrome (n = 27). A subgroup of dysmenorrhea patients was found on screening with noninvasive oral water challenge to report significantly higher bladder pain during experimentally monitored spontaneous bladder filling (>15 out of 100 on visual analogue scale, based on prior validation studies) and separately defined as a group with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain. Medical/menstrual history and pain history were evaluated with questionnaires. Psychosocial profile and impact were measured with validated self-reported health status Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short forms and a Brief Symptom Inventory for somatic sensitivity. Pelvic anatomy and sensory sensitivity were examined via a standardized physical examination and a tampon provocation test.
   RESULTS: In our largely young, single, nulliparous cohort (24 +/- 1 years old), approximately a quarter (46 out of 212) of dysmenorrhea sufferers tested positive for the dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain phenotype. Dysmenorrhea-only sufferers were more likely to be African American (24%) than healthy controls (5%, post hoc chi(2), P = .007). Pelvic examination findings did not differ in the nonchronic pain groups, except for tampon test sensitivity, which was worse in dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain and dysmenorrhea sufferers vs healthy controls (2.6 +/- 0.3 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 vs 0.7 +/- 0.2, P < .05). Consistent with heightened pelvic sensitivity, participants with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain also had more nonmenstrual pain, dysuria, dyschezia, and dyspareunia (P's < .05). Participants with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain had Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Physical T- scores of 47.7 +/- 0.9, lower than in women with dysmenorrhea only (52.3 +/- 0.5), and healthy controls 56.1 +/- 0.7 (P < .001). Similarly, they had lower Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Mental T-score than healthy controls (47.8 +/- 1.1 vs 52.8 +/- 1.2, P = .017). Similar specific impairments were observed on Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales for anxiety, depression, and sleep in participants with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain vs healthy controls.
   CONCLUSION: Women with dysmenorrhea who are unaware they also have bladder sensitivity exhibit broad somatic sensitivity and elevated psychological distress, suggesting combined preclinical visceral sensitivity may be a precursor to chronic pelvic pain. Defining such precursor states is essential to conceptualize and test preventative interventions for chronic pelvic pain emergence. Dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain is also associated with higher self-reported pelvic pain unrelated to menses, suggesting central nervous system changes are present in this potential precursor state.

TI  - Association between dairy consumption and menopausal symptoms: A cross-sectional study among Iranian postmenopausal women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL DAIRY JOURNAL
AB  - The association between dairy food consumption and menopausal symptoms was evaluated with a cross-sectional study conducted on 393 postmenopausal women. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake over a year; menopausal symptoms were measured using a menopause rating scale (MRS) questionnaire. The total MRS score was the sum of the somatic, psychological, and urogenital scores. After adjustment for age, years since menopause, education level, BMI, physical activity, energy intake, healthy eating index and fibre intake, higher total dairy intake was related to lower somatic (beta -0.184; P-value <0.001), psychological (beta -0.155; P-value 0.002) and total MRS (beta -0.184; P-value <0.001) scores. In addition, higher intake of low-fat dairy was associated with lower somatic (beta -0.175; P-value <0.001), psychological (beta -0.181; P-value <0.001) and total MRS (beta -0.189; P-value <0.001) scores. Regular consumption of low fat dairy may be beneficial in improving somatic and psychological symptoms of menopause. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Poor sleep and emotion dysregulation mediate the association between depressive and premenstrual symptoms in young adult women
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - A large portion of reproductive-aged women report experiencing distressing premenstrual symptoms. These symptoms can be exacerbated by concurrent mood problems and contribute to long-term depressive risk. However, difficulty sleeping and regulating emotional responses are also associated with the premenstrual phase and represent additional, well-established risk factors for depression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether habitual sleep problems and emotion regulation strategies serve to mediate the relationship between mood and premenstrual symptoms in non-treatment-seeking young women. Participants included 265 adult women between the ages of 18 and 25 who provided retrospective self-reports of depressive symptoms, habitual sleep quality, and premenstrual symptoms for the past month. Trait-based difficulties in regulating emotions were also assessed. Greater depressive symptoms significantly predicted greater premenstrual symptoms and both poor sleep and ineffective emotion regulation were shown to mediate this relationship. Poor sleep may enhance experience of premenstrual symptoms via its well-established impact on physical, cognitive, and/or affective functioning. Similarly, an inability to effectively regulate emotional responses in general may exacerbate experience or perception of somatic and mood symptoms during the premenstrual period, contributing to mood disturbances and risk. Findings require replication in future studies using prospective designs and more diverse samples of women.

TI  - Consideration of Cough Reflex Development When Ordering Modified Barium Swallow Studies in Infants
T2  - DYSPHAGIA
AB  - Infants < 51 weeks post-menstrual age (< 51 PMA) are often referred for modified barium swallow (MBS) studies for suspected silent aspiration (SA) given a possible association between SA and aspiration pneumonia. Infants this young are unlikely to have developed a mature laryngeal cough reflex, most likely rendering SA an expected finding in those who aspirate. The aims of this retrospective review were to (1) determine if SA resolves in a significant proportion of infants around the expected emergence of the laryngeal cough reflex, (2) determine which factors or characteristics are associated with and without SA resolution in these infants, and (3) determine if SA, or any aspiration, is associated with increased rates of lower respiratory infection (including aspiration pneumonia) in these infants. Results from the chart review revealed that 79/148 (53.4%) infants had SA on MBS < 51 PMA. 16/48 (33.3%) infants assessed for SA by the time of the expected emergence of the cough reflex had resolution. SA resolution was less common in infants with obstructive sleep apnea (p = 0.037). A total of 50/70 (71.4%) infants with a follow-up MBS had eventual SA resolution. Aspiration was not significantly associated with LRI, including aspiration pneumonia. The results suggested that the laryngeal cough reflex might develop later than reported in the literature and there is no association between aspiration and LRI. These findings may indicate that age should be considered before ordering an MBS solely to assess for SA in this population. The study provides preliminary evidence for future prospective research regarding SA resolution.

TI  - Concomitants of menopause-specific quality of life in premenopausal and post-menopausal women living in South Korea
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - The present study investigated the concomitants of menopause-specific quality of life among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Based on the Wilson and Cleary model of quality of life, this cross-sectional study recruited 329 women of age 40-65 years following operational convenience. The study was conducted in the office of the Korea Population, Health and Welfare Association (KPHWA) in Incheon, South Korea. Data collected on sociodemographic characteristics, social support, biological/physiological characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-K), and self-rated health. Menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire (MENQOL) was used in this study. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was performed. The study found that social support and self-rated health were negatively correlated with MENQOL in premenopausal women, while the income level and self-rated health were negatively associated with MENQOL in postmenopausal women. Sleep quality was positively correlated with MENQOL in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The study results indicate the need for tailored approaches based on menopausal status. Especially, social support may help improve the MENQOL of premenopausal women, while in postmenopausal women, improved sleep quality may enhance their menopause-specific quality of life.

TI  - Age-varying associations between lifestyle risk factors and major depressive disorder: a nationally representative cross-sectional study of adolescents
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Lifestyle risk factors, such as alcohol use, smoking, high body mass index, poor sleep, and sedentary behavior, represent major public health issues for adolescents. These factors have been associated with increased rates of major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of this paper is to investigate critical peaks in the prevalence of MDD at certain ages and to examine how these peaks might be amplified or attenuated by the presence of lifestyle risk factors. Methods A nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 11-17 years old (n = 2967) and time-varying effect models were used to investigate the associations between lifestyle risk factors and the prevalence of MDD by sex. Results The estimated prevalence of MDD significantly increased among adolescents from 4% (95% CI 3-6%) at 13 years of age to 19% (95% CI 15-24%) at 16 years of age. From the age of 13, males were significantly less likely to have a diagnosis of MDD than females with the maximum sex difference occurring at the age of 15 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13-0.47). All lifestyle risk factors were at some point significantly associated with MDD, but these associations did not differ by sex, except for body mass index. Discussion These findings suggest that interventions designed to prevent the development of depression should be implemented in early adolescence, ideally before or at the age of 13 and particularly among young females given that the prevalence of MDD begins to rise and diverge from young males. Interventions should also simultaneously address lifestyle risk factors and symptoms of major depression.

TI  - Night shift work and osteoporosis among female blue-collar workers in Poland-a pilot study
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Osteoporosis is an important public health problem worldwide. Although a number of factors that affect bone structure have been described; thus far, the current knowledge of occupational factors that may have an influence on bone tissue metabolism is strongly limited. Published studies indicate night shift work and the related circadian rhythm disruption may be considered as plausible underlying factors. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential association between night shift work and bone mineral density (BMD) among female blue-collar workers in Poland. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 194 female blue-collar workers >40 years of age employed in industrial plants. The operating system of work consisted of three work shifts clockwise rotation: morning (06:00-14:00 h), afternoon (14:00-22:00 h), and night (22:00-06:00 h), with five consecutive shifts per week followed by a free weekend. A questionnaire survey, based on a Polish version of The European vertebral osteoporosis study (EVOS) questionnaire, a validated instrument, was administered. Data on current job characteristics, job seniority, and lifetime duration of night shift work were also collected. BMD of the lumbar spine and hip (both total femur and femoral neck) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Multivariate linear regression models were run, with bone mineralization parameters as dependent variables, as well as night work characteristics and important confounders. Statistical analysis was performed separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The analyses adjusted for confounders did not reveal any significant differences between current or lifetime experience of night shift work and BMD among both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, the outcomes supported the well-established correlation with factors, such as age, BMI, and menopausal status. BMD at the three sites measured was significantly associated with BMI (p< .001) and inversely associated with age (p< .001) in the total study population. Postmenopausal women had significantly lower BMD than did premenopausal women (p< .001). The study findings indicate that in the population of Polish female blue-collar workers, the system of work does not seem to be associated with the development of osteoporosis.

TI  - Sleep disturbance is associated with an increased risk of menstrual problems in female Chinese university students
T2  - SLEEP AND BREATHING
AB  - Purpose We aimed to investigate the association between sleep disturbance and menstrual problems in female Chinese university students. Methods A convenience sample of 1006 female university students participated in this study. Sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia symptoms were assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. A structured questionnaire was used to assess participants' demographics and menstrual characteristics. Results The prevalence rates of irregular menstrual cycle, heavy menstrual bleeding, menstrual flow length >= 7 days, period pain, and premenstrual syndrome were significantly higher in participants with sleep disturbance than those without sleep disturbance (all p < 0.05). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, poor sleep quality and insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with menstrual flow length >= 7 days (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.23-2.68, OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.13-2.45), period pain (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.02-2.35, OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.02-2.37), and premenstrual syndrome (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.30-2.24, OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.46-2.56). In addition, poor sleep quality was significantly associated with heavy menstrual bleeding (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.12-2.72), and insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with irregular menstrual cycle (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.02-1.80). However, short sleep duration (<= 6 h) was only associated with premenstrual syndrome. Conclusion Our results suggested that sleep disturbance is associated with menstrual problems among female university students. More attention should be paid to improving the sleep quality and insomnia symptoms in individuals with menstrual problems.

TI  - Effectiveness of functional exercises on pain and sleep quality in patients with primary dysmenorrhea: a randomized clinical trial
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
AB  - Purpose Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological problem in young women and adolescents. Exercise therapy provides positive effects on women with primary dysmenorrhea. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a combined exercise program on pain, sleep and menstrual symptoms in patients with primary dysmenorrhea. Methods The study is a randomized controlled study. The study included 28 sedentary individuals. The participants were assigned to two groups as the exercise (mean age 22.9 +/- 2.0 years) and the control (mean age 23.1 +/- 1.8 years) groups. The exercise protocol was carried out with the exercise group three times a week for eight weeks. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used for assessing the intensity of pain. The Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used for evaluating menstrual symptoms and sleep quality, respectively. The study was registered on the Clinical Trials website by the number NCT03625375. Results The comparisons between the groups revealed statistically significant differences in abdominal pain severity, MSQ total score and the subscale scores of negative outcomes and management methods (p < 0.05). The intragroup comparisons of the exercise group demonstrated that the scores of the low back pain and abdominal pain and the MSQ and PSQI scores were found to be significantly different after the 8-week program (p < 0.05). Conclusion The combined exercise therapy is an effective way to manage symptoms associated with primary dysmenorrhea.

TI  - Lifestyle and Psychosocial Patterns and Diabetes Incidence Among Women with and Without Obesity: a Prospective Latent Class Analysis
T2  - PREVENTION SCIENCE
AB  - We conducted latent class analyses to identify women with homogeneous combinations of lifestyle and behavioral variables and tested whether latent classes were prospectively associated with diabetes incidence for women with or without baseline obesity. A total of 64,710 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years without prevalent diabetes at baseline (years 1993-1998) were followed until 2018 with a mean follow-up of 14.6 years (sd = 6.4). Lifestyle variables included smoking, diet quality, physical activity, and sleep quality. Psychosocial variables included social support, depression, and optimism. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models tested associations between latent classes and diabetes incidence controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and education. During follow-up, 8076 (12.4%) women developed diabetes. For women without baseline obesity, five latent classes were identified. Compared with a lower risk referent, diabetes incidence was higher in classes characterized by high probability of multiple lifestyle and psychosocial risks (HR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.28, 1.64), poor diet and exercise (HR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.13, 1.33), and psychosocial risks alone (HR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.12, 1.29). For women with baseline obesity, four latent classes were identified. Compared with a lower risk referent, diabetes incidence was higher for women with obesity in classes characterized by high probability of multiple lifestyle and psychosocial risks (HR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.32, 1.66), poor diet and exercise (HR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.19, 1.47), and intermediate probabilities of multiple risks (HR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.05, 1.30). Diabetes prevention efforts that focus on diet and exercise may benefit from attention to how lifestyle behaviors interact with psychosocial variables to increase diabetes risks, and conversely, how psychological or social resources may be leveraged with lifestyle changes to reduce the risk for women with and without obesity.

TI  - Progesterone decreases apnoea and reduces oxidative stress induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia in ovariectomized female rats
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - New Findings
   What is the central question of this study? Does progesterone reduce the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on arterial blood pressure, respiratory control and oxidative stress in the central nervous system in ovariectomized rats?
   What is the main finding and its importance? Progesterone does not prevent the elevation of arterial blood pressure in rats exposed to CIH, but normalizes respiratory control, and reduces cerebral oxidative stress. This study draws focus to a potential role of progesterone and the consequences of sleep apnoea in menopausal women.
   We tested the hypothesis that progesterone (Prog) reduces the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on arterial blood pressure, respiratory chemoreflexes and oxidative stress in the central nervous system. Ovariectomized female rats were implanted with osmotic pumps delivering vehicle (Veh) or Prog (4 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). Two weeks following the surgery, rats were exposed to room air (Air) or CIH (7 days, 10% O-2, 10 cycles h(-1), 8 h day(-1)). We studied three groups: Veh-Air, Veh-CIH and Prog-CIH. After the CIH exposures, we measured the mean arterial pressure (MAP; tail cuff) and assessed the frequency of apnoeas at rest and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia (whole body plethysmography). The activities of the pro-oxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX) and antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD; in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, were measured in brain cortex and brainstem samples. CIH exposure increased the MAP, the frequency of apnoeas, and the respiratory frequency response to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Prog did not prevent the CIH-induced elevation in MAP, but it reduced the CIH-induced frequency of apnoeas and increased hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses. In the brain cortex, CIH increased NOX activity, and decreased the cytosolic and mitochondrial SOD activities. These effects were prevented by Prog. NOX activity was increased by CIH in the brainstem, and this was also blocked by Prog. The study draws focus to the links between ovarian hormones and the consequences of sleep apnoea in women.

TI  - Consistency index of daily activity pattern and its correlations with subjective ratings of QOL
T2  - SLEEP AND BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS
AB  - Since sleep is under circadian and homeostatic regulation, the status of regulatory mechanisms can be known from daily activity patterns, including both sleep and wake states. Therefore, the relationship between their quantitative characterization and associated subjective QOL can be expected to provide practical knowledge for maintaining/improving QOL. An index quantifying the consistency of daily activity patterns over days, the activity consistency index (ACI), was developed, and its correlations with subjective QOL ratings based on the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) were analyzed using actigraphy data obtained from university students and IT workers. The consistency of the parametrically transformed actigraphy data was quantified using a parameter set tuned to optimize an ensemble correlation between the consistency measure and QOL. Comparisons of ACI with a previously proposed index (SRI: sleep regularity index) were made according to their correlations with the participants' subjective ratings of QOL. The comparison of ACI and SRI with respect to the various quantitative features of daily activity revealed that ACI tuned to PSQI was correlated only with mean sleep-onset time and mean sleep duration, while SRI was correlated with most of the quantitative features of sleep. In addition, the correlation profile showed gender dependency. For male and female subjects in their 20 s, the analysis indicated a significant correlation between PSQI and ACI, but not between PSQI and SRI. ACI was shown to work well as an index of daily activity patterns relevant to subjective sleep quality. This ability suggests that ACI could be a basis for predicting subjective sleep quality. Through evaluating daily activity patterns using ACI, an individual may be able to select an appropriate lifestyle for maintaining/improving QOL.

TI  - Association of Childhood Trauma Exposure with Inflammatory Biomarkers Among Midlife Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Childhood abuse has been associated with poor health outcomes in adulthood. However, the physiologic pathways by which abuse is linked to health are not fully elucidated. Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of multiple chronic diseases. We tested whether childhood trauma exposure was related to increased systemic inflammation in midlife women.
   Materials and Methods: Participants were 304 nonsmoking perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years and free of cardiovascular disease. They completed questionnaires assessing psychosocial and behavioral factors, including childhood trauma, anthropometric measures, wrist actigraphy sleep measurements, and a fasting blood draw for inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Associations between childhood trauma and inflammatory markers were tested in linear regression models controlling for age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, anti-inflammatory medication use, and alcohol consumption. Other covariates considered included sleep continuity and depressive symptoms.
   Results: A total of 44.8% of the sample experienced at least one type of childhood abuse/neglect. Women with a history of emotional abuse had higher IL-6 levels than women without this history in multivariate models (beta = 0.077, standard error = 0.032, p = 0.017). Results were not accounted for by covariates and persisted additionally controlling for depressive symptoms and sleep. Childhood abuse/neglect was not related to hsCRP.
   Conclusions: Childhood emotional abuse was associated with higher levels of IL-6 in midlife women. Assessing childhood trauma exposure along with inflammatory markers may be important for the development of prevention strategies at midlife to prevent chronic diseases later in life.

TI  - Effects of NT-814, a dual neurokinin 1 and 3 receptor antagonist, on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women: a placebo-controlled, randomized trial
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of NT-814, a dual neurokinin 1,3 antagonist, in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Methods: We completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in three US clinical research units in 76 postmenopausal women with moderate/severe hot flashes. Participants were randomized to 14 days of once-daily NT-814 or placebo within each of four sequential dose cohorts; 50, 100, 150, and 300 mg. Participants completed diaries of hot flash frequency and severity and waking due to night sweats before (baseline) and during treatment. Results: All prespecified efficacy parameters (24-h hot flash frequency and severity, frequency of waking due to night sweats) decreased in all groups (including placebo). Mean reduction from baseline at week 2 in moderate/severe hot flash frequency was 37% in the placebo group and, respectively, 24% (P = 0.048 vs placebo), 59% (P = 0.155), 84% (P < 0.001) and 66% (P = 0.022) in the 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg NT-814 groups; in waking due to night sweats reduction was 20% (P = 0.059), 55% (P = 0.135), 81% (P < 0.001), and 63% (P = 0.031) in the NT-814 groups and 32% in the placebo group. The improvement with NT-814 >= 150 mg was also evident in the first week of treatment. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild somnolence and headache, more frequently in the 300 mg group. Safety monitoring identified no concerns. Conclusions: Once-daily NT-814 (>= 150 mg/d) resulted in a rapid, marked improvement in hot flashes and waking due to night sweats. No safety concerns were identified. Doses up to 300 mg were well tolerated.

TI  - Adolescent Dietary Habit-induced Obstetric and Gynecologic Disease (ADHOGD) as a New Hypothesis-Possible Involvement of Clock System
T2  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - There are growing concerns that poor dietary behaviors at young ages will increase the future risk of chronic diseases in adulthood. We found that female college students who skipped breakfast had higher incidences of dysmenorrhea and irregular menstruation, suggesting that meal skipping affects ovarian and uterine functions. Since dysmenorrhea is more prevalent in those with a past history of dieting, we proposed a novel concept that inadequate dietary habits in adolescence become a trigger for the subsequent development of organic gynecologic diseases. Since inadequate feeding that was limited during the non-active phase impaired reproductive functions in post-adolescent female rats, we hypothesize that circadian rhythm disorders due to breakfast skipping disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, impairs the reproductive rhythm, and leads to ovarian and uterine dysfunction. To explain how reproductive dysfunction is memorized from adolescence to adulthood, we hypothesize that the peripheral clock system also plays a critical role in the latent progression of reproductive diseases together with the central system, and propose naming this concept "adolescent dietary habit-induced obstetric and gynecologic disease (ADHOGD)". This theory will contribute to analyzing the etiologies of and developing prophylaxes for female reproductive diseases from novel aspects. In this article, we describe the precise outline of the above hypotheses with the supporting evidence in the literature.

TI  - Sex differences within sleep in gonadally intact rats
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Sleep impacts diverse physiological and neural processes and is itself affected by the menstrual cycle; however, few studies have examined the effects of the estrous cycle on sleep in rodents. Studies of disease mechanisms in females therefore lack critical information regarding estrous cycle influences on relevant sleep characteristics. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from multiple brain regions to assess sleep states as well as sleep traits such as spectral power and interregional spectral coherence in freely cycling females across the estrous cycle and compared with males. Our findings show that the high hormone phase of proestrus decreases the amount of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increases the amount of time spent awake compared with other estrous phases and to males. This spontaneous sleep deprivation of proestrus was followed by a sleep rebound in estrus which increased NREM and REM sleep. In proestrus, spectral power increased in the delta (0.5-4 Hz) and the gamma (30-60 Hz) ranges during NREM sleep, and increased in the theta range (5-9 Hz) during REM sleep during both proestrus and estrus. Slow-wave activity (SWA) and cortical sleep spindle density also increased in NREM sleep during proestrus. Finally, interregional NREM and REM spectral coherence increased during proestrus. This work demonstrates that the estrous cycle affects more facets of sleep than previously thought and reveals both sex differences in features of the sleep-wake cycle related to estrous phase that likely impact the myriad physiological processes influenced by sleep.

TI  - Time use and sexual maturity-related indicators differentially predict youth body mass indices, Peruvian girls versus boys
T2  - ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB  - Rapid development in Latin America has been accompanied by lifestyle shifts, including changes in time use and social environments. Overweight/obesity has also emerged as a public health challenge. We examined whether lifestyle changes and sexual maturity-related indicators (early pubertal development and having a child) predict increases in adiposity among Peruvian youth. Using longitudinal data from Young Lives, we examined changes in adiposity between ages 8 and 15 years old for the younger cohort and ages 15 and 22 years old for the older cohort. Boys and girls in both cohorts demonstrated substantial increases in age-adjusted adiposity measures, but predictors were different for boys versus girls. For boys, increases in time spent in work and domestic chores predicted increases in adiposity body mass index and BMI-for-age Z-score and increases in time spent sleeping were associated with decreases in adiposity (waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio). For girls, sexual maturity-related indicators (early menarche and childbearing) predicted increases in adiposity, regardless of time use. Potential mechanisms for these results may include diet, physical activity, wealth, and urban-rural residence. Time use among youth was associated with diet quality and physical activity, but in different ways for boys versus girls. Strategies for dealing with rising overweight and obesity should incorporate sex-based specificities.

TI  - Women dealing with hot flushes: the role of beta-alanine
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Hot flushes (HFs) are a very frequent condition in menopausal women, associated with a marked decrease in quality of life, impaired ability to carry on daily activities and sleep disturbances. However, this condition is often only given poor attention in daily practice and in clinical research.
   Indeed, several treatments for HFs exist. The most effective is considered to be hormone replacement therapy, but this strategy has been associated with a poor risk-benefit ratio given its link with the development of cancer. Other treatments have been tested and are currently used, but they are usually only poorly effective or cannot be recommended in all patients due to potential side effects or interference with other molecules. Therefore, there is a major need for new treatment options for HFs.
   beta-alanine supplementation is widely used for the enhancement of energetic metabolism and is known to be devoid of any relevant adverse effect. BA has also been widely used for the treatment of HFs.
   This narrative review will discuss the current pharmacological management of HFs and will present the role of beta-alanine in this setting.

TI  - Mortality and morbidity of preterm neonates weighing less than 750 g: A 2-year retrospective cohort study
T2  - ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE
AB  - Background: The rate of premature births in France is 6% and is increasing, as is the rate of extremely premature births. Morbidity and mortality rates in this population remain high despite significant medical progress. We aimed to evaluate the morbidity and mortality rate in preterm neonates weighing < 750 g and to evaluate their outcome at 2 years' corrected age (CA).
   Methods: This was a retrospective monocentric study including babies born between May 2011 and April 2013 who were preterm and weighed < 750 g. We evaluated mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period. At 2 years' CA, we focused on developmental quotient (DQ) with the Brunet-Lezine test, on neurosensory assessment (sleeping/behavior), and growth evaluation.
   Results: Among the 107 infants included, 29 (27%) died in the neonatal period. Mean gestational age was 25.6 weeks' gestation. Female sex and higher birth weight were independent predictors of survival. A total of 61 (78.2%) infants showed extra-uterine growth retardation at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. At 2 years' CA, 57 children were followed up; 38 were evaluated using the Brunet-Lezine test, 20 (52.6%) had a DQc < 85, and none had a severe developmental delay (DQc < 50). Six (10%) children had cerebral palsy and 22 of 56 (39.2%) showed language delay. Growth retardation persisted in 15 of 52 (28.8%) children.
   Conclusion: Our results confirm the acute fragility of extremely low-birth-weight babies with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. At 2 years' CA, this population still shows a considerable rate of mild difficulties, whose long-term evolution needs to be followed. (C) 2020 French Society of Pediatrics.

TI  - The effect of yoga on sleep quality and insomnia in women with sleep problems: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background To examine the effectiveness and safety of yoga of women with sleep problems by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Medline/PubMed, ClinicalKey, ScienceDirect, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched throughout the month of June, 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing yoga groups with control groups in women with sleep problems were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias by using the risk of bias tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The main outcome measure was sleep quality or the severity of insomnia, which was measured using subjective instruments, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or objective instruments such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and safety of the intervention. For each outcome, a standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% were determined. Results Nineteen studies in this systematic review included 1832 participants. The meta-analysis of the combined data conducted according to Comprehensive Meta-Analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep (SMD = - 0.327, 95% CI = - 0.506 to - 0.148, P < 0.001). Meta-analyses revealed positive effects of yoga using PSQI scores in 16 randomized control trials (RCTs), compared with the control group in improving sleep quality among women using PSQI (SMD = - 0.54; 95% CI = - 0.89 to - 0.19; P = 0.003). However, three RCTs revealed no effects of yoga compared to the control group in reducing insomnia among women using ISI (SMD = - 0.13; 95% CI = - 0.74 to 0.48; P = 0.69). Seven RCTs revealed no evidence for effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving sleep quality for women with breast cancer using PSQI (SMD = - 0.15; 95% CI = - 0.31 to 0.01; P = 0.5). Four RCTs revealed no evidence for the effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving the sleep quality for peri/postmenopausal women using PSQI (SMD = - 0.31; 95% CI = - 0.95 to 0.33; P = 0.34). Yoga was not associated with any serious adverse events. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that yoga intervention in women can be beneficial when compared to non-active control conditions in term of managing sleep problems. The moderator analyses suggest that participants in the non-breast cancer subgroup and participants in the non-peri/postmenopausal subgroup were associated with greater benefits, with a direct correlation of total class time with quality of sleep among other related benefits.

TI  - Does aromatherapy with lavender affect physical and psychological symptoms of menopausal women? A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Objectives: The objective of this review was to evaluate systematically the effectiveness of Lavender aromatherapy on physical and psychological symptoms in menopausal women.
   Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search in the electronic databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), Ovid, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of science, and Google scholar, as well as Magiran, SID, and Irandoc for Persian literature review up to January 2020. All Randomized controlled trials, and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated the impact of aromatherapy with lavender alone or in combination with other aromas on physical and psychological symptoms in menopausal women were included in this systematic review.
   Results: Sixteen interventional studies consisted of 1092 postmenopausal women included in systematic review. Eight of eligible studies with 493 participants included in meta-analysis. There were significant between group differences in menopausal symptoms (standardized mean difference (SMD) =-1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.98 to 0.80, I-2 = 76%; four trials, 236 participants); sleep quality score (SMD = 2.16, 95%CI: 3.77 to 0.54, I-2 = 95%; three studies, 199 participants); systolic blood pressure (MD = 5.34 mmHg, 95% CI: 7.40 to 3.29, I-2 = 10%; two study, 114 participants); diastolic blood (MD = 5.06 mmHg, 95% CI: 7.55 to 2.57, I-2 = 0%; two study, 114 participants). Aromatherapy had positive effect on sexual function, self-esteem, anxiety, hot flash, but it had negative impact on triglyceride and high density lipoprotein compared to placebo (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Aromatherapy with Lavender in postmenopausal women may cause an improvement in most of physical and psychological symptoms. Further high quality studies especially with focus on the adverse events are suggested globally.

TI  - Mild sleep restriction increases 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in premenopausal women with no indication o mediation by psychological effects
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Studies assessing the impact of sleep restriction (SR) on blood pressure (BP) are limited by short study length, extreme SR (<4 hours a night), and lack of attention to psychological distress as a possible mediator.
   Methods A community-based cohort was assembled with 237 women (age 34.1 +/- 13.5 years; body mass index 25.4 +/- 5.4 kg/m(2)), and a randomized, crossover, intervention study was conducted in 41 women (24 completed: age 30.2 +/- 6.5 years; body mass index 24.3 +/- 2.8 kg/m(2)) to determine the causal effect of SR on BP. Sleep was maintained as usual (HS) or reduced by 1.5 hours a night (SR) for 6 weeks. In the cohort, associations between sleep and psychosocial factors were evaluated using multivariable models adjusted for demographic and clinical confounders. In the intervention study, in-office BP was measured weekly; ambulatory BP was measured at end point. Psychological factors were assessed at baseline and end point. Mixed-model analyses with total sleep time (TST, main predictor), week and fraction of time spent in physical activity (covariates), and subject (random effect) were performed.
   Results Among the community cohort, higher perceived stress, stressful events and distress, and lower resilience were associated with shorter sleep, worse sleep quality, and greater insomnia symptoms (P < .05). In the intervention, systolic BP increased as TST decreased (TST x week interaction, [coefficient +/- standard error] -0.0097 +/- 0.0046, P = .036). Wake ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (-0.059 +/- 0.022, P = .021) and mean arterial pressure (-0.067 +/- 0.023, P = .018) were higher after SR versus HS. Psychological distress variables were not affected by TST and did not mediate the effects of SR on BP.
   Conclusions These results suggest that SR influences CVD risk in women via mechanisms independent of psychological stressors.

TI  - Predictive ability and reliability of the STOP-BANG questionnaire in screening for obstructive sleep apnea in midlife women
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Objectives: The STOP-BANG questionnaire (snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, high blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck size, gender) was originally validated to screen for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the surgical population. It has been validated in mixed populations of men and women. We aimed to evaluate its reliability for OSA screening of midlife women.
   Study design: We retrospectively evaluated midlife women seen at the Women's Health Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who completed the STOP-BANG questionnaire and subsequently underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT).
   Main outcome measures: The questionnaire's predictive ability was assessed with the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) measured at PSG and HSAT.
   Results: Because participants were female, the gender question response was consistently 0, making the mean (SD) STOP-BANG score low at 3 (1.2). The most sensitive item to detect any OSA and moderate to severe OSA through STOP-BANG was observed apneas; the most specific item to detect OSA and moderate to severe OSA was neck circumference exceeding 40 cm. A score of 3 or more had a sensitivity of 77 % and a specificity of 45 % to detect moderate to severe OSA. The area under the curve with the STOP-BANG score to predict moderate to severe OSA was 0.67 (95 % CI, 0.51-0.84).
   Conclusions: Interpretation of the STOP-BANG questionnaire is nuanced for midlife women. Given the nature of its questions, a lower score may be predictive of more severe OSA in women, necessitating use of a lower threshold to trigger further testing.

TI  - Assessing heart rate variability in type 1 diabetes mellitus-Psychosocial stress a possible confounder
T2  - ANNALS OF NONINVASIVE ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB  - Background Autonomic neuropathy (AN) commonly arises as a long-term complication in diabetes mellitus and can be diagnosed from heart rate variability (HRV), calculated from electrocardiogram recordings. Psychosocial stress also affects HRV and could be one of several confounders for cardiac AN. The present work investigated the impact of psychosocial stress on HRV in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and assessed the use of salivary cortisol as a biomarker for psychosocial stress in this context.
   Methods A total of 167 individuals 6-60 years old (113 with T1DM and 54 healthy controls) underwent 24-hr ECG recordings with HRV analysis. Salivary cortisol was sampled thrice during the registration day. Perceived psychosocial stress along with other factors of possible importance for the interpretation of HRV was documented in a diary.
   Results Heart rate variability (high-frequency power during sleep) was reduced (p < .05) with older age, longer diabetes duration, higher mean glucose levels, physical inactivity, and perceived psychosocial stress. Salivary cortisol levels in the evening were increased (p < .05) in women in ovulation phase, in individuals with preceding hypoglycemia or with hyperglycemia. The amplitude of salivary cortisol was reduced (p < .05) with the presence of perceived psychosocial stress, but only in adult healthy controls, not in individuals with diabetes.
   Conclusion Psychosocial stress might be a confounder for reduced HRV when diagnosing cardiac AN in T1DM. Salivary cortisol is, however, not a useful biomarker for psychosocial stress in diabetes since the physiological stress of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia seems to overrule the effect of psychosocial stress on cortisol.

TI  - Applying a data-driven approach to quantify EEG maturational deviations in preterms with normal and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Premature babies are subjected to environmental stresses that can affect brain maturation and cause abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome later in life. Better understanding this link is crucial to developing a clinical tool for early outcome estimation. We defined maturational trajectories between the Electroencephalography (EEG)-derived 'brain-age' and postmenstrual age (the age since the last menstrual cycle of the mother) from longitudinal recordings during the baby's stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Data consisted of 224 recordings (65 patients) separated for normal and abnormal outcome at 9-24 months follow-up. Trajectory deviations were compared between outcome groups using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and maximum trajectory deviation (delta(max)). 113 features were extracted (per sleep state) to train a data-driven model that estimates brain-age, with the most prominent features identified as potential maturational and outcome-sensitive biomarkers. RMSE and delta(max) showed significant differences between outcome groups (cluster-based permutation test, p < 0.05). RMSE had a median (IQR) of 0.75 (0.60-1.35) weeks for normal outcome and 1.35 (1.15-1.55) for abnormal outcome, while delta(max) had a median of 0.90 (0.70-1.70) and 1.90 (1.20-2.90) weeks, respectively. Abnormal outcome trajectories were associated with clinically defined dysmature and disorganised EEG patterns, cementing the link between early maturational trajectories and neurodevelopmental outcome.

TI  - Human Papillomavirus Vaccination and Physical and Mental Health Complaints Among Female Students in Secondary Education Institutions in Denmark
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background Previous studies have not explored the effect of HPV vaccination on health status at a longer time interval. Similarly, self-reported physical and mental health in recipients of the HPV vaccine has not been studied. Objective To evaluate whether HPV vaccination was associated with physical and mental health complaints among girls in secondary education institutions. Design Prospective cohort study. Participants This study used data from girls aged 15-20 years who participated in the Danish National Youth Study (DNYS) 2014. Data on HPV vaccination was retrieved from the Danish Vaccination Register. Main Measures Participants were asked whether they had experienced headaches, stomachache, neck pain, menstrual cramps, sore throat, sadness, irritation, nervousness and sleep problems in the past 6 months. Key Results Of 41,333 girls, 39,145 (94.7%) received at least one dose of HPV vaccine. The most prevalent health complaint among the vaccinated and not vaccinated females was "been irritable" (88.2% and 88.4%, respectively). The lowest proportion of health complaints was stomachache (49.6% in vaccinated and in 50.4% in unvaccinated girls). Regression model, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and health behavior, showed that HPV vaccination was associated with a lower likelihood of reporting sore throat (odd ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.95) and being sad (OR 0.86, 95%CI 0.76-0.97). Similar results were observed when HPV vaccination status was analyzed according to the number of doses received. Conclusion We conclude that HPV vaccination was not associated with physical and mental health complaints among girls in secondary education institutions in Denmark after a median of 5.3 years since HPV vaccination.

TI  - Efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - This study examined the effects of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia. A randomized controlled trial was performed on 44 women. The intervention included one group session of sleep hygiene education and four individual sessions of counseling. The instruments included the Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Menopausal quality of life. The data were analyzed using repeated measure MANOVA, followed by repeated measure ANOVA. Repeated measure MANOVA showed that time had a significant main effect on the anthropometric variables (body mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressures) and revealed significant main effects of the group and time on the psychosocial variables (sleep quality, insomnia, depressive symptoms, and quality of life) (p < .05). Repeated measure ANOVA results indicated a significant effect of the group on insomnia and sleep quality (p < .05). Overall, the intervention was effective in improving insomnia and poor sleep quality.

TI  - Efficacy of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) for menopausal insomnia and its effect on serum hormone levels
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACUPUNCTURE AND TUINA SCIENCE
AB  - Objective To explore the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) for menopausal insomnia. Methods A total of 80 patients with menopausal insomnia were randomly divided into a control group and an observation group, with 40 cases in each group. The patients in the control group received conventional Western medication treatment, and the patients in the observation group received TEAS on the basis of conventional Western medication treatment. The treatment for both groups lasted for 4 weeks. Before and after treatment, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and modified Kupperman scale were evaluated, and the serum levels of estradiol (E-2) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated after treatment. Results After treatment, the total effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05); in the control group, the improvement of PSQI score was significant (P<0.05), while the change of modified Kupperman score was insignificant (P>0.05); the PSQI and Kupperman scores in the observation group were significantly improved after treatment (both P<0.05), and there were significant differences between the observation group and the control group in PSQI and Kupperman scores (both P<0.05). After treatment, the serum E-2 and FSH levels in the control group were not statistically different from those before treatment (both P>0.05); the serum E-2 level was significantly increased (P<0.05), and the FSH level was decreased (P<0.05) in the observation group after treatment, and the between- group differences in serum levels of E-2 and FSH were significant (both P<0.05). Conclusion TEAS plus conventional Western medication in treating menopausal insomnia is effective, and can significantly improve the symptoms of insomnia and menopause, which may be related to the regulation of serum E-2 and FSH levels.

TI  - A U-shaped Association of Breastfeeding Duration with Cognitive Impairment in Chinese Postmenopausal Women
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Breastfeeding is related to maternal health. However, the association of women's breastfeeding duration with cognitive function in their later life is limited and inconsistent. The aim of this study was to accurately evaluate the association in Chinese postmenopausal women. We analyzed the data from Zhejiang Ageing and Health Cohort Study including 5487 postmenopausal women. Cognitive impairment was assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination. Data on breastfeeding duration was collected in the reproductive history section within the questionnaire. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and logistic regression models, controlled for an extensive range of potential confounders, were generated to examine the associations. A U-shaped association was identified between breastfeeding duration and cognitive impairment based on GAM. The nadir with lowest odds of cognitive impairment was ascertained by quadratic model as 12 months. The logistic models showed that compared with women breastfeeding 12 months per child, the fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.50 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.20-1.88), 1.58 (95% CI: 1.29-1.93), 1.33 (95% CI: 1.06-1.68), 2.08 (95% CI: 1.64-2.65) for those averagely breastfeeding <6, 6-<12,>12-18,>18 months, respectively. Furthermore, we did not observe significant effect modification of the association. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the association.

TI  - Possible association between spindle frequency and reversal-learning in aged family dogs
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In both humans and dogs sleep spindle occurrence between acquisition and recall of a specific memory correlate with learning performance. However, it is not known whether sleep spindle characteristics are also linked to performance beyond the span of a day, except in regard to general mental ability in humans. Such a relationship is likely, as both memory and spindle expression decline with age in both species (in dogs specifically the density and amplitude of slow spindles). We investigated if spindle amplitude, density (spindles/minute) and/or frequency (waves/second) correlate with performance on a short-term memory and a reversal-learning task in old dogs (> 7 years), when measurements of behavior and EEG were on average a month apart. Higher frequencies of fast (>= 13Hz) spindles on the frontal and central midline electrodes, and of slow spindles (<= 13Hz) on the central midline electrode were linked to worse performance on a reversal-learning task. The present findings suggest a role for spindle frequency as a biomarker of cognitive aging across species: Changes in spindle frequency are associated with dementia risk and onset in humans and declining learning performance in the dog.

TI  - Objective and subjective vasomotor symptom outcomes in the CBT-Meno randomized controlled trial
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Objective: Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats) are common during the menopausal transition. Pharmacotherapy is effective but is associated with health risks for some women. There is an increasing demand for non-pharmacological interventions. The CBT-Meno protocol is a psychological intervention targeting a range of common menopausal symptoms. We compared the impact of CBT-Meno vs. waitlist on objective and subjective measures of vasomotor symptoms and on the relationship between vasomotor symptoms and sleep difficulties. Materials: The participants were 36 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with co-occurring depressive symptoms who participated in the CBT-Meno trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02480192). Subjective measures included the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale, the Greene Climacteric Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory. Objective (physiological) and 'in-the-moment' measures of vasomotor symptoms were assessed with sternal skin conductance. Results: Greater improvements in vasomotor 'bothersomeness' and 'interference' were observed in the CBT-Meno condition compared to the waitlist condition. No between-group differences were observed in vasomotor frequency (subjectively or objectively recorded) or severity ratings. Sleep disturbance was unrelated to objectively measured vasomotor symptom frequency. Conclusion: The CBT-Meno trial improved subjective but not objective (physiological) measures of vasomotor symptoms. Self-reported sleep difficulties were unrelated to subjective or objective vasomotor symptoms.

TI  - Therapeutic considerations and clinical characteristics of a sample of adolescent patients with acne vulgaris in Tirana, Albania: A cross-sectional study
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
AB  - Acne vulgaris is a common adolescent disorder but the data related to acne vulgaris is insufficient in Albania. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiologic features of acne vulgaris and to identify lifestyle and constitutional factors in formulating a proper management protocol. A cross-sectional study conducted on a representative sample of 2036 adolescents from 10 high schools located in Tirana. A self-administered questionnaire was administered to collect the data. The binary logistic regression was applied to assess the factors linked to the presence of acne vulgaris in adolescents. The mean age in the study population was 16.2 +/- 0.9 years. The self-reported prevalence of acne was 50.3% (52.1% in females and 47.9% in males). Lifetime prevalence was 68.5%. The factors significantly associated with an increased likelihood over time were: frequent consumption of sweets, frequent endurance of stress, poor quality of sleep, positive family history of acne, oily and combination skin, menstrual disorders. Acne vulgaris is common among adolescents in our country. The identification of various modifiable factors related to acne generates opportunities to tailor and focus prevention efforts and better management and treatment planning in relevant high-risk groups.

TI  - The effect of sleeping position on heart rate variability in newborns
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background Lower heart rate variability (HRV) in a newborn might represent a risk factor for unfavourable outcome, a longer recovery after illness, and a sudden infant death. Our aim was to determine whether the newborn's sleeping position is associated with HRV. Methods We performed a prospective clinical study in 46 hospitalized cardiorespiratory stable term newborns. During sleeping, we measured the parameters of HRV in four body positions (supine, supine with tilt, prone, prone with tilt). Results The TP (total power spectral density) was significantly higher when lying supine in comparison to prone (p = 0,048) and to prone with tilt (p = 0,046). The HF (high frequency of power spectral density) in the supine position without tilt tended to be higher compared to prone without tilt (p > 0,05). The LF (low frequency power) was significantly higher when lying supine compared to prone, both without tilt (p = 0,018). TP and HF showed a positive correlation with gestational but not postmenstrual age (p = 0.044 and p = 0.036, respectively). Conclusions In term newborns, sleeping position is associated with HRV. Higher TP and HF were found in the supine position, which might reflect better ANS stability. Gestational age positively correlated with TP and HF power, but only in supine position.

TI  - Treatment-induced symptoms, depression and age as predictors of sexual problems in premenopausal women with early breast cancer receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Purpose Sexual dysfunction is an important concern of premenopausal women with early breast cancer. We investigated predictors of sexual problems in two randomized controlled trials. Methods A subset of patients enrolled in TEXT and SOFT completed global and symptom-specific quality-of-life indicators, CES-Depression and MOS-Sexual Problems measures at baseline, six, 12 and 24 months. Mixed models tested the association of changes in treatment-induced symptoms (baseline to 6 months), depression at 6 months, and age at randomization with changes in sexual problems over 2 years. Results Sexual problems increased by 6 months and persisted at this level. Overall, patients with more severe worsening of vaginal dryness, sleep disturbances and bone or joint pain at 6 months reported a greater increase in sexual problems at all time-points. Depression scores were significantly associated with sexual problems in the short-term. All other symptoms had a smaller impact on sexual problems. Age was not associated with sexual problems at any time-point. Conclusion Among several key symptoms, vaginal dryness, sleep disturbance, and bone and joint pain significantly predicted sexual problems during the first 2 years. Early identification of these symptoms may contribute to timely and tailored interventions.

TI  - Does midlife aging impact women's sleep duration, continuity, and timing?: A longitudinal analysis from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Our study objectives were to evaluate the age-related changes in actigraphy measures of sleep duration, continuity, and timing across 12 years in midlife women as they traversed the menopause, and to take into account factors affecting women's sleep that also change with age. Black, white, and Chinese women were recruited from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to participate in an ancillary sleep study on two occasions over 3 years apart and a third assessment 12 years after the first (N = 300, mean ages, 52, 55, and 64 at the three assessments). Women had at least four consecutive nights of actigraphy (95% with 7 nights) and sleep diaries, and self-reported sleep complaints measured at each time point. Partial correlations adjusted for time between assessments across the 12 years were significant and moderate in size (r's = .33-.58). PROC MIXED/GLIMMIX multivariate models showed that sleep duration increased over time; wake after sleep onset (WASO) declined, midpoint of sleep interval increased, and sleep latency and number of sleep complaints did not change between the first and third assessments. Blacks and whites had a greater increase in sleep duration than Chinese. Taken together, the results of this longitudinal study suggest that sleep may not worsen, in general, in midlife women. Perhaps, the expected negative effect of aging in midlife into early old age on sleep is overstated.
   Statement of Significance
   It is well established that sleep characteristics change across the life span, with midlife aging thought to be associated with worsening sleep. However, few longitudinal studies using objective measures of sleep have addressed change in duration, continuity, and timing in midlife into early old age. This article describes age-related changes measured by actigraphy in 300 women (mean ages 52, 55, and 64 at three assessments) who participated in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation sleep studies. Results showed that, in general, sleep duration and time spent awake after sleep onset improved over time, suggesting that sleep may not worsen in midlife women. Perhaps, the expected negative effect of aging in midlife is overstated.

TI  - When does prone sleeping improve cardiorespiratory status in preterm infants in the NICU?
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Preterm infants undergoing intensive care are often placed prone to improve respiratory function. Current clinical guidelines recommend preterm infants are slept supine from 32 weeks' postmenstrual age, regardless of gestational age at birth. However, respiratory function is also related to gestational and chronological ages and is affected by sleep state. We aimed to identify the optimal timing for adopting the supine sleeping position in preterm infants, using a longitudinal design assessing the effects of sleep position and state on cardiorespiratory stability.
   Methods: Twenty-three extremely (24-28 weeks' gestation) and 33 very preterm (29-34 weeks' gestation) infants were studied weekly from birth until discharge, in both prone and supine positions, in quiet and active sleep determined by behavioral scoring. Bradycardia (heart rate <= 100 bpm), desaturation (oxygen saturation <= 80%), and apnea (pause in respiratory rate >= 10 s) episodes were analyzed.
   Results: Prone positioning in extremely preterm infants reduced the frequency of bradycardias and desaturations and duration of desaturations. In very preterm infants, prone positioning only reduced the frequency of desaturations. The position-related effects were not related to postmenstrual age. Quiet sleep in both preterm groups was associated with fewer bradycardias and desaturations, and also reduced durations of bradycardia and desaturations in the very preterm group.
   Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory stability is improved by the prone sleep position, predominantly in extremely preterm infants, and the improvements are not dependent on postmenstrual age. In very preterm infants, quiet sleep has a more marked effect than the prone position. This evidence should be considered in individualizing management of preterm infant positioning.
   Statement of Significance
   Prone positioning is frequently used in the neonatal intensive care unit to improve respiratory function in preterm infants. However, prone sleeping increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for infants after hospital discharge. Current guidelines recommend infants to be slept supine from 32 weeks' postmenstrual age. However, respiratory function is related to gestational age at birth rather than postmenstrual age. Using a longitudinal design, the age-related effects of prone positioning on cardiorespiratory stability were assessed in relation to gestational, postmenstrual, and chronological ages. Cardiorespiratory stability is improved by the prone sleep position predominantly in extremely preterm infants, and these improvements are not dependent on postmenstrual age. In very preterm infants, quiet sleep has a more marked effect than the prone position. This evidence should be considered in future recommendations in the management of preterm infant positioning.

TI  - Impact of Circadian Disruption on Female Mice Reproductive Function
T2  - ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - In female mammals, cycles in reproductive function depend both on the biological clock synchronized to the light/dark cycle and on a balance between the negative and positive feedbacks of estradiol, whose concentration varies during oocyte maturation. In women, studies report that chronodisruptive environments such as shiftwork may impair fertility and gestational success. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of shifted light/dark cycles on both the robustness of the estrous cycles and the timing of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in female mice. When mice were exposed to a single 10-hour phase advance or 10-hour phase delay, the occurrence and timing of the LH surge and estrous cyclicity were recovered at the third estrous cycle. By contrast, when mice were exposed to chronic shifts (successive rotations of 10-hoursour phase advances for 3 days followed by 10-hour phase delays for 4 days), they exhibited a severely impaired reproductive activity. Most mice had no preovulatory LH surge at the beginning of the chronic shifts. Furthermore, the gestational success of mice exposed to chronic shifts was reduced, because the number of pups was 2 times lower in shifted than in control mice. In conclusion, this study reports that exposure of female mice to a single phase shift has minor reproductive effects, whereas exposure to chronically disrupted light/dark cycles markedly impairs the occurrence of the preovulatory LH surge, leading to reduced fertility.

TI  - Timing of puberty in boys and girls: Implications for population health
T2  - SSM-POPULATION HEALTH
AB  - Puberty is marked by substantial increases and emerging sex differences in psychological disorders and risky behaviors. However, few studies have examined these effects beyond adolescence, and the previous literature has been dominated by samples of White girls. The current study examines the broadest known set of health sequelae related to traditional pubertal markers and peer-relative pubertal timing in a representative sample of 14,545 U.S. youth from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.
   Maturational timing was assessed by age at menarche for girls and physical development for boys (e.g., facial hair, voice change), and then categorized as early (1 SD below mean), on-time, or late (1 SD above mean) within-sex. Early and late peer-relative timing was assessed by a self-report of looking "much older" or "much younger" than one's peers. We examined psychological (depressive symptoms, antisocial behavior), behavioral (number of sex partners, drug use, physical activity, screen time, sleep hours), and physical health (self-reported health, BMI) outcomes during adolescence and young adulthood in a series of sex-stratified regression analyses using survey weights and a comprehensive set of sociodemographic covariates.
   Results indicated that, overall, earlier pubertal timing (i.e., maturational timing and peer-relative timing) put both girls and boys at risk during adolescence, while later timing was protective. However, longitudinal models revealed mixed results. For instance, early maturational timing was associated with higher young adult BMI (girls: beta = 0.139, p < .01; boys: beta = 0.107, p < .01), but later timing for boys was associated with both risky (e.g., more screen time; beta = 0.125, p < .05) and health promoting (e.g., more sleep; beta = .296, p < .01) behaviors. Analysis of this holistic set of outcomes with sex differences in mind allows for more careful evidence-based recommendations for adolescent health promotion.

TI  - Clinical Effects of Early or Surgical Menopause
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Increasing numbers of women experience early menopause due in part to surgical treatment for benign gynecologic disorders and the rise in risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations. Unfortunately, the adverse health consequences of early loss of ovarian function accelerate the menopausal state and affect multiple systems, including cardiovascular, neurologic, bone, and connective tissue, and affect quality of life owing to vasomotor symptoms, mood, sleep, and sexual function. Yet many clinicians and women remain reluctant to use hormone therapy because of the Women's Health Initiative's adverse findings, even though they are not applicable to women with early menopause. This review examines the effects of early menopause and highlights the critical role of hormone therapy in this population.

TI  - Vasomotor Symptoms and Accelerated Epigenetic Aging in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Purpose: The hallmark menopausal symptom, vasomotor symptoms (VMS), has been linked to adverse health indicators. However, the relationship between VMS and biological aging has not been tested. We examined associations between menopausal VMS and biological aging as assessed by 2 DNA methylation-based epigenetic aging indicators previously linked to poor health outcomes.
   Methods: Participants were members of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study integrative genomics substudy (N = 1206) who had both ovaries and were not taking hormone therapy. Relationships between VMS at enrollment (presence, severity) or VMS timing groups (no VMS: not at menopause onset nor at study enrollment; early VMS: at menopause onset but not at enrollment; persistent VMS: at menopause onset and study enrollment; and late VMS: at enrollment but not at menopause onset) and epigenetic clock indicators predictive of physical aging and early death (DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge) were tested in linear regression models adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, hysterectomy, education, body mass index, smoking, and, in additional models, sleep disturbance.
   Results: Women were on average 65 years of age at enrollment. Severe hot flashes at enrollment were associated with higher DNAm PhenoAge [relative to no hot flashes: B (SE) = 2.79 (1.27), P = 0.028, multivariable]. Further, late-occurring VMS were associated with both higher DNAm PhenoAge [B (SE) = 2.15 (0.84), P = 0.011] and DNAm GrimAge [B (SE) = 1.09 (0.42), P = 0.010, multivariable] relative to no VMS.
   Main Conclusions: Among postmenopausal women, severe or late-occurring VMS were associated with accelerated epigenetic age, controlling for chronological age. Postmenopausal women with severe or late-occurring VMS may have greater underlying epigenetic aging.

TI  - Evaluation of maturity of sleep states in preterm infants using conventional and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To determine whether sleep state maturity can be estimated accurately using conventional electroencephalography (cEEG) or amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) features concerning sleep in neurologically unimpaired preterm infants.
   Methods: A total of 51 preterm infants were monitored with cEEG-polygraphy and simultaneous aEEG. Sleep state maturity of EEG corresponded to specific postmenstrual age (PMA). PMA on cEEG was blindly estimated according to cEEG patterns (indicated as background continuity, frequencies, and voltages) as well as developmental markers in specific states. PMA on aEEG was blindly estimated based on the cycling score (cycling representing sleep state transitions) according to a pre-established scoring system.
   Results: A total of 51 EEGs recorded between 32 and 37 weeks PMA were analysed. A significant relationship between estimated PMA (ePMA) and actual chronological PMA (cPMA) was shown by linear regression both on cEEG (r = 0.93, beta = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.09, p < 0.001) and aEEG (r = 0.85, beta = 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.98, p < 0.001). The estimation gap (defined as ePMA minus cPMA) was between -2 and +2 weeks both on cEEG and aEEG. The percentage of estimation gap between -1 and +1 weeks was 96% for cEEG, which was higher than the estimate of 88% for aEEG.
   Conclusion: Estimated maturity of sleep state was well correlated with cPMA both on cEEG and aEEG. PMA corresponding to state maturity could be estimated within two weeks of actual cPMA using either of these two tools. However, cEEG had higher accuracy compared with aEEG in the evaluation of sleep state maturity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Association between common mental disorders, sleep quality, and menopausal symptoms: a population-based study in Southern Brazil
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To investigate the association between common mental disorders (CMD), sleep quality, and moderate and severe menopausal symptoms in adult women in southern Brazil. Methods: This cross-sectional, population-based study investigated a representative sample of 393 women (age 40-69 years) living in an urban area. A standardized and pretested questionnaire that included the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 for CMD (Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 >= 7), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-BR for sleep disorders (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index >5), and the Menopause Rating Scale for moderate/severe menopausal symptoms (Menopause Rating Scale >8) was used for data collection. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using robust Poisson regression. Results: The prevalence of moderate/severe menopausal symptoms in the sample was 58.0% (95% CI 53.0-63.0), the prevalence of CMD was 40.2% (95% CI 35.3-45.2), and the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 49.4% (95% CI 44.3-54.5). CMD and poor sleep quality occurred simultaneously in 34.4% of participants (95% CI 29.6-39.3). Moderate/severe menopausal complaints were significantly more prevalent in women with CMD (P < 0.001) and poor sleep quality (P < 0.001); the presence of both CMD and poor sleep quality increased the likelihood of moderate/severe menopausal complaints threefold. After adjustment, CMD and poor sleep quality remained strongly and significantly associated with moderate/severe menopausal complaints (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Considering the complex time-course relationship between CMD, sleep quality, and menopausal symptoms, longitudinal studies should follow women with these issues throughout the menopausal period to identify a possible temporal link between exposures and outcome.

TI  - Lights on MsFLASH: a review of contributions
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health clinical trials network was funded by the National Institutes of Health to find new ways to alleviate the most common, bothersome menopausal symptoms by designing and conducting multiple concurrent clinical intervention studies, accommodating a wide scope of populations and intervention strategies. Methods: Trials were conducted in Boston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Oakland, Philadelphia, and Seattle, with the Data Coordinating Center in Seattle, and were designed with standardized eligibility criteria and endpoints. Primary outcomes focused on vasomotor symptoms, sleep quality and insomnia symptoms, and vaginal symptoms. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, sexual function, and mood. Results: We completed five randomized clinical trials and three ancillary studies, testing nine interventions in over 1,300 women and collecting nearly 16,000 bio-specimens. Escitalopram, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release, and low-dose estradiol diminished hot flashes by approximately 50% as compared with a 30% decrease by placebo. No benefits on vasomotor symptoms were observed with yoga or exercise compared with usual activity, nor with omega-3 supplementation compared with placebo. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia reduced self-reported insomnia symptoms and improved overall sleep quality compared with menopause education control. We did not find significant benefit from a vaginal estradiol tablet or a vaginal moisturizer compared with placebo tablet and gel in diminishing the severity of vaginal symptoms. Conclusions: The MsFLASH trials contributed substantially to our understanding of bothersome menopausal symptom treatment. It is important that clinicians counseling women about available treatment options consider all therapies-both nonhormonal and hormonal.

TI  - Behavior Profiles at 2 Years for Children Born Extremely Preterm with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Objective To characterize behavior of 2-year-old children based on the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
   Study design We studied children born at 22-26 weeks of gestation and assessed at 22-26 months of corrected age with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). BPD was classified by the level of respiratory support at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. CBCL syndrome scales were the primary outcomes. The relationship between BPD grade and behavior was evaluated, adjusting for perinatal confounders. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether cognitive, language, or motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on behavior.
   Results Of 2310 children, 1208 (52%) had no BPD, 806 (35%) had grade 1 BPD, 177 (8%) had grade 2 BPD, and 119 (5%) had grade 3 BPD. Withdrawn behavior (P < .001) and pervasive developmental problems (P < .001) increased with worsening BPD grade. Sleep problems (P = .008) and aggressive behavior (P = .023) decreased with worsening BPD grade. Children with grade 3 BPD scored 2 points worse for withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems and 2 points better for externalizing problems, sleep problems, and aggressive behavior than children without BPD. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on the attention problems, emotionally reactive, somatic complaints, and withdrawn CBCL syndrome scales (P values < .05).
   Conclusions BPD grade was associated with increased risk of withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems but with decreased risk of sleep problems and aggressive behavior. The relationship between BPD and behavior is complex. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediate the effects of BPD grade on some problem behaviors.

TI  - Effects of Estrogen on Cardiac mRNA and LncRNA Expression Profiles in Hypertensive Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - Estrogen is a vascular protection factor and plays a protective role in the pathogenesis of gender differences in cardiovascular diseases. This study was to address the possible mechanisms that may explain the relationship between estradiol configuration-17 beta-estradiol (E2) and ventricular remodeling. Here, we show that a total of 1499 LncRNAs and 680 mRNAs significantly differently expressed were identified. This result indicates that estradiol has a global role in regulating heart gene expression profiles in female mice. Go and Pathway functional cluster analysis showed that the antagonism of E2 on cardiac remodeling and AngII-induced pathological changes in female mice may be related to physiological processes such as circadian rhythm disorder and ion channel dysfunction.

TI  - Associations between menopausal hormone therapy and sleep disturbance in women during the menopausal transition and post-menopause: data from the Norwegian prescription database and the HUNT study
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background Impaired sleep is common in menopausal women. The aim was to examine associations between uses of systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and sleep disturbance in a large population sample. Methods Female participants aged 45 to 75 years were selected from the Norwegian Health Study in Nord-Trondelag (HUNT3, 2006-2008) (N = 13,060). Data were linked to the Norwegian Prescription Database, identifying use of prescribed MHT and use of sleep medication. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results In total, 996 women used systemic MHT (7.6%), with the highest prevalence of 10.3% among women 55 to 64 years of age. Despite high reports of frequent nocturnal awakening (24.7%) and high reports of hot flashes, use of MHT was low in this large population based survey. Although MHT use was associated with more sleep disturbance in unadjusted analyses, the association was not significant after adjusting for relevant covariates. Using sleep medication, reporting poor health, tobacco and alcohol use, doing daily exercise, having higher levels of anxiety, and being less satisfied with life were factors showing the strongest associations with sleep disturbance. Conclusion The lack of association between MHT and sleep disturbance suggests that other factors, such as self-perceived good health, a healthy lifestyle and anxiety/depression, are more relevant to sleep than MHT.

TI  - Effect of Pilates on Sleep Quality: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Objective: Pilates exercise is increasingly used to improve sleep quality, but relevant evidence remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the effect of Pilates on sleep quality.
   Methods: Five databases were searched for articles published until 10 December 2019. Two investigators screened the articles and extracted data from each included study. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of Pilates on sleep quality, assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
   Results: Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising 477 participants were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the study. All included studies reported the positive effects Pilates had on sleep quality. The Pilates group (PG) significantly lowered the PSQI total score (MD = -3.60, 95%CI: [-5.41, -1.78), P = 0.0001, I-2 = 97%) compared to the non-exercising control group (CG), whereas no significant improvement in use of sleep medication was observed (MD = -0.33, 95%CI: [-0.73, -0.06), P = 0.10, I-2 = 68%). However, in a subgroup analysis, we found that there was no significant reduction in the PSQI total score for healthy participants over 40 years old (MD = -3.73, 95%CI: [-7.89, 0.42], P = 0.08, I-2 = 98%) and for postmenopausal women (MD = -5.55, 95%CI: [-13.98, -2.89], P = 0.20, I-2 = 98%).
   Conclusions: Overall, Pilates improved sleep quality but had no significant effect on the use of sleep medication. However, Pilates showed no significant impact on sleep quality for healthy individuals over 40 years old and for postmenopausal women. Well-designed and large-scale RCTs are needed in the future.

TI  - When Traumatic Memories Affect Your Health: A Clinical Case Study
T2  - CLINICAL CASE STUDIES
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSA) is the most common breathing-related sleep disorder and affects more than 20% of older individuals. Furthermore, risk of OSA increases in postmenopausal women. OSA is effectively treated using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, Mary, a 74-year-old White woman with OSA, severe, refused to obtain a CPAP machine because the sound of the machine elicited memories of her late husband's suicide. Intervention focused on reducing Mary's fear of CPAP sounds. Treatment involved imaginal exposure, in vivo exposure, sleep hygiene strategies, and relaxation strategies. Although evidence-based treatments for OSA and trauma separately exist, there are no treatment protocols designed to address the specific combination of the conditions. Treatment gains included a reduction in trauma-related symptoms and an increase in CPAP compliance. Quantity and quality of patient's sleep did not improve despite sleep hygiene and CPAP use. At 3-week follow-up, treatment gains and CPAP compliance were maintained.

TI  - Measuring Cot-Side the Effects of Parenteral Nutrition on Preterm Cortical Function
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Early nutritional compromise after preterm birth is shown to affect long-term neurodevelopment, however, there has been a lack of early functional measures of nutritional effects. Recent progress in computational electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has provided means to measure the early maturation of cortical activity. Our study aimed to explore whether computational metrics of early sequential EEG recordings could reflect early nutritional care measured by energy and macronutrient intake in the first week of life. A higher energy or macronutrient intake was assumed to associate with improved development of the cortical activity. We analyzed multichannel EEG recorded at 32 weeks (32.4 +/- 0.7) and 36 weeks (36.6 +/- 0.9) of postmenstrual age in a cohort of 28 preterm infants born before 32 weeks of postmenstrual age (range: 24.3-32 weeks). We computed several quantitative EEG measures from epochs of quiet sleep (QS): (i) spectral power; (ii) continuity; (iii) interhemispheric synchrony, as well as (iv) the recently developed estimate of maturational age. Parenteral nutritional intake from day 1 to day 7 was monitored and clinical factors collected. Lower calories and carbohydrates were found to correlate with a higher reduction of spectral amplitude in the delta band. Lower protein amount associated with higher discontinuity. Both higher proteins and lipids intake correlated with a more developmental increase in interhemispheric synchrony as well as with better progress in the estimate of EEG maturational age (EMA). Our study shows that early nutritional balance after preterm birth may influence subsequent maturation of brain activity in a way that can be observed with several intuitively reasoned and transparent computational EEG metrics. Such measures could become early functional biomarkers that hold promise for benchmarking in the future development of therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Relationships between depression and food intake in climacteric women
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Objective: This study evaluated the associations between food intake - especially omega-3 (n-3) - and depressive symptoms in climacteric women. Methods: Four hundred climacteric women were included in this research. The Kupperman Index, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and a 3-day food diary were used to investigate climacteric symptoms, depressive symptoms, and food intake, respectively. Sociodemographic, clinical, and anthropometric variables were also explored. Results: Statistically significant associations were observed between depression and climacteric symptoms, climacteric phase, previous history of depression, antidepressant drug use, family income, sleep pattern, and consumption of carbohydrates, fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins C, D, and B12. No association was observed between n-3 consumption and depression. Conclusion: Climacteric symptoms and food intake are important factors linked to depression during the climacteric period. Further studies are needed to clarify the changes in this phase of women's lives, as well as to investigate the role of the diet in the depression treatment or prevention.

TI  - Sleep patterns, genetic susceptibility, and incident cardiovascular disease: a prospective study of 385 292 UK biobank participants
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Aim To quantify the association of combined sleep behaviours and genetic susceptibility with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Methods and results This study included 385 292 participants initially free of CVD from UK Biobank. We newly created a healthy sleep score according to five sleep factors and defined the low-risk groups as follows: early chronotype, sleep 7-8 h per day, never/rarely insomnia, no snoring, and no frequent excessive daytime sleepiness. Weighted genetic risk scores of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke were calculated. During a median of 8.5 years of follow-up, we documented 7280 incident CVD cases including 4667 CHD and 2650 stroke cases. Compared to those with a sleep score of 0-1, participants with a score of 5 had a 35% (19-48%), 34% (22-44%), and 34% (25-42%) reduced risk of CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively. Nearly 10% of cardiovascular events in this cohort could be attributed to poor sleep pattern. Participants with poor steep pattern and high genetic risk showed the highest risk of CHD and stroke.
   Conclusion this large prospective study, a healthy sleep pattern was associated with reduced risks of CVD, CHD, and stroke among participants with low, intermediate, or high genetic risk.

TI  - The Scent of a Good Night's Sleep: Olfactory Cues of a Romantic Partner Improve Sleep Efficiency
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Almost nothing is known about whether exposure to the scent of loved ones influences sleep. In the current study, 155 participants spent 2 nights with their partner's scent and 2 nights with a control scent (in random order). Sleep was measured in two ways: sleep efficiency (via actigraphy) and perceived sleep quality (via self-report). Sleep efficiency was higher when participants were exposed to their partner's scent. This increase occurred regardless of participants' beliefs about the origin of the scent. Perceived sleep quality was higher when participants believed that they were smelling their partner's scent. Exposure to a partner's scent led sleep efficiency to increase by more than 2% on average, an improvement similar in magnitude to the effect of melatonin on sleep. The current work speaks to the critical role of olfaction in communication and reveals that social scents can impact sleep.

TI  - An examination of the relationship between sunlight exposure and hot flush in working women
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - We examined whether sunlight affects hot flushes in working menopausal women and explored effect modification by shift work and season. In this prospective cohort study, daily hot flush score (outcome) was measured by the 7-day North Central Cancer Treatment Group Daily Vasomotor Symptoms Diary. Daily duration of sunlight (>= 2000 lux) was recorded by the HOBO MX2202 pendant. Both variables were measured in two 7-day data collection phases. T0 data were collected during the Australian Summer (December 2017, January and February 2018); and T1 data were collected in the Australian winter (June, July and August 2018). Linear mixed effects model was used. Shift work and season were both confounders and effect modifiers. To detect a median effect size of R-2 = 0.2, 34 women were required to achieve an effective sample size of 41. A total of 49 menopausal women were recruited, 11 shift and 38 day workers. Some 13 women had various missing observations. For shift workers, an hour increase in sunlight exposure was associated with a 1.4-point reduction in hot flush score (p = .016). This relationship was not significant for day workers (p = .185). The finding of this study suggests increased sunlight exposure might improve hot flushes in menopausal shift workers who are moderately bothered by hot flushes, but probably not in day workers. The possible role of shift-work associated circadian disruption on estrogen level in regard to elevated intensity and frequency of hot flush in menopausal women is discussed.

TI  - Alterations in vaginal temperature during the estrous cycle in dairy cows detected by a new intravaginal device-a pilot study
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Estrus identification is important in dairy cow production. At present, estrus identification is automated with a pedometer or accelerometer and the results remain unsatisfactory. It was previously reported that body temperature changes during estrus. In the present study, dairy cow vaginal temperature (VT) was monitored during various seasons, and an increase in VT of 0.3 degrees C was suggested for the onset of estrus, using an automated VT monitoring system developed in-house. Natural and synchronized estrus were measured simultaneously. The VT was determined to be in circadian rhythm and significantly higher in summer than in either autumn or winter (P < 0.05). VT difference (between estrus VT and average VT 7 days earlier) gradually increased, reached a peak of 0.56 degrees C +/- 0.17 at 4 h before the end of estrus, and then decreased to the normal. The VT of cows in estrus and the duration of their estrus were significantly affected by seasons and estrus types (P < 0.05). VT gradually decreased in response to prostaglandin (PG) injection and was significantly lower (0.15-0.35 degrees C) from 9 to 33 h after the drug administration than the average VT at the same time 7 days earlier (P < 0.05). Changes in circadian and seasonal VT and in the estrous cycle can be monitored to assess the physiological status of cows and will help in developing an effective automated estrus identification technique. Results of this pilot study should be validated in further studies.

TI  - Evening chronotype is associated with poor cardiovascular health and adverse health behaviors in a diverse population of women
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Chronotype reflects time of day preferences for performing daily activities. Previous research within Asian and European cohorts indicates evening chronotype is associated with elevated cardiometabolic risk. However, evidence is limited from population-based US cohorts, particularly among women in whom evening chronotype prevalence may become higher after middle-age, coinciding with life stages associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. This cross-sectional study evaluated associations of chronotype with overall cardiovascular health (CVH), health behaviors, and cardiometabolic risk factors among 506 women (mean age = 37 +/- 16y, 62% racial/ethnic minority) in the American Heart Association (AHA)'s Go Red for Women Strategically-Focused Research Network cohort at Columbia University (New York City, NY, USA). Chronotype was assessed using the validated Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and categorized as "evening", "intermediate", and "morning" chronotypes. Health behaviors (diet, physical activity, and sleep) were assessed using validated questionnaires. Anthropometrics, clinical blood pressure, and blood biomarkers were assessed at the clinic visit. CVH was evaluated using the AHA Life's Simple 7 (LS7) metrics; LS7 scores of 0-8 and 9-14 were considered indicative of poor and moderate-to-high CVH, respectively. Linear and logistic regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, and menopausal status were used to examine associations of MEQ scores and chronotype categories with overall CVH, clinical cardiometabolic risk factors, and health behaviors. Overall, 13% of women identified as evening chronotypes, while 55% and 32% reported being intermediate and morning types. In linear models, higher MEQ scores were associated with higher AHA LS7 scores (beta(SE) = 0.02(0.01); p = .014), indicative of more favorable CVH, and with health behaviors not included in the LS7. Higher MEQ scores were also associated with lower Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, i.e. better sleep quality, (beta(SE) = -0.07(0.02), p < .0001), lower insomnia severity (beta(SE) = -0.14(0.01), p < .0001), shorter time to fall asleep (beta(SE) = -0.28(0.14), p = .044), and less sedentary time (beta(SE) = -0.11(0.03), p = .001). In logistic regression models, evening chronotype, compared to intermediate/morning type, was associated with higher odds of having poor CVH (OR(95%CI):2.41(1.20-4.85)), not meeting AHA diet (OR(95%CI):2.89(1.59-5.23)) and physical activity guidelines (OR(95%CI):1.78(1.03-3.07)), and having short sleep (OR(95%CI):2.15(1.24-3.73)) or insomnia (OR(95%CI):2.69(1.53-4.75)). The evening type compared to morning type was also associated with being a current smoker (OR(95%CI):2.14(1.02-4.52)) and having poor sleep quality (OR(95%CI:2.35(1.27-4.37)) and long sleep onset latency (OR(95%CI:1.89(1.00-3.56)). In our cohort of women, evening chronotype was related to poor CVH, likely driven by its influence on health behaviors. These findings, although warranting confirmation prospectively in other populations, suggest chronotype is an important factor to consider and possibly target when designing lifestyle interventions for CVD prevention.

TI  - Mental health aspect of quality of life in the menopausal transition
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate factors associated with mental health quality of life (QOL), such as depressed mood, anxiety, poor memory and sleep, among midlife women according to the menopausal status. Material and methods: Participants were 500 women aged 40-65 years. Data were collected using socio-demographic questionnaire, Women's Health Questionnaire (domains of depressed mood-DEP, anxiety-ANX, memory-MEM and sleep-SLE) and Short Form-36 (Mental Composite Score) for assessment of health-related QOL. Factors associated with poorer DEP, ANX, MEM and SLE were examined using adjusted linear regression models. Results: In premenopausal women, lower household monthly income (p = .046) was associated with higher level of DEP; higher body mass index (p = .045) was associated with higher ANX; having gynecological illnesses (p = .017) and menopause-related symptoms (p = .039) were associated with poorer MEM; being married (p = .036), drinking alcohol (p = .036) and having more physical activity (p = .041) was associated with better SLE. In postmenopausal women, worse DEP was more likely among women residing in city outskirts (p = .009), who are not married (p = .038) and with sedentary occupations (p = .049); lower education level (p = .030) was associated with more ANX; lower education level (p = .045) and having menopause-related symptoms (p = .044) were associated with poorer MEM; not engaging in regular recreation (p = .031) was associated with better SLE. Conclusions: To improve QOL, pre- and postmenopausal women should not only be supported in the management of menopause-specific symptoms. Women should also receive recommendations as to the behavioral and personal changes when approaching the midlife period.

TI  - Associations between sleep habits and interference of premenstrual symptoms in athletic performance in Japanese adolescent athletes: a cohort study over a 2-year period
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Premenstrual symptoms are common problems among female high-school and college athletes. This prospective study investigated associations between sleep habits and interference of premenstrual symptoms in athletic performance among Japanese adolescent athletes. A school-based survey on menstruation and school life was conducted among 623 female high-school students in 2015 and 2016, and data from the two surveys were connected. In total, 262 students completed the questionnaire in both years. We recruited 108 of those students who were athletes with regular menstrual cycles. Participants completed a questionnaire about their premenstrual symptoms and lifestyle habits. The prevalence of short sleep duration (<8 h) was high (95.4%). The difference in premenstrual symptom severity in individual students between the first and second years was not significant (p > .05). Premenstrual symptoms were less associated with disturbance in 'athletic performance in training or competition' in the second year than the first. 'Longer sleeping time' in the first year was associated with lower risk of increased interference of premenstrual symptoms in athletic performance in the second year (odds ratio 0.982, 95% confidence interval: 0.970-0.994). Shorter sleep duration may therefore have an effect on premenstrual symptoms' interference with athletic performance among Japanese adolescents.

TI  - Insomnia Overview: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Monitoring, and Nonpharmacologic Therapy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
AB  - Insomnia, whether short-term or chronic, is a common condition. It has a negative impact on vulnerable patient groups, including active military personnel and veterans, patients with coexisting psychiatric and medical disorders, those in life transitions such as menopause, and elderly persons. Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is first-line treatment for insomnia, its high cost and a lack of trained providers has prevented widespread uptake. Now, digital CBTI (dCBTI) is emerging as a scalable option with the potential to overcome these barriers in managed care. The first part of this article reviews the epidemiology and pathophysiology of insomnia with a focus on vulnerable patient groups. The second part explores the rapidly evolving landscape of nondrug therapy for insomnia. The underlying concepts and supporting evidence for CBTI and dCBTI are presented, including their utility in vulnerable patient groups.

TI  - The Menopause Transition and Women's Health at Midlife: A Progress Report From the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
AB  - A major health milestone for women with influences extending far beyond reproduction is the menopause transition (MT). In addition to menopausal symptoms, concomitant biological, psychological, behavioral, and social changes occur during the MT that shape women's midlife and future health. Much of what is known about the MT, its characteristics, and consequences is based on seminal longitudinal studies in the 1980s and 1990s that reported experiences of women seeking clinical care rather than population-based studies.
   The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) was initiated in 1996 with the goal of defining the MT, to characterize its biological and psychosocial antecedents and sequelae in an ethnically and racially diverse sample of midlife women (black, Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese, and white).
   The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a multisite, multiracial/ethnic, longitudinal cohort study, enrolled 3302 women in 1996 at 7 geographically distinct sites across the United States. Since a baseline visit at enrollment, 16 follow-up visits have been conducted through 2017. The aim of this review was to summarize the central findings of SWAN to date that can inform women and their health care providers about the impact of the MT and midlife aging on overall health and well-being. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation's characterization of the MT was instrumental to the development of the criterion standard staging system, STRAW+10, which characterizes the stages of reproductive aging and is critical to improving comparability across studies of midlife and menopause, providing uniform clinical terminology. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation contributed to our understanding of MT-related changes in 3 main areas (1) reproductive axis and menstrual cycle patterns informing staging of the MT; (2) symptoms and mental health; and (3) physiological systems and functions influenced by the MT. For each of these areas, when data were available, their similarities and differences in each of the SWAN's racial/ethnic groups are provided. The principal content included changes in areas influenced by SWAN: MT-related symptoms and mental health (vasomotor and psychological symptoms, sleep complaints, and cognitive performance, as well as urogenital and sexual health) and physiological systems and functions (cardiometabolic and cardiovascular health, bone health, physical function performance).
   The clinical and research implications of the reviewed findings are discussed as well as the next steps SWAN will take to understand women's health in midlife and early old age (when adverse changes in health and function start accumulating). Substantial interrelations among these changes and significant racial/ethnic differences in the rate and magnitude of change in multiple health indictors in midlife women are demonstrated in SWAN. The findings indicate that midlife is a critical stage for adopting healthy behavior and preventive strategies that can forestall or limit adverse outcomes of old age. It is not known whether the MT-related changes during midlife have causal influence on poor health and well-being in early old age or represent a temporary set of physical and mental challenges.
   In summary, SWAN has advanced our understanding over the past 23 years of the impact of the MT and midlife aging on health and well-being in women. These findings will be critical for determining whether MT-related changes during midlife are related to unfavorable health and well-being in early old age and will allow identification of interventions that may preserve health and function as women age.

TI  - Dietary Inflammatory Index Scores Are Associated with Pressure Pain Hypersensitivity in Women with Fibromyalgia
T2  - PAIN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective. Pain hypersensitivity has been described as one of the most disabling symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Here we analyzed the relationship between an anti-inflammatory diet profile and the pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) of tender point sites and other fibromyalgia-related symptoms in patients with FMS. Methods. This cross-sectional study included 95 women diagnosed with FMS and 98 menopause-status matched controls. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was calculated by conducting a 24-hour diet recall interview. The PPTs of tender point sites and self-reported global pain levels were evaluated by algometry and the visual analog scale, respectively. Disease severity, fatigue, sleep anxiety, and central sensitization were also evaluated. Results. Linear regression analysis revealed that the PPTs of tender point sites including the occiput (beta = 0.234, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.016-0.452, P = 0.036), trapezius (beta = 0.299, 95% CI = 0.083-0.515, P = 0.007), zygapophyseal joint (beta = 0.291, 95% CI = 0.022-0.559, P = 0.035), second rib (beta = 0.204, 95% CI = 0.060-0.348, P = 0.006), gluteus (beta = 0.591, 95% CI = 0.110-1.072, P = 0.017), greater trochanter (beta = 0.379, 95% CI = 0.016-0.742, P = 0.041), and knee (beta = 0.482, 95% CI = 0.117-0.850, P = 0.011) were associated with DII score after adjustments for the age, menopausal status, and global energy levels reported by the patients with FMS. No significant differences were found for the cases or controls between the DII score and the remaining clinical symptoms. Analyses of covariance showed that the PPTs of the aforementioned tender point sites were also significantly associated (P < 0.05) with the DII score quartiles in patients with FMS, but no significant differences were found between these quartiles and the other clinical symptoms. Conclusions. A pro-inflammatory diet was associated with pain hypersensitivity in patients with FMS.

TI  - Prevalence of Anemia and its Associated Factors among Chinese 9-, 12-, and 14-Year-Old Children: Results from 2014 Chinese National Survey on Students Constitution and Health
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Anemia has been one of the main nutritional challenges around the world. Not enough attention has been paid to this issue in children and adolescents in China. In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of anemia among 9-, 12-, and 14-year old Chinese children and investigate the associated factors of anemia. Methods: Data come from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 26 provinces and 4 municipalities in mainland China. A total of 48,537 children aged 9, 12, and 14 years old were included in data analyses. Anthropometric measurements were conducted to obtain information about height and weight. Capillary blood was collected from the fingertip, and hemoglobin concentration was tested by HemoCue201+. Information about sleep duration, daily consumption of eggs, milk, and breakfast were obtained from a self-administrated questionnaire. The mixed-effects logistic regression model was applied to estimate the association between selected variables and risk of anemia. Results: A total of 8.4% of participants were identified as being anemic; and the prevalence was higher in girls and rural children. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis showed that children who were overweight, obese, and consumed eggs and milk every day had a lower risk of anemia. Spermarche, overweight/obesity, and having milk every day were associated with lower risk of anemia in boys, while menarche was found to be a risk factor and eating eggs every day to be a protective factor of anemia in girls. Conclusions: Anemia among 9-, 12-, and 14-year-old children is still high. Intervention programs of adding egg and milk into school daily diet might contribute to reducing anemia in Chinese school aged children, especially for those living in rural areas or girls with menarche.

TI  - Impact of Estradiol Variability and Progesterone on Mood in Perimenopausal Women With Depressive Symptoms
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Context: Women are at increased risk for depressive symptoms during the menopause transition. Changes in estradiol secretion and presence of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) contribute to perimenopausal depressive symptoms, but links with progesterone have not been investigated.
   Objective: To determine whether estradiol variability, ovulatory levels of progesterone, and VMS burden are independently associated with perimenopausal depressive symptomatology.
   Design and Intervention: Depressive symptoms, serum levels of estradiol and progesterone, and VMS frequency were assessed weekly in an 8-week observational study. Association of mood with estradiol variability, ovulatory levels of progesterone, and VMS frequency were estimated using generalized estimating equation models.
   Setting: Academic medical center.
   Patients: Fifty unmedicated perimenopausal women with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (mean Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score 15.5 +/- 5.3).
   Main Outcome Measure: Depressive symptoms (MADRS score).
   Results: During the study, 90.0% of participants had varying estradiol levels, 51.1% had ovulatory progesterone levels, and 90% had VMS. Greater estradiol variability and absence of progesterone levels consistent with ovulation, but not VMS frequency, are associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms (beta = 0.11 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.04 to 0.18; P = 0.001]; beta = -2.62 [95% CI, -4.52 to -0.71; P = 0.007], respectively), after accounting for higher body mass index, lifetime history of depression, and stressful life events.
   Conclusions: Increasing dysregulation of ovarian hormones, but not VMS, associates with more depressive symptom burden during perimenopause. These results suggest that perimenopausal mood instability is driven by the underlying hormonal dysregulation of the menopause transition involving changes in both estradiol and progesterone.

TI  - Sleep Changes Across the Female Hormonal Cycle Affecting Memory: Implications for Resilient Adaptation to Traumatic Experiences
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - We review findings and propose a model explaining why women's adaptation to traumatic stress might be different than men's, including the role of cycling hormones and sleep differences in the development of post-traumatic stress and other stress-related disorders. Women are diagnosed with stress-related mental health disorders at a higher frequency than men. Most mental health disorders involve sleep disturbances, which may contribute to these disorders. The mechanisms by which sleep contributes to the development of mental health disorders in women have not been addressed in basic research. Sleep features such as spindle density and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep theta power are important for the role of sleep in emotion and cognition. The effect of hormonal cycles on these and other critical sleep features is only beginning to be understood. We explore what sleep factors could confer resilience to mental health disorders and how they might be altered by hormonal cycles in women. We target a specific system at the nexus of arousal control, stress response, and memory consolidation processes that has not been explored at all in women or across the hormonal cycle in animal studies: the locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) system.

TI  - Self-Hypnosis for Sleep Disturbances in Menopausal Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Poor sleep is one of the most frequent health concerns among menopausal women. All stages of sleep can be impacted by the menopause transition. Negative outcomes of poor sleep are multidimensional and include poor physical, psychological, cognition, and social outcomes. Hypnosis is a nonpharmacological treatment for poor sleep and hot flashes in menopausal women. The goal of hypnosis is to educate and train subjects to perform self-hypnosis to alleviate the underlying symptom. The use of hypnosis as a treatment for poor sleep has shown benefits for both acute and chronic insomnia. Initial findings from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) Hypnosis Intervention for Sleep in Menopause: Examination of Optimal Dose and Method of Delivery randomized control trial of 90 women were presented. Results showed that program and treatment satisfaction were high in all groups, adherence to daily practice met or exceeded adherence benchmarks. There were significant reduction of poor sleep quality in all groups with a significant increase in minutes slept in all groups. The majority of women also showed clinical improvements of duration. There were clinically meaningful improvements in reducing the perception of poor sleep quality in 50%-77% of women across time. Overall, the use of self-hypnosis as a treatment program for sleep problems related to menopause was acceptable for women. Data further support that hypnosis is a promising technique to improve sleep in menopausal women with sleep and hot flashes. Further research is ongoing on self-hypnosis delivery and implementation into wider populations of women using clear definition and control groups.

TI  - Trajectory analysis of sleep maintenance problems in midlife women before and after surgical menopause: the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Investigate temporal patterns of sleep maintenance problems in women who became surgically menopausal (hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy) before their final menstrual period and examine whether presurgery trajectories of sleep maintenance problems are related to problems staying asleep postsurgery. Methods: Longitudinal analysis of sleep self-reports collected every 1 to 2 years from 1996 to 2013 from 176 surgically menopausal women in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a seven-site community-based, multiethnic/multiracial, cohort study. Median follow-up was 15.3 years (4.2 years presurgery, 10.2 years postsurgery). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify patterns of problems staying asleep, and the presurgery trajectories were used to predict similar postsurgery sleep problems. Results: Four trajectory patterns of sleep maintenance problems were identified: low (33.5% of women), moderate (33.0%), increasing during presurgery (19.9%), and high (13.6%). One-fifth of women reported a presurgery increase in these problems. Postsurgically, problems staying asleep remained associated with similar levels of presurgical problems, even after adjusting for postsurgical early morning awakening, frequent vasomotor symptoms, and bodily pain score (beta(low) = -1.716, beta(moderate) = -1.144, beta(increasing) = -0.957, beta(high) = -1.021; all P values <0.01). Conclusions: Sleep maintenance problems were relatively stable across time postsurgery. These data are remarkably consistent with our trajectory results across the natural menopause, suggesting that presurgical assessment of sleep concerns could help guide women's expectations postsurgically. Although reassuring that sleep complaints do not worsen postsurgically for most surgically menopausal women, referral to a sleep specialist should be considered if sleep symptoms persist or worsen after surgery.

TI  - Effects of menopause on sleep quality and sleep disorders: Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: Sleep complaints are common during the menopause transition. However, it is difficult to disentangle changes in sleep related to aging from those directly due to menopause. We compared sleep disorders in 45 to 60-year-old women in a large population-based study, according to menopausal status. Methods: Women aged between 45 and 60 years who self-reported menopausal status were selected from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging, excluding those with prior hysterectomy. Participants completed assessments for overall sleep satisfaction, hours of daily sleep, sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintenance insomnia, daytime somnolence, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Each sleep variable was compared between postmenopausal and pre/perimenopausal women using multivariate regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Among 6,179 women included, 3,713 (60.1%; age 55.7 +/- 3.3 years) were postmenopausal and 2,466 (39.9%) were pre/perimenopausal (age 49.80 +/- 3.1 years). Compared with pre/perimenopausal women, postmenopausal women were more often reported requiring >= 30 minutes to fall asleep (20.4% vs 15.5%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.53) and were more likely to meet criteria for possible sleep-onset insomnia disorder (10.8% vs 7.3%; AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07-2.12). Postmenopausal women were also more likely to screen positive for OSA (14.6% vs 10.4%; AOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14-1.92). The two groups did not differ on sleep dissatisfaction (32.4% vs 29%), daytime somnolence disorder (1.6% vs 1.3%), sleep-maintenance insomnia disorder (17% vs 14.5%), RLS (23.5% vs 20.9%), or RBD (3.9% vs 4.0%). Conclusions: Menopause is associated with increased sleep-onset insomnia. Postmenopausal women also are more likely to screen positive for OSA. However, menopausal status is not associated with sleep maintenance, somnolence, or RLS, and RBD.

TI  - Clock control of mammalian reproductive cycles: Looking beyond the pre-ovulatory surge of gonadotropins
T2  - REVIEWS IN ENDOCRINE & METABOLIC DISORDERS
AB  - Several aspects of the physiology and behavior of organisms are expressed rhythmically with a 24-h periodicity and hence called circadian rhythms. Such rhythms are thought to be an adaptive response that allows to anticipate cyclic events in the environment. In mammals, the circadian system is a hierarchically organized net of endogenous oscillators driven by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This system is synchronized by the environment throughout afferent pathways and in turn it organizes the activity of tissues by means of humoral secretions and neuronal projections. It has been shown that reproductive cycles are regulated by the circadian system. In rodents, the lesion of the SCN results on alterations of the estrous cycle, sexual behavior, tonic and phasic secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)/gonadotropins and in the failure of ovulation. Most of the studies regarding the circadian control of reproduction, in particular of ovulation, have only focused on the participation of the SCN in the triggering of the proestrus surge of gonadotropins. Here we review aspects of the evolution and organization of the circadian system with particular focus on its relationship with the reproductive cycle of laboratory rodents. Experimental evidence of circadian control of neuroendocrine events indispensable for ovulation that occur prior to proestrus are discussed. In order to offer a working model of the circadian regulation of reproduction, its participation on aspects ranging from gamete production, neuroendocrine regulation, sexual behavior, mating coordination, pregnancy and deliver of the product should be assessed experimentally.

TI  - Beneficial effects of estrogens in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome
T2  - SLEEP AND BREATHING
AB  - Epidemiological studies showing the higher frequency of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome in men, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and in post-menopausal women suggest the beneficial role of estrogen. These findings are well supported by the pre-clinical studies (ten research studies described in this review) showing that estrogen and phytoestrogens attenuate the deleterious effects of chronic intermittent hypoxia (obstructive apnea in animals) on the genioglossal muscles and on other organs (co-morbidities) in ovariectomized rodents. Moreover, clinical studies (four research studies described in this review) have also shown the beneficial role of estrogen therapy on the parameters of obstructive apnea in post-menopausal women. The beneficial effects of estrogen and phytoestrogens on obstructive sleep apnea and its co morbidities have been attributed to increase in thioredoxin, Nrf-2, activation of p38 MAP kinases, inhibition of vagal C fibers, and attenuation of HIF-1 alpha. It is possible that estrogen-mediated activation of p38 MAP kinase may inhibit HIF-1 alpha to attenuate lung inflammation, which may inhibit the activation of vagal C fibers to attenuate bronchoconstriction and prevent obstruction during sleep. Moreover, estrogen-mediated increase in thioredoxin and Nrf-2 may also contribute in increasing antioxidant defense and attenuating inflammation.

TI  - A perspective from experimental studies of burning mouth syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is one of the most frequently seen idiopathic pain conditions in a dental setting. Peri- and postmenopausal women are most frequently affected, and patients who experience BMS complain of persistent burning pain mainly at the tip and the bilateral border of the tongue. Recent studies have assessed whether BMS is a neuropathic pain condition, based on morphologic changes in biopsied tongue specimens, and whether there are abnormal pain responses in patients with this disease. Somatosensory studies have reported some abnormal findings in sensory and pain detection thresholds with inconsistency; however, the most distinct finding was exaggerated responses to painful stimuli. Imaging and electrophysiologic studies have suggested the possibility of dysregulation of the pain-modulating system in the central nervous system, which may explain the enhanced pain responses despite the lack of typical responses toward quantitative sensory tests. Basic studies have suggested the possible involvement of neuroprotective steroids, although the underlying mechanisms of this condition have not been elucidated. Experimental studies are looking for preferable supportive therapies for BMS patients despite the obscure pathogenesis.

TI  - A comprehensive review and the pharmacologic management of primary dysmenorrhea
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic condition in women during the reproductive period. Severe dysmenorrhea pain affects their social activities, sleep, and quality of life. Nevertheless, the proportion of women with dysmenorrhea do not receive adequate medical counseling or pharmacological treatments. Primary dysmenorrhea is diagnosed clinically, and the secondary causes that can cause pelvic pain should be identified. The treatment of choice for primary dysmenorrhea is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In order to maximize the therapeutic effect, it is necessary to ensure that the appropriate medication is administered in a proper way. NSAIDs can cause adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disorders. If side effects occur or are anticipated with NSAIDs, the use of hormonal contraceptives may be recommended when contraception is considered. In addition to these pharmacological treatments, heat, dietary, and behavioral therapies have been tried and reported to have some effects. However, further research is required for robust conclusions.

TI  - Morning chronotype is a protective factor against chemotherapy-induced hot flashes in premenopausal women with breast cancer
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
AB  - Purpose Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer often causes hot flashes, impairing quality of life. However, the chronobiological or psychiatric factors associated with the development of chemotherapy-induced hot flashes (CIHFs) remain undetermined. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether chronotype was associated with the incidence of CIHFs. Methods A total of 119 premenopausal women with non-metastatic breast cancer awaiting adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery without hot flashes were included. The presence of CIHF was defined as having moderate to severe hot flashes, as measured by the subscale of hot flashes in the Menopause Rating Scale, at 4 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. Chronotype (Morning/Intermediate/Evening) was assessed with the Composite Scale of Morningness before adjuvant chemotherapy. To examine the association between chronotype and CIHF, we built logistic regression models, adjusting for age, body mass index, sleep quality, and radiation therapy. Results CIHF occurred in 50.4% of participants. Morning type was inversely associated with CIHF (reference: Intermediate type, odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.94; p = 0.040) in the univariate model, and the association remained significant (OR, 0.37; CI, 0.13-0.96; p = 0.045) after adjusting for age, body mass index, sleep quality, and radiation therapy. Conclusions Morning chronotype is a protective factor against the development of CIHF in patients with breast cancer. Chronotypes should be assessed and considered in the prediction and management of CIHF.

TI  - Severe insomnia is associated with metabolic syndrome in women over 50 years with major depression treated in psychiatry settings: a METADAP report
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Introduction: Major depression is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk. We have previously shown that severe insomnia, a core symptom of major depression episode (MDE), is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, a component of metabolic syndrome, in women but not in men with major depression. Since insomnia is related to cardiovascular morbidity in the general population and major depression also, our objective was to assess the link between insomnia and metabolic syndrome, a marker syndrome of cardiovascular risk, during MDE, in women and in men.
   Methods: In 624 patients with a current MDE cohort, both insomnia and metabolic syndrome were assessed in women and men. Insomnia was rated from 0 to 6 based on the HDRS corresponding items, severe insomnia being defined by a total insomnia score >4.
   Results: severe insomnia was associated with metabolic syndrome in women but not in men. In multivariate logistic regressions, these results in women were independent from age, educational level, major depressive disorder duration and current smoking. These results were only significant in women aged >= 50 years, a cut-off age for menopausal status but not in women under 50 years.
   Conclusion: Women aged >= 50 years with a severe insomnia during MDE have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Severe insomnia may be a clinical marker of metabolic risk in this population. They should be particularly monitored for metabolic syndrome and may benefit from sleep recommendations and cardiovascular prevention.

TI  - Cardiovascular Disease in Women Across the Lifespan: The Importance of Sleep
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and sleep disturbances are both common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Compared with men, women are more likely to report insufficient sleep. During the 2018 Research Conference on Sleep and the Health of Women sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, researchers in cardiology, integrative physiology and sleep medicine reviewed the current understanding of how sleep and sleep disturbances influence CVD in women across the lifespan. Women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of sleep disturbances at important stages of their life, including during pregnancy and after menopause. The proposed pathways linking sleep disturbances and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women are numerous and the complex interaction between them is not well understood. Future research focused on understanding the scope of sleep disorders in women, defining the underlying mechanisms, and testing interventions to improve sleep are critical for improving the cardiovascular health of all women.

TI  - Age of puberty and Sleep duration: Observational and Mendelian randomization study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Earlier age of puberty has detrimental consequences for many aspects of health. Here, for the first time, we assessed the association of earlier puberty with sleep duration observationally and with validation using Mendelian Randomization. In the "Children of 1997" birth cohort (n = 8,327), we used adjusted multivariable logistic regression to assess the associations of each clinically assessed marker of earlier puberty with self-report sleep duration in adolescence. Using two-sample MR, we assessed the effect of earlier puberty timing based on 203 single nucleotide polymorphisms applied to genome wide association studies of sleep duration in adults (n = 335,410). In "Children of 1997", cross-sectionally, older age of menarche was associated with longer (9+ hours) sleep duration [odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.21] at 13.5 years. The other earlier puberty markers were unrelated to sleep duration. Using inverse variance weighting, later of age at menarche increased adult sleep duration [0.020 per category, 95% CI 0.006 to 0.034]. This study demonstrated a causal effect of age at menarche on adult sleep duration, since age of menarche also affects obesity, our novel finding may be relevant to the observed relation of sleep duration with obesity and poor health.

TI  - Obesity and cardiovascular disease in women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY
AB  - As the prevalence of obesity continues to grow worldwide, the health and financial burden of obesity-related comorbidities grows too. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is clearly associated with increased adiposity. Importantly, women are at higher risk of CVD when obese and insulin resistant, in particular at higher risk of developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and ischemic heart disease. Increased aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor activation, aberrant estrogenic signaling and elevated levels of androgens are among some of the proposed mechanisms explaining the heightened CVD risk. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, understanding nontraditional risk factors specific to women, like excess weight gain during pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and menopause are central to designing personalized interventions aimed to curb the epidemic of CVD. In the present review, we examine the available evidence supporting a differential cardiovascular impact of increased adiposity in women compared with men and the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms behind these differences. We also discuss women-specific cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance.

TI  - Risk of excessive sleepiness in sleep restriction therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) has been shown to be comparably effective relative to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but with lower requirements for patient contact. As such, SRT appears to be a viable alternate treatment for those who cannot complete a full course of CBT-I. However, it is unclear whether SRT-a treatment solely focusing on restricting time in bed-increases risk for sleepiness comparably to CBT-I. The current study tested objective sleepiness as an outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing SRT, CBT-I, and attention control in a sample of postmenopausal women in whom insomnia was diagnosed according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.
   Methods: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 +/- 5.64 years) with perimenopausal or postmenopausal onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition insomnia disorder were randomized to 3 treatment conditions: sleep education control (6 sessions); SRT (2 sessions with interim phone contact); and CBT-I (6 sessions). Blinded assessments were performed at pretreatment and posttreatment. Risk of excessive sleepiness was evaluated using a symmetry analysis of sleepiness measured through the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).
   Results: The odds ratios (ORs) of being excessively sleepy versus nonsleepy were not different than 1.0 for both SRT (OR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [0.13-6.96]) and CBT-I (OR = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [0.09-4.46]), indicating that the odds of becoming excessively sleepy following treatment was not different from the odds of being nonsleepy. This suggests that excessive sleepiness is not of unique concern following SRT relative to CBT-I or sleep education.
   Conclusions: SRT appears to have a comparable risk profile for excessive sleepiness as CBT-I, and thus may be considered a safe alternative to CBT-I. Future research should characterize objective measures of excessive sleepiness immediately following sleep restriction.

TI  - Outdoor light at night at residences and breast cancer risk in Canada
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Experimental and epidemiologic studies suggest that light at night (LAN) exposure disrupts circadian rhythm, and this disruption may increase breast cancer risk. We investigated the potential association between residential outdoor LAN and breast cancer risk. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Vancouver, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario, Canada with incident breast cancer cases, and controls frequency matched by age in the same region. This analysis was restricted to 844 cases and 905 controls who provided lifetime residential histories. Using time-weighted average duration at each home 5-20 years prior to study entry, two measures of cumulative average outdoor LAN were calculated using two satellite data sources. Logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between outdoor LAN and breast cancer risk, considering interactions for menopausal status and night shift work. We found no association between residential outdoor LAN and breast cancer for either measure of LAN [OR comparing highest vs. lowest tertile (DNB) = 0.95, 95% CI 0.70-1.27]. We also found no association when considering interactions for menopausal status and past/current night work status. These findings were robust to changes to years of residential data considered, residential mobility, and longer exposure windows. Our findings are consistent with studies reporting that outdoor LAN has a small effect or no effect on breast cancer risk.

TI  - Why young women gain weight: A narrative review of influencing factors and possible solutions
T2  - OBESITY REVIEWS
AB  - Significant weight gain occurs in women during young adulthood, which increases risk of diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many cancers. This review aims to inform future individually targeted weight gain prevention programmes and summarizes possible targets: key life events, mediators that influence energy intake and physical activity levels, and moderators that could identify groups of women at greatest risk. Life events affecting weight include pregnancy and motherhood, smoking cessation, marriage and cohabiting, attending university, and possibly bereavement. Research has identified successful methods for preventing weight gain associated with pregnancy and motherhood, which could now be used in practice, but evidence is inconclusive for preventing weight gain around other life events. Weight gain is mediated by lack of knowledge and skills around food and nutrition, depression, anxiety, stress, satiety, neural responses, and possibly sleep patterns and premenstrual cravings. A paucity of research exists into altering these to limit weight gain. Moderators include socioeconomic status, genetics, personality traits, and eating styles. More research is required to identify at-risk females and engage them in weight gain prevention. There is a need to address evidence gaps highlighted and implement what is currently known to develop effective strategies to limit weight gain in young women.

TI  - Menstrual phase-dependent differences in neurobehavioral performance: the role of temperature and the progesterone/estradiol ratio
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study objectives: Women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle exhibit better cognitive performance overnight than women in the follicular phase, although the mechanism is unknown. Given the link between core body temperature (CBT) and performance, one potential mechanism is the thermoregulatory role of progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2), and their ratio (P4/E2), which change across the menstrual cycle. We examined the role of P4/E2 in modulating performance during extended wake in premenopausal women. Additionally, we compared the acute effects of nighttime light exposure on performance, CBT, and hormones between the menstrual phases.
   Methods: Participants were studied during a 50 h constant routine and a 6.5 h monochromatic nighttime light exposure. Participants were 16 healthy, naturally cycling women (eight follicular; eight luteal). Outcome measures included reaction time, attentional failures, self-reported sleepiness, CBT, melatonin, P4, and E2.
   Results: As compared to women in the luteal phase, women in the follicular phase exhibited worse performance overnight. CBT was significantly associated with performance, P4, and P4/E2 but not with other sex hormones. Sex hormones were not directly related to performance. Light exposure that suppressed melatonin improved performance in the follicular phase (n = 4 per group) to levels observed during the luteal phase and increased CBT but without concomitant changes in P4/E2.
   Conclusions: Our results underscore the importance of considering menstrual phase when assessing cognitive performance during sleep loss in women and indicate that these changes are driven predominantly by CBT. Furthermore, this study shows that vulnerability to sleep loss during the follicular phase may be resolved by exposure to light.

TI  - Structural equation model analysis for the evaluation of factors associated with overweight and obesity in menopausal women in RaNCD cohort study
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Weight gain and increased body fat mass are among the common complications of menopause. In addition to hormonal changes, behavioral and environmental factors aggravate transition through this phase. This study uses a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate factors associated with overweight and obesity in menopausal women.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 4,471 women (pre/perimenopausal 3,150, menopausal 1,321) from baseline data of the Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort study in the west region of Iran in 2018. Obesity and overweight were the outcome variables. SEM was used to examine the relationships, using IBM SPSS, AMOS version 23.
   Results: The mean body fat percentage and visceral fat area in menopausal women was significantly greater than among pre/perimenopause women. The direct association of higher socioeconomic status (SES) with a healthy dietary pattern was stronger among pre/perimenopausal women than among menopausal women (beta = 0.574 vs beta = 0.552). In both groups, less physical activity was associated with depression and musculoskeletal disorders, and this association was stronger in menopausal women (beta = -0.174 vs beta = -0.215; P > 0.05). Overweight and obesity were directly decreased (beta = -0.011, P > 0.05) and indirectly increased (beta = 0.013, P > 0.05) in pre/perimenopausal women by sleep duration, but they were directly and indirectly decreased in menopausal women.
   Conclusions: The direct and indirect effects of well-known risk factors associated with overweight and obesity were found to be different in pre/perimenopausal and menopausal groups. Some risk factors showed stronger effects among menopausal women compared with the pre/perimenopausal women. Physical activity and healthy dietary pattern had a mediator impact in the two study groups.

TI  - The association between abuse history in childhood and salivary rhythms of cortisol and DHEA in postmenopausal women
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - A history of child abuse (CA) is associated with morbidity and mortality in adulthood, and one proposed mechanism is dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Therefore, we evaluated whether a history of physical and sexual CA was associated with daily rhythms of HPA hormones (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) among postmenopausal women (mean age: 60.6 years). In 2013, 233 participants from the Nurses' Health Study H provided up to 5-timed saliva samples over the course of a day: immediately upon awakening, 45 min, 4 h, and 10 h after waking, and prior to going to sleep. Among these 233 participants, 217 provided >= 4 timed saliva samples. Assessment of physical and sexual CA history occurred in 2001 using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. Cumulative CA history was derived by combining reports of physical and sexual abuse prior to age 18. Piecewise linear mixed models compared diurnal rhythms of cortisol and DHEA between participants with none-to-moderate CA (n = 104, reference group) versus high-to-severe CA (n = 113). Models adjusted for characteristics at each saliva collection, health status, sleep quality, medications, and hormone use. Compared to those with none-to-moderate CA, women with high-to-severe CA had different diurnal rhythms in the early and evening hours, including blunted (less steep) early declines in DHEA (% difference (%D) = 10.7, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 4.3, 17.5), and steeper late declines in both cortisol and DHEA (cortisol %D = -2.5, 95 % CI -4.8, -0.1, and DHEA %D = -3.9, 95 % CI -6.0, -1.8). In conclusion, high-to-severe abuse history prior to age 18 was more strongly associated with differences in DHEA rather than cortisol, suggesting that early life abuse may be related to dysregulation of stress-response mechanisms later in life.

TI  - High glycemic index and glycemic load diets as risk factors for insomnia: analyses from the Women's Health Initiative
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown mixed results on the association between carbohydrate intake and insomnia. However, any influence that refined carbohydrates have on risk of insomnia is likely commensurate with their relative contribution to the overall diet, so studies are needed that measure overall dietary glycemic index (GI), glycemic load, and intakes of specific types of carbohydrates.
   Objective: We hypothesized that higher GI and glycemic load would be associated with greater odds of insomnia prevalence and incidence.
   Methods: This was a prospective cohort study with postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, investigating the relations of GI, glycemic load, other carbohydrate measures (added sugars, starch, total carbohydrate), dietary fiber, and specific carbohydrate-containing foods (whole grains, nonwhole/refined grains, nonjuice fruits, vegetables, dairy products) with odds of insomnia at baseline (between 1994 and 1998; n = 77,860) and after 3 y of follow-up (between 1997 and 2001; n = 53,069).
   Results: In cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, higher dietary GI was associated with increasing odds of prevalent (fifth compared with first quintile OR: 1.11; CI: 1.05, 1.16; P-trend = 0.0014) and incident (fifth compared with first quintile OR: 1.16; CI: 1.08, 1.25; P-trend < 0.0001) insomnia in fully adjusted models. Higher intakes of dietary added sugars, starch, and nonwhole/refined grains were each associated with higher odds of incident insomnia. By contrast, higher nonjuice fruit and vegetable intakes were significantly associated with lower odds of incident insomnia. Also, higher intakes of dietary fiber, whole grains, nonjuice fruit, and vegetables were significantly associated with lower odds of prevalent insomnia.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that high-GI diets could be a risk factor for insomnia in postmenopausal women. Substitution of high-GI foods with minimally processed, whole, fiber-rich carbohydrates should be evaluated as potential treatments of, and primary preventive measures for, insomnia in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Role of menopause and hormone replacement therapy in sleep-disordered breathing
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS
AB  - There are suggestions that the loss of female sex hormones following menopause is critical for the development or progression of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). We conducted a review of the literature on the role of menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in SDB risk. There is an increase in SDB during the menopausal transition period, but data on an effect beyond that of increasing age and changes in body habitus are weak or absent. Early community-based, observational studies reported a protective effect by HRT on SDB prevalence, but this could possibly be explained as a healthy user effect. Interventional studies of the effect of HRT on SDB are sparse, with only a few randomized placebo-controlled studies, often performed on small samples of women without clinically significant SDB. HRT regimens have varied and all the studies are fairly old. They do not definitely assure the alleviation of SDB and HRT cannot thus be recommended as treatment for SDB. It is concluded that there is no evidence that female sex hormone changes during menopause per se are able to explain the increase in SDB in midlife women and conclusions on the effect of HRT on SDB cannot be drawn from the current literature.

TI  - Physical and mental fatigue across the menstrual cycle in women with and without generalised anxiety disorder
T2  - HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Subjective, disabling fatigue is a common complaint and a key feature of numerous medical conditions, and is a transdiagnostic feature of psychiatric disorders. Despite physical and mental fatigue being associated with functional impairment and reduced quality of life, little is understood about its underlying mechanisms or modulating factors. Women commonly experience exacerbation of other (non-fatigue related) psychiatric symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and report greater fatigue prevalence compared to men. It is therefore plausible that subjective fatigue may similarly fluctuate across the menstrual cycle. Here we compared physical and mental fatigue in the early-follicular (lower ovarian hormones) and mid-luteal (higher ovarian hormones) phases of a single menstrual cycle, while controlling for sleep disruption, in women with (n = 18) and without (non-anxious; n = 20) generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). As expected, women with GAD reported greater physical and mental fatigue than healthy women. Further, although there were no changes in physical fatigue from the early-follicular to mid-luteal phases in both groups, mental fatigue in non-anxious women increased to levels equivalent to those experienced by their GAD counterparts in the mid-luteal phase. Although salivary levels of estradiol and progesterone increased from the early-follicular to mid-luteal phase, hormones did not significantly predict fatigue in either phase. These findings are consistent with the exacerbations of state anxiety and mood disturbance recognised to occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. We speculate that increased mental fatigue in the luteal phase may represent a vulnerable period for the development and maintenance of psychiatric disorders, potentially via compromised emotional regulation.

TI  - Detection and Prediction of Ovulation From Body Temperature Measured by an In-Ear Wearable Thermometer
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Objective: We present a non-invasive wearable device for fertility monitoring and propose an effective and flexible statistical learning algorithm to detect and predict ovulation using data captured by this device. Methods: The system consists of an earpiece, which measures the ear canal temperature every 5& x00A0;min during night sleep hours, and a base station that transmits data to a smartphone application for analysis. We establish a data-cleaning protocol for data preprocessing and then fit a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with two hidden states of high and low temperature to identify the more probable state of each time point via the predicted probabilities. Finally, a post-processing procedure is developed to incorporate biorhythm information to form a time-course biphasic profile for each subject. Results: The performance of the proposed algorithms applied to data collected by the device are compared with traditional methods in terms of match rate with self-reported ovulation days confirmed with an ovulation test kit. Empirical study results from a group of 34 users yielded significant improvements over the traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy (with sensitivity 92.31& x0025;) and prediction power (23.07-31.55& x0025; higher). Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility for reliable ovulation detection and prediction with high-frequency temperature data collected by a non-invasive wearable device. Significance: Traditional fertility monitoring methods are often either inaccurate or inconvenient. The wearable device and learning algorithm presented in this paper provide a user friendly and reliable platform for tracking ovulation, which may have a broad impact on both fertility research and real-world family planning.

TI  - Contributions of the Women's Health Initiative to understanding associations between sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep-disordered breathing across a range of health outcomes in postmenopausal women
T2  - SLEEP HEALTH
AB  - The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a longitudinal study of more than 161,000 postmenopausal women across the United States, provides an opportunity to investigate the link between sleep health and healthy aging. The purpose of this paper was to systematically review all published WHI articles examining sleep as a predictor of health outcomes and health behaviors/quality of life outcomes. A strength of the WHI is that for most participants, sleep measures were completed before a major health diagnosis, with a significant portion of participants also providing sleep measures after diagnosis. Twenty-three WHI articles were identified and examined for this review. The combination of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms was the most commonly investigated sleep measure. The results indicated that both short (<= 6 hours) and long (>= 9 hours) sleep duration were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, mortality, cognitive decline, and poor diet. Insomnia symptoms, frequent snoring, and risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) were also associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke and cardiovascular disease. However, many significant results were attenuated after multivariable adjustment. Limitations of these WHI examinations include the use of different categories for sleep measures across studies and a lack of examination by race/ethnicity. Owing to the longitudinal study design, large sample size, and long-term follow-up for health outcomes, the WHI serves as a rich resource for examining associations between sleep characteristics, demographics, and health in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Childhood Dystonia-Parkinsonism Following Infantile Spasms-Clinical Clue to Diagnosis in Early Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration
T2  - NEUROPEDIATRICS
AB  - Introduction Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a very rare, X-linked dominant (XLD) inherited member of the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) disease family. Case report We present a female case of BPAN with infantile spasms in the first year, Rett-like symptomatology, focal epilepsy, and loss of motor skills in childhood. Menarche occurred at the age of 9, after precocious pubarche and puberty. Dystonia-parkinsonism as extrapyramidal sign at the age of 10 years resulted in radiological and genetic work-up. Results Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) measured 66/120 points in body part-related dystonia symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed dopamine depletion. T2 and B0 sequences of the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed susceptibility artifacts with NBIA-typical hypointense globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra (SN). Next-generation sequencing revealed a BPAN-causing pathogenic variant in WDR45 (WD repeat-containing protein 45) gene (c.830 + 1G > A, XLD, heterozygous, de novo). Skewed X-inactivation was measured (2:98). Conclusions Autophagy-related X-linked BPAN disease might still be underdiagnosed in female cases of infantile spasms. Skewed X-inactivation will have mainly influenced the uncommon, very early childhood neurodegenerative symptomatology in the present BPAN case. Oral levodopa substitution led to improvement in sleep disorder, hypersalivation, and swallowing. Reduced white matter and hypointense signals in SN and GP on susceptibility sequences in magnetic resonance imaging are characteristic radiological findings of advanced disease in NBIA. No BPAN-typical halo sign in T1-weighted scan at midbrain level was seen at the age of 11 years. NBIA panel is recommended for early diagnosis.

TI  - Impacts of sex and the estrous cycle on associations between post-fear conditioning sleep and fear memory recall
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Women are at greater risk than men for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after trauma exposure. Sleep, especially rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), has been considered a contributing factor to the development of PTSD symptoms through its effects on the processing of emotional memories. However, it remains unknown if sex and sex hormones play a role in the hypothesized impact of sleep on the development of PTSD. Animal models have methodological advantages over human studies in investigating this research question; however, animal models of sleep in PTSD have been tested only with males. C57BL/6 mice (7 males and 15 females) were exposed to 15 footshocks in a footshock chamber, and 5 min after the last footshock, were returned to their home cages for telemetric electroencephalographic sleep recording. Nine to thirteen days later, mice were returned to the footshock chamber for 10 min without footshocks. Fear recall rates were computed by comparing freezing behaviors in the footshock chamber immediately after the footshocks to those during fear context reexposure. Males had significantly lower recall rates compared to metestrous females (that received footshocks on metestrus). Overall, males slept more than both proestrous females (that received footshocks on proestrus) and metestrous females during the dark period. Regression analyses revealed that average REMS episode durations after footshocks were differentially associated with recall rates across groups, such that the association was positive in males, but negative in proestrous females. Results suggest that both sex and the estrous cycle modulate the associations between REMS continuity and fear memory consolidation.

TI  - Hormonal contraceptive use and subjective sleep reports in women: An online survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
AB  - Female sexual hormones have known hypnogenic effects and the use of hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal women leads to improvement in sleep quality. However, the effects of hormonal contraceptives in women of reproductive age are still scarcely understood. This study sought to evaluate the impact of hormonal contraceptive use on subjective self-reports of sleep through a web-based cross-sectional survey. A total of 2,055 women between 18 and 40 years old participated by answering an online questionnaire evaluating hormonal contraceptive use, sleep-related characteristics and related features. Sleep assessment tools comprised the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Statistical comparisons were performed between hormonal contraceptive users and those who reported no current use. Analyses were repeated to compare users of combined contraceptives with users of progestagens only, as well as to compare users of different generations of contraceptives. Among the total sample, 1,286 participants met the inclusion criteria (918 of them were currently taking a hormonal contraceptive). Contraceptive users reported more frequent sleep complaints and had higher scores on ESS and ISI, which means increased excessive daytime sleepiness and more insomnia symptoms. Women using progestagen-only therapies reported lower total sleep duration compared with combined therapy. Users of third-generation contraceptives showed lower total sleep time and higher ISI score when compared with non-users. In conclusion, contraceptive users have more insomnia symptoms and increased excessive daytime sleepiness when compared with women who do not use any hormonal contraceptive method, and progestagen-only therapy was associated with lower sleep duration.

TI  - Cardiorespiratory fitness, sleep, and physiological responses to stress in women
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SPORT SCIENCE
AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRfitness) is associated with reduced risk of depression and anxiety in women, however, the mechanisms by which CRfitness may be protective against the development of these disorders are less clear. Because sleep problems are associated with both a higher risk for mental illness and altered physiological responses to stress, this study investigated whether sleep quality might influence the relationship between CRfitness and physiological stress responses in women. Thirty healthy women (18-45 y) who were medication-free, with regular menstrual cycles completed: (1) enrolment visit [including the assessment of CRfitness via maximal oxygen consumption during exercise]; (2) one-week sleep monitoring period including subjective (daily sleep diaries) and objective (wrist actigraphy) sleep measures; and (3) psychosocial stressor protocol (the Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) for the collection of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and salivary cortisol stress responses. Higher CRfitness was associated with reduced wake after sleep onset (WASO) duration (r = -.38, p = 0.04), higher self-reported sleep quality (higher scores reflect poorer sleep quality; r = -.37, p = 0.05), and lower HR (r = -.43, p = 0.02) during the stressor. Higher sleep quality was associated with a lower HR during the stressor (r = .44, p = 0.01). Increased WASO duration and WASO number were associated with blunted cortisol output during the stressor (r = -.44, p = 0.02, and r = -.46, p = 0.02, respectively). Results suggest that, in women, CRfitness may be protective against the deleterious effects of stress via improved sleep quality.

TI  - Association Between a Comprehensive Movement Assessment and Metabolically Healthy Overweight Obese Adults
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior are associated with metabolic health in overweight and obese individuals. However, the role of comprehensive health-related movement guidelines on PA, recreational screen time, and sleep among Metabolically Healthy Overweight-Obese (MHO) individuals is unknown. We investigated differences in comprehensive movement assessment scores between adults classified as MHO or Non-MHO. The sample included 513 adults (46.2% male), aged 19 to 85 years, body mass index (BMI) >= 25, from cycle 2005-2006 of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Comprehensive movement assessment outcomes were defined as meeting modified 24-Hour Movement Guidelines criteria, with thresholds adapted for adults. 13.8% of participants were MHO (normal serum glucose, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure). Only 1.4% of MHO participants met all guidelines. MHO and Non-MHO participants had similar comprehensive movement assessment scores (MHO: 18.3% vs. Non-MHO: 10.9%; p = 0.072). MHO individuals had less continuous recreational screen time than Non-MHO individuals (1.8 +/- 1.4 hrs/day vs. 2.5 +/- 1.6 hrs/day; p < 0.001). Meeting the recreational screen time recommendation was the only variable associated with the MHO phenotype (OR:4.84 95%CI: 2.33-10.07). This association remained after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, and BMI (OR: 3.53 95%CI: 1.72-7.24). Our results suggest the importance of limiting recreational screen time in adults to optimize cardiometabolic risk profile in individuals living with overweight or obesity. Using movement guidelines with a screen time component to assess the risk associated with health outcomes in adults appears to provide a better assessment.

TI  - Health problems among breast cancer survivors after completing conventional treatments: A cross-sectional study
T2  - NURSING & HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - This cross-sectional design study aimed to explore health problems among breast cancer survivors after completing conventional treatments. Purposive sampling was adopted to recruit 160 breast cancer survivors from a regional tertiary care hospital and hospital with a specialist cancer center in southern Thailand. STROBE checklist of items for cross-sectional studies is applied to report the study. Five most frequent, severe, and distressing symptoms faced in the first 3 years after cancer treatment were reported as numbness to the affected side, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, pain, and skin changes. Almost half of the participants reported symptoms indicating a definite diagnosis of anxiety, and nearly 70% of them rated themselves as borderline depressed or depressed. Approximately 50% of participants reported no change in their relationships with significant people, and about 60% of them reported a high-level fear of recurrence. Symptom frequency, severity, and distress were positively associated with anxiety, depression, and menopausal symptoms, while relationship changes were negatively associated with menopausal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Support and information for these women are required after active treatment has ceased to deal with ongoing symptoms.

TI  - Muscle and joint pains in middle-aged women are associated with insomnia and low grip strength: a cross-sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Background: Although muscle and joint pains are among the most common symptoms in menopausal transition, their underlying mechanisms are not precisely known. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with myalgia and arthralgia in middle-aged women. Methods: We analyzed in a cross-sectional manner the first-visit records of 305 Japanese women aged 40-59 years who enrolled in a health and nutrition education program at a menopause clinic. The prevalence of muscle and joint pains was estimated according to the participants' responses to the Menopausal Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire. Background characteristics including age, menopause status, body composition, cardiovascular parameters and physical fitness, as well as other menopausal symptoms including vasomotor symptoms, insomnia, depression and anxiety, were assessed for associations with daily myalgia and arthralgia. Results: The percentage of women who were bothered by muscle and joint pains almost every day of the previous week was 56.1%. Characteristics associated with these symptoms were: low stature; high body fat percentage; low grip strength; and high vasomotor, insomnia, depression and anxiety symptom scores. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that independently associated factors (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) for daily myalgia/arthralgia were low hand-grip strength (kgf) (0.92 [0.87-0.97]) and insomnia symptom score (1.20 [1.07-1.34]). Conclusion: Muscle and joint pains are highly prevalent in Japanese middle-aged women. Low grip strength and insomnia are independently associated with these symptoms. Treatment of insomnia in this population might improve myalgia/arthralgia, and in turn, help restore grip strength, or treatment of hand pain might conversely reduce insomnia in addition to improvement in grip strength.

TI  - Effect of sleep duration on blood pressure in women over 55 years of age - Poznan Cohort study
T2  - NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is considered to be the most common pathology of the circulatory system and the most common cause of death or cardiovascular diseases' development. There are many commonly known risk factors of this condition, such as overweight, obesity, a high-fat diet, family history of ischemic heart disease, lipid disorders, and atherosclerosis. In order to reduce the effect of high blood pressure, patients should modify their lifestyle, including sleeping patterns. We wanted to investigate if, in a group of women over 55 years of age compared to the general population from Poznan cohort, sleep duration is related to hypertension.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All subjects were divided into three research groups depending on the time of sleep. The first group included people who have been sleeping less than 6 hours a day. The second group included people who have been sleeping from 6 to 9 hours a day. The third group was characterized by people with sleep time over 9 hours a day. Due to their age, participants were divided into two groups, below and over 55 years of age.
   RESULTS: There is a weak positive correlation between long sleep duration (>9h) and a higher prevalence of unregulated blood pressure (r = 0.3, p = 0.017) in the group of women over 55 years of age.
   CONCLUSION: Unregulated increased blood pressure may occur more frequently in postmenopausal women whose sleep duration exceeds 9 hours a day.

TI  - Comparative study of the effect of resistance exercises versus aerobic exercises in postmenopausal women suffering from insomnia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MID-LIFE HEALTH
AB  - Study Objectives: The main objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of resistance exercises versus aerobic exercises in postmenopausal women suffering from insomnia using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Materials and Methods: Sixty postmenopausal women with menopause <10 years, suffering from insomnia for >1 month and on no supplementary exercises were recruited and categorized conveniently into two groups of 30 each. Group A received resistance exercises and Group B aerobic exercises. PSQI was used to screen postmenopausal women. Women on hormone replacement therapy, with artificial menopause, with diagnosed osteoporosis (t > 2) were excluded. Group A underwent general strengthening program in the form of closed-chain exercise. Group B received aerobic exercises after calculating target heart rate (HR) using Karvonen's formula in the form of brisk walking three times a week at 30%-60% of HRmax. Results: Paired t-test done to evaluate pre- and postmean values of PSQI for Group A. P < 0.001 which is highly statistically significant. Paired t-test done to evaluate pre- and postmean values of PSQI for Group B. P < 0.001, which is highly statistically significant. Unpaired t-test was carried out to compare the mean difference (pre-post) of PSQI values of both the groups. P < 0.001 which is highly significant. The mean difference of Group A (i.e., 4) is more than the mean difference of Group B (i.e., 2.63) indicating that the intervention of resistance exercises is more effective. Conclusion: Aerobic exercises and resistance exercises, both are effective in reducing insomnia in postmenopausal women, but resistance exercises are more beneficial than aerobic exercises.

TI  - Epidemiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma progression
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Its incidence has grown alongside the increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The risk of progression to hepatocellular carcinoma for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients over 5 years is 8%, and despite targeted and immunotherapy treatment advances, HCC maintains a bleak 5-year survival of 19%. NAFLD's primary risk factors are components of metabolic syndrome as well as possible sleep disturbances. NAFLD is most common among men 50-60 years of age, though incidence in women catches up after menopause. In the US, Hispanics are most likely to develop NAFLD and African Americans least likely, in part due to the prevalence of the PNPLA3 gene variant. With NAFLD risk factors especially prevalent in underserved populations and developing nations, public health interventions, earlier diagnosis, and novel treatments could curb the growing disease burden.

TI  - Vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone compared to other methods of treating vaginal and vulvar atrophy associated with menopause
T2  - MENOPAUSE REVIEW-PRZEGLAD MENOPAUZALNY
AB  - During the menopause, a fall in estrogen levels often leads to many unfavorable symptoms, including changes in the vascular and urogenital systems, in mood, and sleep. The symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy are especially troublesome for menopausal women. These symptoms not only disturb the sexual sphere, but also functioning at work and in the family. Based on the literature, a review of contemporary methods of management in the case of symptoms of vulvar atrophy in menopausal women has been performed. The current methods of treating vulvovaginal atrophy in menopausal women are described. The pharmacology of the available dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) preparations, both oral and vaginal, was briefly analyzed. Own experiences of using DHEA are presented. Vaginal DHEA has been found to be an effective and safe treatment in menopausal women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

TI  - Investigation the effect of jujube seed capsule on sleep quality of postmenopausal women: A double-blind randomized clinical trial
T2  - BIOMEDICINE-TAIWAN
AB  - Bakground and objective: Sleep disorder is among the most common problems in the life of postmenopausal women. Because of the complications of chemical drugs, many women prefer to use herbal supplements for relieving sleep problems. So, the main objective of this study was to determine the effect of the jujube seed capsule on sleep quality in postmenopausal women.
   Materials and methods: This study was a double-blind clinical trial conducted on 106 postmenopausal women in Khuzestan province, southwest of Iran. All participants were selected by a simple non-probability sampling method. Data were collected through a demographic data form and the Pittsburgh sleeps quality index (PSQI). Individuals were randomly divided into intervention (n = 53) and control (n = 53) groups. The intervention group received 250 mg oral jujube seed capsule and the control group received a placebo capsule twice a day for 21 days. After the treatment, the PSQI was completed in both intervention and control groups. Data were analyzed using the independent t-test and the Chi-square test using SPSS software version 24, and p-value < 0.05 was considered as the significance level.
   Results: The results revealed that after treatment, the mean scores of sleep quality decreased in the intervention and control group. Although this difference was statistically significant in both intervention and control groups (pvalue < 0.05), more reduction observed in the intervention group (p-value < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Consumption of the jujube seed capsule had a positive impact on improving the sleep quality of postmenopausal women and could be recommended as a useful herbal medication.

TI  - CONSEQUENCES OF HOLOCAUST ON PHYSICAL HEALTH OF SURVIVORS: BIBLIOGRAPHY REVIEW
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objective: Period of elderly age preordains the occurrence of many health issues. People deported during World War II to concentration camps suffered from malnutrition, lack of sleep, physical and mental exhaustion. Recently, the health condition of Holocaust survivors is often complicated as a result of physical punishments and different torture methods as well as mental hardships which they had suffered during deportation. The consequences often have psychosomatic nature thus the survivors are often receivers of health care. The topic of bibliography review is based on the need to objectivize and systematically evaluate subjective health issues of Holocaust survivors in connection with trauma related to the stay in a concentration camp. The aim is to offer a review of effects of the Holocaust on health of different body systems for survivors in concentration camps and Jewish ghettos in the course of World War II.
   Methods: To map the subjective problems of Holocaust survivors, evidence-based medicine (EBM) method has been used with the help of scientific database PubMed, CINAHL Plus with full text, ProQuest and other sources with specific key words and Boole operators. Prognostic type of clinical/review questions has been selected for the bibliography review, which is trying to predict the probability of relation or output of illness/condition and based on diseases or symptoms seriousness to find out expectancy for treatment/improvement of care.
   Results: 175 studies have been found in basic search with the use of key words both in English and in Czech language. The search has not been time-limited. The advanced search has focused on different body systems and health damage due to Nazi experiments. Fourteen studies have been used to complete the study. The research results have confirmed the significant effect of Holocaust trauma on body condition of the survivors. The reasons of this condition were insufficient nutrition, unsuitable and harmful hygienic, living and working conditions and brutality of the guards. According to the research, these factors have impacted all organ systems, mainly locomotion and cardiovascular ones. The results have shown a more frequent occurrence of osteoporosis, fractures of long bones and corresponding chronical pain of people of Jewish origin who had gone through different forms of torture during World War II. Other present symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, tumors mainly in the area of colorectum and lungs. Moreover, the stay in concentration camps had influence on women's menstrual cycle.
   Conclusion: The studies of Holocaust effects are an example of the influence of an extreme mental and physical burden on the body condition of the survivors' health. The results of the studies have shown a wide range of the effects also in mental and social areas.

TI  - Electroacupuncture versus Sham Acupuncture for Perimenopausal Insomnia: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial
T2  - NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the short- and long-term effects of acupuncture on perimenopausal insomnia (PMI) and quality of life.
   Patients and Methods: We designed a semi-standardized, patient-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. A total of 84 patients were recruited, all of whom met the criteria for diagnosis of PMI. Either acupuncture therapy or a noninvasive placebo acupuncture therapy designed to treat insomnia was implemented 18 times over the course of 8 weeks (3 times per week for 4 weeks, twice per week for 2 weeks, once per week for 2 weeks). The primary outcome was the change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores from baseline to the end of treatment, week 8. Secondary outcomes included climacteric symptoms and quality of life measured by the Menopause Quality of Life (Men-QoL), Insomnia Severity Index (IR), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), sleep parameters recorded in the actigraphy and adverse events. The PSQI and Men-QoL were assessed at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 20. Other assessments were performed at week 0 and week 8.
   Results: The participants were randomly assigned to either acupuncture (n=42) or sham acupuncture (n=42) groups. The mean difference from baseline of PSQI score at the end of treatment between real acupuncture and sham acupuncture group was -2.38 (95% CI, -3.46 to -1.30; P<0.001). The acupuncture group was associated with significantly lower scores than the sham acupuncture group at week 12 and during the 20-week follow-up visits (all P <0.001). Acupuncture was also associated with significantly higher quality of life in vasomotor and other physical dimensions (all P <0.001). At the end of treatment, researchers found a significantly higher total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and lower number of average awakenings (AA) (P =0.007 0.023 and 0.011, respectively) in the acupuncture group than in the sham acupuncture group. No severe adverse events were reported.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that acupuncture may be a safe and effective treatment for PMI and improving quality of sleep in patients with menopause and could have a long-lasting effect.

TI  - How Can Alternative Exercise Traditions Help Against the Background of the COVID-19 in Cancer Care? An Overview of Systematic Reviews
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the quality of systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SR/MAs) on alternative exercise traditions in cancer care.
   Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Ovid, EBSCOhost, WanFang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and VIP Database were searched from their inception to June 30, 2020. The search used a combination of subject words and free words. The search terms included "Tai Chi," "Qigong," "Baduanjin," "Yoga," "Pilates," "Cancer," "Meta-analysis," and "Systematic review." Two researchers independently performed literature screening and data extraction and used AMSTAR scale and PRISMA statement to evaluate the methodology and the quality of the evidence.
   Results: A total of 26 SR/MAs were included. The AMSTAR scale score was 5-10 points, with an average of 7.46 +/- 1.33 points. Overall, the methodological quality was considered to be moderate. The PRISMA list score was 13-24 points, with an average of 19.19 +/- 2.86 points. Among the papers evaluated, eight reports were relatively complete. A total of 15 papers indicated certain defects. A total of three papers showed relatively serious information defects.
   Conclusion: Relative to the control group, alternative exercise traditions may be effective in improving the quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and fatigue of cancer patients. However, they may not necessarily improve patients' sleep outcome, body mass index, and pain. During convalescence, cancer patients can be encouraged to start engaging in physical exercise, and professionals can develop appropriate exercise alternatives to ensure the expected effect of exercise while ensuring the safety of patients. The methodological quality of the systematic evaluations of the intervention effects of alternative exercise traditions on cancer patients is not satisfactory. Hence, focus should be directed to the improvement of the preliminary design scheme, publication status, literature retrieval, conflict of interest, and other aspects.

TI  - Study on the relationship between low back pain and emotional state, sleep and quality of life in postmenopausal women
T2  - JOURNAL OF BACK AND MUSCULOSKELETAL REHABILITATION
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of low back pain in the postmenopausal period and the relationship between low back pain and emotional state, sleep and quality of life.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 368 postmenopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The frequency and severity of low back pain were recorded for all participants, as well as depressive symptoms and anxiety, quality of life and sleep quality.
   RESULTS: 90.2% of the participants reported low back pain. As low back pain severity increased, it was found that depression, anxiety levels, NHP and PSQI total scores increased as well (p = 0.0001). Significant positive correlations were found between pain intensity and outcome measures, except for sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency (p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: A great majority of women experience postmenopausal low back pain, which causes significant problems that negatively affect their quality of life, emotional state and sleep quality.

TI  - Falls Risk, Circadian Rhythms and Melatonin: Current Perspectives
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - Aging is associated with weakening of the circadian system. The circadian amplitude of most physiological variables is reduced, while the circadian phase becomes more labile and tends to occur earlier with advancing age. As the incidence of falls in older persons could follow circadian variations, a better understanding of conditions in which falls occur can lead to the implementation of countermeasures (such as adjusting the scheduling of hospital staff, or changing the timing of anti-hypertensive medication if falls are related to undesirable circadian patterns of blood pressure and/or heart rate). This includes knowing the times of the day, days of the week, and times of the year when falls are more likely to occur at home or in the hospital. Additionally, the links between aging processes and factors associated with an increased risk of developing autonomic dysfunction are well established. A strong association between heart rate variability indexes and aging has been shown. Circadian rhythms of autonomous nervous system activity may play important role for maintenance of orthostatic tolerance. Whether one is concerned with disease prediction and prevention or maintenance of healthy aging, the study of circadian rhythms and the broader time structure underlying physiopathology is helpful in terms of screening, early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as the timely institution of prophylactic and/or palliative/ curative treatment. Timing the administration of such treatment as a function of circadian (and other) rhythms also could lead to reduction of falls in older persons. Finally, a prominent circadian rhythm characterizes melatonin, which peaks during the night. The circadian amplitude of melatonin decreases as a function of age, raising the questions whether such a decrease in the circadian amplitude of melatonin relates to a higher risk of falls and, if so, whether melatonin supplementation may be an effective countermeasure. This narrative review assesses the relationships between fall risk and the potential role circadian rhythms and melatonin play in mitigating this risk. We aim to provide healthcare workers adequate information about fall risk in older persons, including the potential role of the circadian rhythms and/or melatonin, as well as to lay foundations for future fall prevention interventional studies.

TI  - Menopausal Symptoms and Associated Social and Environmental Factors in Midlife Chinese Women
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - Objective: To investigate the dependency of menopausal symptoms on age and/or meno-pausal status and association with social and environmental factors.
   Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted on 4595 women (40-83 years) coming from 31 provinces during two years to our "Menopause Clinic", the first official center in China. Menopausal symptoms were assessed: negative mood, cognitive symptoms, sleep disorder, vasomotor symptoms (VMS), urogenital symptoms, autonomic nervous disorder, limb pain/paresthesia. Social and environmental factors were collected; simple and unconditional logistic regression with adjustments by all analyzed factors were used to assess associations.
   Results: Urogenital symptoms were the most common and VMS the least common complaints. All symptoms, except cognitive and urogenital symptoms, worsened age-dependently up to 60 years but improved beyond this age. Most symptoms also were associated with menopause, except negative mood and autonomic nervous disorders. Soya-rich diet decreased all symptoms, but only if consumed daily. Exercise was beneficial for some symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was most effective but only with regular use. Increased alcohol consumption aggravated VMS. Higher education was associated with less symptoms; no relationship was found for smoking, gravidity, parity, and menarche.
   Conclusion: All symptoms, except cognitive and urogenital symptoms, worsened age dependently up to 60 years but improved beyond this age; most were also associated with menopause. For the first time in a large study population, it was observed that soy-rich diet is protective but only with daily consumption. Exercising can protect against some of the symptoms. HRT decreased all symptoms, but regular use is necessary. Women with higher education reported less symptoms, but after adjustments no other relationships were observed (ChiCTR2000035047).

TI  - Exercise and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
T2  - PHYSICAL EXERCISE FOR HUMAN HEALTH
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy affecting both the metabolism and reproductive system of women of reproductive age. Prevalence ranges from 6.1-19.9% depending on the criteria used to give a diagnosis. PCOS accounts for approximately 80% of women with anovulatory infertility, and causes disruption at various stages of the reproductive axis. Evidence suggests lifestyle modification should be the first line of therapy for women with PCOS. Several studies have examined the impact of exercise interventions on reproductive function, with results indicating improvements in menstrual and/or ovulation frequency following exercise. Enhanced insulin sensitivity underpins the mechanisms of how exercise restores reproductive function. Women with PCOS typically have a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that are risk factors for CVD. There is irrefutable evidence that exercise mitigates CVD risk factors in women with PCOS. The mechanism by which exercise improves many CVD risk factors is again associated with improved insulin sensitivity and decreased hyperinsulinemia. In addition to cardiometabolic and reproductive complications, PCOS has been associated with an increased prevalence of mental health disorders. Exercise improves psychological well-being in women with PCOS, dependent on certain physiological factors. An optimal dose-response relationship to exercise in PCOS may not be feasible because of the highly individualised characteristics of the disorder. Guidelines for PCOS suggest at least 150 min of physical activity per week. Evidence confirms that this should form the basis of any clinician or healthcare professional prescription.

TI  - An Interventional strategy of physical activity promotion for reduction of menopause symptoms
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) programs are inexpensive, non-pharmaceutical and universally accessible options with demonstrated efficacy in reducing menopausal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a behavioral strategy for initiating and sustaining PA with the hope to reduce or eliminate menopausal symptoms.
   Methods: Menopausal and perimenopausal women (n=190) were randomly assigned to intervention (n=95) and non-intervention (n=95) groups using a random-numbers table. The intervention group consisted of 18 neighborhood network subgroups, each consisting of five to six women known to one another. They participated in a 12-week regular PA program, augmented by eight interactive group education and discussion sessions. The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) self-report instrument was used to determine perceived severity of menopausal symptoms.
   Results: The intervention group showed a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms (P < 0.001). Those whose symptoms rated severe/very severe for hot flushes were reduced from 30.1% to 11.8%. Also, participants whose sleep problems and joint discomfort rated severe/very severe declined from 28% to 6.5% and joint discomfort rated severe or very severe was reduced from 52.7% to 4.4%, respectively. Conversely in the nonintervention group, hot flushes, sleep problems and joint problems got significantly worse (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Implementing educational program that increases awareness of PA benefits in combination with existing neighborhood networks that facilitate communication and cooperation may increase PA levels and decrease menopausal symptoms. Such networks offer a low-cost means of improving quality of life (QOL) for perimenopausal and menopausal women.

TI  - Non-hormonal Treatments For Menopausal Symptoms and Sleep Disturbances: A Comparison Between Purified Pollen Extracts and Soy Isoflavones
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB  - Background: Besides hot-flushes, sleep disturbances increase around menopause, impacting on the quality of life. When hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated, it is necessary to provide alternative treatments.
   Objectives: This study aimed to observe the effects of an herbal remedy from pollen extracts and soy isoflavones for menopausal complaints, particularly on sleep disorders.
   Methods: A six-month prospective observational study was performed in women in natural menopause suffering from menopausal symptoms and sleep disturbances. Three groups were compared: 57 women receiving two tablets/day containing herbal remedy from pollen extracts (group A), 60 women receiving one tablet/day containing isoflavones 60 mg (group B), 47 women not receiving any treatment (group C). At 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6), the daily number of hot-flushes, Kupperman index for menopausal symptoms, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) test were assessed.
   Results: Both groups A and B showed a significant improvement of hot flushes (p<0.001) and Kuppermann Index (p<0.001) from T0 to T3 and from T0 to T6. No significant differences between treatment groups were found at T3, while at T6 group A showed greater decrease of daily hot flashes and better improvement of Kupperman index as compared to group B (respectively, -48.8% versus -18.4% and -24.4% versus -15.4%; p<0.001). improvement of global sleep quality was more evident in the pollen treated group compared to isoflavones group at both three (-24.7% versus -9.3%, p<0.001) and six (-52.9% vs -4.0%; p<0.001) months, mainly for the scores related to subjective sleep quality, sleep latency and habitual sleep efficiency.
   Conclusion: Non-hormonal treatments can effectively be used in symptomatic menopausal women: among these, after six months of treatment, pollen extracts might achieve a better improvement of hot flushes, sleep disturbances and menopause-related symptoms than soy isoflavones. Herbal remedy from pollen extracts is mainly effective when the quality of sleep is the most disturbing complaint.

TI  - Association of Urinary Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Diabetes in Korean Adults: Data from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey Cycle 2 (2012-2014)
T2  - DIABETES METABOLIC SYNDROME AND OBESITY-TARGETS AND THERAPY
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the associations between the urinary levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and diabetes mellitus in Korean adults.
   Materials and Methods: We examined the data of 6478 participants aged >= 19 years from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) cycle 2 (2012-2014). The urinary levels of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), 2-naphthol (2-NAP), 1-hydroxyphenathrene (1-OHPhe), and 2-hydroxyfluorene (2-OHFlu) were measured by gas chromatographymass spectrometry. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a self-report of physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus or the use of oral hypoglycemics or insulin. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, household income, alcohol consumption, physical activity, urinary creatinine and cotinine, menopausal status, and quartiles of all other PAHs.
   Results: The prevalence of diabetes was 6.5% in the study population. In men, the geometric means of the 2-NAP and 2-OHFlu levels were higher in participants with diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes mellitus [4.11 vs 3.26 mu g/L (P<0.05) and 0.45 vs 0.40 mu g/L (P<0.05), respectively]. In women, the geometric mean of 2-NAP levels was also higher in participants with diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes mellitus (1.81 vs 0.56 mu g/L, P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in geometric means for other PAHs. A higher odds ratio (OR) of diabetes was found in participants with the highest quartiles of urinary 2-NAP [OR 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.60] and 2-OHFlu (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.10-2.98) than in those with the lowest quartiles.
   Conclusion: The urinary 2-NAP and 2-OHFlu levels were associated with diabetes mellitus in Korean adults. Further studies are needed to determine a potential causal relationship between PAH exposure and diabetes mellitus and its underlying mechanism.

TI  - EEG-Based Neonatal Sleep-Wake Classification Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Objective: Classification of sleep-wake states using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) data that reliably work for neonates. Methods: A deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network is developed to classify sleep-wake states using multichannel bipolar EEG signals, which takes an input vector of size 108 containing the joint features of 9 channels. The network avoids any post-processing step in order to work as a full-fledged real-time application. For training and testing the model, EEG recordings of 3525 30-second segments from 19 neonates (postmenstrual age of 37 +/- 05 weeks) are used. Results: For sleep-wake classification, mean Cohen's kappa between the network estimate and the ground truth annotation by human experts is 0.62. The maximum mean accuracy can reach up to 83% which, to date, is the highest accuracy for sleep-wake classification.

TI  - The Associations of Gender, Menopause, Age, and Asthma with REM-Predominant Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Prospective Observational Study
T2  - NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP
AB  - Purpose: The study sought to assess demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, and polysomnographic features of a large cohort of clinic-based patients with rapid eye movement-predominant obstructive sleep apnea (REM-predominant-OSA) in both genders, while assessing the relationship between REM-predominant OSA in one hand and menopausal status and age on the other.
   Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted between January 2003 and December 2017. REM-predominant OSA diagnostic criteria included an AHI of >= 5/h, with REM-AHI/non-REM-AHI of > 2, a non-REM-AHI of < 15/h, and a minimum of 15 min of REM sleep. Patients who had an AHI> 5 events/h and did not meet the criteria for REM-predominant OSA were included in the non-stage-specific OSA group (NSS).
   Results: The study consisted of 1346 men and 823 women (total=2169). REM-predominant OSA was diagnosed in 17% (n=369). The prevalence of REM-predominant OSA in women was 25% compared with 12% in men. Several independent associations of REM-predominant OSA were identified in the whole group, including age (OR: 0.97 [0.95-0.98], p< 0.01), female sex (OR: 6.95 [4.86-9.93], p> 0.01), REM sleep duration (min) (OR: 1.02 [1.02-1.03], < 0.01), and time with SpO2 < 90% (mins) (OR: 0.97 [0.95-0.99], < 0.01), hypertension (OR:0.67 [0.45-0.99], 0.04) and asthma (OR: 2.19 [1.56-3.07], < 0.01). The prevalence of REM-predominant OSA in premenopausal and postmenopausal women was 35% and 18.6% (p< 0.01), respectively. Among women, age was an independent correlate (OR: 0.97 [0.94-0.99], p=0.03; however, menopausal status was not.
   Conclusion: REM-predominant OSA is prevalent among clinic-based patients with OSA. A younger age and female sex were independent correlates of REM-predominant OSA. Among women, a younger age but not menopausal status was a correlate of REM-predominant OSA. Asthma was independently associated with REM-predominant OSA.

TI  - Effects of exercise program on sleep quality in postmenopausal women
T2  - CUKUROVA MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of regular walking program on sleep quality in postmenopausal women.
   Materials and Methods: The study has semi-experimental design with pretest-posttest control group. The sample consisted of 66 women (33 training, 33 controls) who were at least literate, who went through menopause by natural means, did not exceed 65 years of age, did not receive hormone replacement therapy, did not have any chronic disease. The data were collected with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Introductory Information Form. The women in the training group were asked to take regular and paced walking for at least 30 minutes three days a week for six weeks, and they were followed up by telephone. No attempt was made to women in the control group.
   Results: There was no statistically significant difference between pretest sleep quality and PSQI mean scores of women in the training and control groups. In the last test after six weeks of regular and paced walking application, it was found that the good sleep quality of the training group increased from 6.1% to 39.4%. On the other hand, control group it was found that the rate of good sleep quality, which was 15.2% in the pretest, decreased to 12.1% after 6 weeks. The difference between training and control groups pretest-posttest sleep quality was found to be statistically significant.
   Conclusion: It has been shown that regular and paced walking for 6 weeks increases the sleep quality of postmenopausal women.

TI  - Prevalence of Hypothyroidism in a Large Sample of Patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome
T2  - NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP
AB  - Purpose: Data on hypothyroidism in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) are scarce. This study assessed the prevalence of hypothyroidism among a large group of patients with OHS.
   Patients and Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 308 consecutive patients with OHS seen between January 2002 and December 2018. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free-thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured in all patients. The OHS patients were compared with 445 patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).
   Results: The OHS patients had a mean age of 55.1 +/- 13.8 years and a BMI of 43.9 +/- 14.8 kg/m(2); apnoea hypopnea index was >= 30 events/hr in 222 (72%). Clinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 58 (18.8%) of the OHS patients; only two cases (0.6%) were diagnosed in the sleep disorders clinic (newly diagnosed cases). Subclinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 19 (6.2%) of the OHS patients based on elevated TSH and normal FT4 levels; all cases were newly diagnosed. A logistic regression model identified female sex as the only predictor of clinical hypothyroidism in OHS patients (odds ratio: 2.801 [1.386-5.662], p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in clinical hypothyroidism prevalence between the OHS and OSA patients; however, subclinical hypothyroidism was more common in OHS than in OSA patients (6.2% vs 2.9%, respectively, p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Clinical hypothyroidism was prevalent among patients with OHS; however, newly diagnosed cases of clinical hypothyroidism were relatively low. Female sex was the only predictor of clinical hypothyroidism.

TI  - The Effects of Evening-Primrose Oil on Menopausal Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - CURRENT WOMENS HEALTH REVIEWS
AB  - Background: Evening primrose oil (EPO) has been a treatment option for reducing menopausal symptoms, but evidence for its use is inadequate.
   Objective: The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of EPO in treating menopausal symptoms among peri and postmenopausal women.
   Study Design: This is a systematic review with meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials (RCTs).
   Methods: We searched CENTRAL, Medline, Embase and trial registries for relevant RCTs. The methodology and reporting were carried out grounded on references from the Cochrane collaboration and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement. Review Manager version 5.3.5 was used to perform all the statistical analyses.
   Results: Five RCTs, recruiting a total of 402 peri and postmenopausal women were identified. EPO did not reduce the frequency of daily vasomotor symptoms (MD 0.01 episodes, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.57, P=0.960), frequency of daytime hot flash episodes (MD -0.51 episodes, 95% CI -2.05 to 1.03, P=0.510), frequency of night sweat episodes (MD 0.33 episodes, 95% CI -0.48 to 1.13, P=0.430) and severity of vasomotor symptoms (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -1.56 to 0.66, P=0.420) in comparison to control. EPO was associated with a minimal reduction in the severity of overall menopausal symptoms in comparison to control (SMD -1.18; 95% CI-2.18 to -0.18, P=0.02). There were insufficient data to pool results for musculoskeletal symptoms, mood, sexuality, sleeping disorders and quality of life.
   Conclusion: EPO may reduce the severity of overall menopausal symptoms but is not effective to reduce the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms. The evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. Further research is needed to enhance related evidence.

TI  - Changes in sleeping energy metabolism and thermoregulation during menstrual cycle
T2  - PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB  - Women with ovulatory menstrual cycles show an increase in body temperature in the luteal phase, compared with follicular phase, particularly during the night. Several, albeit not all, studies reported higher energy expenditure in the luteal phase compared with follicular phase. Q(10) of biological reactions lies between 2.0 and 3.0, predicting a 7-12% increase in energy expenditure when body temperature rises by 1 degrees C. In this study, temperature dependence of energy expenditure was assessed by comparing changes in sleeping energy expenditure and thermoregulation with menstrual cycle in 9 young females. Energy expenditure was measured using a metabolic chamber, in which sleep was recorded polysomnographically, and core body temperature and skin temperature were continuously monitored. Distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient was assessed as an index of heat dissipation. In the luteal phase, a significant increase in average core body temperature (+0.27 degrees C) and energy expenditure (+6.9%) were observed. Heat dissipation was suppressed during the first 2 hr of sleep in the luteal phase, compared with follicular phase. Rise in basal body temperature in the luteal phase was accompanied by increased energy expenditure and suppressed heat dissipation. The 6.9% increase in metabolic rate would require a Q(10) of 12.4 to be attributable solely to temperature (+0.27 degrees C), suggesting that energy expenditure in the luteal phase is enhanced through the mechanism, dependent and independent of luteal-phase rise in body temperature presumably reflects other effects of the sex hormones.

TI  - Sleep and Methylation of Estrogen Receptor Genes, ESR1 and GPER, in Healthy Middle-Aged and Older Women: Findings from the Women 40+Healthy Aging Study
T2  - NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP
AB  - Purpose: Sleep problems in middle-aged and older women are very common and have been associated with menopause-related changes in estrogen levels. However, not all women experience sleep problems as they enter perimenopause, and epigenetic mechanisms might contribute to the differences in sleep quality within this population. In this study, we hypothesized that increased methylation of two estrogen receptor (ER) genes (ESR1 and GPER) would be associated with increased sleep problems in healthy pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women, either directly or indirectly through the experience of vasomotor symptoms (VMS).
   Materials and Methods: In 130 healthy women aged 40-73 years, we assessed DNA methylation from dried blood spots (DBS). Women rated their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and VMS using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS).
   Results: Higher percentage methylation of ESR1 was associated with increased sleep problems, mediated by VMS, even after controlling for age, menopausal status, body mass index, estradiol levels, depressive symptoms, and caffeine consumption. There was no significant association between GPER methylation and either sleep problems or VMS.
   Conclusion: The study findings support an association between increased ESR1 methylation and sleep problems through increased VMS among healthy women aged 40-73 years.

TI  - Pregnancy disorders in female workers at the industrial area of Sidoarjo, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The number of female workers in Indonesia has increased and female workers have been discovered to be very vulnerable to several hazards and health problems in the workplace environment linked to their menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze risk factors associated with pregnancy disorders in female workers.
   Design and Methods: The research was conducted through the use of a cross-sectional design with 307 female workers using simple random sampling. Furthermore, a descriptive analysis was conducted to describe the conditions of the respondents during pregnancy to childbirth process.
   Results: The results showed 45% of respondents had pregnancy disorders, 16% had miscarriages, and despite the fact most of the prenatal care processes was assisted by doctors or midwives, 2.6% of the respondents consulted Traditional Birth Attendants, who were also recorded and was found to account for 2.9% of the deliveries. Moreover, the risk factors associated with pregnancy disorders include vibrations (P=0.004), irritants (P=0.002) and repetitive works (P=0.009).
   Conclusions: It is recommended that companies should provide maternal and child health protection and control for any risk associated with female workers.

TI  - Sleep quality in women who use different contraceptive methods
T2  - SLEEP SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Both menstrual cycle and hormone alterations influence sleep pattern. The aim of this study was to evaluate sleep quality in women who use different contraceptive methods. Material and Methods: This study was a descriptive, cross-sectional survey. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate sleep quality, and a questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic, clinical, lifestyle, and contraceptive use data. Results: The study population comprised 235 women in reproductive age. Regarding lifestyle, 25.5% of the women were physically active, 12.3% were tobacco-smoking, and 70.6% drank coffee daily. Sleep quality was good in 34% of the studied population and poor in 66% of the population. The population was divided into two groups: hormonal (57.1%) and non-hormonal (42.9%) contraceptive users. Sleep quality in the users of non-hormonal contraceptive methods was similar to that in the users of hormonal methods (6.1 +/- 3.2 versus 5.9 +/- 2.9; p=0.5). Sleep efficiency was statistically higher among the users of non-hormonal contraceptive methods (94.7 +/- 17.7) than among the users of hormonal methods (90.0 +/- 15.3; p=0.03). The patients who had irregular or altered menstrual cycles reported poorer sleep quality. The absence of routine physical activity negatively influenced sleep quality (p=0.05). The women who snored reported worse sleep quality (p=0.002). Conclusions: Nearly half of the studied population was users of hormonal contraception, and most of these women reported poor sleep quality. Sleep efficiency was higher among the users of non-hormonal contraceptives. No differences in subgroups (hormonal contraceptive users) were observed.

TI  - Sex differences in factors associated with poor subjective sleep quality in athletes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is an important recovery period for athletes. In general, women are not satisfied with their sleep quality, which is also true for female soccer players, although the reasons remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to confirm sex difference in sleep quality among athletes from various fields of sport, and to investigate factors related to poor subjective sleep quality in male and female athletes.
   METHODS: We collected data concerning subjective sleep quality, measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), from athletes who were 16 to 40 years of age and played various types of sports. Data concerning their sports, lifestyle, and sleep issues and sleep environments, and also menstrual issues for females, were collected.
   RESULTS: Data from 207 male athletes and 215 female athletes were assessed. Among them, 31.4% of men and 48.8% of women had poor subjective sleep quality (i.e., PSQI >= 6). In male athletes, witnessed apnea, episodes of disorientation or confusion during the time of sleep, long time gap between dinner and bedtime, and turning on the heating in the winter, were identified as factors associated with poor sleep quality by multivariate analysis, whereas in female athletes, bathing close to bedtime, habitual drinking, and being annoyed by noises at bedtime were identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: In both populations, females had poorer subjective sleep quality than males. Sex differences exist in factors associated with poor subjective sleep quality. Thus, different approaches should be considered to improve their sleep quality.

TI  - Provocative factors and treatment response in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy - experience from a tertiary epilepsy center
T2  - CESKA A SLOVENSKA NEUROLOGIE A NEUROCHIRURGIE
AB  - Aim: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is an epilepsy syndrome characterized by myoclonic seizures and good response to treatment. Factors such as sleep deprivation, hunger, stress, bright flashing lights and menstruation may provoke seizures. The objective of this study was to investigate these provocative factors, whether they display changes over time and have a relation to treatment response. Methods: 200 patients with a JME diagnosis who are being followed in our outpatient clinic were included in the study. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. The provocative factor presence and temporal evolution of these factors were investigated in face-to-face interviews with patients. The patients were categorized into two groups based on treatment response and compared according to the presence and temporal evolution of the provocative factors. Results: 200 JME patients were enrolled and the mean age was 26.77 +/- 8.06 (12-49) years. At least one provocative factor was identified in 199 patients (99.5%). The most common provocative factors were sleep deprivation, in 166 (83%), stress in 151 (75.5%) and fatigue in 125 (62.5%) of patients. The response to treatment was less satisfactory in patients with persistent sensitivity to sleep deprivation, stress, fatigue, hunger, photo stimulation and sadness (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Provocative factors may evolve over time, but the persistent presence of seizure-provocative factors in patients with JME may indicate that the treatment response will be less satisfactory. These results show that paying attention to provocative factors is not only helpful for providing means to prevent seizures, but also for predicting the treatment response.

TI  - RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DEPRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE AND OTHER POSSIBLE FACTORS AMONG POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN IN WESTERN TURKEY
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine relationships between depression, quality of life and other possible factors among postmenopausal women in western Turkey. This cross-sectional study was realized from 01 January to 28 February 2018. The study group was formed with 802 postmenopausal women. Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to assess the level of depression. The severity of menopause-related symptoms was assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Short Form (SF-36) was used to evaluate the quality of life. Logistic Regression Analysis (Backward Wald) was used to determine the risk factors for depression. Statistical significance was accepted as p <= 0.05. The prevalence of depression was 22.7%. According to the logistic model, being divorce (OR: 1.847), low family income (OR: 1.929), chronic disease history (OR: 1.653), obesity (OR: 1.484), history of domestic violence (OR: 2.168) and sleep problems (OR: 2.76) were found to be important risk factors for depression in postmenopausal women (for each one, p <= 0.05). For all sub-domains of SF-36, the scores were lower in women with depression compared to others (p <= 0.05 for each one). There was a weak positive relationship between total scores obtained from MRS and BDI scores (r = 0.406; p = 0.001). It may be useful to conduct awareness-raising studies on depression for postmenopausal women and to screen for suspicious cases and to refer them to advanced health centres.

TI  - Monthly variation of hot flashes, night sweats, and trouble sleeping: effect of season and proximity to the final menstrual period (FMP) in the SWAN Menstrual Calendar substudy
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Although reproductive function is influenced by season, few studies have evaluated seasonal effects on menopausal symptoms. We assessed the impact of season and proximity to the final menstrual period (FMP) on frequency of symptom reporting.
   Methods: In all, 955 participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation recorded whether or not they had experienced menopausal symptoms on a monthly menstrual calendar over a 10-year period. We modeled the log-odds of presence of a given symptom each month using a logistic mixed-effects model, assuming a third-order polynomial before the FMP and a different third-order polynomial after the FMP. We assumed sine and cosine functions for month of the year.
   Results: Five to 10 years before the FMP, similar to 20% of women reported hot flashes and night sweats, whereas similar to 40% reported trouble sleeping. Prevalence rose similar to 4 years before the FMP with a sharp jump in hot flash (similar to 60%) and night sweats (similar to 40%) prevalence coincident with the FMP. Peaks in hot flashes and trouble sleeping were observed in July with troughs in January. The peak and trough in night sweats occurred about 1 month earlier. Odds of hot flashes, night sweats, and trouble sleeping were 66%, 50%, and 24% greater, respectively, at the seasonal peak versus the seasonal minimum.
   Conclusion: Menopausal symptoms exhibit seasonal variation associated with the summer and winter equinoxes. Seasonal increases in night sweats precede increases in hot flashes. Prospectively recorded monthly symptom data demonstrate that hot flashes and night sweats increase notably coincident with the FMP.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Procollagen Type I- N terminal Propeptide (P1NP) in women with Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL & HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Osteoporotic fractures are pre-eminent matter of concern and high economic burden in Pakistan. The prevalence of osteoporosis is anticipated to rise to 11.3 million by 2020, which is alarming. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is a diagnostic tool for osteoporosis but it reveals static changes in bone metabolism which appears late. There is a need to identify dynamic markers in bone metabolism which can unmask early changes. Procollagen Type I- N terminal Propeptide (P1NP) is a recommended bone formation biomarker by International osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) which is less affected by food intake and circadian rhythm variability, but its diagnostic accuracy needs to be assessed.
   Aim: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of P1NP in osteoporosis and osteopenia.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study with 267 postmenopausal women was conducted at Ziauddin University, Karachi, Pakistan. Demographic variables were taken by self-designed, structured questionnaire. P1NP levels were detected by using electrochemilluminescent technique while DEXA Scan was used to estimate bone mineral density (BMD). Cases were distributed into three groups on the basis of t-score from DEXA scan on hip and spine separately. Mean, median, SD and quartiles were used to describe P1NP levels in three groups and Box-plot was used to show the distribution of P1NP for three groups. Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve (ROC) was used to identify the cutoff of P1NP level for diagnosis of Osteoporosis and Osteopenia in comparison to normal by taking t-score spine as gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy were measured and were presented in percentages with 95% confidence interval. Pvalue = 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: P1NP values for the diagnosis of osteoporosis were ascertained as 83.3% Sensitivity,70.8% specificity with diagnostic accuracy of 75.5%.When used for diagnosis of osteopenia the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy recorded were 56.0%, 70.8% and 65.11% respectively.
   Conclusion: P1NP can be used as reliable marker to predict spinal osteoporosis.

TI  - Epidemiology of low-energy wrist, hip, and spine fractures in Chinese populations 50 years or older: A national population-based survey
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of low-energy fracture of wrist, hip, and spine and the related risk factors in Chinese populations 50 years or older.This study was a part of the Chinese National Fracture Survey (CNFS) carried out in 8 Chinese provinces in 2015. Data on 154,099 Chinese men and women 50 years or older were extracted from the CNFS database for calculations and analyses. Low-energy fracture was defined as fracture caused by slip, trip, or falls from standing height.A total of 247 patients sustained low-energy fractures in 2014, indicating the incidence rate was 160.3/100,000 person-years, with 120.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 95.5-144.5] and 213.1(95% CI, 180.7-245.6)/100,000 person-years in men and women, respectively. In men, advanced age, alcohol consumption, residence at second floor or above without elevator, sleep duration <7h/day, and history of past fracture were identified to be significant risk factors for low-energy fractures. In women, advanced age, living in east region, higher latitude zone (40 degrees N -49.9 degrees N), alcohol consumption, more births, sleep duration <7h/day, and history of past fracture were identified as significant risk factors. Supplementation of calcium or vitamin D or both was identified to be associated with reduced risk of fracture in women (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.75), but not in men.These epidemiologic data on low-energy fractures provided updated clinical evidence base for national healthcare planning and preventive efforts in China. Corresponding interventions such as decreasing alcohol consumption and sleep improvement should clearly be implemented. For women, especially those with more births and past history of fracture, routine screening of osteoporosis, and intensive nourishment since menopause should be advocated.

TI  - Immunophysiological Indicators in Elderly Teachers in the School-Year Dynamics
T2  - ADVANCES IN GERONTOLOGY
AB  - The preservation of the health of participants in the educational process and the performance of comprehensive diagnostic measures with laboratory and instrumental methods occupy a significant place in a number of biomedical studies. The goal of the present work was to study the state of cellular factors of innate and adaptive immunity, IL-1 beta, 1 alpha, IFN-gamma cytokines, hormones, and autonomic regulation of the heart rhythm in elderly teachers in the school-year dynamics. The indices of spectral analysis of the heart rhythm (n = 50) at the beginning of the school year (background level) and after 5 and 9 months were studied. The state of cellular factors of innate and adaptive immunity was assessed via analysis of the functional activity of peripheral blood neutrophils by their ability to absorb latex particles, the oxygen-dependent metabolism, and the functional reserve. The lymphocyte-receptor landscape was assessed with flow cytofluorimetry, direct immunofluorescence, and solid-phase, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The criteria of the Shapiro-Wilk test, the chi(2) test, the one-sided Fisher exact test, and Student's t-test were calculated. A decrease in heart rate variability indicators characterizing the activity of the parasympathetic regulation, as well as immune homeostasis among elderly teachers in the school-year dynamics, was found, which confirms the need to implement a set of preventive measures for health maintenance.

TI  - MITOCHONDRIAL AND REDOX DYSFUNCTION IN POST-MENOPAUSE AS RISK FACTOR OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE: A PILOT STUDY TESTING THE ROLE OF A VALIDATED JAPANESE FUNCTIONAL FOOD
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL REGULATORS AND HOMEOSTATIC AGENTS
AB  - During the menopause women may experience increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity and, together with the decline of neurosteroids, this represents a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to test a functional food (FPP-ORI, Osato Research Institute, Gifu, Japan) on redox and mitochondrial efficiency in post-menopausal women. The study population consisting of 69 untreated post-menopausal women were given supplements as follows: Group A was given a multivitamin (MV) 1c 2 times a day, and group B was given FPP 4.5 g 2 times a day. Group C consisted of 23 fertile premenopausal women as the control group. The tests carried out on entry, and at 3 and 6 months were erythrocyte redox parameters, plasma oxidated proteins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) mitochondria cytochrome c oxidase Vmax activity. Menopausal women showed an increased malondialdehyde (MDA) (p<0.05 vs control) which was normalized by both treatments (p<0.05), but MV failed to do so in the BMI >= 26 subgroup (p<0.05). All other redox enzymes and BDNF were significantly lower in menopausal women and they responded only to FPP (p<0.05). Carbonyl protein level was higher in "BMI >= 26" subgroup (p<0.05) and reduced only by FPP (p<0.05). The PBMC cyclooxygenase to citrate synthase activity was reduced (< 40%) in the menopausal group (p<0.01) and only FPP caused a significant restoration (p<0.05). Although preliminary, these data confirm the redox and mitochondrial dysfunction occurring in post-menopause and responsive to FPP but very poorly to high dosage antioxidants. This may lead to potential preventive opportunities in menopause-associated neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Instrumentation for Measuring the Wet Frictional Property of Sanitary Pads
T2  - FIBERS AND POLYMERS
AB  - Women wear sanitary pad for whole day during their menstruation period. They have direct skin contact with it even for sleeping and exercising. The presence of sweat and menstrual blood increases the moisture level and the adhesion of liquid to textile causing sensorial discomfort. This study describes the design and uses of modified Textile Stickiness Measurement System (TSMS) which can characterize the frictional properties of sanitary pads under both dry and wet conditions. The uniqueness of this measurement system is that the wetness level of the pad is adjustable and the surface profile of the contacting object (i.e. Lorica (R) Soft) does simulate the condition of human skin. Also, it does not have restriction on the type of sanitary pad that can be tested. Among the 12 sanitary pads tested (disposable and reusable types), the frictional force for the disposable sanitary pads is lower than the reusable pads whilst the performance of disposable sanitary pads with nonwoven surface is lower than the one with perforated surface. These can attribute to their liquid transport property and surface feature. For those with better liquid transport property, less water will stay on skin surface and so the adhesion between skin and textiles is lower. For those with protruding fibers on its surface, it reduced the contact area and so the frictional force is lower.

TI  - Depressive Symptoms, Sleep Profiles and Serum Melatonin Levels in a Sample of Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP
AB  - Background: Chronobiological changes have been detected in various physiological functions of patients with breast cancer, suggesting dysregulation in the pineal gland and melatonin secretion. This study aimed to assess and measure serum melatonin levels pre-and postoperatively in patients who had been diagnosed for the first time with breast cancer.
   Methods: A sample of first-time breast cancer patients, consisting of 45 women aged 25-65 years, was evaluated and psychometric assessment was completed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Insomnia Severity Index (White, Weinberg et al) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Cardoso, Spence et al). The Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) was used to assess the chronotype. Serum melatonin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay.
   Results: Morning and moderately morning chronotypes were prevalent among the sample (25%, 45.8%, respectively). The finding of a mean BDI score of 13.5 +/- 11.2 indicated that depressive symptoms were prevalent among the sample. Despite the finding that a mean of the participants apparently had no symptoms of daytime sleepiness (the mean and standard deviations of the ESS were 7.5 +/- 4.4), scores on the ISI (a mean of 16.7 +/- SD 7.3) indicated that insomnia symptoms were prevalent in the sample. Melatonin levels showed an inverse relationship with insomnia severity as measured by the ISI and depression severity, as assessed by the BDI. The postoperative melatonin levels were higher than the preoperative levels. Additionally, the psychometric profile differed among various pathological types of breast cancer according to their hormone receptor profile.
   Conclusion: Serum melatonin levels correlated significantly with self-reported sleep quality and psychometric profiles of depression in the present sample of breast cancer patients. The melatonin assay, which is relatively easy to carry out, provided a convenient, objective measure of an important biological correlate of sleep quality and depression. This assay thus represented a confirmatory alternative to the self-report instruments, which may sometimes be unreliable. Future studies should further evaluate the utility of melatonin measures in psychiatric and sleep complaints of breast cancer patients.

TI  - Dietary supplement of tomato can accelerate urinary aMT6s level and improve sleep quality in obese postmenopausal women
T2  - CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ingestion of tomato before bed on obese postmenopausal women's urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) level and sleep quality. We quantified melatonin concentrations in beefsteak tomato, black tomato, and two commercial tomato juices and found that beefsteak tomato contained the highest level of melatonin. In this 8-week open-label, randomized controlled dietary intervention trial, 36 subjects completed the entire trial. The tomato group ate 250 g of beefsteak tomatoes 2 h before sleep for 8 weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected at the baseline and in the 8th week and were analyzed. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in the tomato group significantly decreased with time (p for trend = 0.0297). After 8 weeks of the beefsteak intervention, all components of the PSQI in tomato group had significantly improved, and their aMT6s level was 10-fold significantly higher than that of the control group. Therefore, supplementation with beefsteak tomato before sleep can increase circulating melatonin and improve sleep quality in obese postmenopausal women.

TI  - Melatonin Promotes Uterine and Placental Health: Potential Molecular Mechanisms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - The development of the endometrium is a cyclic event tightly regulated by hormones and growth factors to coordinate the menstrual cycle while promoting a suitable microenvironment for embryo implantation during the "receptivity window". Many women experience uterine failures that hamper the success of conception, such as endometrium thickness, endometriosis, luteal phase defects, endometrial polyps, adenomyosis, viral infection, and even endometrial cancer; most of these disturbances involve changes in endocrine components or cell damage. The emerging evidence has proven that circadian rhythm deregulation followed by low circulating melatonin is associated with low implantation rates and difficulties to maintain pregnancy. Given that melatonin is a circadian-regulating hormone also involved in the maintenance of uterine homeostasis through regulation of numerous pathways associated with uterine receptivity and gestation, the success of female reproduction may be dependent on the levels and activity of uterine and placental melatonin. Based on the fact that irregular production of maternal and placental melatonin is related to recurrent spontaneous abortion and maternal/fetal disturbances, melatonin replacement may offer an excellent opportunity to restore normal physiological function of the affected tissues. By alleviating oxidative damage in the placenta, melatonin favors nutrient transfer and improves vascular dynamics at the uterine-placental interface. This review focuses on the main in vivo and in vitro functions of melatonin on uterine physiological processes, such as decidualization and implantation, and also on the feto-maternal tissues, and reviews how exogenous melatonin functions from a mechanistic standpoint to preserve the organ health. New insights on the potential signaling pathways whereby melatonin resists preeclampsia and endometriosis are further emphasized in this review.

TI  - Absenteeism during Menstruation among Nursing Students in Spain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Absenteeism can clearly have a negative impact on academic performance among university students. Certain experiences or symptoms such as menstrual pain are very common in women and can lead to absenteeism. The current study was aimed at examining the presence of menstrual experiences or symptoms and their impact upon absenteeism among healthy (illness-free) female university nursing students in Spain. A total of 299 students participated in this research, which was a descriptive cross-sectional, observational study. An ad hoc online questionnaire was used based on sociodemographic and gynecological data, together with the noted menstrual experiences; the most prevalent of which were bloating, which affected 87.3% of students; dysmenorrhea and irritability, which affected 76.3%; and fatigue, which affected 70.6%. Students with dysmenorrhea had a 6.95 higher (odds ratio (OR) 6.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.39-14.25) odds of absenteeism; in those who reported dizziness, the odds of absenteeism was 4.82 times higher (OR 4.82; 1.76-13.23); in those who manifested nausea and vomiting, the percentage of absenteeism was 3.51 higher (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.51-8.15); in those who presented sleep alterations, the odds were 2.95 higher (OR 2.95; 95% CI 1.39-6.25); and for those who felt depressed the odds were 2.18 times higher (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.21-3.94) Absenteeism was found to be more likely in women with dysmenorrhea. However, in addition, higher odds of absenteeism were also found in women with nausea and vomiting, dizziness, sleep disorders, and those who feel depressed. These menstrual experiences can be considered a relevant problem among young women, leading to absenteeism, and a negative influence on academic performance. It is essential to raise awareness of the socioeconomic impact of absenteeism and establish new strategies for improving menstrual experiences.

TI  - Why Are Women Prone to Restless Legs Syndrome?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Restless legs syndrome is a relatively common neurologic disorder considerably more prevalent in women than in men. It is characterized by an inactivity-induced, mostly nocturnal, uncomfortable sensation in the legs and an urge to move them to make the disagreeable sensation disappear. Some known genes contribute to this disorder and the same genes contribute to an overlapping condition-periodic leg movements that occur during sleep and result in insomnia. Dopamine and glutamate transmission in the central nervous system are involved in the pathophysiology, and an iron deficiency has been shown in region-specific areas of the brain. A review of the literature shows that pregnant women are at particular risk and that increased parity is a predisposing factor. Paradoxically, menopause increases the prevalence and severity of symptoms. This implies a complex role for reproductive hormones. It suggests that changes rather than absolute levels of estrogen may be responsible for the initiation of symptoms. Both iron (at relatively low levels in women) and estrogen (at relatively high oscillating levels in women) influence dopamine and glutamate transmission, which may help to explain women's vulnerability to this condition. The syndrome is comorbid with several disorders (such as migraine, depression, and anxiety) to which women are particularly prone. This implies that the comorbid condition or its treatment, or both, contribute to the much higher prevalence in women than in men of restless legs syndrome.

TI  - Sound reduction management in the neonatal intensive care unit for preterm or very low birth weight infants
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity. The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.
   Objectives
   Primary objective
   To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates.
   Secondary objectives
   1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity).
   2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age.
   3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance.
   4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov ; controlled-trials.com ; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2View (TM)), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014.
   Selection criteria
   Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit.
   Data collection and analysis
   We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.
   Main results
   One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (M D) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n =12).
   Authors' conclusions
   To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy after surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Women who have undergone surgical treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) may develop menopausal symptoms due to immediate toss of ovarian function following surgery and chemotherapy. Women may experience vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, sexual dysfunction, vaginal symptoms and accelerated osteoporosis. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment to relieve these symptoms, its safety has been questioned for women with EOC.
   Objectives
   To assess the safety and efficacy of HRT for menopausal symptoms in women surgically treated for EOC.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 12 June 2019) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2019, week 23). We also handsearched conference reports and trial registries. There was no language restriction.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants of any age and menopausal status who had undergone surgery for EOC and, after diagnosis and treatment, used any regimen and duration of HRT compared with placebo or no hormone therapy. We also included trials comparing different regimens or duration of administration of HRT.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently identified studies that met the inclusion criteria. They used Covidence to extract study characteristics, outcome data and to assess methodological quality of the included studies.
   Main results
   Our search strategy identified 2617 titles, of which 2614 titles were excluded. Three studies, involving 350 women, met our inclusion criteria. Two of the studies included pre and postmenopausal women, and the third only included premenopausal women. The overall age range of those women included in the studies was 20 to 89.6 years old, with a median follow-up ranging from 31.4 months to 19.1 years. The geographical distribution of participants included Europe, South Africa and China. All stages and histological subtypes were included in two of the studies, but stage IV disease had been excluded in the third. The three included studies used a variety of HRT regimens (conjugated oestrogen with or without medroxyprogesterone and with or without nylestriot) and HRT administrations (oral, patch and implant), In all studies, the comparisons were made versus women who had not received HRT.
   The studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and reporting bias, and at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias. The certainty of the evidence was low for overall survival and progression-free survival, and very low for quality-of-life assessment, incidence of breast cancer, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and myocardial infarction (MI).
   Meta-analysis of these studies showed that HRT may improve overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.93; 350 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). Quality-of-life assessment by use of the EORTC-C30 questionnaire was performed only in one study. We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces quality of life as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low (mean difference (MD) 13.67 points higher, 95% CI 9.26 higher to 18.08 higher; 1 study; 75 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Likewise, HRT may make little or no difference to progression-free survival (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.01; 275 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence).
   We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces the incidence of breast cancer (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 225 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence); TIA (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 102.42; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); CVA (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.88; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); and MI (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.10; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of gallstones was not reported in the included studies.
   Authors' conclusions
   Hormone replacement therapy may slightly improve overall survival in women who have undergone surgical treatment for EOC, but the certainty of the evidence is low. HRT may make little or no difference to quality of life, incidence of breast cancer, TIA, CVA and MI as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. There may be little or no effect of HRT use on progression-free survival. The evidence in this review is limited by imprecision and incompleteness of reported relevant outcomes and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed RCTs are required as this is an important area to women experiencing menopausal symptoms following surgical treatment for ovarian cancer, especially as doctors are often reluctant to prescribe HRT in this scenario. The evidence in this review is too limited to support or refute that HRT is very harmful in this population.

TI  - The Impact of Estrogen Supplementation to Autonomic and Sleep Modulations in Free-Moving Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats
T2  - INTERNATIONAL HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Sleep and estrogen levels have an impact on neural regulation and are associated with cardiovascular (CV) events. We investigated the effects of estrogen on heart rate variability (HRV) and circadian cycle in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Polysomnographic recording was performed in seven male and seven female SHRs during sleep. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) were evaluated to define active waking (AW), quiet sleep (QS), and paradoxical sleep (PS) stages. Cardiac activities were measured by RR interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and power spectrum of HRV.
   In ECG, estrogen prolonged the RR interval in total sleep when compared with that at baseline in male SHRs (203.74 +/- 6.61 versus 181.30 +/- 8.06 ms. P < 0.001) and in female SHRs (169.21 +/- 6.43 versus 160.76 +/- 10.66 ms, P < 0.05). In HRV, the estrogen increased the high frequency (HF) in total sleep when compared with that at baseline in male SHRs (1.03 +/- 0.28 versus 0.60 t 0.43 In (ms(2)), P < 0.001) and in female SHRs (0.71 +/- 0.26 versus 0.42 +/- 0.19 In (ms(2)), P < 0.05).
   In male SHRs, estrogen increased the frequency of QS (26.50 +/- 4.85 versus 20.79 +/- 5.07, P < 0.01) and PS (25.64 +/- 5.18 versus 20.14 +/- 4.75. P < 0.05) stages when compared with baseline. In female SIIRs, estrogen increased the percentage of delta waves in total sleep (79.87% +/- 3.10% versus 76.71% +/- 2.74%, P < 0.05) when compared with that at baseline.
   In HRV, estrogen leads to neuromodulation by increased parasympathetic tone in all SHRs, suggesting a lower risk to CV events. In sleep analyses, estrogen in male SHRs caused poor sleep quality. In contrast, estrogen in female SHRs demonstrated improved quality of sleep and decreased risk of hypertension.

TI  - Central aspects of systemic oestradiol negative- and positive-feedback on the reproductive neuroendocrine system
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - The central nervous system regulates fertility via the release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This control revolves around the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which operates under traditional homeostatic feedback by sex steroids from the gonads in males and most of the time in females. An exception is the late follicular phase in females, when homeostatic feedback is suspended and a positive-feedback response to oestradiol initiates the preovulatory surges of GnRH and luteinising hormone. Here, we briefly review the history of how mechanisms underlying central control of ovulation by circulating steroids have been studied, discuss the relative merit of different model systems and integrate some of the more recent findings in this area into an overall picture of how this phenomenon occurs.

TI  - Sleep-Wake States and Feeding Progression in Preterm Infants
T2  - NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - Background Previous studies demonstrated a short-term relationship between infant sleep-wake states and oral feeding performance, with state being an indication of infants' neurobehavioral readiness for feeding. However, the relationship between sleep-wake states and feeding skills has not been evaluated longitudinally during hospitalization. Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine preterm infants' sleep-wake state developmental trajectories and their associations with feeding progression during hospitalization. Methods This descriptive and exploratory study was a secondary analysis using data from a longitudinal two-group, randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of early and late cycled light on health and developmental outcomes among extremely preterm infants who were born <= 28 weeks of gestational age. Sleep-wake states were assessed for two 2-hour interfeeding periods per day (day and night hours), 30 weeks postmenstrual age, and every 3 weeks until discharge. Occurrences of active sleep, quiet sleep, and waking were recorded every 10 seconds. Feeding progression was assessed based on an infant's postmenstrual age at five milestones: first enteral feeding, full enteral feeding, first oral feeding, half oral feeding, and full oral feeding. Trajectory analyses were used to describe developmental changes in sleep-wake states, feeding progression patterns, and associations between feeding progression and sleep-wake trajectories. Results Active sleep decreased while waking, and quiet sleep increased during hospitalization. Two distinct feeding groups were identified: typical and delayed feeding progression. In infants with delayed feeding progression, rates of active and quiet sleep development during the day were delayed compared to those with typical feeding progression. We also found that infants with delayed feeding progression were more likely to be awake more often during the night compared to infants with typical feeding progression. Discussions Findings suggest that delays in sleep-wake state development may be associated with delays in feeding progression during hospitalization. Infants with delayed feeding skill development may require more environmental protection to further support their sleep development.

TI  - Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at alleviating treatment-induced menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors: Moderators and mediators of treatment effects
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Objectives: Results from our recently conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) indicated that Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), with or without therapist support, is effective in reducing the perceived impact of hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS) and overall levels of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors with treatment-induced menopausal symptoms.
   Study design: We used data of 235 women and compared the iCBT groups combined (n = 156) with the control group (n = 79). Bootstrapped multiple regression analyses with interaction terms (group x potential moderator) or indirect effects (mediation pathway) were conducted.
   Main outcome measures: Reductions in perceived impact of HF/NS and overall levels of menopausal symptoms.
   Results: Women with lower levels of education benefited most from the iCBT. Age, time since diagnosis, current endocrine treatment, oophorectomy, frequency of HF/NS, and psychological distress did not moderate the treatment effects. Factors that mediated treatment effects were the development of healthier beliefs about experiencing hot flushes in a social context, about the impact of night sweats on sleep and daily functioning, and about the ability to control and cope with hot flushes. The acquisition of behavioral coping strategies and decreased psychological distress did not mediate treatment effects.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that women with lower levels of education may benefit most from the current iCBT program, with or without therapist support. The development of healthier HF/NS beliefs contribute significantly to the observed positive effect of iCBT on the burden of menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Sex differences in obstructive sleep apnoea
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY REVIEW
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) have long been considered predominantly male-related conditions. The clinical presentation of sleep disordered breathing in females differs from males and can vary with age and physiological status, e.g. menopause and pregnancy. Overall, females appear to be more symptomatic, with lower apnoea-hypopnoea index scores compared to males. Furthermore, they appear to have more prolonged partial upper airway obstruction, and may report insomnia as a symptom of OSAHS more frequently. As a consequence of these differences in clinical presentation, females with sleep disordered breathing are often underdiagnosed and undertreated compared to males. This review is aimed at discussing the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology and hormonal and metabolic differences in females who present with OSA/OSAHS in comparison to males.

TI  - Further content validation of the 18-item NCCN/FACT Ovarian Symptom Index and its Disease Related Symptom-Physical (DRS-P) subscale for use in advanced ovarian cancer clinical trials
T2  - HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES
AB  - Background This study evaluated pre-defined aspects of content validity of the 18-item NCCN FACT-Ovarian Symptom Index (NFOSI-18) and its Disease-Related Symptoms-Physical (DRS-P) subscale, as clinical trial outcome tools for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Methods Twenty-one women (mean age 59.5 years) diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer completed the NFOSI-18 and participated in a cognitive interview to explore: (1) whether 'pain' and 'cramps' are considered redundant; (2) whether 'fatigue' and 'lack of energy' are overlapping concepts; (3) whether patients consider severity when responding to the item "I am bothered by constipation;" and (4) factors considered when responding to the item "I am sleeping well." Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively. Results Pain was associated with discomfort, hurt, and life interference; 'cramps' was associated with pain, muscle tightening, and menstrual or digestive issues. Most (81%) considered the items "I have pain" and "I have cramps in my stomach area" to be more different than similar. Participants associated 'fatigue' with intense tiredness and 'lack of energy' with motivation and capability to complete daily activities. Item comparisons revealed a majority (65%) considered the items to be more different than similar. When responding to "I am bothered by constipation," patients indicated constipation severity was related to bother. Finally, patients considered disease, treatment, and other factors when responding to "I am sleeping well." Conclusions Findings support content validity of the NFOSI-18 and its DRS-P as originally constructed. We propose an alternative scoring option that excludes the item "I am sleeping well" from the DRS-P when used as a symptom-focused index for clinical research in a regulatory context.

TI  - Off-label uses of drugs for depression
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The prescription of drugs for depression is rising rapidly. One of the reasons for this trend is their many off-label uses. Up to one third of all prescriptions are for non-indicated use, which in addition to drug repurposing includes different dosing or duration than those recommended. In this review, we elaborate on what antidepressants can treat besides depression. The five classes of drugs for depression are introduced, and their mechanisms of action and serious side effects are described. The most common off-label uses of antidepressants are discussed, with a special focus on treating eating disorders, sleep problems, smoking cessation and managing chronic pain. Depression is often a comorbidity when antidepressants are chosen as therapy, but good therapeutic effects have been observed for other conditions also when depression is not involved. Finally, a new type of antidepressant developed from the hallucinogenic "party drug" ketamine is briefly introduced. This recent development suggests that antidepressants will keep playing a central role in medicine for years to come.

TI  - Night shift work and cardiovascular disease biomarkers in female nurses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background Night shift work is associated with cardiovascular disease, but its associations with cardiovascular disease biomarkers are unclear. We investigated these associations in a study of female nurses. Methods We used data from the Nurses' Health Study II for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen. The sample sizes for our analysis ranged from 458 (fibrinogen) to 3574 (total cholesterol). From questionnaires, we determined the number of night shifts worked in the 2 weeks before blood collection and total years of rotating night shift work. We used quantile regression to estimate differences in biomarker levels by shift work history, adjusting for potential confounders. Results Nurses working 1 to 4 recent night shifts had median HDL cholesterol levels 4.4 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3, 7.5) lower than nurses without recent night shifts. However, working >= 5 recent night shifts and years of rotating night shift work were not associated with HDL cholesterol. There was no association between recent night shifts and CRP, but median CRP levels were 0.1 (95% CI: 0.0, 0.2), 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.4), and 0.2 (95% CI: 0.0, 0.4) mg/L higher among nurses working rotating night shifts for 1 to 5, 6 to 9, and >= 10 years compared with nurses never working rotating night shifts. These associations were attenuated when excluding postmenopausal women and women taking statins. We observed no associations between night shift work and other biomarkers. Conclusions We found suggestive evidence of adverse short-term and long-term effects of night shift work on select cardiovascular disease biomarkers.

TI  - Thermal Comfort Intervention for Hot-flash Related Insomnia Symptoms in Perimenopausal and Postmenopausal-aged Women: An Exploratory Study
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objective/Background: To examine a novel intervention for nighttime thermal comfort and sleep of perimenopausal- and postmenopausal-aged women who experience hot flashes and insomnia symptoms. Participants: Thirty-nine women (ages 45-58, M = 52.1 years) with sleep-disrupting hot flashes and insomnia symptoms. Methods: This was a 4-week randomized cross-over study. The intervention included 2 weeks of nighttime use of a warming/cooling device worn on the wrist and was compared to a 2-week baseline period (no device). All participants completed questionnaires at the end of each 2-week period, including the Insomnia Severity Index, the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment scales, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale. Results: The intervention resulted in a reduction in sleep onset latency, as well as an increase in nighttime sleep. There was a significant improvement of scores on the Insomnia Severity Index, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment scales, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Significantly fewer women reported that hot flashes interfered with their sleep (90% vs 70%) and more perceived control over the degree of sleep disruption due to nighttime hot flashes while using the device (5% vs 49%). The majority reported a positive experience, with two-thirds reporting that the device improved their thermal comfort and ability to return to sleep after a night waking. Conclusions: Overall, a thermal comfort intervention may offer sleep benefits for women who experience disruptive nighttime hot flashes, particularly in terms of falling asleep at bedtime and subjective perception of control over nighttime hot flash sleep interference.

TI  - Positive Affect Moderates the Relationship Between Salivary Testosterone and a Health Behavior Composite in University Females
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background Testosterone is released in both men and women and plays an important role in social functioning and motivation. Greater testosterone in women has been associated with negative physical health outcomes, while lower testosterone has been associated with psychological disorders. The following cross-sectional study examined the contribution of salivary testosterone, positive and negative affect, and demographic variables in predicting a composite health behavior score (cigarette use, hours of sleep, fruit/vegetable intake, following an exercise routine). Method The sample (mean age 21.17, SD = 6.13) consisted of 87 female university students asked to complete a demographic and lifestyle behavior questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and provide a saliva sample. Participants self-identified as Latina (37.9%), European American (32.2%), Asian American (5.7%), African American (4.6%), or Mixed/other (19.5%). Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine whether positive and negative affect served as a moderator between salivary testosterone and a health behavior composite. Results Results indicated that positive affect moderated the relationship between salivary testosterone and the composite health behavior score (t = - 2.42, p = .018, Adj. R-2 = .21, F (5, 81) = 5.07, p < .001) such that the healthiest behaviors were observed in participants with high positive affect and low salivary testosterone. Findings remained after adjusting for oral contraceptive use, income level, relationship status, and ethnicity. Conclusions These results provide a preliminary foundation for future research examining the interplay of neuroendocrine function, psychological factors (i.e., positive affect), and behavior. Further empirical studies can focus on expanding this research in larger, representative samples.

TI  - A national survey on how sexual activity is perceived to be associated with sleep
T2  - SLEEP AND BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS
AB  - There is a paucity of studies investigating how sexual activity is perceived to influence sleep, despite conceptions about significant gender differences regarding this issue. In all, 4000 persons, aged between 18 and 55 years, were randomly drawn from the Norwegian Population Registry and invited to participate in a postal survey. The respondents were asked how sexual activity with another person, with or without orgasm, and how masturbation, with and without orgasm, influenced sleep latency and sleep quality. A total of 1080 persons participated (response rate 28.2%) of which 56.1% were women. The mean age of the sample was 38.7 years (SD = 10.8). Sexual activity with an orgasm was perceived to have a soporific effect by both men and women. Sexual activity with another person, with an orgasm, was perceived to have a relatively stronger effect on men compared to women in terms of sleep quality. Sexual activity without an orgasm was by men reported to have a sleep impairing effect, whereas the perceived effect reported by women was equivocal. Sexual activity with orgasms was perceived as having a soporific effect in both men and women. Sexual activity without an orgasm had an equivocal perceived effect on sleep.

TI  - The New West Japan Twins and Higher Order Multiple Births Registry
T2  - TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS
AB  - The new West Japan Twins and Higher Order Multiple Births Registry was established by recruiting young twins and multiple births and by referrals from public health centers in the 1990s. The participants included in the survey comprised over 7800 twins and 4241 higher order multiples, and their families. Specifically, the present registry contains one of the largest triplet samples in the world. For these twins and multiples, data on year of delivery, mode of delivery, gestational age, intrapartum complications, longitudinal physical measures, motor milestones, cerebral palsy and feeding methods were obtained from records in the Maternal and Child Health Handbooks and schools. Participating mothers were asked to indicate family structure, parental educational history, maternal sleeping time, maternal health condition, maternal and paternal age at multiple delivery, complications during pregnancy, handedness of multiples and age at menarche of multiples. However, the zygosity differed among the various collaborating public health centers according to factors such as the time of investigation. Follow-up questionnaires have been mailed out every 3-4 years for longitudinal studies. This article describes the goals of this registry, recruitment of multiples and the focus of the study. The goals of this registry are not only to conduct research on human genetics and maternal and child health, but also to contribute to providing appropriate information for families with multiples.

TI  - Endogenous Circadian Regulation of Female Reproductive Hormones
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Context: Studies suggest that female reproductive hormones are under circadian regulation, although methodological differences have led to inconsistent findings.
   Objective: To determine whether circulating levels of reproductive hormones exhibit circadian rhythms.
   Design: Blood samples were collected across;90 consecutive hours, including 2 baseline days under a standard sleep-wake schedule and;50 hours of extended wake under constant routine (CR) conditions.
   Setting: Intensive Physiological Monitoring Unit, Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   Participants: Seventeen healthy premenopausal women (22.8 +/- 2.6 years; nine follicular; eight luteal). Interventions: Fifty-hour CR.
   Main Outcome Measures: Plasma estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), LH, FSH, SHBG, melatonin, and core body temperature.
   Results: All hormones exhibited significant 24-hour rhythms under both standard sleep-wake and CR conditions during the follicular phase (P < 0.05). In contrast, only FSH and SHBG were significantly rhythmic during the luteal phase. Rhythm acrophases and amplitudes were similar between standard sleep-wake and CR conditions. The acrophase occurred in the morning for P4; in the afternoon for FSH, LH, and SHBG; and during the night for E2.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm previous reports of similar to 24-hour rhythms in many female reproductive hormones in humans under ambulatory conditions but demonstrate that these hormones are under endogenous circadian regulation, defined as persisting in the absence of external time cues. These results may have important implications for the effects of circadian disruption on reproductive function.

TI  - Sex Hormone Phenotypes in Young Girls and the Age at Pubertal Milestones
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Context: The age of pubertal onset is influenced by many variables in young girls. Previous studies have not examined sex hormones longitudinally around the time of breast development and their relationship to pubertal onset.
   Objective: We sought to use an unbiased statistical approach to identify phenotypes of sex hormones in young girls and examine their relationship with pubertal milestones.
   Design and Setting: Longitudinal observational study.
   Participants and Main Outcome Measures: In 269 girls, serum concentrations of steroid sex hormones [estradiol (E2), estrone, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate] were measured by HPLC-mass spectrometry at time points before, at, and after thelarche. Girls were classified into four hormone phenotypes using objective principal components and cluster analyses of longitudinal hormone data. The association between the identified phenotypes and age of pubertal milestones was estimated using Cox proportional hazards modeling.
   Results: Mean ages at thelarche, pubarche, and menarche were 9.02, 9.85, and 12.30 years, respectively. Girls with low levels of all four hormones, phenotype 3b, were youngest at thelarche (8.67 years); those in phenotype 2, with the highest E2 levels and E2 surge 6 months after thelarche, were youngest at menarche (11.87 years) with shortest pubertal tempo. When controlling for race, maternal age of menarche, caregiver education, and body mass, different phenotypes were associated with the age of pubertal events.
   Conclusions: Hormone phenotypic clustering can identify clinically relevant subgroups with differing ages of thelarche, pubarche, andmenarche. These findings may enhance the understanding of timing of pubertal milestones and risk of adult disease.

TI  - Association of Night Eating with Depression and Depressive Symptoms in Korean Women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This study examined the associations of night eating with depression and depressive symptoms in Korean adults. The study used a nationally representative sample of 31,690 Korean adults (>= 19 years old) from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2013. The participants were divided into two groups based on status of night eating: night eaters (consuming >= 25% of total daily energy intake between 21:00 and 06:00) and non-night eaters. Depression was defined based on diagnosis by a doctor, whereas depressive symptoms were defined as feelings of sadness or desperation for more than two weeks in the last one year. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between night eating and odds of depression and depressive symptoms after controlling for age, education, income, marital status, drinking, smoking, day of recalled intake, physical activity, body mass index, menopausal status (women only), total energy intake, and sleep duration. A total of 14.3% of Korean adults were night eaters. Night eaters were more likely to be men, young, less educated, single, drinkers, current smokers, and not employed (all ps < 0.05). In women, night eaters had higher odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.75; p for trend = 0.0389) and depressive symptoms (AOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.41; p for trend = 0.0382) compared with non-night eaters. However, no associations of night eating with depression and depressive symptoms were found in men. Night eaters had higher odds of depression and depressive symptoms only in Korean women. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying psychological and behavioral mechanisms that in turn may shed light on the factors influencing both night eating and odds of depression and depressive symptoms.

TI  - Estradiol regulates daily rhythms underlying diet-induced obesity in female mice
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM
AB  - The circadian system is a critical regulator of metabolism and obesity in males, but its role in regulating obesity in females is poorly understood. Because there are sex differences in the development of obesity and susceptibility to obesity-related disorders, we sought to determine the role of estrogens in regulating the circadian mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity. When fed high-fat diet, C57BL/6J male mice gain weight, whereas females are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Here, we demonstrate that estradiol regulates circadian rhythms in females to confer resistance to diet-induced obesity. We found that ovariectomized females with undetectable circulating estrogens became obese and had disrupted daily rhythms of eating behavior and locomotor activity when fed a high-fat diet. The phase of the liver molecular circadian rhythm was also altered by high-fat diet feeding in ovariectomized mice. Estradiol replacement in ovariectomized females a fed high-fat diet rescued these behavioral and tissue rhythms. Additionally. restoring the daily rhythm of eating behavior in ovariectomized females with time-restricted feeding inhibited diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Together, these data suggest that the circadian system is a target for treating obesity and its comorbidities in women after menopause, when circulating levels of estrogens are too low to protect their circadian rhythms.

TI  - The role of melatonin in polycystic ovary syndrome: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread endocrine disorder, affecting approximately 20% of women within reproductive age. It is associated with hyperandrogenism, obesity, menstrual irregularity, and anovulatory infertility. Melatonin is the main pineal gland hormone involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm. In recent years, it has been observed that a reduction in melatonin levels of follicular fluid exists in PCOS patients. Melatonin receptors in the ovary and intrafollicular fluid adjust sex steroid secretion at different phases of ovarian follicular maturation. Moreover, melatonin is a strong antioxidant and an effective free radical scavenger, which protects ovarian follicles during follicular maturation.
   Objective: In this paper, we conducted a literature review and the summary of the current research on the role of melatonin in PCOS.
   Materials and Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Reaxys were searched from their inception to October 2018 using the keywords "Melatonin" AND "Polycystic ovary syndrome" OR "PCOS."
   Results: Based on the data included in our review, it was found that the administration of melatonin can improve the oocyte and embryo quality in PCOS patients. It may also have beneficial effects in correcting the hormonal alterations in PCOS patients.
   Conclusion: Since metabolic dysfunction is the major finding contributing to the initiation of PCOS, melatonin can hinder this process via its improving effects on metabolic functions.

TI  - SOOJI CHIM (Koryo hand acupuncture) for perimenopausal insomnia: Evidence from actigraphy and serum hormone testing
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF ACUPUNCTURE-MOXIBUSTION
AB  - Objective: This study is conducted to determine the effects of SOOJI CHIM (Koryo hand acupuncture, KHA) therapy on sleep structures and perimenopause symptoms among insomniacs.
   Methods: Totally 49 participants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in a two-arm randomized, placebo controlled, patients-blind trial, with 24 cases allocated to a real-KHA group and 25 cases allocated to a sham-KHA group. Patients in each group received corresponding treatment every other day, three times a week for total eight weeks. Both actigraphy and testing of serum hormones level reflected by biological markers such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E-2) were performed at pre- and post-treatment. Additionally, the scores of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was used for assessing the subjective sleep experience of insomniacs. Meanwhile, adverse effects were monitored and recorded.
   Results: After eight-week treatment, the global scores of PSQI declined significantly (P<0.05) in the real-KHA group but not in the sham-KHA group (P>0.05). According to the outcomes of actigraphy, a striking increase was observed in both sleep efficiency (SE) and total sleep time (TST) in the real-KHA group (both P<0.05) but not in the sham-KHA group (P>0.05). However, no significant changes of sleep awakenings (SA) in both groups was found after treatment (both P>0.05). Meanwhile, FSH and LH in the real-KHA group decreased markedly after intervention (both P<0.05) while those indicators only slightly changed in the sham-KHA group (P>0.05). The fluctuation of E-2 levels were not significant in both groups (both P>0.05). No serious adverse event was reported in either real- or sham- KHA group.
   Conclusion: KHA may be a potential alternative therapy for improving perimenopausal insomnia via down regulating the levels of FSH and LH. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of World Journal of Acupuncture Moxibustion House.

TI  - Perceptions of using herbal medicines for managing menopausal symptoms: a web-based survey of Korean medicine doctors
T2  - INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Most women experiencing menopause have sought out traditional treatment options to relieve their symptoms. The aim of this study, which used a web-based survey, was to investigate perceptions of Korean medicine doctors (KMDs) on managing menopausal symptoms with herbal medicines.
   Methods: We developed and then sent a questionnaire via email to a total 497 KMDs in obstetrics and gynecology affiliated with the Society of Korean Medicine. The questionnaire consisted of three categories and a total of 26 items focusing on major menopausal symptoms, prescriptions, pattern identification, and background characteristics.
   Results: Out of the 497 KMDs, we received responses from 48 doctors, a response rate of 9.7%. The most common symptoms of menopausal disorder perceived by responded KMDs were hot flashes (22.9%), sleep disorders (18.2%), systemic fatigue (12.5%), and sweating (12.0%). The herbal medicines reported to be the most effective when treating patients with menopausal disorders were Jiawei shaoyao-san (12.5%), Jiawei guipi-decoction (11.8%). The responding KMDs recommended one to two months of treatment for female menopausal disorder, using two to three doses of herbal medicine per day in combination with traditional Korean medicine (KM) therapies such as acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, and pharmacopuncture.
   Conclusion: The results of this survey may provide information about doctor's perceptions on using herbal medicines to manage patient's menopausal symptoms. Future studies should be done with a larger sample size to overcome the limitation of this study and to examine how KM is used for treating menopausal symptoms in clinical practice.

TI  - Lifestyle Factors Associated with Premenstrual Syndrome: A Cross-sectional Study of Japanese High School Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Study Objective: To investigate the relationships between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and lifestyle, sleep, and dietary habits among Japanese high school students.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Two public high schools in Sendai, the largest city in northeastern Japan.
   Participants: A school-based survey was conducted among 1818 female Japanese high school students in 2015, and 1022 students with regular menstrual cycles (25-38 days) completed the questionnaire.
   Interventions and Main Outcome Measures: Relationships between PMS and lifestyle, sleep, and dietary habits.
   Results: The rates of moderate to severe PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder were 9.7% (99/1022) and 2.2% (22/1022), respectively. A total of 121 students (11.9%) were classified as having PMS-the PMS(+) group. Significant differences were observed between the PMS(+) group and those without PMS-the PMS(-) group-in age at menarche (P = .022), menstrual pain (P < .001), hypnagogic disorder (P < .001), long Internet use time (P < .001), eating breakfast (P = .018), chewing well (P = .037), and belonging to a sports club (P = .046). Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for PMS were menstrual pain (odds ratio [OR], 4.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.83-7.95), hypnagogic disorder (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.47-3.35), stress fracture (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.21-3.98), and Internet use time (OR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005). Belonging to a sports club decreased the risk of PMS (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.91).
   Conclusion: Sleep, dietary habits, belonging to a sports club, and screen time affect PMS among high school students.

TI  - Circulating Obestatin levels during Ramadan fasting in normal weight and obese subjects
T2  - KUWAIT MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate obestatin levels in both obese and normal subjects before and after Ramadan period. Also, the relationships between plasma obestatin levels and anthropometric and metabolic parameters were analysed.
   Design: Prospective study
   Setting: Ankara Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey
   Subjects: Premenopausal women between the ages of 21 - 42 years, 30 obese and 35 normal weight, were recruited the study.
   Intervention: Blood samples were received and anthropometric measurements were made from all of the subjects two days before and two days after Ramadan.
   Main Outcome Measures: Obestatin was measured by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Insulin resistance was calculated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
   Results: Obestatin levels were significantly lower in obese individuals compared with normal controls [0.65 (0.72) vs 1.10 (1.22) ng/ml; p<0.01]. While obestatin [1.45 (1.22) vs 0.65 (0.72) ng/ml; p=0.002] and HDL-C levels were higher after Ramadan in obese group; BMI, HOMA-IR and LDL-C levels were found to be lower. After Ramadan, BMI, HOMA-IR, fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin were negatively correlated with obestatin level.
   Conclusions: The changes in pattern of sleep and fasting, and eating two times in a day during Ramadan may lead to increased obestatin in obese subjects, and this result may positively affect obesity, glucose and lipid metabolism. Thus, this peptide may be a therapeutic helper in pathological conditions such as insulin resistance and diabetes.

TI  - The effects of foot reflexology on depression during menopause: A randomized controlled clinical trial
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of foot reflexology on depression during menopause.
   Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.
   Setting: Gynecology outpatient clinic.
   Interventions: We enrolled 90 menopausal women with depression. Participants were assigned to the intervention (n = 45) and control (n = 45) groups by block randomization. Participants in the intervention group received 15 min of foot reflexology on each foot for a total of 30 min in evenings, twice a week for six weeks. Participants in the control group received only the routine care for menopause patients.
   Main outcome measures: The Beck Depression questionnaire was completed by all participants at the beginning of the trial and the end of the intervention and two months after completion of the intervention.
   Results: A total of 121 patients were assessed for eligibility to participate in the study. One-hundred patients met the criteria to participate, and 90 participants-45 participants in each group-completed the study. In the intervention group, the mean scores of depression before, immediately after, and two months after the study were 26.97 +/- 4.47 (95% CI = 25.3-28.3), 22.55 +/- 5.18 (95% CI = 20.9-24.1), and 21.20 +/- 5,74 (95% CI = 19.4-22.9), respectively. In the control group, these scores were 26.15 +/- 5.01 (95% CI = 24.6-27.6), 26.22 +/- 5.14 (95% CI = 24.7-27.7), and 26.66 +/- 3.87 (95%CI = 25.5-27.8), respectively. Using Repeated Measures ANOVA, the comparison of the mean scores of depression in the two groups indicated that the scores were decreased over time.
   Conclusion: The findings indicated that the foot reflexology technique can be effective for reducing women's depression during menopause. However, considering the study's limitations, including a small sample size and no intervention in the control group, more studies are needed to verify the findings.

TI  - Disorders of Sleep in Women: Insomnia
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC ANNALS
AB  - Insomnia is defined as a persistent difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. A comprehensive history and physical examination differentiate the subtypes of insomnia: acute, chronic, and associated with comorbid disorders. Evaluation of insomnia entails understanding the predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors of insomnia unique to each person. Effective treatment is incomplete without implementing cognitive-behavioral therapy for behaviors nonconducive to sleep as monotherapy or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Setting realistic goals and expectations of quality and quantity of sleep required to feel rested determine treatment success and outcomes. This article reviews the prevalence, symptoms, subtypes, and diagnosis and management of insomnia, particularly in women with emotional and hormonal changes of symptomatic premenstrual syndrome, pregnancy, and menopause.

TI  - The Relationship Between Quality of Life and Pubertal Timing in Adolescence: The Toyama Birth Cohort Study, Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: Although pubertal timing is gradually becoming earlier in Japan, support as for physical and mental health among children experiencing earlier puberty than their peers is inadequate. To better understand health and life satisfaction in seventh grade students (age 12-13 years), examination of relationships between health outcomes and pubertal timing, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors is necessary.
   Methods: Participants of the Toyama Birth Cohort Study (4,752 males and 4,740 females) answered questions regarding school year of onset of voice break for boys and menarche for girls, sleep quality, mental health difficulties, overall health, quality of life (QOL), and lifestyle. Relationship between health outcomes and pubertal timing was examined using binary logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Earlier pubertal timing was associated with four health-related outcomes. For poor sleep quality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of fourth grade males and crude OR of fifth grade females were statistically significant. Regarding mental health difficulties, the crude OR of fifth grade males and adjusted OR of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade females were statistically significant. Associations between poor overall health and fourth grade males and fourth or fifth grade females were observed. For poor QOL, the adjusted OR of fourth grade males and females was statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Relationships between earlier pubertal timing and poor sleep quality, mental health difficulties, poor physical health, and poor QOL were observed. To improve children's quality of life, support from teachers and school doctors and nurses is needed-especially for children with earlier pubertal timing.

TI  - Absence of a diurnal rhythm of oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin in human cerebrospinal fluid, blood and saliva
T2  - NEUROPEPTIDES
AB  - Purpose: The aims of our study were to determine first circadian influences on central concentrations of the neuropeptides oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin and second to investigate if these central concentrations are associated with those in the peripheral compartments blood and saliva in neurocritical care patients.
   We therefore included patients with external ventricular drain who attended a neurosurgical intensive care unit and were not exposed to painful or stressful stimuli during the sampling period. For this purpose, blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva were collected in a 24-hour-interval at the timepoints 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 and 24:00.
   Results: In none of the three body fluids examined, significant time-dependent fluctuations of oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin concentrations could be detected during the 24-hour sampling period. The only exception was the subgroup of postmenopausal women whose oxytocin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid at 12:00 were significantly higher than at 18:00. Correlations of blood and cerebrospinal fluid and blood and saliva neuropeptide levels were very weak to weak at each timepoint. Cerebrospinal fluid and saliva oxytocin levels showed a moderate correlation at 06:00 but did correlate very weak at the other timepoints.
   Conclusions: Central as well as peripheral oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin concentrations in neurocritical care patients did not show significant diurnal fluctuations. No strong correlations between central and peripheral neuropeptide concentrations could be detected under basal conditions. If investigators even though decide to use saliva concentrations as surrogate parameter for central neuropeptide activity, they have to consider that correlations of cerebrospinal fluid and saliva oxytocin seem to be highest in the early morning.

TI  - Sex differences in breathing
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Breathing is a vital behavior that ensures both the adequate supply of oxygen and the elimination of CO2, and it is influenced by many factors. Despite that most of the studies in respiratory physiology rely heavily on male subjects, there is much evidence to suggest that sex is an important factor in the respiratory control system, including the susceptibility for some diseases. These different respiratory responses in males and females may be related to the actions of sex hormones, especially in adulthood. These hormones affect neuromodulatory systems that influence the central medullary rhythm/pontine pattern generator and integrator, sensory inputs to the integrator and motor output to the respiratory muscles. In this article, we will first review the sex dependence on the prevalence of some respiratory-related diseases. Then, we will discuss the role of sex and gonadal hormones in respiratory control under resting conditions and during respiratory challenges, such as hypoxia and hypercapnia, and whether hormonal fluctuations during the estrous/menstrual cycle affect breathing control. We will then discuss the role of the locus coeruleus, a sexually dimorphic CO2/pH-chemosensitive nucleus, on breathing regulation in males and females. Next, we will highlight the studies that exist regarding sex differences in respiratory control during development. Finally, the few existing studies regarding the influence of sex on breathing control in non-mammalian vertebrates will be discussed.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of sleep disturbances in breast cancersurvivors: systematic review and meta-analyses
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
AB  - Background Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among women worldwide, with rising incidence numbers. In Belgium, one out of eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Fortunately, 80% of those breast cancer patients will still be alive 10 years after diagnosis due to improvements in screening and treatment strategies. However, an important portion of the breast cancer survivors (BCS) will face side effects, such as sleep disturbances, long after treatment ends. It has been demonstrated that untreated insomnia in BCS negatively impacts mood, physical symptoms, pain sensitivity, fatigue, and quality of life. Furthermore, insomnia is increasingly considered an independent risk factor for future depression in BCS. The importance of understanding sleep disturbances in cancer populations has been highlighted and recognized as warranting further research. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence and the risk factors for the development of sleep disturbances in BCS. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, and PEDro were systematically screened for studies encompassing data regarding the prevalence or risk factors of sleep disturbances in BCS. If possible, meta-analyses were performed. Subgroup analyses were undertaken based on the methodological quality, study design, type of sleep disturbance, and the use of a measurement tool with strong psychometric properties to investigate significant heterogeneity (I-2 > 50%) across studies. Results A total of 27 studies were found eligible. The pooled estimate for sleep disturbances prevalence is 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.29-0.52], I-2 = 100%, p < 0.00001) and ranged from 0.14 (95% CI = [0.04-0.24]) to 0.93 (95% CI = [0.91-0.95]). Subgroup analyses did not reduce the heterogeneity among studies. Meta-analyses were performed for seven risk factors. Significant differences for the odds of developing sleep disturbances were found for hot flashes (pooled OR (ORp) 2.25, 95% CI = [1.64-3.08], I-2 = 0%, p = 0.90), race (ORp 2.31, 95% CI = [1.56-3.42], I-2 = 0%, p = 0.47), and menopause (ORp 1.84, 95% CI = [1.11-3.06], I-2 = 0%, p = 0.70). After withdrawing the studies that did not rely on the use of a measurement tool with strong psychometric properties, pain (ORp 2.31, 95% CI = [1.36-3.92], I-2 = 27%, p = 0.25), depressive symptoms (ORp 3.20, 95% CI [2.32-4.42], I-2 = 0%, p = 0.63), and fatigue (ORp 2.82, 95% CI = [1.98-4.02], I-2 = 0%, p = 0.60) became significant as well, with a substantial decrease of heterogeneity. Conclusion Prevalence for sleep disturbances ranged from 0.14 to 0.93 with the vast majority of the studies investigating insomnia and sleep-wake disturbances. High heterogeneity makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Pain, depressive symptoms, hot flashes, fatigue, non-Caucasian race, and menopausal status were significantly associated with increased odds for developing sleep disturbances.

TI  - Nocturnal finger skin temperature in menstrual cycle tracking: ambulatory pilot study using a wearable Oura ring
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background Body temperature is a common method in menstrual cycle phase tracking because of its biphasic form. In ambulatory studies, different skin temperatures have proven to follow a similar pattern. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the applicability of nocturnal finger skin temperature based on a wearable Oura ring to monitor menstrual cycle and predict menstruations and ovulations in real life. Methods Volunteer women (n = 22) wore the Oura ring, measured ovulation through urine tests, and kept diaries on menstruations at an average of 114.7 days (SD 20.6), of which oral temperature was measured immediately after wake-up at an average of 1.9 cycles (SD 1.2). Skin and oral temperatures were compared by assessing daily values using repeated measures correlation and phase mean values and differences between phases using dependent t-test. Developed algorithms using skin temperature were tested to predict the start of menstruation and ovulation. The performance of algorithms was assessed with sensitivity and positive predictive values (true positive defined with different windows around the reported day). Results Nocturnal skin temperatures and oral temperatures differed between follicular and luteal phases with higher temperatures in the luteal phase, with a difference of 0.30 degrees C (SD 0.12) for skin and 0.23 degrees C (SD 0.09) for oral temperature (p < 0.001). Correlation between skin and oral temperatures was found using daily temperatures (r = 0.563, p < 0.001) and differences between phases (r = 0.589, p = 0.004). Menstruations were detected with a sensitivity of 71.9-86.5% in window lengths of +/- 2 to +/- 4 days. Ovulations were detected with the best-performing algorithm with a sensitivity of 83.3% in fertile window from - 3 to + 2 days around the verified ovulation. Positive predictive values had similar percentages to those of sensitivities. The mean offset for estimations were 0.4 days (SD 1.8) for menstruations and 0.6 days (SD 1.5) for ovulations with the best-performing algorithm. Conclusions Nocturnal skin temperature based on wearable ring showed potential for menstrual cycle monitoring in real life conditions.

TI  - Sleep quality of Shanghai residents: population-based cross-sectional study
T2  - QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Objective To estimate the prevalence of poor sleep and its risk factors for adults living in a suburban area of Shanghai with rapid urbanization. Methods A total of 37,545 residents who were aged 20 to 74 years and from the "Peak Program," a community-based natural population cohort study, were included. Data on demographics, lifestyle, and physical health-related factors were collected using a face-to-face questionnaire interview. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and poor sleep was defined as a PSQI score above 7. Results The overall mean of PSQI score was 3.69 +/- 2.57 while the prevalence of poor sleep was 8.3%. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was higher in participants who were older than 40 years, had less education, smoked tobacco, had anxiety, and had a chronic disease (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for confounding, a logistic regression model indicated that poor sleep was associated with advanced age, smoking, anxiety, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and other chronic diseases (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In addition, compared to women who were premenopausal, the naturally postmenopausal women (OR 1.675, 95% CI 1.44-1.94) and induced menopausal women (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.81-2.82) were more likely to report poor sleep. Conclusion The prevalence of poor sleep among individuals who lived in the Songjiang District of Shanghai and were aged 20 to 74 years was remarkably lower than in the general population of China. Poor sleep was generally more common in middle-aged and elderly residents and in those suffering from anxiety and chronic diseases. Regular exercise, anxiety relieving, and treatment improvement of different chronic diseases may help sleep better.

TI  - The influences of sleep duration, chronotype, and nightwork on the ovarian cycle
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Despite research indicating that sleep disorders influence reproductive health, the effects of sleep on reproductive hormone concentrations are poorly characterized. We prospectively followed 259 regularly menstruating women across one to two menstrual cycles (the BioCycle Study, 2005-2007), measuring fasting serum hormone concentrations up to eight times per cycle. Women provided information about daily sleep in diaries and chronotype and night/shift work on a baseline questionnaire. We evaluated percent differences in mean hormone concentrations, the magnitude of shifts in the timing and amplitude of hormone peaks, and the risk for sporadic anovulation associated with self-reported sleep patterns and night/shift work. We estimated chronotype scores - categorizing women below and above the interquartile range (IQR) as "morning" and "evening" chronotypes, respectively. For every hour increase in daily sleep duration, mean estradiol concentrations increased by 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0, 5.9%) and luteal phase progesterone by 9.4% (CI 4.0, 15.2%). Receiving less than 7 hours of sleep per day was associated with slightly earlier rises in peak levels for several hormones. Women reporting night/shift work (n = 77) had lower testosterone relative to women employed without night/shift work (percent difference: -9.9%, CI -18.4, -0.4%). Women with morning chronotypes (n = 47) had earlier rises in estradiol during their cycles and potentially an earlier rise in luteinizing hormone. Compared to those who had intermediate chronotypes, women with evening chronotypes (n = 42) had a later luteinizing hormone peak of borderline statistical significance. A reduced risk for sporadic anovulation was suggested, but imprecise, for increasing hours of daily sleep leading up to ovulation (risk ratio 0.79, CI 0.59, 1.06), while an imprecise increased risk was observed for women with morning chronotypes (risk ratio 2.50, CI 0.93, 6.77). Sleep-related hormonal changes may not greatly alter ovarian function in healthy women, but have the potential to influence gynecologic health.

TI  - Sex and Gender Driven Modifiers of Alzheimer's: The Role for Estrogenic Control Across Age, Race, Medical, and Lifestyle Risks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Research indicates that after advanced age, the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is female sex. Out of every three AD patients, two are females with postmenopausal women contributing to over 60% of all those affected. Sex- and gender-related differences in AD have been widely researched and several emerging lines of evidence point to different vulnerabilities that contribute to dementia risk. Among those being considered, it is becoming widely accepted that gonadal steroids contribute to the gender disparity in AD, as evidenced by the "estrogen hypothesis." This posits that sex hormones, 17 beta-estradiol in particular, exert a neuroprotective effect by shielding females' brains from disease development. This theory is further supported by recent findings that the onset of menopause is associated with the emergence of AD-related brain changes in women in contrast to men of the same age. In this review, we discuss genetic, medical, societal, and lifestyle risk factors known to increase AD risk differently between the genders, with a focus on the role of hormonal changes, particularly declines in 17 beta-estradiol during the menopause transition (MT) as key underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Military Sexual Trauma in Older Women Veterans: Prevalence and Comorbidities
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background Recent attention has highlighted the common occurrence and health consequences of military sexual trauma (MST) in younger women veterans. However, almost nothing is known about MST in older veterans. Objective To describe MST among older women veterans, including prevalence and common comorbidities. Design Cross-sectional observational study, using data from national Department of Veterans Affairs medical records. Participants Population-based sample of women Veterans aged 55+ with at least one documented MST screen response and at least one clinical encounter in fiscal years 2005-2015. Main Measures MST screen: medical diagnoses (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, obesity, chronic pain conditions, back pain, dementia, insomnia, sleep apnea, menopause symptoms) and mental health diagnoses (anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, tobacco use, alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, opioid use disorder, suicidal ideation) from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification codes in the medical record. Key Results In this cohort of older women veterans (n = 70,864, mean age 65.8 +/- 10.4 years), 13% had a positive MST screen. In multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and marital status, MST was strongly associated with most mental health diagnoses, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 7.25, 95% CI 6.84-7.68), depression (OR 2.39, 95% CI 2.28-2.50), and suicidal ideation (OR 2.42, 95% CI 2.08-2.82). MST was also associated with multiple medical conditions, particularly sleep disorders (insomnia OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.43-1.82; sleep apnea OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.37-1.61) and pain (chronic pain OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.50-1.67; back pain OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.34-1.47). Conclusions A history of MST is common among older women veterans and associated with a range of medical and mental health diagnoses. These findings call attention to the need for additional research in this understudied population, and the importance of trauma-informed care approaches for women across the lifespan.

TI  - Short Sleep Is Associated With Low Bone Mineral Density and Osteoporosis in the Women's Health Initiative
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH
AB  - Short sleep duration, recognized as a public health epidemic, is associated with adverse health conditions, yet little is known about the association between sleep and bone health. We tested the associations of usual sleep behavior and bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. In a sample of 11,084 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; mean age 63.3 years, SD = 7.4), we performed a cross-sectional study of the association of self-reported usual hours of sleep and sleep quality (WHI Insomnia Rating Score) with whole body, total hip, femoral neck, and spine BMD using linear regression models. We also studied the association of sleep duration and quality with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-defined low bone mass (T-score < -2.5 to <-1) and osteoporosis (T-score <= -2.5) using multinomial regression models. We adjusted for age, DXA machine, race, menopausal symptoms, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol use, physical function, and sleep medication use. In adjusted linear regression models, women who reported sleeping 5 hours or less per night had on average 0.012 to 0.018 g/cm(2) significantly lower BMD at all four sites compared with women who reported sleeping 7 hours per night (reference). In adjusted multinomial models, women reporting 5 hours or less per night had higher odds of low bone mass and osteoporosis of the hip (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.45, and 1.63; 1.15-2.31, respectively). We observed a similar pattern for spine BMD, where women with 5 hours or less per night had higher odds of osteoporosis (adjusted OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.02-1.60). Associations of sleep quality and DXA BMD failed to reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration was associated with lower BMD and higher risk of osteoporosis. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the cross-sectional effects of sleep duration on bone health and explore associated mechanisms. (c) 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

TI  - Comparison of physical activity level with sleep quality in premenopausal and postmenopausal women Physical activity and sleep quality in menopause
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND ANALYTICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the individual and combined associations of physical activity and sleep in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Material and Method: Two hundred and fifty premenopausal (mean age: 45.50 +/- 2.10) and 250 postmenopausal (mean age: 60.27 +/- 3.03) women were evaluated. We compared age, body mass index (BMI), education, marital status, menopause age, jobs, medical conditions, smoking, physical activity and sleep quality using the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale between groups. The SPSS 22.0 program was used for thre statistical analysis of the research data. Frequency and percentage (average, standard deviation) were used as descriptive statistics of the study. Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman correlation test) were performed for comparison of the variables, which did not comply with the normal distribution. Significance was accepted as p<0.05. Results: Sleep quality scores were better in premenopausal women when compared with postmenopausal women (p<0.000). No significant differences were found in BMI (p=0.691). The mean menopause age was 47.56 +/- 4.91 in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women's physical activity and sleep quality was worse than in premenopausal women. Thirty-four premenopausal (14 of them walking, 8 of them swimming, 12 of them fitness) and 12 postmenopausal (8 of them walking, 4 of them swimming) women had physical activity. In all women, exercise training participants had better sleep quality. Those who exercised had better sleep quality in both groups (p<0.000). No significant differences were found in sleep quality between those premenopausal and postmenopausal women who exercised. Discussion: Objective sleep measures differed significantly between the pre- and postmenopausal groups. These findings provide strong evidence that sleep qualities are more favorable in highly active women relative to less active women.

TI  - Prehospital methods applied in migraine attack Prehospital migraine attack
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND ANALYTICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Aim: In this study, we aimed to detect the pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods used by the migraine patients before applying to the emergency department, and the factors triggering the migraine attack. Material and Method: Patients accepted to the emergency department due to a migraine headache were included in the study. Patients who had repetitive applications and those who did not approve participating in the study were excluded from the study. Their demographic features, possible triggering factors and what they do to eliminate a headache before applying to the emergency department were recorded. Results: The average ages of male and female patients were 33.7 +/- 10,6; 71,4% (n=200) of the patients were female. The menstruation was detected as one of the primary triggering factors in 28% (n=56) of the female patients. The other triggering factors for all patients were stress (83,6%), sleeplessness (72,1%), starvation (55,7%), malodor (44,3%), gurgling (25,4%), nutrient (20%), more light (19,3%), extreme cold weather (18,6%), fatigue (13,9%), extreme hot weather (10%), and smoking (7,5%). The methods that the patients used for a headache relief before applying to the emergency department were following: drugs intake (62,9%), nutrients intake (47,1%), massage (45%), exercises (34,3%), trying to sleep (32,1%), going out for fresh air (25,4%), and taking a shower (21,8%). Discussion: Although the ordinary analgesia or non-pharmacological methods are used by many patients when a migraine attack happens, the headaches do not sufficiently relieve and they apply to the emergency departments.

TI  - Effects of perimenopausal transdermal estradiol on self-reported sleep, independent of its effect on vasomotor symptom bother and depressive symptoms
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of transdermal estradiol (E-2) plus intermittent progesterone (EPT) for improving self-reported sleep in perimenopausal women, after controlling for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) bother and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 172 healthy women meeting STRAW+10 criteria for being in the menopausal transition or early postmenopause were randomized to 12 months of transdermal E-2 (0.1 mg/d) + 200 mg progesterone (12 d every 3 mo) or placebo. Using standard questionnaires, self-reported sleep, depression, and VMS bother were obtained at baseline and bimonthly postrandomization.
   Results: Controlling for baseline levels, EPT (vs placebo) led to reductions in minutes to fall asleep (estimate = -0.12, P = 0.002) and number of awakenings (estimate = -0.24, P = 0.04) over the 12 months. Controlling for changes in VMS bother and depressive symptoms, EPT still predicted reductions in minutes to fall asleep (estimate = -0.28, P = 0.02) and number of awakenings (estimate = -0.11, P = 0.02) over the 12 months.
   Conclusions: We extend existing research by demonstrating that hormone therapy (HT) in subjective sleep cannot be fully explained by improvements in VMS bother or depressive symptoms. Research to examine the mechanism(s) underlying HT's effects on sleep would have public health significance for perimenopausal women and also advance our general understanding of the pathophysiology of impaired sleep.

TI  - Changes in heart rate and blood pressure during nocturnal hot flashes associated with and without awakenings
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Hot flashes (HFs) are a hallmark of menopause in midlife women. They are beyond bothersome symptoms, having a profound impact on quality of life and wellbeing, and are a potential marker of cardiovascular (CV) disease risk. Here, we investigated the impact on CV functioning of single nocturnal HFs, considering whether or not they were accompanied by arousals or awakenings. We investigated changes in heart rate (HR, 542 HFs), blood pressure (BP, 261 HFs), and pre-ejection period (PEP, 168 HFs) across individual nocturnal physiological HF events in women in the menopausal transition or post-menopause (age: 50.7 +/- 3.6 years) (n = 86 for HR, 45 for BP, 27 for PEP). HFs associated with arousals/awakenings (51.1%), were accompanied by an increase in systolic (SBP; similar to 6 mmHg) and diastolic (DBP; similar to 5 mmHg) BP and HR (similar to 20% increase), sustained for several minutes. In contrast, HFs occurring in undisturbed sleep (28.6%) were accompanied by a drop in SBP and a marginal increase in HR, likely components of the heat dissipation response. All HFs were accompanied by decreased PEP, suggesting increased cardiac sympathetic activity, with a prolonged increase for HFs associated with sleep disruption. Older age predicted greater likelihood of HF-related sleep disturbance. HFs were less likely to wake a woman in rapid-eye-movement and slow-wave sleep. Findings show that HFs associated with sleep disruption, which are in the majority and more likely in older women, lead to increases in HR and BP, which could have long-term impact on nocturnal CV restoration in women with multiple HFs.

TI  - Analysis of the long-term beneficial effects of menopausal hormone therapy on sleep quality and menopausal symptoms
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
AB  - A large number of menopausal women report sleep disturbances along with psychological, somatic and urogenital menopausal symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) in improving subjective sleep quality and the severity of menopausal symptoms. An institutional ethics committee approved this retrospective chart review of 342 women treated with MHT for menopausal symptoms. Standard 28-day MHT consisted of the oral administration of 2 mg estradiol daily for 14 days, followed by 2 mg estradiol and 10 mg dydrogesterone daily for the remaining 14 days. A subgroup of 14 participants with a family history of cancer and mammography scores of 3 and above, received only tibolone 2.5 mg daily. Perceived sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while the assessment of menopausal symptoms was performed using the Kupperman Menopause Index (KMI) and menopause rating scale (MRS). Of the 342 patients, 79 were followed-up for 3 years. Compared to the baseline scores, the mean decrease in PSQI scores was 1.53 +/- 0.29 points (P<0.0001) at 1 month, 2.21 +/- 0.187 points (P<0.0001) at 2 months and 2.26 +/- 0.6 points (P<0.0001) after 3 years of MHT. The KMI scores also decreased by a mean of 6.37 +/- 1.59 points (P<0.0001) at 1 month and by 8.73 +/- 1.92 points after 3 years (P<0.0001). The MRS scores decreased by a mean of 3.56 +/- 1.05 points (P<0.0001) at 1 month and by 4.28 +/- 2.01 points (P<0.0001) after 3 years, as compared to the baseline scores. Patients receiving tibolone MHT did not report any improvement in sleep quality (P=0.956). On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that conventional MHT has a rapid and prolonged beneficial effect on self-reported sleep quality and menopausal symptoms in women. However, further clinical studies are warranted to compare the effects of different MHT regimens.

TI  - Estradiol treatment improves biological rhythms in a preclinical rat model of menopause
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB  - The perimenopausal transition at middle age is often associated with hot flashes and sleep disruptions, metabolic changes, and other symptoms. Whereas the mechanisms for these processes are incompletely understood, both aging (AG) and a loss of ovarian estrogens play contributing roles. Furthermore, the timing of when estradiol (E) treatment should commence and for how long are key clinical questions in the management of symptoms. Using a rat model of surgical menopause, we determined the effects of regimens of E treatment with differing time at onset and duration of treatment on diurnal rhythms of activity and core temperature and on food intake and body weight. Reproductively mature (MAT, similar to 4 months) or AG (similar to 11 months) female rats were ovariectomized, implanted intraperitoneally with a telemetry device, and given either a vehicle (V) or E subcutaneous capsule implantation. Rats were remotely recorded for 10 days per month for 3 (MAT) or 6 (AG) months. To ascertain whether delayed onset of treatment affected rhythms, a subset of AG-V rats had their capsules switched to Eat the end of 3 months. Another set of AG-E rats had their capsules removed at 3 months to determine whether beneficial effects of E would persist. Overall, activity and temperature mesor, robustness, and amplitude declined with AG. Compared to V treatment, E-treated rats showed (1) better maintenance of body weight and food intake; (2) higher, more consolidated activity and temperature rhythms; and (3) higher activity and temperature robustness and amplitude. In the AG arm of the study, switching treatment from V to E or E to V quickly reversed these patterns. Thus, the presence of E was the dominant factor in determining stability and amplitude of locomotor activity and temperature rhythms. As a whole, the results show benefits of E treatment, even with a delay, on biological rhythms and physiological functions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Singles of both sexes expedite reproduction: Shifts in sexual-timing strategies before and after the typical age of female menopause
T2  - EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - How do singles' strategies for engaging in sexual activity with a new partner vary across the adult lifespan? Using three large and independent demographically representative cross-sectional samples of heterosexual single adults in the U.S., we found that females approaching the typical age of menopause became less likely to establish relationship exclusivity prior to sexual activity with a new partner. However, after the typical age of menopausal onset, females returned to earlier levels of commitment choosiness. These changes in commitment choosiness surrounding the age of menopause were consistent across two studies (including a larger dataset combining two samples). Findings suggest that single females approaching menopause a major life history milestone alter their behavior to achieve reproductively relevant partnering goals but abandon this mating strategy once the typical reproductive period has ended. Males exhibited similar, though attenuated, changes in expected relationship commitment before sexual activity during midlife as well. Age-related changes in commitment corresponded with the amount of stress expressed regarding one's "biological clock". However, reduced commitment choosiness did not vary with frequency of sexual thoughts, frequency of sexual behaviors, or external pressures to find a romantic partner. Results are discussed in terms of life history theory and sex differences in sexuality.

TI  - Association of Daytime Napping and Diagnosed Diabetes in Middle-Aged Premenopausal, Middle-Aged Postmenopausal, and Older Postmenopausal Chinese Women
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION
AB  - Purpose: To examine associations of daytime napping and diagnosed diabetes in middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal Chinese women. Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional. Setting: 2015 cross-sectional data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Participants were recruited from 150 counties/districts and 450 villages/resident committees. Participants: Six thousand nine hundred and forty women aged 45 years and older (mean age = 61 years) stratified by age and menopausal status. Measures: The outcome was self-reported diagnosed diabetes. The exposure was self-reported daytime napping (0, >0-<= 60, or >60 min/d). Participants were stratified to middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal women according to their age (<= 60 or >60 years) and menopausal status. Analysis: One-way analysis of variance and chi(2) tests were conducted to explore differences on characteristics of middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal women. Multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for diagnosed diabetes according to daytime napping in the total sample, middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal Chinese women. Results: Participants' mean self-reported daytime napping duration was 34 minutes. Women who napped more than 60 minutes were more likely to report diagnosed diabetes (OR = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.76) comparing to those who did not nap, after adjusting for potential confounders. No statistical significance of interaction term between daytime napping and age/menopausal status was detected (P = .602 and P = .558) among total women. The stratified analysis revealed the significant association among middle-aged postmenopausal women napping more than 60 minutes (OR = 1.81, 95% CI, 1.18-2.77). The association, however, was found to be insignificant in middle-aged premenopausal women and older postmenopausal women. Conclusions: Long daytime nap (>60 min/d) was associated with diagnosed diabetes in middle-aged postmenopausal women in China.

TI  - Group cognitive behavioural therapy of physical and psychological menopausal symptoms of Chinese women, delivered via Internet and mobile phone versus face to face: A protocol for a randomized non-inferiority trial
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Background: Menopause syndrome generally includes psychological problems. Group treatment delivered via the Internet and mobile phone (imGT) may improve women's physiological and psychological conditions.
   Objective: To investigate the efficacy of group cognitive behavioural therapy of menopause-related mood swings and quality of life, delivered face to face or via the Internet and mobile phone.
   Methods: This protocol is for a randomized controlled clinical trial with a sample of 140 menopausal women divided into 2 groups: imGT and face-to-face group treatment (ffGT). The primary outcome will be the improvement in the menopausal symptoms of the two groups, as assessed by the Greene Climacteric Scale. The secondary outcomes will be: quality of life, assessed by the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire; insomnia, assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory; anxiety, assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; and therapeutic alliance, assessed by the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised and Client Satisfaction Qestionnaire-8. imGT will be performed once a week for 1.5 h for 10 weeks with a daily 'Punched-in' on the WeChat app; ffGT will be performed once a week for 1.5 h for 10 weeks. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at a post-intervention evaluation (week 10), and at a follow-up evaluation (week 22).
   Discussion: This study will be the first clinical trial to examine the effects of imGT on menopausal women in China. If imGT is found to be non-inferior to ffGT, it will facilitate access to menopausal health services.

TI  - Italian Association of Sleep Medicine (AIMS) position statement and guideline on the treatment of menopausal sleep disorders
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Insomnia, vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and depression often co-occur after the menopause, with consequent health problems and reductions in quality of life. The aim of this position statement is to provide evidence-based advice on the management of postmenopausal sleep disorders derived from a systematic review of the literature. The latter yielded results on VMS, insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless leg syndrome (RLS). Overall, the studies show that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) improves VMS, insomnia, and mood.
   Several antidepressants can improve insomnia, either on their own or in association with MHT; these include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and mirtazapine. Long-term benefits for postmenopausal insomnia may also be achieved with non-drug strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and aerobic exercise. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mandibular advancement devices (MADs) both reduce blood pressure and cortisol levels in postmenopausal women suffering from OSA. However, the data regarding MHT on postmenopausal restless legs syndrome are conflicting.

TI  - Chronic pelvic pain in women: an embedded qualitative study to evaluate the perceived benefits of the meridian balance method electro-acupuncture treatment, health consultation and National Health Service standard care
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PAIN
AB  - Introduction: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) - defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least 6months' duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy - is estimated to affect 6-27% of women worldwide. In the United Kingdom, over 1 million women suffer from CPP, which has been highlighted as a key area of unmet need. Current medical treatments for CPP are often associated with unacceptable side effects. A specific style of acupuncture, the meridian balance method electro-acupuncture (BMEA) and traditional Chinese medicine health consultation (TCM HC (BMEA+TCM HC=BMEA treatment)), may be effective for CPP in women.
   Aim: Three focus group discussions and semi-structured telephone interviews were embedded in a randomised controlled feasibility trial to gain in-depth description of the perceived benefits of the participants' respective interventions.
   Methods: Women with CPP were randomised into the BMEA treatment, TCM HC or National Health Service standard care (NHS SC). Focus group discussions were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted post focus group discussions.
   Findings: A total of 30 women were randomised into BMEA treatment, TCM HC or NHS SC. A total of 11 participants attended the three focus group discussions. Thematic analysis of focus group discussions showed: a perceived pain reduction, enhanced sleep, energy level and sense of well-being in the BMEA treatment and TCM HC groups; a dislike for the adverse effects of medications, frustration at the lack of effective treatment, heavy reliance on medications and services that are helpful, in the NHS SC group. Semi-structured telephone interviews showed that the methodology was acceptable to the participants.
   Conclusion: The embedded focus group discussions captured the rich and complex narratives of the participants and provided insights into the perceived benefits of the BMEA treatment, TCM HC and NHS SC interventions.

TI  - Succinate-Based Dietary Supplement for Menopausal Symptoms: A Pooled Analysis of Two Identical Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background. To evaluate the efficacy of a succinate-based dietary supplement (SBDS; Amberen) in symptomatic menopausal women using a larger sample size derived by pooling data from two identical trials. Methods. Raw data were pooled from two identical randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 90-day clinical trials. Women aged 42-60 years with mild to moderate vasomotor and psychosomatic menopausal symptoms were included (114 in the treatment group and 113 in the placebo group). Symptoms were assessed by the Greene Climacteric Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Changes in body mass index, body weight, waist and hip circumferences, and plasma levels of follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, leptin, and apolipoproteins A1 and B were also evaluated. Results. SBDS use resulted in significant improvements in several endpoints including alleviation of 16 of 21 menopausal symptoms (p <= 0.05, Greene Scale) and a decrease in anxiety (p<0.0001, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) when compared to placebo. Significant reductions were observed in weight, body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences in the supplement cohort. Evaluation of physiological parameters showed a significant increase in serum estradiol levels compared to baseline (p<0.0001) among users of the SBDS. Levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone decreased slightly in both groups, without significant differences between the groups. Leptin levels decreased with statistical significance in the SBDS cohort compared to placebo (p=0.027). For those with initial leptin concentrations above the reference range, leptin decreased significantly in the SBDS group compared to the baseline (p<0.0001) and to placebo (p=0.027). Conclusions. The pooled analysis reaffirms the outcomes from the individual trials. A nonhormonal, succinate-based dietary supplement is shown to relieve menopausal symptoms when compared to a placebo regimen in a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial.

TI  - Reference Gene Optimization for Circadian Gene Expression Analysis in Human Adipose Tissue
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS
AB  - A hallmark of biology is the cyclical nature of organismal physiology driven by networks of biological, including circadian, rhythms. Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13 alpha, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13 alpha, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems.

TI  - Gender differences in clinical manifestations and polysomnographic findings in Chinese patients with obstructive sleep apnea
T2  - SLEEP AND BREATHING
AB  - Purpose The gender differences in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are not fully understood so far, as previous studies had conflicting results. No reports have addressed the differences in OSA between Chinese men and women. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and polysomnographic differences between Chinese men and women with OSA. Methods This case-paired control retrospective study included 580 consecutive Chinese patients (290 males and 290 females) newly diagnosed as OSA by overnight polysomnography from the Sleep Disorders Center of Tangdu Hospital affiliated to the Fourth Military Medical University of China. Demographic, clinical, and polysomnographic data of men and women with OSA were compared. Order logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for OSA severity. Results Male and female patients had similar age (57.3 +/- 9.2 vs. 58.2 +/- 8.9, p > 0.05) and body mass index (BMI) (25.4 +/- 3.4 vs. 25.5 +/- 3.9, p > 0.05). Women more commonly presented with insomnia (70.3% vs. 40.3%, p < 0.001), poor sleep quality (58.3% vs. 40.7%, p < 0.001), and headache on awakening (23.1% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.01) than men, while men more frequently reported habitual snoring (69.0% vs. 52.1%, p < 0.001) compared with women. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement sleep was higher in men compared with women (25.8 +/- 20.4 vs. 19.3 +/- 16.8; 22.0 +/- 18.2 vs. 15.1 +/- 15.4; p < 0.001, respectively), whereas AHI during rapid eye movement sleep was higher in women than in men (4.2 +/- 3.6 vs. 3.7 +/- 4.3, p < 0.01). Compared with men, women had lower sleep efficiency (75.4 +/- 15.7 vs. 78.1 +/- 15.5, p < 0.05), longer REM latency (128.9 +/- 88.6 vs. 107.7 +/- 72.4, p < 0.01), and greater wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) (98.3 +/- 70.2 vs. 88.0 +/- 70.3, p < 0.05). No significant differences in the lowest oxygen desaturation and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) were observed between men and women (80.4 +/- 10.8 vs. 80.8 +/- 9.0; 17.0 +/- 20.9 vs. 13.1 +/- 16.5; p > 0.05, respectively). In addition, ordinal logistic regression analysis identified neck circumference as an independent risk factor for OSA severity in male patients (OR, 1.161; 95% CI, 1.020-1.325; p < 0.05) and in female patients (OR, 1.163; 95% CI, 1.013-1.338; p < 0.05). Conclusions Overall, female patients had less severe OSA when compared with male patients. The female patients more commonly reported "atypical" OSA symptoms, while male patients more frequently reported "typical" OSA symptoms. In clinical practices, physicians dealing with OSA need to take the gender disparity into consideration for more precise diagnosis and treatment, as women may be atypically symptomatic at a less severe OSA.

TI  - The Effects of Transgender Hormone Therapy on Sleep and Breathing: A Case Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - The effect of hormone therapy on sleep-disordered breathing in transgender patients has not been described. We present three cases of patients undergoing gender reassignment and treated with hormone replacement. The first case was a transgender woman (assigned male at birth) with a prolonged history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that resolved following initiation of female sex hormones. The second and third cases both address transgender males (assigned female at birth) in whom OSA developed following initiation of male sex hormones (with pretreatment polysomnography documenting absence of OSA). The growing interest in transgender health warrants further evaluation of the effects of related therapies on sleep and sleep-disordered breathing.

TI  - Fibromyalgia, sleep disturbance and menopause: Is there a relationship? A literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RHEUMATIC DISEASES
AB  - Introduction Fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms worsen in a significant portion of patients with the onset of menopause. Some patients report that their symptoms begin after menopause, suggesting a relationship between these entities. Sleep disturbance is a common condition in FM and menopause, and it is associated with chronic pain. Methods/Objectives Several electronic databases were searched, from the first available year to April 2018 to evaluate the publications that assessed the effects of menopause and sleep disturbance on the appearance or worsening of FM and the role of hormone therapy for these patients. Results The results are summarized in three tables. The objective sleep patterns of FM patients included high sleep latency, frequent arousals and intrusion of alpha wave sleep and NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep in delta sleep. Poor sleep during menopause is more frequent in late perimenopause and surgical menopause, and may be related to vasomotor symptoms or not. Hormone therapy exerted a positive effect on subjective sleep quality of symptomatic menopausal women. Studies have shown a high association between FM and early and surgical menopause. Raloxifene exerted a positive effect on pain and sleep in FM patients; however one study that analyzed the effects of transdermal estrogen therapy found no improvement in subjective and objective parameters of pain. Conclusion Further studies are needed to elucidate the nature of the association between menopause, sleep and persistent pain syndromes, such as FM, showing the role of hormone therapy in prospective placebo-controlled trials.

TI  - Evaluation of clinical manifestations, health risks, and quality of life among women with polycystic ovary syndrome
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the clinical manifestations and health risks associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its impact on quality of life (QOL) in Pakistan. A detailed cross-sectional study was conducted on PCOS among women of reproductive age visiting the gynecology and obstetrics and endocrinology departments at primary and tertiary care hospitals located in Abbottabad, Kohat, and Islamabad. In total, 440 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were included. A checklist was specifically designed to identify symptoms and health risks, including adverse drug reactions, complications, irrational prescription or underprescription, and drug-drug interactions. The Short Form-12 questionnaire was used to evaluate the QOL of patients with PCOS. Data collected were analyzed for descriptive and inferential statistics using chi-square test, analysis of variance, and post hoc analysis. All patients exhibited the cardinal symptoms of PCOS, including obesity (n = 352, 80%), acne (n = 296, 67.3), hirsutism (n = 299, 68%), hyperglycemia (n = 278, 63.2%), and irregular menstruation (n = 316, 71.8%). Ultrasonography confirmed that 268 (61%) patients had multiple cysts of >10 mm in diameter. Patients with untreated PCOS exhibited a high prevalence of health risks including hypertension (n = 87, 19.8%), diabetes (n = 268, 60.9%), sleep apnea (n = 11, 2.5%), infertility (n = 146, 33.2%), increased endometrial thickness (n = 21, 4.8%), miscarriages (n = 68, 15.5%), high cholesterol level (n = 85, 19.3%), and hyperandrogenism (n = 342, 77.7%). Most patients exhibited low QOL scores (n = 374, 85%), with depression being the largest contributor to low QOL. Apart from novel results, this study found an association between depression and low QOL in patients with PCOS, suggesting the need for reviewing the management guidelines and psychological health assessment of women with PCOS.

TI  - The Concept of Growth Hormone Deficiency Affecting Clinical Prognosis in IVF
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - The current understanding of human growth hormone (hGH; here GH) action is that the molecule is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized, stored and secreted by the somatotroph cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland. It can be classified as a protein (comprising more than 50 amino acids) but true proteins have tertiary and quaternary chains creating a more complex structure, hence GH is usually classified as a polypeptide. GH is normally secreted at night during sleep and promotes skeletal, visceral and general body growth through the action of somatomedins or IGFs, notably IGF-1. In some tissues, GH action is directed via specific receptors GHRs; these are most abundant in liver, adipose and muscle tissues but have also been shown in granulosa cells, testicular tissues and on the oocyte, as well as in glandular cells of the luteal phase endometrium and decidua; such findings being recent and minimally researched to now. Following engagement with its receptor, the transduction process activates multiple signaling proteins. These all lead to extensive metabolic and mitogenic (growth promoting) responses. Clinically, GH is known to have an important role in pubertal development and is a key hormone for the vigor associated with adolescence and early adult life stages but has a faded presence and role for later adulthood, beyond age 30 years, and is minimally detected in advanced age, beyond 40 years. In association with the rapidly increasing trend for delaying reproduction beyond age 35 years, GH is being widely researched now as a potential adjuvant for infertility treatment in this group who, studies consistently show, have a poorer prognosis than younger females when relying on autologous oocytes. The idea that the age-related reduction in fertility prognosis is a feature of growth hormone deficiency is supported by our studies showing an elevated binding protein IGFBP-3/IGF-1 ratio and this can be reduced to a normal range (matching younger, good prognosis women) by the administration of GH as an adjuvant.

TI  - Prevalence and Determinants of Somatization and Anxiety among Adult Women in an Urban Population in Kerala
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Common mental disorders (CMDs) such as somatization and anxiety are prevalent in general practice. These are twice more common in women. Objectives: The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence and determinants of somatization and anxiety among adult women in an urban population of Kochi. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1210 adult women of Kochi in 2016-2017. The Patient Health Questionnaire-15; the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire; the Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Scream tool; and a semi-structured questionnaire were used to estimate the prevalence of somatization and anxiety. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate analysis were done for factors associated with CMDs. Results: Most of the respondents were married (77.7%), with a mean age of 45.24 +/- 15.59. In the current study, 40.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] =38.09-43.62) had somatization and 23.9% (95% CI = 21.57-26.37) had anxiety disorders. In the final logistic regression model, hypertension, perception of illness, positive family history of mental illness, and arthritis were the four determinants common to somatization and anxiety. Menstrual problems (odds ratio [OR] =3.19; 95% CI = 1.12-5.9), cardiac illness (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.08-4.9), and history of major surgeries (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.14-2.41) were independent determinants of somatization. The status of being single (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.25-2.32), adverse life circumstances (OR = 5.85; 95% CI = 3.98-8.6), diabetes (OR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.25-3.34), sleep problems (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.77-2.91), and history of drug use (OR = 4.89; 95% CI = 1.92-12.46) were independent determinants of anxiety. Conclusion: Mental health services for urban women deserve immediate attention as the prevalence of somatization and anxiety is high. Hence, it is important to screen for somatization and anxiety among women with noncommunicable diseases.

TI  - Weight Loss in Women Taking Flibanserin for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD): Insights Into Potential Mechanisms
T2  - SEXUAL MEDICINE REVIEWS
AB  - Introduction: Flibanserin, a multifunctional serotonin receptor agonist and antagonist, is currently approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. A post hoc analysis of HSDD clinical trial data found that flibanserin treatment was associated with statistically significant weight loss relative to placebo, even though study patients were not selected for being overweight/obese and were provided no expectation for weight reduction or interventions intended to promote weight loss.
   Aim: To understand possible mechanisms by which flibanserin may produce weight loss.
   Methods: A literature review was performed using Medline database for relevant publications on the mechanisms of action by which flibanserin may provide weight loss and the links between sexual function and weight management.
   Main Outcome Measures: Examination of (i) biopsychosocial factors regulating sexual desire, food intake, and weight regulation; (ii) clinical pharmacology of flibanserin; (iii) neurobiology of brain reward circuitry; and (iv) identification of possible mechanisms common to flibanserin and weight loss.
   Results: Based on flibanserin clinical trial data, there was no consistent correlation between weight loss and improvement in sexual function, as assessed by HSDD outcome measures. Nausea, a common adverse event associated with flibanserin use, also did not appear to be a contributing factor to weight loss. Hypothetical links between flibanserin treatment and weight loss include modulation of peripheral 5-HT2A receptors and factors such as improved mood and improved sleep.
   Conclusion: Mechanisms of flibanserin-induced weight loss have not been well characterized but may involve indirect beneficial effects on peripheral 5-HT2A receptors and central regulation of mood and sleep. Future research may better elucidate the links between sexual function and weight management and the mechanism(s) by which flibanserin use may result in weight loss.

TI  - Childhood abuse and vasomotor symptoms among midlife women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Childhood maltreatment is related to adverse health outcomes. However, the relation of childhood maltreatment to the menopause transition-a universal transition for women often accompanied by troubling symptoms such as vasomotor symptoms-is relatively underexplored. This study tested whether childhood abuse and neglect are associated with menopausal vasomotor symptoms, utilizing both physiologic and prospective self-report measures of vasomotor symptoms. Methods: In all, 295 nonsmoking perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years with and without vasomotor symptoms completed psychosocial measures, including the Child Trauma Questionnaire, ambulatory physiologic (sternal skin conductance) and self-report measurement of vasomotor symptoms during wake and sleep, and actigraphy measurement of sleep. Relationships between childhood abuse/neglect and vasomotor symptoms during wake and sleep were tested in linear regression models controlling for demographics, body mass index, and menopause stage. Results: 44% of the sample reported abuse or neglect during childhood. Among women reporting vasomotor symptoms, childhood sexual or physical abuse was associated with more frequent physiologically-recorded vasomotor symptoms during sleep (sexual abuse: b [SE] = 1.45 [0.52], P = 0.006; physical abuse: b [SE] = 0.97 [0.47], P = 0.03) in multivariable models. Among these women, women with a physical or sexual abuse history had approximately 1.5 to 2-fold the number of sleep vasomotor symptoms than women without this history. Conclusions: Childhood abuse is associated with more frequent physiologically-detected vasomotor symptoms during sleep.

TI  - The MATE survey: men's perceptions and attitudes towards menopause and their role in partners' menopausal transition
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The perceptions and attitudes of menopause shared by men are largely unknown. This analysis characterized men's awareness and their understanding of their partner's menopausal transition. Methods: A 35-question, online survey was used to assess men's perceptions and attitudes toward menopause. Men were recruited from an online research marketplace and were eligible to participate if their female partners (45-64 years old) experienced >= 1 of the following symptoms: hot flashes, night sweats, sleepless nights, difficulty sleeping, low libido, mood swings, pain during sex, or vaginal dryness. Couples either lived together full time, or, if living separately, resided together regularly two or more times a week. Results: Of the 1,356 surveys sent to eligible men, 450 (33%) were completed. Most men were between 50 and 69 years (80%), married and not separated (90%), and lived with their partner full time (97%). Men were aware of the symptoms regularly experienced by their partner, with difficulty sleeping (54%) and lack of energy (49%) being frequently identified; these symptoms were attributed to menopause (26%) and/or aging (22%). Of those who were affected by symptoms (63%), most men reported they negatively impacted them (77%), their partners (70%), and relationships (56%). Men engaged in discussions with their partners regarding menopausal symptoms (72%) and believed they were somewhat/very influential (75%) in their partner's decision to seek treatment or make lifestyle adjustments. Conclusions: Overall, men are aware of their partner's menopausal transition and may influence decisions relating to symptom management. Educational interventions would further benefit men's awareness of menopause and available treatment options. Video Summary:.

TI  - Sleep quality and fatigue in women with premature ovarian insufficiency receiving hormone therapy: a comparative study
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To compare sleep quality and fatigue between women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) receiving hormone therapy (HT) and women of the same age with preserved ovarian function. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 61 women with POI receiving HT (POI group) and 61 women with preserved ovarian function (control group) who were matched by age (+/- 2 years). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Chalder Fatigue Scale were used to assess sleep quality and fatigue. Apart from correlation analysis, the Mann-Whitney, chi-square, or Fisher test was used to compare the groups. Results: Women from the POI and control groups were 35.03 +/- 7.68 and 34.49 +/- 7.55 years of age, respectively (P = 0.63). In the PSQI evaluation, the scores were 7.69 +/- 4.18 and 8.03 +/- 4.53, respectively (P = 0.79), showing no difference between the POI and control groups. However, the POI group had higher and therefore worse scores for the sleep latency component (1.74 +/- 0.66 and 1.18 +/- 0.87, respectively; P < 0.001) and use of medication to sleep (1.28 +/- 0.88 and 0. 85 +/- 0.8; P = 0.008). The POI group had a higher fatigue index than that of the control group (5.25 +/- 2.78 and 3.49 +/- 1.78, respectively; P < 0.001), with sleep quality being classified as poor in 69% and fatigue present in 59% of patients. Conclusions: Women with POI receiving HT have poor sleep quality. They take longer to fall asleep and have a higher fatigue index.

TI  - Doctor, ask your perimenopausal patient about her physical fitness; association of self-reported physical fitness with cardiometabolic and mental health in perimenopausal women: the FLAMENCO project
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the association of self-reported physical fitness (PF) and its components with cardiometabolic and mental health in perimenopausal women. Methods: These cross-sectional analyses included 191 participants (53 +/- 4 y old) from the FLAMENCO project. Self-reported PF was assessed with the International Fitness Scale (IFIS). Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), waist circumference (WC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), and glucose were measured. The Beck's Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Life Orientation Test Revised, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule were used to assess mental health. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, greater overall PF was associated with lower BMI, FM, WC (P < 0.001), DBP and CRP, and higher HDL-C (P < 0.05). Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), speed-agility, and flexibility were associated with lower BMI, WC, and FM (P < 0.001), and muscle strength (MS) with lower WC and FM (P < 0.05). In addition, CRF, MS, and speed-agility were associated with lower CRP (P < 0.01), and flexibility with enhanced triglycerides and HDL-C (P < 0.05). Overall PF and all its components were associated with lower depression, anxiety, and negative affect (P <= 0.01), and greater positive affect (P <= 0.05). Overall PF and MS were associated with better sleep quality (P < 0.05), and CRF, MS, and speed-agility with greater optimism (P <= 0.05). Finally, overall PF showed evidence of significant association with less pharmaceutical expenditure (B = -7.2, beta=-0.145, P = 0.08). Conclusions: Self-reported PF was associated with better cardiometabolic and mental health in perimenopausal women. The IFIS might be proposed as an inexpensive, quick, and easy tool in clinical settings.

TI  - Sleep-related symptoms of midlife women with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and sleep-related symptoms among midlife women from four major racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Methods: The data from 164 participants of two larger Internet survey studies (62 women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 102 women without diabetes) were included. In the original studies, multiple instruments including the questions on background characteristics, health status, and menopause status and the Sleep Index for Midlife Women were used. The data were analyzed using chi(2) tests, independent t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Results: The mean total number of sleep-related symptoms was significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes (9.95 +/- 5.83) than those without diabetes (7.25 +/- 6.08) (t = 2.81, P = 0.006). The mean total severity score of sleep-related symptoms was also significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes (33.42 +/- 22.41) than those without diabetes (21.87 +/- 21.40) (t = 3.29, P = 0.001). Among postmenopausal women and Asian women, there were significant differences in total numbers and total severity scores between those with type 2 diabetes and those without diabetes (all P < 0.05). When background characteristics, health status, and menopause status were controlled, having a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was positively associated with total numbers (beta=0.143, P = 0.047) and total severity scores (beta=0.176, P = 0.014) of sleep-related symptoms. Conclusions: This secondary analysis supported significant associations of type 2 diabetes to sleep-related symptoms of midlife women from four major racial/ethnic groups in the United States.

TI  - The menopause transition and women's health at midlife: a progress report from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Our initial understanding of the menopause transition (MT) has been framed by clinical samples of women seeking treatment rather than by population-based studies. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) initiated in 1996 with an overall goal to define the MT, to characterize its biological and psychosocial antecedents and sequelae in an ethnically and racially diverse sample of midlife women. Methods: This review summarizes the central findings of SWAN to date that can inform women and their healthcare providers about the impact of the MT and midlife aging on overall health and well-being. Results: SWAN characterized changes in reproductive axis and menstrual cycle patterns that informed the development of the reproductive aging staging system Staging of Reproductive Aging Workshop+10; MT-related symptoms and mental health (vasomotor symptoms, sleep complaints, psychological symptoms, cognitive performance, and urogenital and sexual health); and physiological systems and functions (cardiovascular and cardiometabolic health, bone health, physical function performance) that are influenced by the MT. SWAN demonstrated substantial interrelations among these changes and significant racial/ethnic differences in the rate and magnitude of change in multiple health indictors in midlife women. The findings point to midlife as a critical stage for adopting healthy behavior and preventive strategies. Conclusions: Over the past 23 years, SWAN has advanced our understanding of the impact of the MT and midlife aging on health and well-being in women. SWAN will be instrumental to determine whether MT-related changes during midlife are related to unfavorable health and well-being in early old age.

TI  - Cognition, Mood and Sleep in Menopausal Transition: The Role of Menopause Hormone Therapy
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - During the menopausal transition, which begins four to six years before cessation of menses, middle-aged women experience a progressive change in ovarian activity and a physiologic deterioration of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function associated with fluctuating hormone levels. During this transition, women can suffer symptoms related to menopause (such as hot flushes, sleep disturbance, mood changes, memory complaints and vaginal dryness). Neurological symptoms such as sleep disturbance, "brain fog" and mood changes are a major complaint of women transitioning menopause, with a significant impact on their quality of life, productivity and physical health. In this paper, we consider the associations between menopausal stage and/or hormone levels and sleep problems, mood and reduced cognitive performance. The role of estrogen and menopause hormone therapy (MHT) in cognitive function, sleep and mood are also discussed.

TI  - Effects of aromatherapy on stress, fructosamine, fatigue, and sleep quality in prediabetic middle-aged women: A randomised controlled trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Although there has been an overall increase in life expectancy, the rise in chronic diseases poses a threat to healthy life expectancy. In particular, individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes, stress, fatigue, postmenopausal accumulation of abdominal fat, insulin resistance, and insomnia are likely to have a poorer quality of life. This study aimed to investigate whether aromatherapy (inhalation and massage) could affect levels of stress, blood glucose, fatigue, and sleep quality in middle-aged prediabetic women.
   Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial. In this study, prediabetic middle-aged women, aged 40-65-years old, with a fasting blood glucose or HbA1c level of 100 mg/dL-126 mg/dL or 5.5-6.4%, respectively, were included. The experimental treatment consisted of direct inhalation of aroma essential oil and self-massage with 3% massage oil for two weeks, as prescribed by an international aromatherapist. To determine the effects of treatment, subjective stress, objective stress index, fructosamine, fatigue, and sleep quality were measured. Differences in stress response, sleep quality, and fatigue over time and between the two groups were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA and Student's t-tests.
   Results: Subjective stress did not significantly differ between the two groups after one week but became significantly different after two weeks (t= -3.78, p = .001). After the treatment, there were significant changes in fructosamine (t= -3.53, p = .001), fatigue (t= -4.12, p = .001), and sleep quality (t = 6.27, p < .001).
   Conclusion: The study suggests that aroma inhalation and self-abdominal massage may help manage blood sugar, fatigue and improve sleep quality in pre-diabetic women.

A1  - Study Osteoporotic Fractures SOF
TI  - Association between objective sleep duration and bone mineral density in older postmenopausal women from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF)
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The Summary Methodological limitations preclude determination of the association between sleep duration and bone mineral density (BMD) from existing literature. This was the first study to use objective sleep duration to determine its association with BMD. Nocturnal sleep duration, assessed objectively (actigraphy) or subjectively (questionnaire), was not independently associated with BMD in postmenopausal women.IntroductionBoth long and short self-reported sleep durations are associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) in men and women. The association between sleep duration measured by actigraphy and BMD in postmenopausal women is unknown.MethodsThe Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) ancillary sleep study was used to determine the association between sleep duration and BMD at the total hip and femoral neck in postmenopausal women >= 75 years old. Sleep duration was assessed by wrist actigraphy (average 4 nights) and questionnaire. BMD was compared between postmenopausal women with short (<6 h/night) vs. NIH-recommended (7-8 h/night) sleep durations. Data were analyzed using a 2-sample t test (unadjusted) and multivariate regression model (adjusted). Simple linear regression was used to estimate the difference in BMD per additional hour of sleep when sleep duration was considered as a continuous, rather than dichotomized, variable.ResultsTotal hip BMD was higher in women with actigraphically assessed shorter sleep duration in unadjusted models only. No clinically or statistically significant differences in total hip or femoral neck BMD were observed according to nocturnal sleep duration after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) in dichotomized (N=874) or continuous (N=1624) sleep duration models or when subjective sleep duration was used. When sleep duration included daytime naps, longer sleep duration was associated with lower total hip BMD (beta=-0.005, p=0.04).ConclusionsNocturnal sleep duration, whether assessed objectively (actigraphy) or subjectively (questionnaire), was not independently associated with BMD in older postmenopausal women.

TI  - Association of sleep characteristics with cardiovascular health among women and differences by race/ethnicity and menopausal status: findings from the American Heart Association Go Red for Women Strategically Focused Research Network
T2  - SLEEP HEALTH
AB  - Background and Objective: Sleep is an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is not currently included as a cardiovascular health (CVH) metric in the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (AHA LS7). Our objective was to evaluate the association of sleep with CVH in women and examine differences by menopausal status and race/ethnicity.
   Methods: Baseline data from the Columbia University AHA Go Red for Women Strategically Focused Research Network were examined. Sleep habits were self-reported using validated questionnaires. A CVH score was computed using AHA LS7 criteria for smoking, diet, physical activity, BMI, blood pressure(BP), total cholesterol, and fasting glucose. Women received a score of 2 (ideal), 1 (intermediate), or 0 (poor) based on their level of meeting each AHA LS7 metric. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to evaluate associations of sleep with meeting overall and individual CVH metrics.
   Results: The analytical sample consisted of n = 507 women (62% minority/Hispanic, mean age:37 y). Participants with adequate sleep duration (>= 7 h), good sleep quality, no insomnia nor snoring, and low risk for OSA were more likely to meet >4 of the AHA LS7 metrics (P < .01). Poorer sleep quality (beta = -0.08, P = .002), higher insomnia severity (beta = -0.05, P = .002), snoring (beta = -0.77, P = .0001), and higher risk for OSA (beta = -1.63, P < .0001) were associated with poorer CVH. Insomnia, snoring, and high OSA risk were associated with 69% to >300% higher odds of having poor CVH (P <= .03). Associations were stronger in postmenopausal and racial/ethnic minority women.
   Conclusions: Better sleep habits were associated with more favorable CVH among women, suggesting that there may be benefit in incorporating sleep assessment into CVD risk screening. (C) 2019 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Health Care Professionals' Perceptions about Sensory-Based Interventions in the NICU
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objective The main objective of this article is to define perceptions of health care professionals regarding current use of sensory-based interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Study Design A multidisciplinary group of NICU health care professionals ( n = 108) defined the types of sensory-based interventions used in their NICU, the postmenstrual age (PMA) sensory-based interventions are administered, conditions under which sensory-based interventions are used, and personnel who administer sensory-based interventions. Results The most commonly reported tactile intervention was infant holding (88% of respondents), the most common auditory intervention was recorded music/singing (69% of respondents), the most common kinesthetic intervention was occupational and physical therapy (85% of respondents), and the most common vestibular intervention was infant swings (86% of respondents). Tactile interventions were initiated most often at 24 to 26 weeks PMA (74% of respondents), auditory interventions at 30 to 32 weeks (60% of respondents), kinesthetic interventions at 30 to 32 weeks (76% of respondents), vestibular interventions at 33 to 34 weeks (86% of respondents), and visual interventions at 32 to 36 weeks (72% of respondents). Conditions under which sensory-based interventions were administered, and personnel who provided them, varied across settings. Conclusion Varied use of sensory-based interventions in the NICU were reported. While this study was limited by biased sampling and the identification of health care professionals' perceptions but not real-world practice, this information can be used to build a comprehensive approach to positive sensory exposures in the NICU.

TI  - Autonomic signatures of late preterm, early term, and full term neonates during early postnatal life
T2  - EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Background: Late preterm and early term births account for similar to 25% of live births. Infants born prior to term are at significantly higher risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality.
   Aims: Determine autonomic regulation differences in infants (35-40 weeks gestation) during sleep at birth and one-month after delivery.
   Study design: Consecutive enrollment until at least 20 infants per group: 75 late preterm (35-36 weeks gestation), 110 early term (37-38 weeks), and 130 full term (39-40 weeks). Assess autonomic parameters 12-84 h after delivery and again at one month of life.
   Subjects: 329 newborns met inclusion criteria. Exclusions: maternal age < 18 years, major maternal medical problems, psychiatric medications, drug use, Apgar < 8 at 5 min, medical complications requiring other than standard care, non-English or non-Spanish speaking.
   Outcome measures: Heart rate and two measures of heart rate variability in active and quiet sleep at birth and at one month of life.
   Results: Late preterm and early term newborns demonstrate immature patterns of autonomic regulation at birth. Heart rate decreased with gestational age in both sleep states whereas the standard deviation of R-R intervals and beat-to-beat variability in heart rate both increased with gestational age in both sleep states. One month after delivery, i.e. at term-equivalent age, late preterm infants continued to have higher heart rates than infants born full term; and their heart rate was also significantly higher when compared to that of full term newborns at birth, i.e. their autonomic signature did not "normalize" over the first four weeks of life. Early term infants, however, did not differ from full term infants when they reached a postmenstrual age of 44 weeks.
   Conclusion: The specific patterns of immature autonomic regulation in late preterm and early term infants during early postnatal life may underlie their increased morbidity and mortality in infancy and later in development. Future studies should address how early autonomic measures might relate to adverse outcomes. Results suggest the need for autonomic nomograms at birth and at one month after delivery that are stratified by both gestational week and sleep state.

TI  - An integrated approach to diagnosing and managing sleep disorders in menopausal women
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Sleep disorders increase in prevalence during the menopausal transition and they constitute a complex phenomenon. Insomnia, the main sleep disorder, can be a primary disorder or it can be secondary to hot flushes (HF), mood disorders, psychosocial factors, medical conditions, and other sleep disturbances, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or restless legs syndrome (RLS). Menopausal women complaining of persistent sleep disorders should be referred to a sleep specialist for comprehensive sleep management because unrecognized and untreated sleep disorders can have dramatic health-related consequences. Women suffering from insomnia related to vasomotor symptoms (VMS) can be treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Primary insomnia will be preferentially improved with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-I) or with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics or melatonin. CBT-I is a highly efficacious treatment for postmenopausal women with insomnia. Using antidepressants to treat sleep disruption in the absence of depression is not recommended; instead, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved paroxetine as the first non-hormonal treatment for HF. Sleep disorders in menopausal women should not be underestimated. It is necessary to diagnose the specific causal disorder and then to provide treatment to improve sleep quality and quality of life.

TI  - Chronotype, social jetlag and sleep loss in relation to sex steroids
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Chronotype describes preferences for functioning at different times of the day. At the onset of puberty, a sharp shift towards eveningness starts, reaching its peak at the end of adolescence, followed by a steady shift towards morningness as the ageing process occurs. Puberty is also the time when sex differences appear, with men being more inclined to eveningness than women, which diminishes around menopause; the described pattern of changes in chronotype leads to the hypothesis that reproductive hormones may be the driving factor behind this conversion. In the present study, we aimed to verify this hypothesis by analysing participants' testosterone, progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels in the three months, as indicated by assays in 3-cm hair strands from the scalp. Participants (n = 239) of both sexes also completed the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. The results showed that in men higher testosterone levels were related to eveningness and less sleep loss, whereas greater sleep loss was associated with lower levels of DHEA. In women, no associations between chronotype and levels of the analysed hormones were found. The results support the hypothesis that testosterone levels play a role in shaping eveningness. We further hypothesised that a possible cause of the higher secretion level of testosterone in men with the evening chronotype is a mechanism to offset the negative consequences of sleep loss.

TI  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 and Glucagon-like peptide 2 in relation to osteoporosis in non-diabetic postmenopausal women
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Osteoporosis results from an imbalance in bone remodeling, which is known to follow a circadian rhythm determined by a functional relationship between intestine and bone tissue. Specific intestinal peptides have been identified as mediators. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucagon-like peptide 2, have been associated with bone health. Our main objective was to determine whether postprandial plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon-like peptide 2 and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 activity, are associated with osteoporosis in non-diabetic postmenopausal women. We studied non-diabetic postmenopausal women with osteoporosis diagnosed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cases, n = 43) and age-matched (+/- 1 yr) controls without osteoporosis or a history of osteoporotic fracture (n = 43).We measured postprandial plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon-like peptide 2, and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 activity, bone mineral density, and baseline levels of bone remodeling markers and analyzed the food intake using a food-frequency questionnaire. Postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 values were lower (p < 0.001) in cases, mu (SEM) = 116.25 (2.68), than in controls, mu (SEM) = 126.79 (2.68). Glucagon-like peptide 1 was associated with reduced osteoporosis risk in the crude logistic regression analysis [OR (95%CI) = 0.724 (0.53-0.97), p =0.031] and adjusted analysis [OR = 0.603 (0.38-0.94), p = 0.027]. We found no association of glucagon-like peptide 2, or dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 activity with osteoporosis. Postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 levels are related to osteoporosis and osteoporosis risk in non-diabetic postmenopausal women. Further studies are required to verify these findings.

TI  - Impact of chemotherapy on symptoms and symptom clusters in postmenopausal women with breast cancer prior to aromatase inhibitor therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aims and Objectives To examine and compare the differences in symptoms and symptom clusters between postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who did and did not receive chemotherapy prior to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Background Women with breast cancer often experience multiple concurrent symptoms during AI therapy. The burden of symptoms prior to AI is associated with nonadherence to cancer treatment. To date, few studies have comprehensively explored the symptoms and symptom clusters occurring prior to AI therapy. Design Secondary analysis of a prospective repeated-measures study. Methods The sample comprised postmenopausal women (N = 339) with breast cancer who would receive AI therapy with or without chemotherapy. We collected information on 48 symptoms after surgery or chemotherapy but before AI therapy using different symptom assessment tools. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the differences in the severity of symptoms between groups. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to determine symptom clusters. This study followed STROBE guidelines. Results The most severe symptoms among women with breast cancer prior to AI therapy were breast sensitivity, unhappy with the appearance of my body, general aches and pain, joint pain and muscle stiffness. Women who received chemotherapy prior to AI therapy experienced significantly higher severity of 22 symptoms than women who did not receive chemotherapy. Through EFA seven distinct symptom clusters were revealed in both groups: cognitive, musculoskeletal, psychological, vasomotor, weight, sexual and urinary, with additional gastrointestinal symptom cluster been identified in women who received chemotherapy. Conclusions This study indicates the presence of symptoms among women with breast cancer prior to AI therapy, with higher severity of symptoms and greater number of symptom clusters for women who received chemotherapy. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses should assess and be aware of symptoms and symptom clusters existed prior to AI therapy and manage them in advance.

TI  - Pathogenesis and Consequences of Disordered Sleep in PCOS
T2  - CLINICAL MEDICINE INSIGHTS-REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that is characterized by hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity. Affected women have a high prevalence of insulin resistance and related metabolic complications. The frequency of sleep disturbances appears to be increased in women with PCOS, although most studies so far have included more severely affected obese women with PCOS who are referred to tertiary care clinics and may not represent the general population of women with PCOS. This article provides an overview of sleep disturbances in PCOS with the focus on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most commonly reported sleep disturbance among these women. The pathogenesis and risk factors for OSA in PCOS and its association with metabolic disorders is discussed in detail.

TI  - Hierarchical measurement structure in the Women's Health Questionnaire: a confirmatory factor analysis
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Purpose: This study conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the measurement structure of the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and how its components were organized. Methods: Participants were 448 postmenopausal women, with a mean age of 63.3 years. CFA was conducted to test how well several proposed measurement models fit the data. Results: The single-factor model performed poorly, indicating the presence of multiple factors. The model with seven correlated factors fit the data well, although the varying degrees of inter-factor correlations suggested grouping of similar factors. The hierarchical measurement structure, with seven first-order factors organized under two second-order factors of physical health and mental health functioning, demonstrated a good fit with the data (chi(2)(367) = 694.05, p < 0.001; root mean square error of approximation = 0.05; comparative fit index = 0.95) and a meaningful pattern. The Mental Health factor was represented by Depressed Mood, Anxiety/Fear, Memory/Concentration Problems, and Sleep Problems. The Physical Health factor was manifested mainly by Somatic Symptoms, Menstrual Symptoms, and Vasomotor Symptoms, and, to a lesser extent, also by Sleep Problems and Memory/Concentration Problems. Conclusion: Findings suggested that, in addition to a global index and subscale scores, the WHQ may produce summary scores of physical health and mental health functioning in evaluation of well-being among postmenopausal women.

TI  - Effects of Yoga on Quality of Sleep of Women With Premenstrual Syndrome
T2  - ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE
AB  - Objective . Women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) commonly complain of sleep disturbances, specifically in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, the effects of yoga on quality of sleep of women experiencing PMS was investigated.
   Material and Methods . Women (aged 20-45 y) monitored for PMS, who were referred to the private obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Tabriz, Iran, were referred to the private obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Tabriz, Iran. Afterward, 62 women, were selected and divided into 2 groups, randomly: 31 subjects in yoga the yoga group and 31 in the control group. Subjects in yoga performed for 10 wk in 3 sessions, with each session lasting 60 min. Subjects in the control group did not perform any yoga. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index questionnaire before and after yoga in both groups.
   Results . After yoga intervention, subjects significantly expressed improvement in sleeping (P<.05). Based on the Mann-Whitney U test, a significant difference was observed in the subdomains of both groups on quality of sleep (P < .01), sleep latency (P<.01), and sleep efficiency (p<.05).
   Conclusion . Yoga reduced the disturbances of sleep in the subjects with PMS, which subsequently improved the efficiency of their sleep. Therefore, we conclude that yoga can be prescribed for improving sleep disturbances in women with PMS and medical therapy will probably be needed in severe situations.

TI  - Cognitive behavior therapy for menopausal symptoms (CBT-Meno): a randomized controlled trial
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for menopausal symptoms (CBT-Meno) compared with a waitlist condition (no active intervention), A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 71 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women who were seeking treatment for menopausal symptoms.
   Methods: Blind assessments were conducted at baseline, 12 weeks postbaseline, and 3 months post-treatment, An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. CBT-Meno sessions included psychoeducation, and cognitive and behavioral strategies for vasomotor and depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep difficulties, and sexual concerns. Primary outcomes were scores on the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Secondary outcomes were scores assessing vasomotor and sexual concerns on the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS-vm, GCS-sex), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Female Sexual Function index (FWI).
   Results: There were significantly greater improvements in CBT-Meno compared with waitlist in vasomotor symptom interference (HFRDIS; P < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.21) and "bothersomeness" (GCS-vm; P = 0.04, eta(2)(p) = 0.06), depressive symptoms (BDI-II; P = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.15), sleep difficulties (PSQI; P = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.17), and sexual concerns (GCS-sex; P = 0.03, eta(2)(p) = 0.07). These results were found even when controlling for menopausal staging and medication use. Gains were maintained at 3 months post-treatment.
   Conclusions: CBT-Meno was particularly effective in improving self-reported vasomotor symptoms, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulties, and sexual concerns. Although future studies will be needed to confirm the impact of CBT-Meno on anxiety symptoms, these results suggest that this protocol is effective in targeting commonly reported menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Prevalence of sarcopenia and associated factors in climacteric women of the Colombian Caribbean
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and associated factors in climacteric middle-aged women.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Colombian Caribbean women (40-59 y, n=403), who were surveyed with a form that included sociodemographic information and two validated tools (the Menopause Rating Scale and the SF-36 Health questionnaire). Calf circumference, handgrip, and gait speed were measured. Low muscle mass (calf circumference <31 cm), reduced muscle strength (<20 kg in handgrip), and lower physical performance (<0.8 m/s gait speed) were estimated. Criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People were used to identify sarcopenia. Association between sarcopcnia (dependent variable) and menopausal symptoms and health perception (independent variables) was estimated.
   Results: Median age of surveyed women was 48 years, with 44.5% being postmenopausal. 9.6% had low muscle mass, 18,1% had reduced muscle strength, and 6.9% had lower physical performance. Presarcopenia was identified in 9.6% and sarcopenia in 7.9% (nonsevere sarcopcnia 7,1% and severe sarcopenia 0.8%). Most important factors associated with sarcopcnia were feeling full of life only sometimes, feeling a lot of energy only sometimes, having joint/muscular discomfort, history of hysterectomy, hot flashes, mestizo ethnic group, age 50 or more, being postmenopausal, and sleep problems.
   Conclusions: Sarcopenia was present in this middle-aged female Colombian Caribbean sample and associated with various factors such as ethnicity, age, and menopausal symptoms and status.

TI  - The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS): what have we learned?
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) was designed to address gaps in understanding the effects of timely menopausal hormone treatments (HT) on cardiovascular health and other effects of menopause after the premature termination of the Women's Health Initiative.
   Method: The KEEPS was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that initiation of HT (oral conjugated equine estrogens [o-CEE] or transdermal 17 beta-estradiol [t-E-2]) in healthy, recently postmenopausal women (n = 727) would slow the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT).
   Results: After 4 years, neither HT affected the rate of increase in CIMT. There was a trend for reduced accumulation of coronary artery calcium with o-CEE. There were no severe adverse effects, including venous thrombosis. Several ancillary studies demonstrated a positive effect on mood with o-CEE, and reduced hot flashes, improved sleep, and maintenance of bone mineral density with both treatments. Sexual function improved with t-E-2. There were no significant effects of either treatment on cognition, breast pain, or skin wrinkling Variants of genes associated with estrogen metabolism influenced the age of menopause and variability in effects of the HT on CIMT. Platelet activation associated with the development of white matter hyperintensities in the brain.
   Conclusions: KEEPS and its ancillary studies have supported the value and safety of the use of HT in recently postmenopausal women and provide a perspective for future research to optimize HT and health of postmenopausal women. The KEEPS continuation study continues to pursue these issues.

TI  - PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME AND RELATIONSHIP WITH HEALTHY LIFESTYL BEHAVIOURS IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
T2  - NOBEL MEDICUS
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between premenstrual syndrome (PMS)frequency and healthy lifestyle behaviors of university students.
   Material and Method: The universe of this descriptive study consisted of 341 female students studying at the Faulty of Health Sciences of Hitit University in the 2017-2018 academic year and the sample were 188 female students. The data of the study were collected between 01-30 March 2018 through a 28-Questions Personal Information Form and Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS), which were developed by the researchers in the light of literature.
   Results: PMS frequency of students was determined as 64.89%. The average score PMSS was determined as 121.38 +/- 133.36 and average score healthy Promotion Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II) was determined as 126.70 +/- 20.46. In the study, a two-way correlation was found between the sub-dimensions of PMS scale and also sub-dimensions of healthy lifestyle behaviors.
   Conclusion: PMS complaints of students are moderate. Adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors in young girls was found to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of PMS. It is suggested that young girls should be educated about ways of coping with healthy lifestyle behaviors such as nutrition, sleep and stress management.

TI  - A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Telomere Length and Sleep in the Women's Health Initiative
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Telomere length is a heritable marker of cellular age that is associated with morbidity and mortality. Poor sleep behaviors, which are also associated with adverse health events, may be related to leukocyte telomere length (LTL). We studied a subpopulation of 3,145 postmenopausal women (1,796 European-American (EA) and 1,349 African-American (AA)) enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative in 1993-1998 with data on Southern blot-measured LTL and self-reported usual sleep duration and sleep disturbance. LTL-sleep associations were analyzed separately for duration and disturbance using weighted and confounder-adjusted linear regression models in the entire sample (AAs + EAs; adjusted for race/ethnicity) and in racial/ethnic strata, since LTL differs by ancestry. After adjustment for covariates, each additional daily hour of sleep beyond 5 hours, approximately, was associated with a 27-base-pair (95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 48) longer LTL in the entire sample. Associations between sleep duration and LTL were strongest among AAs (adjusted beta = 37, 95% CI: 4, 70); a similar, nonsignificant association was observed for EAs (adjusted beta = 20, 95% CI: -7, 48). Sleep disturbance was not associated with LTL in our study. Our models did not show departure from linearity (quadratic sleep terms: P >= 0.55). Our results suggest that longer sleep duration is associated with longer LTL in postmenopausal women.

TI  - The Relationship Between Insomnia and Cognitive Impairment in Breast Cancer Survivors
T2  - JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
AB  - Background: Cancer-related cognitive impairment is an emerging public health burden. Growing research suggests that sleep disturbances contribute to poor cognition. Our study aimed to evaluate the association between insomnia and cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors.
   Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from a cohort study of postmenopausal women with stage 0-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer on aromatase inhibitor therapy. The study was conducted between November 2011 and April 2015 at an academic cancer center (Philadelphia, PA). Insomnia was assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. Perceived cognitive impairment was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Checklist. We used linear regression to evaluate the association between insomnia and perceived cognitive impairment.
   Results: Among 1072 patients, 556 (51.9%) reported insomnia and 847 (79.0%) were bothered by cognitive symptoms (forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, distractibility). Greater perceived cognitive impairment was reported by patients with mild insomnia (regression coefficient [beta] = 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.23 to 0.46, P < .001), moderate insomnia (beta = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.65, P < .001), and severe insomnia (beta = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.21, P < .001), compared with those without insomnia. Greater perceived cognitive impairment was also associated with patients younger than 55 years (beta = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.45, P<.001), taxane-based chemotherapy (beta = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.004 to 0.22, P =.04), anxiety (beta = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.64, P<.001), and depression (beta = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.94, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy, insomnia and cognitive impairment are prevalent and characterized by a graded association, in which severity of perceived cognitive impairment increases as insomnia severity increases. Our findings warrant further research to determine whether addressing sleep is a strategy to improve management of cancer-related cognitive impairment.

TI  - Hot flashes and awakenings among midlife women
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: For most women, the menopause is accompanied by hot flashes and sleep problems. Although hot flashes reportedly wake women from sleep, in the few studies that have used objective measures of both sleep and hot flashes, links between hot flashes and nocturnal awakening have been inconsistent. In a well-characterized cohort of midlife women, we examined the association between objectively assessed hot flashes and actigraphically defined wake from sleep. We hypothesized that wake episodes would be more likely during an objective hot flash relative to minutes without a hot flash.
   Methods: Peri- and postmenopausal midlife women underwent simultaneous objective measurement of hot flashes (sternal skin conductance) and sleep (actigraphy) over 24 hours in the home. The likelihood of waking in the minutes during the hot flash relative to the minutes preceding the hot flash was compared using generalized estimating equations.
   Results: We studied 168 women with at least one objective nocturnal hot flash and actigraphy data. Actigraphy-assessed wake episodes were concurrent with 78% of the objective hot flashes. We found an increased likelihood of wake in the minutes during the objective hot flash (0 to +5 min: OR [95% CI] = 5.31 (4.46 to 6.33); p < .0001) relative to the minutes preceding it (-10 to -1 min). The increased likelihood of wake occurred irrespective of whether the women reported the objective hot flash.
   Conclusion: Among these women who underwent objective measurement of sleep and hot flashes, nocturnal wakefulness was observed with the majority of hot flashes.

TI  - Activation of Rev-erba attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory reactions in human endometrial stroma cells via suppressing TLR4-regulated NF-kappa B activation
T2  - ACTA BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA SINICA
AB  - Perturbation of the circadian rhythm damages the biological characteristics of cells and leads to their dysfunction. Rev-erb alpha, an important gene in the transcription-translation loop of circadian rhythm, is involved in regulating the balance between pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation. The disruption of this balance in human endometrial stroma cells (hESCs) destroys their biological behavior function in maintaining the menstrual cycle and embryonic implantation. Whether pharmacological modulation of Rev-erb alpha affects the inflammation of hESCs remains unclear. In this study, we treated hESCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that LPS treatment increased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF alpha, and the secretion of IL-6. SR9009, a Rev-erb alpha agonist, significantly alleviated the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hESCs. Meanwhile, knockdown of Rev-erb alpha increased the expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8, accompanied by an increased mRNA level of the core clock gene Bmal1. Western blot analysis showed that SR9009 inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the activation of NF-kappa B induced by LPS. All these findings suggested that pharmacological activation of Rev-erb alpha attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory response of hESCs by suppressing TLR4-regulated NF-kappa B activation. This study may provide a strategy for preventing inflammation-related endometrial dysfunction and infertility or recurrent implantation failure.

TI  - A Nutraceutical Approach to Menopausal Complaints
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - The menopausal transition, or perimenopause, is characterized by menstrual irregularities, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbances, mood symptoms, and urogenital tract atrophy. These changes can also affect the quality of life and one's self-esteem. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is considered the best option to achieve therapeutic relief of different menopausal symptoms but is usually restricted to moderate or severe symptoms. Moreover, many women refuse HRT for a variety of reasons concerning the fear of cancer and other adverse effects. According to these considerations, new topics are emerging: Dissatisfaction with drug costs and conventional healthcare, desire for personalized medicines, and the public perception that "natural is good". In this context, nonhormonal therapies are mostly evolving, and it is not unusual that women often request a "natural" approach for their symptoms. The aim of this study is to investigate nonhormonal therapies that have been identified to reduce the menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy of Low-Dose Paroxetine for the Treatment of Hot Flushes in Surgical and Physiological Postmenopausal Women: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: Hot flushes and sleep disturbances are the most common vasomotor symptoms (VMS) reported by postmenopausal women. Hormonal treatment is to date referred to as the gold standard approach but not suitable for all the patients. Alternative treatments are needed in case of a contraindication to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), adverse side effects, and poor compliance. Paroxetine salt is the only nonhormonal medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of VMS. Nonetheless, few trials with low consensus are available about this topic. In this review, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose paroxetine therapy in the treatment of vasomotor hot flushes and night sleep disturbances in postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods: We performed an electronic search from the beginning of all databases to July 2019. All results were then limited to a randomized trial. Restrictions for language or geographic location were not utilized. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials of physiological or surgical postmenopausal women experiencing hot flushes and sleep disturbances who were randomized to either low-dose paroxetine or placebo (i.e., formulations without active ingredients). The primary outcome evaluated was the mean weekly reduction of hot flushes. Results: Five randomized clinical trials, including 1482 postmenopausal women, were analyzed. Significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 90%) between studies was noted. Hot flushes episodes were significantly reduced in the treatment arm compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.97 [-10.51, -5.92] episodes/week). Results on the improvement on sleep were limited by being reported in only two studies; however, no significant reduction of night-time awakenings was observed (MD, -0.40 awakenings/night [-1.38, 0.58 CI]). Conclusions: Low-dose paroxetine is an effective treatment for vasomotor menopause symptoms, including hot flushes.

TI  - Executive function in breast cancer survivors and the influencing factors
T2  - ENFERMERIA CLINICA
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze executive function (EF) in postchemotherapy breast cancer survivors and factors that influence it.
   Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 hospitals in Jakarta and Bandung, Indonesia. Respondents consisted of 82 breast cancer survivors who had completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy, 81 nonchemotherapy breast cancer survivors, and 80 noncancer female patients, who were determined by consecutive sampling. Data collection tools included patient care documentation, Trail Making Test B, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and Piper Fatigue Scale. Data analysis was done using multiple logistic regression.
   Results: The mean age of the respondents was 43.06 +/- 8.18 years, the mean score of stress was 13.12 +/- 5.55, 81.1% of respondents had <12 years of education, 81.1% were not using hormonal therapy, 51.4% were in menopause, 62.6% did not have anemia, 51% had poor sleep quality, and 47.32% experienced mild fatigue. Furthermore, 86.6% of postchemotherapy breast cancer survivors had experienced EF impairment. Variables that had significant relationships with EF impairment were age, stress, length of education, classification of respondents, type of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy usage, menopausal status, hemoglobin level, and sleep quality.
   Conclusions: It was concluded that most influencing variables that disrupt EF are chemotherapy type, age, and stress (OR 18.089, 1.138, and 1.104, respectively). (C) 2019 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. AU rights reserved.

TI  - Autonomic regulation of preterm infants is enhanced by Family Nurture Intervention
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY
AB  - Preterm infants have maturational delays in several neurobehavioral systems. This study assesses the impact of the Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the maturation of autonomic regulation of preterm infants. Preterm infants born at 26-34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) were assigned to groups receiving either standard care (SC) or SC plus FNI, using a randomized controlled trial design. At two collection time points, approximately 35 weeks and 41 weeks PMA, electrocardiograms (ECG) were monitored for approximately 1 hour during sleep. Heart rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were quantified from the ECG. Across the two time points, the FNI group exhibited greater increases in RSA (Cohen's d = 0.35) and slope between RSA and heart rate, as a measure of vagal efficiency (Cohen's d = 0.62). These results document that FNI resulted in enhanced autonomic regulation consistent with greater maturation of cardiac function. These and previous findings strongly suggest that facilitating early nurturing interactions and emotional connection between preterm infants and their mothers is a practicable and effective means of optimizing postnatal development in preterm infants. Interpretation of these autonomic function results also enriches our understanding of the potential long-term beneficial outcomes of FNI by drawing upon polyvagal theory, which explains how autonomic state provides a neurophysiological platform for optimal co-regulation between infant and caregiver, and by drawing upon calming cycle theory, which provides a model for understanding how repeated mother/infant calming interactions positively condition autonomic state and reinforce approach, prosocial behaviors.

TI  - Cardiovascular prevention in women: a narrative review from the Italian Society of Cardiology working groups on 'Cardiovascular Prevention, Hypertension and peripheral circulation' and on 'Women Disease'
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in women. Some authors highlighted that the female risk profile consists of traditional and emerging risk factors. Despite the lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes, years of life lost owing to the disease for women are substantially higher compared with men. In addition, pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes represents a risk factor for CVD. Women with gestational diabetes have a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease that occur at a younger age and are independent of T2DM. Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor in women. Estrogens and progesterone, known to have an impact on blood pressure levels, have also been proposed to be protective against sleep-disordered breathing. It is very difficult to understand whereas obstructive sleep apnea in women is independently associated with hypertension or if many confounders acting at different stages of the woman lifespan mediate this relation. The cardioprotective effect of physical activity in women of all ages is well known. Women are generally more physically inactive than men. During and after menopause, most women tend to reduce their physical activity levels and together with the reduction in basal metabolic rate, women experience loss of skeletal muscle mass with a negative change in the ratio of fat-to-lean mass. In conclusion, sex differences in the cardiovascular system are because of dissimilarities in gene expression and sex hormones; these result in variations in prevalence and presentation of CVD and associated conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and vascular and cardiac remodeling. Changes in lifestyle and increase in physical activity could help in prevention of cardiovascular disease in women.

TI  - Relationship between Postmenopausal Vitamin D Level, Menopausal Symptoms and Sexual Functions
T2  - JCPSP-JOURNAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PAKISTAN
AB  - Objective: To determine whether vitamin D levels correlate with menopausal symptoms and female sexual functions.
   Study Design: A cross-sectional study.
   Place and Duration of Study: Izmir Katip Celebi University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, between February and October 2017.
   Methodology: Menopausal and sexual active ladies aged 40-70 years were inducted. Those with psychiatric disorders, endocive abnormalities, related therapy, and malignancy were excluded. Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) were used to collect data. Also blood samples were collected from the patients. The study's data were examined with logistic and linear regression models.
   Results: Total MRS scale scores of the 303 subjects with one of the following conditions had a higher menopause symptom score; chronic disease, vaginal discharge, chronic pain, unsatisfied with sex, sleep problems, and low vitamin D level (p=0.023, p=0.007, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.017, and p<0.001; respectively). It was found that those who have middle income level were more likely to have better sexual function (OR: 0.209, 95% CI: 0.065; 0.671) compared to those who have low income level. It was found that those with higher MRS somatic complaint (OR: 1.274; 95% CI: 1.087; 1.494) and urogenital complaint (OR: 1.670; 95% CI: 1.326; 2.102) and ones with lower vitamin D levels (OR: 0.963; %95 CI: 0.941; 0.987) were more likely to report complaints for sexual function disorders.
   Conclusion: Vitamin D of all women in menopause should be evaluated. High vitamin D levels should reduce menopausal symptoms and positively affect sexual function.

TI  - Examining the effects of menstruation on women's helping behaviour in the workplace
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how menstruation affects women's well-being and discretionary helping on a day-to-day basis - an important step in understanding how factors tied to women's health affect them daily at work. Using an experience sampling study with 96 women over 20 workdays (Level-1 n = 1640), results indicated that the pain experienced by women on the days they were menstruating related to increased daily depletion and negative mood. Depletion subsequently decreased helping, whereas negative mood did not. However, the positive effects of pain on depletion and negative mood were attenuated for women who had higher levels of trait-level approach motivation. Our work speaks to a biological process that is normal and recurring for half of the workforce, helping shed light on this largely ignored topic. Practitioner points
   We identify the effects of menstruation on helping behaviours at work, bringing the discussion of women's health into the organizational spotlight at a time when companies are creating 'period policies' to help support women at work. Our findings suggest that women feel increased pain on days when they menstruate; pain, in turn, relates to increased feelings of depletion and lower helping behaviours. Scholars and practitioners should consider how these physiological shifts that are unique to women's health affect their work experiences daily.

TI  - Chronotype and postmenopausal breast cancer risk among women in the California Teachers Study
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Chronotype is the behavioral manifestation of an individual's underlying circadian rhythm, generally characterized by one's propensity to sleep at a particular time during the 24 hour cycle. Evening chronotypes ("night owls") generally suffer from worse physical and mental health compared to morning chronotypes ("morning larks") - for reasons that have yet to be explained. One hypothesis is that evening chronotypes may be more susceptible to circadian disruption, a condition where the coordinated timing of biologic processes breaks down. The role of chronotype as an independent or modifying risk factor for cancer has not been widely explored. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with chronotype in a case-control study nested within the California Teachers Study (CTS) cohort. The study population consisted of 39686 post-menopausal CTS participants who provided information on chronotype by completing a questionnaire in 2012-2013. 2719 cases of primary invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1995/1996 through completion of the chronotype questionnaire were identified by linkage of the CTS to the California Cancer Registry. 36967 CTS participants who had remained cancer-free during this same time period served as controls. Chronotype was ascertained by responses to an abbreviated version of the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and was characterized into five categories: definite morning, more morning than evening, neither morning or evening, more evening than morning, definite evening. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for each of the chronotypes, adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors. Compared to definite morning types, definite evening types had an increased risk of breast cancer with elevated ORs that were statistically significant in both the crude (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.40) and fully-adjusted models (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.06-1.35). The risk estimates in the fully-adjusted model for all other chronotypes did not significantly differ from one. These results suggest that evening chronotype may be an independent risk factor for breast cancer among a population of women who are not known to have engaged in any substantial night shift work. Further research in other populations of non-shift workers is warranted.

TI  - The association between serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels and job-related stress among female nurses
T2  - ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is an endogenous steroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland. DHEAS has been suggested to play a protective role against psychosocial stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between job-related stress and blood concentrations of DHEAS according to occupational stress factors among female nurses.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 118 premenopausal nurses from 4 departments (operating room, emergency room [ER], intensive care unit, and ward) of a university hospital. Participants were all rotating night shift workers who have worked for over a year and mean age of 33.5 +/- 4.8 years. Data from structured questionnaires including the Korean Occupational Stress Score, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used.
   Results: In the high job-related stressor group, scores of BDI, BAI, and PSQI were significantly higher than low-stressor group. ER nurses had relatively more work-burden related stressors, but they had significantly lower levels of anxiety and depression than other groups. And, ER nurses showed higher levels of DHEAS than the other department nurses. The differences were significant (p = 0.003). Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference even after adjusting for factors that could affect level of DHEAS, such as age, body mass index, drinking, and physical activity (p = 0.039).
   Conclusions: This result suggests the possibility that DHEAS may play a role as a marker of proper stress management. The capacity to secrete DHEAS is not simply due to workload or job stressor but could be determined depending on how individuals and groups deal with and resolve stress. Proper resolution of stress may affect positive hormone secretion.

TI  - Effect of Time of Day of Infection on Chlamydia Infectivity and Pathogenesis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Genital chlamydia infection in women causes complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and tuba! factor infertility, but it is unclear why some women are more susceptible than others. Possible factors, such as time of day of chlamydia infection on chlamydial pathogenesis has not been determined. We hypothesised that infections during the day, will cause increased complications compared to infections at night. Mice placed under normal 12:12 light: dark (LD) cycle were infected intravaginally with Chlamydia muridarum either at zeitgeber time 3, ZT3 and ZT15. Infectivity was monitored by periodic vaginal swabs and chlamydiae isolation. Blood and vaginal washes were collected for host immunologic response assessments. The reproductive tracts of the mice were examined histopathologically, and fertility was determined by embryo enumeration after mating. Mice infected at ZT3 shed significantly more C. muridarum than mice infected at ZT15. This correlated with the increased genital tract pathology observed in mice infected at ZT3. Mice infected at ZT3 were less fertile than mice infected at ZT15. The results suggest that the time of day of infection influences chlamydial pathogenesis, it indicates a possible association between complications from chlamydia infection and host circadian clock, which may lead to a better understanding of chlamydial pathogenesis.

TI  - Epidemiological characteristics of elevated blood pressure among middle and high school students aged 12-17 years: a cross-sectional study in Jiangsu Province, China, 2017-2018
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective In this study, we aimed to present the epidemiological characteristics of elevated blood pressure among middle and high school students aged 12-17 years in Jiangsu Province.
   Setting Hypertension, which is considered a rare disease in children, is an important early precursor to long-term cardiovascular damage, and elevated blood pressure in childhood is a strong predictor of hypertension in adulthood.
   Participants Physical examination and questionnaire investigation among children aged 12-17 years in Jiangsu Province were conducted from 2017 to 2018.
   Main outcome measures Physical measurements included height, weight, blood pressure and history of menarche/first spermatorrhoea. Questionnaire investigation included family type, delivery mode, lifestyle habits and psychological test.
   Results In our study we investigated 17 791 middle and high school students, consisting of 8701 female students and 9090 male students. The prevalence of screening elevated blood pressure among students aged 12-17 years was 20.0% (95% CI 19.2% to 20.9%) for female students and 22.3% (95% CI 21.5% to 23.2%) for male students. The prevalence of screening elevated blood pressure for urban male middle and high school students was higher than that of elevated blood pressure for rural male middle and high school students. However, similar phenomenon cannot be observed among female students. For both male and female students, body mass index (BMI), obesity/overweight and menarche/first spermatorrhoea can be a risk factor contributing to elevated blood pressure, and sleep time and regional distribution might be important factors that need to be investigated in depth.
   Conclusion We found a relatively high prevalence of screening elevated blood pressure among students aged 12-17 years for both female and male students in Jiangsu Province. The risk factors can be BMI, obesity/overweight and menarche/first spermatorrhoea.

TI  - Confirmatory factor analysis of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and invariance across race: a pooled analysis of MsFLASH data
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Women's sleep at menopause is widely reported to be problematic. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a commonly used tool for quantifying sleep problems in clinical and research settings, but psychometric properties in postmenopausal women have not been reported. Our study aim was to examine the factor structure of the ISI in a large and diverse sample of midlife women with hot flashes. Methods: Baseline data were from 899 women enrolled in one of the three clinical trials using similar entry criteria conducted by the Menopause Strategies Finding Lasting Answers to Symptoms and Health research network. We conducted confirmatory factor analyses for the total sample and within strata defined by race/ethnicity (black and white women). Results: The ISI had two factors in the total sample. The two-factor structure was consistent across black and white women, with the exception of one item "difficulty falling asleep." Conclusions: The ISI in midlife women with hot flashes is composed of two factors that capture dimensions of the insomnia severity and daytime impact. The instrument is a psychometrically sound scale appropriate for use in research and clinical practice to capture the severity and daytime impact of insomnia symptoms in diverse samples of midlife women with hot flashes. An abbreviated screening of two items could be considered to determine if further evaluation is needed of sleep complaints.

TI  - Night Shift Work and Risk of Breast Cancer in Women
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background. Night shift work involving circadian disruption has been associated with increased breast cancer rates in some epidemiological studies, but the evidence is still on debate.
   Aim of the study. The objective of this study is to assess the association between night shift work and breast cancer in Mexican women.
   Methods. A Case-control study was conducted with incident cases of breast cancer at the Instituto de Seguridad Social del Estado de Mexico y Municipios. Cases were interviewed about past exposures prior to the final diagnosis. Controls were women without breast cancer matched on multiple sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results. 101 cases and 101 matched controls were interviewed; this small sample size provided consistent, but wide estimates of the assessed associations. The multivariate conditional logistic regression showed that breast-feeding was associated with reduced risk for breast cancer (OR 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02-0.60); women who experienced early menarche (12 years) were more likely to develop breast cancer (OR 18.58; 95% CI 18: 2.19-148). Women who worked at night were more likely to develop breast cancer compared to women who never did (OR = 8.58; 95% CI: 2.19-33.8).
   Conclusions. Our results are consistent with studies from other countries, which positively associated night shift work with breast cancer. (C) 2019 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Sympathetic neural responsiveness to sleep deprivation in older adults: sex differences
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Our laboratory has previously reported that total sleep deprivation (TSD) modifies muscle sympathetic neural activity (MSNA) differently in young men and women. Because postmenopausal women are among the highest risk for hypertension, this study compares MSNA responses with TSD in older men and women. We hypothesized that TSD would alter MSNA in older adults, with greater sympathoexcitation in postmenopausal women. Twenty-seven participants (14 men and 13 women) between the ages of 55 and 75 yr were tested twice, once after 24-h TSD and once after normal sleep (randomized, crossover design). Our primary outcome measure of MSNA (microneurography) was successful across both conditions in 20 participants (10 men and 10 women). Secondary outcome measures included seated blood pressure, heart rate, and fasting plasma testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone. Age (60 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 yr) and BMI (27 +/- 1 vs. 26 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) were not different between groups. TSD increased systolic blood pressure in both men (124 +/- 5 to 130 +/- 4 mmHg) and women (107 +/- 5 to 116 +/- 4 mmHg), but the increases were not different between groups (condition, P = 0.014; condition x sex, P > 0.05). In contrast, TSD elicited divergent MSNA responses in older men and women. Specifically, MSNA burst frequency increased in postmenopausal women (28 +/- 3 to 34 +/- 3 burst/min), but not older men (38 +/- 3 to 35 +/- 3 bursts/min; condition x sex, P = 0.032). In conclusion, TSD elicited sympathoexcitation in postmenopausal women but not age-matched men. These findings provide new mechanistic insight into reported links between sleep deprivation and hypertension.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Epidemiological studies report that sleep deprivation is more strongly associated with hypertension in women than in men. In the present study, 24-h total sleep deprivation (TSD) increased blood pressure in postmenopausal women and age-matched men. In contrast, only women demonstrated increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity after TSD. The sympathoexcitation observed in postmenopausal women suggests a potential contributing mechanism for epidemiological observations and advances our understanding of the complex relations between sleep, sex, and hypertension.

TI  - Habitual sleep quality, plasma metabolites and risk of coronary heart disease in post-menopausal women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background Epidemiologic studies suggest a strong link between poor habitual sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Metabolomic profiling may elucidate systemic differences associated with sleep quality that influence cardiometabolic health.
   Methods We explored cross-sectional associations between sleep quality and plasma metabolites in a nested case-control study of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; n=1956) and attempted to replicate the results in an independent sample from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; n=209). A sleep-quality score (SQS) was derived from self-reported sleep problems asked in both populations. Plasma metabolomics were assayed using LC-MS with 347 known metabolites. General linear regression was used to identify individual metabolites associated with continuous SQS (false-discovery rate <0.05). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms, a metabolite score was created from replicated metabolites and evaluated with CHD risk in the WHI.
   Results After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and smoking, we identified 69 metabolites associated with SQS in the WHI (59 were lipids). Of these, 16 were replicated in NHSII (15 were lipids), including 6 triglycerides (TAGs), 4 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), 3 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 1 diglyceride (DAG), 1 lysophosphatidylcholine and N6-acetyl-L-lysine (a product of histone acetylation). These metabolites were consistently higher among women with poorer sleep quality. The LASSO selection resulted in a nine-metabolite score (TAGs 45: 1, 48: 1, 50: 4; DAG 32: 1; PEs 36: 4, 38: 5; PCs 30: 1, 40: 6; N6-acetyl-L-lysine), which was positively associated with CHD risk (odds ratio per SD increase in the score: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.28; p=0.0003) in the WHI after adjustment for matching factors and conventional CHD risk factors.
   Conclusions Differences in lipid metabolites may be an important pathogenic pathway linking poor habitual sleep quality and CHD risk.

TI  - Associations between age and sleep apnea risk among newborn infants
T2  - PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY
AB  - Objective Among older children, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with measurable neurocognitive consequences. However, diagnostic SDB thresholds are lacking for infants < 12 months. We sought to evaluate the relationship between SDB indices, gestational age (GA), and postmenstrual age (PMA) for infants who underwent clinically-indicated polysomnograms at a tertiary care center. Methods Every infant < 3-months chronological age whose first clinically-indicated polysomnogram was between 2/2012 and 2/2017 was included. Linear regression was used to evaluate associations between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive-apnea index (OAI), and GA and PMA for infants with and without obvious clinical risk factors for SDB (eg, micrognathia and cleft palate). Results For 53 infants without obvious SDB risk factors (GA 35.6 +/- 4.5 weeks; PMA 41.2 +/- 4.0 weeks), mean AHI was 27 +/- 18 and OAI 2.9 +/- 4.5. There was a weak inverse relationship between AHI and PMA (r(2) = 0.12, P = 0.01), but AHI was not predicted by GA (r(2) = 0.04, P = 0.13). Conversely, OAI was more strongly associated with GA (r(2) = 0.33, P < 0.0001) than PMA (r(2) = 0.08, P = 0.036). For 28 infants with congenital structural anomalies that predispose to SDB (GA 38.0 +/- 3.1 weeks, PMA 43.1 +/- 3.3 weeks, AHI 37.7 +/- 30, OAI 8.2 +/- 11.8), neither AHI nor OAI were related to PMA or GA. Conclusions Among infants who received clinically-indicated polysomnograms but did not have obvious structural risk for SDB, AHI declined with advancing PMA, but obstructive-apnea was best predicted by prematurity. In contrast, the SDB risk did not improve with increasing GA or PMA for infants with congenital structural risk factors; such infants may not outgrow their risk for SDB.

TI  - Sleep and female reproduction
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   Sleep disturbances are increasing in prevalence in North America. There is growing evidence that poor sleep quality and short sleep duration may adversely affect circadian rhythms, which in turn may affect female reproduction. The objective of this review is to evaluate recent literature on the association between sleep disturbances and female reproduction.
   Recent findings
   There is accumulating evidence that sleep quality and duration are important for female reproduction, but epidemiologic research is limited. Recent studies provide suggestive evidence that sleep disorders are associated with increased menstrual irregularity, subfertility/infertility, and poor pregnancy and birth outcomes. Mechanisms underlying these associations are likely to be multifactorial and complex. In addition to genetics, circadian disruption may impact reproductive outcomes through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. Recommendations for future studies include: use of prospective study designs; assessment of populations not already experiencing reproductive disorders; more detailed and accurate assessments of sleep such as validated self-reported measures or objective sleep measures (e. g. actigraphy); comprehensive assessment of potential confounders and mediators; and elucidation of biologic mechanisms.
   Summary
   There is a growing body of literature showing evidence that sleep disturbances influence female reproduction, although further epidemiologic research is needed.

TI  - Lipid peroxidation depends on the clock 3111T/C gene polymorphism in menopausal women with Insomnia
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - A comparative analysis of lipid peroxidation processes and antioxidant defense system in Caucasian menopausal women with/without insomnia depending on the genotype of Clock 3111T/C gene polymorphism was performed. Two hundred and fourteen Caucasian menopausal women divided into control (without insomnia) and main group (with insomnia) were examined. Lipid peroxidation (conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reactants) and antioxidant defense system parameters (?-tocopherol, retinol, reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase) were determined by spectrofluorophotometer and immunoenzymometric methods. Patients with insomnia carriers of the TT-genotype had a significantly higher thiobarbituric acid reactants level and glutathione peroxidase activity as compared to group with insomnia carriers of the minor 3111C-allele (p < .05). A comparative analysis of the parameters in the women of the main and control groups showed higher conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reactants levels and lower retinol, reduced glutathione levels, glutathione reductase activity in women with insomnia carriers of the TT-genotype (p < .05). The carriers of the minor allele with insomnia had a higher conjugated dienes levels and lower glutathione peroxidase activity as compared to control (p < .05). Thus, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system parameters in Caucasian menopausal women with insomnia depend on the Clock 3111T/C gene polymorphism.

TI  - Explorative Prospective Evaluation of Short-Term Subjective Effects of Hormonal Treatment in Trans People-Results from the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Although many studies on the short- and long-term effects of hormonal treatment (HT) in trans people focus on objective changes such as body composition or bone density, few studies have evaluated self-reported effects of HT.
   Aim: To evaluate self-reported symptoms during the first year of HT in trans people.
   Methods: This study is part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence, a multicenter prospective cohort study. For this study, 205 trans women and 193 trans men from the gender clinics of Amsterdam, Ghent, and Florence, who were >18 years of age and started hormonal treatment were included. Questionnaires, self-developed based on the Menopause Rating scale and clinical experiences, were completed, and changes in symptom scores were analyzed using linear mixed models.
   Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported psycho vegetative symptoms, as well as physical, cognitive, emotional, sexual and genital complaints, and pain were evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months of HT using a 4-point Likert scale (no, mild, moderate, or severe complaints).
   Results: In trans men, with a median age of 23, transient increases were reported in night sweats, weight gain, and clitoral pain. Persistent increases were reported for hot flashes, balding, voice instability, acne, and increase in sexual desire, whereas emotional instability, fear, and menses decreased. For trans women, with a median age of 29, hot flashes, night sweats, fatigue, weight gain, changes in olfactory sense, brittle nails, emotional instability, mood swings, and breast tenderness increased persistently during 12 months of HT, whereas a decrease was observed for balding and sexual desire. Sleeping difficulties decreased temporarily. No changes were observed in palpitations, dizziness, abdominal complaints, anxiety, panic attacks, cognition, and pain, except for clitoral and breast pain.
   Clinical Implications: Knowledge on the occurrence of these self-reported, subjective effects and their course over time may help physicians informing trans people starting with and during HT.
   Strengths & Limitations: This study was performed in a large cohort of trans people. The follow-up period was limited to 12 months.
   Conclusion: Changes in self-reported symptoms were mentioned in all investigated areas, except cognition. Most symptoms were as expected and even desired, whereas others may be considered unpleasant by some trans people. Copyright (C) 2019, International Society for Sexual Medicine.

TI  - A Mixed Lipid Emulsion Containing Fish Oil and Its Effect on Electrophysiological Brain Maturation in Infants of Extremely Low Birth Weight: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Objective To assess whether parenteral nutrition for infants of extremely low birth weight using a mixed lipid emulsion that contains fish oil influences electrophysiological brain maturation.
   Study design The study is a prespecified secondary outcome analysis of a randomized controlled trial of 230 infants of extremely low birth weight receiving a mixed (soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil; intervention) or a soybean oil-based lipid emulsion (control). The study was conducted at a single-level IV neonatal care unit (Medical University Vienna; June 2012 to October 2015). Electrophysiological brain maturation (background activity, sleep-wake cycling, and brain maturational scores) was assessed biweekly by amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (birth to discharge).
   Results A total of 317 amplitude-integrated electroencephalography measurements (intervention: n = 165; control: n = 152) from 121 (intervention: n = 63; control: n = 58) of 230 infants of the core study were available for analysis. Demographic characteristics were not significantly different. By 28 weeks of postmenstrual age, infants receiving the intervention displayed significantly greater percentages of continuous background activity. Total maturational scores and individual scores for continuity, cycling, and bandwidth were significantly greater. Maximum maturational scores were reached 2 weeks earlier in the intervention group (36.4 weeks, 35.4-37.5) compared with the control group (38.4 weeks, 37.1-42.4) (median, IQR; P < .001).
   Conclusions Using a mixed parenteral lipid emulsion that contains fish oil, we found that electrophysiological brain maturation was accelerated in infants who were preterm.

TI  - Sleep disorders and cognitive alterations in women
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Sleep disturbances are common among women from middle age onwards, into advanced age, and they are connected to menopause. The loss of ovarian hormones can alter cognition directly but probably also through sleep disturbances, which play an important role as a risk factor and a pathogenetic factor in dementia. Alzheimer's disease is common in older women. Knowledge of the fascinating relationship between sleep disturbances and cognitive decline, and in particular the sex/gender differences, is growing but needs to be further investigated.

TI  - Insomnia and hot flashes
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - The increased prevalence of sleep disorders associated with menopause has been emphasized by multiple international studies. Many factors are associated with insomnia during menopause, among them: hot flashes (HF), anxiety and depression, other medical conditions, behavioral and psychosocial factors and primitive sleep patterns. The domino hypothesis connects various factors and suggests that HF disturb sleep, thereby causing insomnia, which in turn increases vulnerability to depression. Nevertheless, sleep disorders predict mood disturbances more robustly than vasomotor symptoms (VMS), indicating that sleep also influences mood via other mechanisms. The medical conditions that may compromise sleep in this age group are common; they include obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, cancer, urinary incontinence and nocturia, thyroid dysfunction, chronic pain, fibromyalgia (often starting or worsening in menopause), and hypertension. Common causes of sleep disorders in middle-aged women include poor sleep hygiene, volitional factors, environmental disturbances, alcohol intake, marital dissatisfaction, requests for care from children, grandchildren and/or elderly parents, and financial worries. Evidence from other populations suggests that if insomnia is not treated, it may negatively affect the outcome of comorbid conditions. Taken together, these observations suggest that insomnia should be considered a disorder requiring specific attention and treatment. Moreover, recent cross-sectional data link sleep with subclinical markers of cardiovascular risk. It should also be noted that insomnia is common in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

TI  - Menopausal symptoms and related factors among Cambodian women
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - This study analyzed the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and associated factors among Cambodian women. A cross-sectional study was performed with 200 women aged 40-60 years in three provinces and one urban area in Cambodia from July 2017 to August 2017. Three symptom categories: somatic, psychological, and urogenital symptoms (totaling 11 symptoms) related to menopause were assessed using the Khmer version of Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Over one-fifth (21.5%) of the participants were premenopausal; 22.5% were perimenopausal, and 56% were postmenopausal. Somatic and psychological symptoms occurred more frequently than urogenital symptoms in all three statuses. The three most prevalent symptoms for all women were physical and mental exhaustion (88.1%), irritability (85.9%), and sleep problems (82.5%). The average MRS score was 12.22 +/- 5.37 (range 0-44). Postmenopausal women had significantly higher rates of menopausal symptoms than pre- and perimenopausal women. Increased severity of menopausal symptoms was associated with less personal income (<= 100 US$), higher parity (>4 children), abortion(s), use of calcium supplements, and history of heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. This study demonstrated a high prevalence of menopausal symptoms among Cambodian women in Cambodia. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to deal with independent factors associated with these symptoms.

TI  - A combined, bioidentical, oral, 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone capsule for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Many women seek treatment to alleviate menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Numerous women use combination compounded hormone therapy (CHT) to achieve the benefits of estrogen/progesterone for endometrial protection. TX-001HR is a combination of bioidentical 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in a single capsule designed for continuous daily use to treat moderate to severe VMS. Areas covered: This drug profile describes the efficacy and safety of 4 doses of this E2/P4 (mg/mg: 1/100, 0.5/100, 0.5/50, 0.25/50) for treating moderate to severe VMS in menopausal woman with a uterus. Expert opinion: In REPLENISH (NCT01942668), the two highest doses of TX-001HR significantly reduced VMS frequency and severity at 4 and 12 weeks versus placebo (co-primary endpoints); all doses met the primary endpoint of endometrial safety. Rates of amenorrhea were high and improved over time; the Menopause Quality of Life and Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep instruments improved with E2/P4. TX-001HR was well tolerated and had no clinically significant impact on vital signs, metabolic or coagulation parameters, or breast safety. The combination bioidentical E2/P4 capsule (1 mg/100 mg dose was FDA-approved as Bijuva in October 2018) may provide a safe, effective, rigorously studied alternative for women with a uterus who prefer CHT for relief of VMS.

TI  - Behavioral Predictors of Weight Regain in Postmenopausal Women: Exploratory Results From the Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta
T2  - OBESITY
AB  - Objective This secondary analysis assessed associations between changes in energy balance and sleep behaviors and the risk of weight regain following exercise-induced weight loss. Methods Of 400 participants initially randomized in the Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA), 227 lost weight following the moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise intervention (-4.2 +/- 3.6 kg) and were included in this analysis. Self-reported energy intake (EI), sleep duration, quality and timing, and objective measurements of physical activity (PA) and sedentary time were collected at the end of the intervention and the end of follow-up. Linear regression models assessed associations between changes in these behaviors and risk of weight regain during follow-up. Results Participants regained 43% of the weight lost during follow-up. Reductions in moderate to vigorous PA (beta = -1.00; 95% CI = -1.74 to -0.25 h/d; P = 0.01) and steps per day (beta = -0.0003; 95% CI = -0.0005 to -0.0001 steps/d; P = 0.004); increases in sedentary time (beta = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.02 h/d; P = 0.03), EI (beta = 0.001; 95% CI = 0.0003 to 0.002 kcal; P = 0.01), and fat intake (beta = 0.004; 95% CI = 0.001 to 0.006 kcal; P = 0.002); and delayed sleep timing midpoint (beta = 0.02; 95% CI = 0.004 to 0.03 min; P = 0.01) were associated with weight regain during follow-up. Conclusions These exploratory results suggest that reductions in moderate to vigorous PA; increases in EI, fat intake, and sedentary time; and delayed sleep timing midpoint were significantly associated with risk of weight regain.

TI  - Stimulation of nicotinic receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus results in a higher number of growing follicles and ova shed
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The timing of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge that leads to ovulation depends to a large extent on a functional circadian clock that is localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The activities of the SCN are regulated by several neurotransmitter systems, including the muscarinic system. Given that acetylcholine binds to muscarinic (mAChRs) and nicotinic (nAChRs) receptors, in the present study, we analysed the effects of unilaterally stimulating nAChRs in the left or right SCN. Stimulation treatment was administered in rats in pro-oestrus at 09.00 or 19.00 h by injecting 0.3 mu l of a nicotine solution (200 mu m). The effects of the stimulation were assessed by evaluating the number of ova shed, the number of ovarian follicles, and the levels of oestradiol and progesterone in serum 24 h after treatment. We observed that regardless of the time (4 h after lights on, 09.00 h, or immediately after lights off, 19.00 h) or the side of the SCN treated, the unilateral microinjection of nicotine resulted in a higher number of ova shed and higher number of growing follicles in the ovaries as well as higher oestradiol serum levels. When the nicotine microinjection treatment failed to reach the SCN, the oestradiol levels in serum were similar to those of animals treated with vehicle solution. Based on the current results, we suggest that during pro-oestrus, the nicotinic neuronal information in the SCN modulates follicular growth and ovulation in a stimulatory manner.

TI  - Impaired sleep quality is associated with concurrent elevations in inflammatory markers: are post-menopausal women at greater risk?
T2  - BIOLOGY OF SEX DIFFERENCES
AB  - BackgroundChronic inflammation and impaired sleep increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. Menopausal women may be particularly at risk as a result of impaired sleep. The objective of the current investigation was to assess the relationship between poor sleep and C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in healthy non- and postmenopausal women and men.MethodsA fasting blood draw was obtained from 122 healthy men and women (31 were postmenopausal). Higher scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to define poor sleep. Given the sample size and healthy nature of the sample, hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed on a composite inflammatory score involving CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Sex/menopausal group and PSQI were entered as predictors, and the interaction of the group by PSQI was entered stepwise. Analyses on MPO were performed separately.ResultsSleep quality was associated with higher inflammatory activity (beta=0.272, P=0.003), which remained significant (P=0.046) after controlling for age, waist circumference, exercise times per week, and depressive symptoms. While in the same direction, sleep quality was not significantly associated with MPO. Dichotomizing sleep quality led to similar results.ConclusionImpaired sleep quality is independently associated with greater inflammation in healthy adult men and women. Despite an overall less favorable metabolic and inflammatory profile in postmenopausal women, impaired sleep did not emerge as differentially related to inflammatory activity in this group.

TI  - Reproductive Regulation and Oxidative Stress Alleviation of Chinese Herbal Medicine Therapy in Ovariectomised Mouse Model
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - In Taiwan, the herbal formula B401 is considered as a health supplement for middle-aged women that can alleviate sweating, anxiety, and sleep disorders. However, the relevant mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the beneficial effects of the herbal formula B401 therapy in the reproductive regulation of ovariectomised mice. Female ICR mice were randomised into four groups: wild-type (WT) mice with sham treatment, wild-type mice treated with the herbal formula B401, bilateral ovariectomised (OVX) mice with sham treatment, and bilateral ovariectomised mice treated with the herbal formula B401. Mice were orally given the herbal formula B401 at a dose of 30 mg/kg bw/day for 2 weeks. At the end of oral treatment with sham or the herbal formula B401, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium, phosphorus, and estradiol-17 beta in the blood; uterine weight and endometrial thickness; and expressions of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), estrogen receptor beta (ER beta), progesterone receptor (PR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in the uterine tissue were examined and then compared among the four groups of mice. We found that OVX mice decreased levels of calcium, phosphorus, and estradiol-17 beta in the blood, decreased uterine weight and endometrial thickness, and decreased expressions of ER alpha, ER beta, PR, and SOD2 in the uterine tissue but increased blood ROS levels compared with those of WT mice. In addition, OVX mice with the herbal formula B401 therapy can increase levels of calcium, phosphorus, and estradiol-17 beta in the blood, increase uterine weight and endometrial thickness, and increase expressions of ER alpha, ER beta, PR, VEGF, and SOD2 in the uterine tissue but decrease blood ROS levels. Our results may provide reasonable explanation for the reproductive regulation of the herbal formula B401 therapy.

TI  - A 30-year study of body temperature variations correlated with menstrual cycle, seasonality, and aging
T2  - BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH
AB  - Studies of human body temperature typically involve a small number of subjects or measurements taken over a relatively short timeframe. To enhance the size of the data-set and more reliably distinguish outlying values, oral temperature was measured each evening in a single female subject for 30 years. The results confirmed the well-known temperature variations during the menstrual cycle and the decreased temperature in older adults compared to young adults. The present study's large data-set extended these results, revealing a gradual decline in temperature with advancing age during middle-age and a rapid decline in temperature during menopause. The results also revealed a convincing seasonal variation in body temperature that peaked in August and were lowest in February-March. A modest shift in body temperature was also related to daylight-saving time change. These results confirm and extend the findings of earlier studies, showing the relationship of body temperature to the menstrual cycle, seasonality, and aging.

TI  - Assessment of sexual activity and menopausal symptoms in middle-aged Chinese women using the Menopause Rating Scale
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess sexual activity and menopausal symptoms in middle-aged Chinese women and to correlate this with their vaginal maturation status (VMS).Methods: 120 women aged 45-60years were assigned to four groups: premenopause (Pre-M), perimenopause (Peri-M), early postmenopause (Post-EM), and late postmenopause (Post-LM). The menopausal symptoms were assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale. VMS was determined using the vaginal maturation index (VMI) and pH value. Sexual activity including sexual frequency and distress was measured using self-administered questionnaires.Results: A high proportion (48.2%) of Post-LM women reported low sexual frequency, and a high proportion (24.2%) of Peri-M women reported sexual distress. Physical/mental exhaustion and sexual problems were the most prevalent symptoms, followed by sleeping problems and hot flushes/sweating rated as severe or very severe. Physical/mental exhaustion and sexual problems became more frequent as menopausal stages progressed (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Hot flushes/sweating was more prominent in women in the Peri-M and Post-EM groups. The Post-LM group exhibited lower VMI and higher pH values than the Pre-M and Peri-M groups (p<0.017 and p<0.001, respectively), and pH was positively correlated with sexual problems (r=0.298, p<0.01).Conclusions: Advancing menopausal status is associated with prevalent physical/mental exhaustion and sexual problems in middle-aged Chinese women. Hot flushes/sweating is among the most frequent menopausal symptoms rated as severe or very severe. In addition, urogenital symptoms are correlated with pH in these women.

TI  - Impact of endogenous and exogenous progesterone exposure on stress biomarkers: a systematic review
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Stress activates the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). Based on a systematic literature review of the impact of endogenous and exogenous exposure with natural progesterone on the stress response in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women, the following conclusions can be drawn: the HPAA activity was not relevantly affected by endogenous progesterone exposure across the menstrual cycle, but might be reduced by exogenous micronized progesterone application; in contrast, the ANS has a sympathetic predominance in the (progesterone-dominated) luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Future studies should assess various stress biomarkers under various hormonal conditions to, for example, allow for cardiovascular risk stratification in hormone users.

TI  - Relationship between seasons and pregnancy rates during intrauterine insemination. A historical cohort
T2  - SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - BACKGROUND: The underlying cause of seasonal infertility in humans is unclear, but is likely to be multifactorial.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to compare the pregnancy rates among infertile women who underwent induced ovulation and intrauterine insemination (IUI) with the season in which the fertility treatment was performed.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 466 patients who were treated in the reproductive endocrinology and infertility outpatient clinic of a tertiary-level women's healthcare and maternity hospital.
   METHODS: Retrospective demographic, hormonal and ultrasonographic data were obtained from the patients' medical records. Clomiphene citrate or gonadotropin medications were used for induced ovulation. The patients were divided into four groups according to the season (spring, winter, autumn and summer) in which fertility treatment was received. Clinical pregnancy rates were calculated and compared between these four groups.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the seasonal groups in terms of age, infertility type, ovarian reserve tests, duration of infertility, medications used or length of stimulation. A total of 337 patients (723%) were treated with clomiphene citrate and 129 (27.7%) with gonadotropin; no significant difference between these two groups was observed. The clinical pregnancy rates for the spring, winter, autumn and summer groups were 15.6% (n = 24), 8.6% (n = 9), 11.5% (n = 13) and 7.4% (n = 7), respectively (P = 0.174).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the spring group had the highest pregnancy rate, the rates of successful lUI did not differ significantly between the seasonal groups.

TI  - The Role of Estrogen in Brain and Cognitive Aging
T2  - NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - There are 3 common physiological estrogens, of which estradiol (E2) is seen to decline rapidly over the menopausal transition. This decline in E2 has been associated with a number of changes in the brain, including cognitive changes, effects on sleep, and effects on mood. These effects have been demonstrated in both rodent and non-human preclinical models. Furthermore, E2 interactions have been indicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. In normal brain aging, there are a number of systems that undergo changes and a number of these show interactions with E2, particularly the cholinergic system, the dopaminergic system, and mitochondrial function. E2 treatment has been shown to ameliorate some of the behavioral and morphological changes seen in preclinical models of menopause; however, in clinical populations, the effects of E2 treatment on cognitive changes after menopause are mixed. The future use of sex hormone treatment will likely focus on personalized or precision medicine for the prevention or treatment of cognitive disturbances during aging, with a better understanding of who may benefit from such treatment.

TI  - Menopause symptoms and chronic pain in a national sample of midlife women veterans
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Women are more likely than men to suffer chronic pain, with the highest rates seen in midlife. The symptoms that characterize menopause broadly affect health and well-being, but their contribution to chronic pain risk during this period is poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined relationships between indicators of menopause symptoms and chronic pain among midlife women veterans, a population with prevalent chronic pain diagnoses and elevated risk for bothersome menopause symptoms.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of national Veterans Health Administration medical and pharmacy records. Using national medical and pharmacy records from women veterans aged 45 to 64 with at least one VA encounter during 2014 and/or 2015 (n = 200,901), we developed multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations between menopause symptoms (defined by menopause symptom-related diagnoses on >= 2 encounters and/or menopause hormone therapy use) and chronic pain outcomes, adjusting for age, race, body mass index, mental health diagnoses, and substance use disorders.
   Results: In this national sample of midlife women veterans (mean age 54.3 +/- 5.4), 13% had menopause symptoms, 52% had chronic pain, and 22% had +/- 2 distinct chronic pain diagnoses. In multivariable analyses, women with menopause symptoms had nearly two-fold odds of chronic pain (odds ratio 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.79-1.90, P< 0.001) and multiple chronic pain diagnoses (odds ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.74-1.83, P< 0.001).
   Conclusions: These findings raise the possibility within this vulnerable critical period, midlife women with a higher menopause symptom burden may be most vulnerable for chronic pain.

TI  - Cardiovascular reactivity and psychological hyperarousal in hot flash-associated insomnia disorder
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: Given the neurocognitive hyperarousal observed in patients with insomnia disorder and associations of nocturnal hot flashes with cardiovascular disease risk, we examined whether women with hot flash-associated insomnia disorder demonstrate exaggerated cardiovascular responsivity to acute stressors, and also a profile of psychological hyperarousal.
   Methods: Peri and postmenopausal women with and without hot flash-associated insomnia disorder underwent assessments of cardiovascular autonomic responsivity to acute stress paradigms and psychological hyperarousal. Hemodynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure) to nociceptive, social-evaluative, and cognitive stress paradigms were measured in the morning. Psychological hyperarousal was evaluated using questionnaires assessing daytime and presleep hyperarousal, anxiety, and sleep-related cognitions.
   Results: Women (25 with and 15 without hot flash-associated insomnia) aged 53.4 +/- 4.8 years reported a range of insomnia symptoms. Resting-state hemodynamics were similar between groups. Heart rate and blood pressure responses to stress paradigms did not differ by group nor did they correlate with insomnia severity. Women with insomnia disorder had higher generalized anxiety disorder scores (mean 2.7 +/- 3.0 vs 1.0 +/- 1.4; P = 0.05) and sleeprelated cognitions than those without insomnia (P <= 0.05). Insomnia symptom severity was moderately correlated with presleep and daytime hyperarousal, anxiety, and sleep-related cognition (all r >= 0.43).
   Conclusions: Though hot flash-associated insomnia is characterized by psychological hyperarousal before sleep and during the daytime, it does not relate to cardiovascular responsiveness to acute stressors. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that altered cardiovascular control is a potential mechanism by which hot flash-associated insomnia confers higher cardiovascular disease risk.

TI  - Higher amounts of sedentary time are associated with short sleep duration and poor sleep quality in postmenopausal women
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives To evaluate the associations between sedentary time, total (total-PA), light (light-PA), moderate (MOD-PA), and vigorous (VIG-PA) physical activity with indices of sleep in postmenopausal women.
   Methods Baseline self-reported data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (n = 75074) were used in this cross-sectional analysis. Total-PA, light-PA, MOD-PA, and VIG-PA were categorized by metabolic equivalents of the activity (MET-hour [hr]/week [wk]) and were estimated using validated questionnaires. Sedentary time was categorized by hr/day and was estimated via questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between these variables and short sleep (<= 6 hr/night), long sleep (>= 10 hr/night), poor sleep quality, and insomnia symptoms after adjustment for age, race, socioeconomic status, body mass index, health status, depressive symptoms, smoking status, alcohol use, hormone therapy, and comorbidities.
   Results Higher sedentary time (>11 hr/day) was associated with higher odds of short sleep (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-1.88), poor sleep quality (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.74-1.97), and insomnia symptoms (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.49-1.64). Light-PA (>0 MET-hr/wk) was associated with lower odds of short sleep (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92-1.00), and higher amounts of total-PA (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.97), light-PA (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89-1.00), and MOD-PA (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.97) were associated with lower odds of poor sleep quality.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that higher levels of light and moderate intensity physical activity are associated with better sleep quality, whereas higher amounts of sedentary time are associated with short sleep and lower quality sleep. Future studies should investigate the directionality of these associations and potential causal pathways.

TI  - Infertility Treatments and Long-Term Neurologic Morbidity of the Offspring
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objective To determine the risk of long-term neurologic morbidity among children (up to 18 years) born following in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation induction (OI) treatments as compared with spontaneously conceived. Study Design A population-based cohort analysis was performed, including data from the perinatal computerized database on all singleton infants born at the Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC) between the years 1991 and 2014. This perinatal database was linked and cross-matched with the SUMC computerized dataset of all pediatric hospitalizations. Results Neurologic morbidity was significantly more common in IVF (3.7%) and OI (4.1%) offspring as compared with those following spontaneous pregnancies (3.1%; p = 0.017). In particular, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders and headaches were more common in the OI group and sleep disorders in the IVF group, whereas autism and cerebral palsy were comparable between the groups. In the Weibull multivariable analysis, while controlling for maternal age, preterm delivery, birthweight centile, maternal diabetes, and hypertensive disorders, IVF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.71; p = 0.001), but not OI (adjusted HR: 1.17' 95% CI: 0.92-1.48; p = 0.196), was noted as an independent risk factor for long-term pediatric neurologic morbidity. Conclusion IVF offspring appear to be at an increased risk of long-term neurologic morbidity up to 18 years of age.

TI  - Loss of quality of sleep and associated factors among menopausal women
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
AB  - The scope of this article is to identify the prevalence of the loss of quality of sleep and associated factors among menopausal women. It is a quantitative, cross-sectional and analytical study, the variables of which were investigated by applying a structured/pre-tested questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index with 819 menopausal women cared for under the Family Health Strategy. Simple Poisson regression was used to screen the variables (p < 0.25). For multiple analysis, Poisson regression was used based on a hierarchical model, at a significance level of 5%. Loss of quality of sleep was identified in 67% of the sample. Variables such as advanced age (PR = 1.09; CI = 1.03-1.16), moderate and severe menopausal symptoms (PR = 1.18; CI = 1.10-1.27), moderate to severe anxiety (PR = 1.17; CI = 1.10-1.25), moderate to severe depression (PR = 1.08; CI = 1.01-1.15) and arthritis/arthrosis/rheumatism (PR = 1. 07; CI = 1.01 - 1.14) revealed statistically significant associations with loss of quality of sleep. The loss of quality of sleep was highly prevalent in the population studied. Factors associated with loss of quality of sleep were advanced age, moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, moderate to severe anxiety and depression, and the presence of arthritis/arthrosis/rheumatism.

TI  - Long-term sleep habits and the risk of breast cancer among Chinese women: a case-control study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
AB  - Previous observational studies have inconsistently suggested that poor sleep is a novel risk factor for breast cancer (BC). However, these studies mainly focused on sleep duration; other sleep domains were rarely reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of a broad range of sleep domains with the risk of BC incidence. We used a community-based 1 : 1 individual matched case-control design that included 401 female patients with incident BC and 401 age-matched and area-matched female controls in Jiujiang, China. Long-term sleep habits were assessed comprehensively using a validated 17-item Sleep Factors Questionnaire. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Light exposure at night (highest vs. lowest level, aOR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.06-2.68), habitual timing of sleep (after 12 a.m. midnight vs. before 22 p.m., aOR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-2.62), night/shift work (yes vs. no, aOR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.04-2.71), and frequency of night-time wakings (>2 per night vs. never, aOR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.10-2.96) were associated with an increased risk of BC after mutually adjusting for other sleep parameters. These positive associations remained irrespective of menopausal status and tumor estrogen receptor status. There was no association between sleep duration, sleep quality, sleep medication use, insomnia frequency, daytime nap, and the risk of BC. Our results indicate that sleep problems including light exposure at night, night/shift work, late sleeping, and frequent night waking could increase the risk of BC development, independent of other sleep factors.

TI  - Effect of environmental factors and changes in the body condition score on the onset of the breeding season in mares
T2  - REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS
AB  - Several methods have been proposed to advance the onset of the breeding season in horses. Most of them are based on the exposure to an artificial lighting period combined with hormonal treatments. Mares exposed to an artificial photoperiod are most often housed indoors where the ambient temperature is often higher than the outside temperature. Mares held in barns are also exposed to different daylight intensities than horses kept outside, depending on the architecture. In the current study, we evaluated the impact of ambient temperature, daylight intensity and changes in body condition score (BCS) on the timing of first ovulation after winter anestrus in mares exposed to an artificial photoperiod. Mares (n = 211) were housed in barns with different ambient temperature and daylight exposure but with the same artificial photoperiod exposure (except for a natural photoperiod control group). Artificial photoperiod as well as an increase in BCS over the winter significantly advanced the first spring ovulation. The BCS at the start and end of the anestrus period did not have an effect on the interval to first ovulation and neither did the modest increase in ambient temperature in the barn. However, a higher light intensity during the daytime significantly advanced the first spring ovulation. The results of this study suggest that exposure to more sunlight advances the onset of the breeding season. This effect is likely mediated through the biological effect of short wavelength blue light and its impact on melatonin suppression and biological rhythms. We suggest that greater/direct exposure to the blue light component of daylight improves the response to the artificial photoperiod. The results of the present study can further assist to optimize the conditions that lead to an efficient spring transition of breeding mares.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Review
T2  - US PHARMACIST
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic condition in which the upper airway collapses frequently during sleep and leads to breathing cessation. Higher-risk populations include males, women who have reached menopause, obese individuals, and patients with craniofacial abnormalities. Persons with OSA present with snoring, choking during sleep, nocturia, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Failure to address OSA not only compromises the patient's quality of life but also increases the risk of mortality. Pharmacists can assist in the management of OSA by providing counseling regarding therapy and recommending lifestyle changes.

TI  - Bone turnover is altered during 72h of sleep restriction: a controlled laboratory study
T2  - ENDOCRINE
AB  - PurposeThe objective of the study was to evaluate how controlled, short-term sleep restriction (SR; 72h) alters markers of bone formation and resorption and urinary calcium (Ca) output.MethodsTen healthy, sleep-adequate, male soldiers were housed in the research facility one day prior to and for the duration of SR. Diet was controlled to provide adequate energy balance and macronutrient distribution, meeting the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for Ca. Subjects engaged in light activities to maintain wakefulness and were allowed 2h of sleep per night (0430-0630 hours). Blood samples were collected each morning at 0h (baseline) and 24, 48, and 72h of SR. Serum was assayed for parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX). Urine was collected in 24h increments during SR for measurement of Ca and creatinine (Cr).ResultsBAP was reduced at 24h (P=0.015) and resorption markers TRAP and CTX were increased after 48 and 72h of SR compared to baseline (P<0.05). The ratio of BAP:TRAP was significantly lower (P=0.017) at 48 and 72h of SR. In contrast, total 24h urinary Ca and Ca/Cr excretion were unchanged.ConclusionsMarkers of bone formation and resorption are uncoupled in response to as little as 48h of SR even when Ca intake is at the RDA. Sleep deprivation may be a risk factor for reduced bone health due to perturbations in bone turnover.

TI  - Fertility treatments and the risk of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea in the offspring-Results from a population-based cohort study
T2  - PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY
AB  - Objective While the impact of fertility treatments on the perinatal outcome is well established, the long-term effects on offspring are yet to be determined. The current study aimed to investigate the risk of long-term obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among children born following in vitro fertilization (IVF) and ovulation induction (OI) as compared with spontaneously conceived pregnancies. Study design A retrospective population-based cohort study was performed. Exposure was defined as delivery following pregnancies conceived by IVF or OI. Incidence of OSA related hospitalizations of the offspring, up to the age of 18 years, was evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve and multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the association. Results During the study period, 242 187 singleton deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 1.1% were conceived following IVF (n = 2603), and 0.7% following OI (n = 1721). Offspring hospitalization rates, involving OSA (n = 1607), were higher among children conceived following IVF and OI pregnancies as compared with the rate in children conceived spontaneously (1.4% vs 1.2% vs 0.7%, respectively; P < .001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of OSA related hospitalizations following IVF and OI (log-rank P < .001). Using multiple Cox regression models, controlled for gestational age, maternal age, maternal smoking, maternal obesity, birthweight, offspring gender and obesity, IVF as well as OI exhibited a significant and independent association with pediatric OSA in all models with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.25, (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-3.1) and 1.63 (95% CI = 1.1-2.5), respectively. Conclusion Both IVF and OI treatments appear to be independently associated with OSA in the offspring.

TI  - Audio- and video-based estimation of the sleep stages of newborns in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
T2  - BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB  - Objective: Premature babies have several immature functions and begin their life under high medical supervision. Since the sleep organization differs across postmenstrual age, its analysis may give a good indication of the degree of brain maturation. However, sleep analysis (polysomnography or behavioral observation) is difficult to install, time consuming and cannot systematically be used. In this context, development of new ways to automatically monitor the neonates, using contactless modalities, is necessary. Therefore, this study presents an innovative non-invasive approach to semi-automatize the classification of infant behavioral sleep states.
   Methods: First, three descriptors were extracted from audio and video recordings: vocalizations, motion and eye state of the baby. For this purpose, an original semi-automatic algorithm for the estimation of the eye state was proposed. Secondly, the three descriptors were used in order to obtain an estimation of the behavioral sleep states. Five classifiers (K-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, random forest and multi-layer perceptron) were compared to an expert annotation.
   Results: Firstly, the comparison of the semi-automatic eye state estimation to manual annotations of 10 videos led to a mean accuracy of 99.4%. Secondly, sleep stage classification was performed. Best results were obtained with random forest, for quiet alert and active alert stages, with 93.5% and 99.0% of accuracy respectively.
   Conclusion: The proposed method provides a high capacity to identify alert sleep stages but the differentiation between quiet sleep and active sleep only by behavioral observations still remains a difficult task to achieve.
   Significance: Results presented in this paper are new since no similar approach was proposed in the literature in the context of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. They augur well for the automatic sleep organization assessment to improve newborn care. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of rotating work schedules, chronotype, and restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease on sleep quality among female hospital nurses and midwives: A cross-sectional survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES
AB  - Background: Decreases in subjective sleep quality are prevalent among nurses and midwives engaged in rotating shift work.
   Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the relationship between differences in work schedules and subjective sleep quality among female nursing staff.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used for descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Data collection was conducted from December 2016 to September 2017.
   Settings: Participants were recruited from five regional core hospitals in Japan.
   Participants: A total of 1253 nurses and midwives were included in the final analysis.
   Methods: Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Chronotype and social jet lag were calculated for both work day and work-free day. Symptoms related to restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease were assessed using the Japanese version of the Cambridge Hopkins questionnaire short form 13. Participants with the urge to move their legs, though not fulfilling the restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease criteria, were classified as having leg motor restlessness. Logistic regression analyses for poor sleep were adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, drinking, menstruation status, the presence of premenstrual syndrome, and the presence of a spouse.
   Results: Rates of poor sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score >= 6) among those working, day shifts, rotating 12.5 hour night shifts, rotating 16 hour night shifts, and three-shift rotations were 41.2%, 51.1%, 44.5%, and 60.4%, respectively. Approximately 40% of three-shift rotation workers experienced difficulty initiating sleep. Shift workers tended to exhibit evening chronotype, delayed sleep phase, and high social jet lag. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease was 2.5%. Leg motor restlessness was observed in. 15.5% of participants. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of three-shift work (vs. day shift), evening chronotype (vs. morning chronotype), and the presence of leg motor restlessness (vs. no leg motor restlessness) for those with poor sleep were 2.20 (1.47-3.30), 1.95 (1.292.94), and 1.66 (1.15-2.39), respectively.
   Conclusions: Regardless of the working schedules, rates of poor sleep were high among female hospital nurses and midwives. Our findings suggest that poor sleep quality is influenced by three-shift rotation, the evening chronotype, and leg motor restlessness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME AND ITS METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES: A MINI REVIEW
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES AND RESEARCH
AB  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive metabolic disorder affecting nearly 20% females, globally. Though Rotterdam consensus is widely used for assessment, it lacks definite diagnostic guidelines. Absence of PCOS guidelines for adolescent and post-menopausal women might be influencing the prevalence data. The prevalence varied with ethnicities and found high in urban than rural. Among women in reproductive age, the obese rural population also found vulnerable to PCOS, indicates the role of lifestyle factors in this syndrome. Erratic lifestyle predisposes to insulin resistance, or obesity leads to subsequent hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia. Also, genetic predisposition to hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis dysfunction and impaired ovarian steroidogenesis further influence the disorder. It dysregulates the oocyte maturation leading to polycystic ovaries, thereby, affects the normal ovarian functions. The environmental toxins which are endocrine disruptors further worsens the consequence of the disorder. Multiple factors make it difficult to decipher the independent pathway of pathogenesis. Apart from ovulatory and reproductive dysfunctions, PCOS have chronic metabolic consequences: cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, and non-fatty liver. These factors are interdependent and progressive. Since the studies have contradicting results; ifs difficult to determine the impact of these consequences. Both non-obese and obese PCOS women found vulnerable to the same metabolic consequences. Hence, further long term, controlled studies are required to understand the exact pathogenesis and metabolic consequences both in obese and non-obese PCOS women. Moreover, both regional and multicentre cohort studies are required to understand the progression of disease in different ethnicities.

TI  - Measuring testosterone in women and men
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Measurement of serum testosterone (T) level is of utmost importance for the evaluation of hypogonadism in men and androgen excess in women. Despite the advances in steroid hormone assessment, substantial variability exists regarding measurement of T concentrations. Several factors affect T measurement in men, including circadian rhythms, intra-individual daily variability and transient stressors, while T concentrations in women vary mainly according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. Most of the available immunoassays lack the required accuracy when dealing with T concentrations at the lower end of the normal range for men and across the entire range for females. Consequently, there is no universally accepted lower T threshold for healthy adult men and most immunoassays fail to detect states of mild androgen excess in women. Mass spectrometry is considered the gold-standard method for T measurement; however, due to its complexity and cost, it has not been widely adopted. To increase accuracy, T in men should be measured with a fasting morning sample and repeated if the level is found to be low; in women, measurement must be performed at the follicular phase of the cycle. In both cases, borderline results may be clarified by the assessment of free testosterone (IT). Since most fT assays are unreliable, calculated surrogates should be used instead. Collaborative efforts have been undertaken, with rigorous internal and external quality controls and the establishment of reference methods, to harmonise the commercial assays.

TI  - The Hekinan Children's Study: Design and Profile of Participants at Baseline
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: The early life environment is now recognized as a key factor contributing to susceptibility to certain diseases in later life.
   Methods: We initiated a cohort study among school children in 2011 to primarily investigate the associations between lifestyle and environmental factors and some surrogate markers of chronic diseases, such as cardiometabolic risk factors (ie, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood glucose, insulin, or lipids) and cancer risk factors (ie. height and age at menarche). A baseline questionnaire asked for information, including demographic variables, medical history and use of medication, dietary habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and behavioral and emotional problems of children. Follow-up surveys are planned for the fourth grade of elementary school and the first grade of junior high school. At these follow-up surveys, fasting blood samples will be obtained to measure cardiometabolic markers. We also checked the validity of a food frequency questionnaire, which was originally created for 6-year-olds but was modified for use in older children.
   Results: A total of 3,141 first-year students at elementary schools in Hekinan City, Aichi Prefecture, participated in the study. The response rate was 87.4%. The means of age and body mass index were 6.99 (standard deviation, 0.28) years and 15.3 (standard deviation, 1.7) kg/m(2), respectively, in the 3,067 Japanese children (1,639 boys and 1,428 girls).
   Conclusions: This cohort will reveal determinants of cardiometabolic risk factors and cancer risk factors during childhood.

TI  - Age at menarche, menstrual problems, and daytime sleepiness in Chinese adolescent girls
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Menstrual problems and daytime sleepiness are prevalent in adolescent girls. Little is known about the associations between age at menarche, menstrual problems, and daytime sleepiness. This study aimed to examine the associations of age at menarche and menstrual problems with daytime sleepiness among Chinese adolescent girls.
   Methods: Of 11,831 adolescents who participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort (SABHC), 5,813 were girls and included for the analysis. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information about menstrual problems, sleep, mental health, and demographics. Daytime sleepiness was measured by the Chinese Adolescent Daytime Sleepiness Scale (CADSS).
   Results: The mean age of the girls was 15.02 (SD = 1.44) years. The prevalence rates of mild, moderate, and severe daytime sleepiness were 20.5%, 16.7%, and 5.5%, respectively. After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates (age, body mass index, physical health, physical exercise, sleep duration, sleep problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, and family social economic status), sometimes irregular (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.52), often irregular menstruation (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.17 to 2.12), moderate (OR=1.39, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.72), and severe (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.04) menstrual pain were significantly associated with increased risk of daytime sleepiness.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that menstrual irregularity and menstrual pain are associated with increased risk of daytime sleepiness. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating and intervening menstrual problems for preventing daytime sleepiness in adolescent girls.

TI  - Improvement in sleep outcomes with a 17 beta-estradiol-progesterone oral capsule (TX-001HR) for postmenopausal women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of TX-001HR, a single-capsule 17 beta-estradiol-progesterone on sleep parameters in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms (VMS) using the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS)-Sleep scale questionnaire in the REPLENISH trial.
   Methods: In the REPLENISH trial (NCT01942668), women were randomized to one of four doses of TX-001HR or placebo, and the 12-item MOS-Sleep questionnaire (secondary endpoint) was self-administered at baseline, week 12, and months 6 and 12. Changes from baseline in the MOS-Sleep total score and 7 subscale scores were analyzed for treatment groups versus placebo at all time points. Somnolence was also collected as an adverse event.
   Results: Women (mean age 55 y) were randomized to TX-001HR (estradiol/progesterone [E2/P4] [mg/mg]) doses: 1/100 (n = 415), 0.5/100 (n = 424), 0.5/50 (n = 421), 0.25/50 (n = 424), or placebo (n = 151). TX-001HR significantly improved MOS-Sleep total score, Sleep Problems Index II subscale, and sleep disturbance subscale versus placebo at all time points, except with 0.25 mg E2/50mg P4 at week 12. Differences in LS mean changes between TX-001HR and placebo for MOS-Sleep total scores ranged from -6.5 to -7.6 at 12 months (all; P <= 0.001). All doses of TX-001HR significantly improved the Sleep Problems Index I subscale at all time points. The sleep somnolence subscale significantly improved from baseline with 0.5 mg E2/100mg P4 and 0.5 mg E2/50 mg P4 at month 12. The incidence of somnolence as a treatment-emergent adverse event ranged from 0.2% to 1.2% versus 0% with placebo.
   Conclusion: TX-001HR significantly improved MOS-Sleep parameters from baseline to week 12, which was sustained for up to 12 months, and was associated with a very low incidence of somnolence.

TI  - Relationship between vasomotor symptom improvements and quality of life and sleep outcomes in menopausal women treated with oral, combined 17 beta-estradiol/progesterone
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To characterize the impact of TX-001HR on the relationship between vasomotor symptom (VMS) improvement and quality of life and sleep.
   Methods: REPLENISH (NCT01942668) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, which evaluated four daily doses of 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone (E2/P4) combined in a single, oral, softgel capsule in postmenopausal women (40-65 years) with a uterus and moderate to severe VMS (>= 7/day or >= 50/week). In post hoc analyses, growth models were used to examine relationships between linear changes in VMS frequency and severity over 12 weeks and changes from baseline in the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL; total score and VMS domain) and the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep (total score, sleep problems indices I and II) questionnaire outcomes at 12 weeks with treatment compared with placebo.
   Results: Outcomes with all four E2/P4 doses were combined (n = 591) and compared with placebo (n = 135). In all 5 growth models, the effects of TX-001HR on MENQOL total score and vasomotor domain were significantly associated with changes in VMS frequency and severity observed over 12 weeks (all, P< 0.001). Treatmentmediated effects on MENQOL via VMS frequency and severity models were significant. Similar results were found with Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep total score and sleep problems indices.
   Conclusions: TX-001HR improvements in quality of life and sleep outcomes are associated with and may be mediated through improvements in VMS frequency and severity.

TI  - Effects of bariatric surgery on obese polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SURGERY FOR OBESITY AND RELATED DISEASES
AB  - Background: Bariatric surgery has been widely used for the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and sleep apnea syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine metabolic disease; however, little attention has been paid to the efficacy of bariatric surgery on PCOS.
   Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of bariatric surgery on obese PCOS patients.
   Setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis at a university hospital.
   Methods: Online databases were searched for all studies reporting the efficacy of bariatric surgery for obese patients with PCOS up to October 2018.
   Results: A total of 9 studies with 234 obese PCOS patients were included in this article. The results of meta-analysis showed that after bariatric surgery, there was a significant reduction of the incidence of abnormal menstruation (relative risk [RR] .23; 95% confidence interval [CI].13-.43; P < .00001) and hirsutism (RR .47; 95% CI .28-.79; P = .004). Bariatric surgery can also cause a decrease in the serum total testosterone level (mean difference [MD] = 25.82; 95% CI -30.06 to -21.58; P < .00001), serum free testosterone level (MD = -4.10; 95% CI -6.97 to -1.23; P = .005), and body mass index (MD = -14.51; 95% CI -17.88 to -11.14; P < .00001). It also showed a significant effect on T2D (RR.09; 95% CI .03-.32; P = .0002) and hypertension (RR .21; 95% CI .05-.98; P = .05) in obese patients with PCOS.
   Conclusions: Bariatric surgery can reduce the incidence of abnormal menstruation, improve hyperandrogenism and its clinical manifestations, and decrease the body mass index, prevalence of T2D, and hypertension in obese patients with PCOS.

TI  - The differences in the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea severity and trabecular bone score in men and women with type 2 diabetes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Aims: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may adversely affect bone. Gender is a well-established factor influencing bone health. We investigated the impact of OSA on bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in T2DM.
   Methods: Eighty-one T2DM patients [33 men and 48 women] participated. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor, with its severity assessed by an apnea hypopnia index (pAHI). The measurements of hypoxia, including the percentage of total sleep time in which oxygen saturation remains below 90% (pT90), the oxygen desaturation index (pODI) and minimum O-2 (min O-2), were reported. Lumbar spine (L1-4) and femoral neck (FN) BMD were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). TBS was computed from DXA images.
   Results: Sixty-five patients (80.2%) had OSA. pAHI, pT90, pODI and min O-2 were not correlated to L1-4 BMD, FN BMD or TBS in all participants by multiple regression analyses adjusting for age, gender and BMI. However, an interaction between gender and pAHI, and gender and pODI were significantly associated with TBS (b = 0.003, p = 0.034 and b = 0.004, p = 0.046, respectively). We therefore reassessed an association between pAHI or pODI and TBS separately between men and women. After adjusting for age and BMI, more severe OSA (higher pAHI) and higher pODI significantly associated with lower TBS (b = -0.002, p = 0.034 and b = -0.003, p = 0.021, respectively) in men. On the other hand, higher pAHI non-significantly associated with better trabecular microarchitecture as indicated by higher TBS (b = 0.002, p = 0.059) in women. When considered only postmenopausal (n = 33), higher pAHI and higher pODI were significantly associated with higher TBS (b = 0.004, p = 0.003 and b = 0.004, p = 0.008, respectively).
   Conclusions: In T2DM patients, there is a complex interrelationship among OSA severity, gender and TBS. More severe OSA predicted lower TBS in men, but predicted higher TBS in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Menopausal Symptoms and Quality of Life Among Breast Cancer Patients with Chemotherapy-induced Amenorrhea
T2  - ASIAN ONCOLOGY NURSING
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the severity of menopausal symptoms and their impact on the quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants were 112 breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. They completed the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Pearsoris correlation coefficients, and multiple regression with SPSS/WIN 23.0. Results: The prevalence of symptoms among the participants were as follows sleep problems, 88.4%; physical and mental exhaustion, 80.4%; joint and muscular discomfort 76.8%; and depression, 70.5%. Menopausal symptoms had a significant negative association with QOL. The results of the regression analysis showed that psychological and urogenital symptoms were statistically significant in explaining patients QOL and accounted for 70% of the total variance Condusion: Menopausal symptoms appear to be a significant problem for premenopausal breast cancer patients. Assessment and control of menopausal symptoms played a large role in maintaining the quality of life in breast cancer patients.

TI  - PSYCHOSOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF BACKACHE IN FEMALES
T2  - INDO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Backache is subjective perception of pain in low back buttocks or legs. It is a frustrating cause of chronic physical impairment in females. Backache in females is a substantial problem.
   Objectives: To identify the following psycho social factors associated with backache in females i.e. Pregnancy, Obesity, Aging, High heel shoes, Major Depressive Disorder, Malnutrition, Work overload(profession), Awkward working posture, Excessive household work, Unsuitable sleeping conditions, Sedentary lifestyle, Menopause, Domestic violence, Fibromyalgia Rheumatica, Somatization disorder, Oral contraceptives. This association between backache and these psychosocial determinants was found by a case control study in a period of 3 months (1st July to 30th September).
   Design: Population based Case Control study.
   Place And Duration: Urban Lahore from January 1st to March 31st 2017.
   Subjects and Methods: A population-based case-control study with 1:1 case to control ratio was conducted. A total of 100 persons (50 cases and 50 controls) were recruited in the study. Selection was made on laid down criteria from adult population living in Urban Lahore after taking due consent. Interviews were conducted through a pretested questionnaire by a group of trained medical doctors of the Department of Community Medicine, King Edward Medical University, Pakistan.
   Results: Our research included females of age group 18-55 years. It was found that backache is more in females above 36 years of age (65%) who were working women (60%) and married (61%). In Bivariate Analysis backache was found to be significantly associated with Major Depressive Disorder (OR:16.00 ,CI:3.483-73.408) Excessive household work(OR:14.462 ,CI: 3.972-52.656) Awkward working posture( OR: 7.319, CI: 3.025-17.705) Obesity (OR:6.143, CI: 2.323-16.242) Fibromyalgia Rhuematica (OR: 5.156,CI:1.86-16.3444) Somatization disorder (OR:5.505,CI: 1.460-20.755) High heel shoes (OR:5.412,CI: 1.660-17.646) Work overload (OR:4.472,CI: 1.355-14.755) Malnutrition (R:4,448,CI:1.675-11.811) Unstable Sleeping Conditions (OR:4.125 CI: 1.473-11.555)Pregnancy (OR: 3.841 ,CI: 1.610-9.161) Domestic Voilence (OR: 3.019,CI: 1.315-6.929) Marital status (OR: 2.279,CI: 1.017-5.108). However in multivariate analysis while controlling all other risk factors; Major Depressive Disorder (OR: 20.891, CI: 2.07-2113.007) High heel shoes (OR:7.777, CI:1.28-466.376) and Fibromyalgia rheumatica (OR:4.757, CI:2.5-921.082) were found to be significantly associated with backache in females.
   Conclusion: Backache was significantly associated with Major Depressive Disorder, High heel shoes and Fibromyalgia Rheumatica.

TI  - Efficacy of a standardised acupuncture approach for women with bothersome menopausal symptoms: a pragmatic randomised study in primary care (the ACOM study)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective To investigate the efficacy of a standardised brief acupuncture approach for women with moderate-tosevere menopausal symptoms.
   Design Randomised and controlled, with 1: 1 allocation to the intervention group or the control group. The assessor and the statistician were blinded.
   Setting Nine Danish primary care practices.
   Participants 70 women with moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms and nine general practitioners with accredited education in acupuncture.
   Intervention The acupuncture style was western medical with a standardised approach in the predefined acupuncture points CV-3, CV-4, LR-8, SP-6 and SP-9. The intervention group received one treatment for five consecutive weeks. The control group was offered treatment after 6 weeks.
   Main outcome measures Outcomes were the differences between the randomisation groups in changes to mean scores using the scales in the MenoScores Questionnaire, measured from baseline to week 6. The primary outcome was the hot flushes scale; the secondary outcomes were the other scales in the questionnaire. All analyses were based on intention-to-treat analysis.
   Results 36 participants received the intervention, and 34 participants were in the control group. Four participants dropped out before week 6. The acupuncture intervention significantly decreased hot flushes: Delta-1.6 (95% CI [-2.3 to -0.8]; p< 0.0001), day-and-night sweats: Delta-1.2 (95% CI [-2.0 to -0.4]; p= 0.0056), general sweating:. -0.9(95% CI [-1.6 to -0.2]; p= 0.0086), menopausalspecific sleeping problems: Delta-1.8 (95% CI [-2.7 to -1.0]; p< 0.0001), emotional symptoms: Delta-3.4 (95% CI [-5.3 to -1.4]; p=0.0008), physical symptoms: Delta-1.7 (95% CI [-3 to -0.4]; p=0.010) and skin and hair symptoms: Delta-1.5 (95% CI [-2.5 to -0.6]; p=0.0021) compared with the control group at the 6-week followup. The pattern of decrease in hot flushes, emotional symptoms, skin and hair symptoms was already apparent 3 weeks into the study. Mild potential adverse effects were reported by four participants, but no severe adverse effects were reported.
   Conclusions The standardised and brief acupuncture treatment produced a fast and clinically relevant reductionin moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms during the six-week intervention. No severe adverse effects were reported.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for perimenopausal insomnia: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACUPUNCTURE AND TUINA SCIENCE
AB  - ObjectiveTo observe the effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) plus Luohua Anshen oral liquid for patients with perimenopausal insomnia.MethodsA total of 66 participants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the randomized controlled trial and allocated to a treatment group and a control group at a ratio of 1:1, with 33 cases in each group. Both groups were given Luohua Anshen oral liquid as a basic treatment. The treatment group was additionally given EA every other day, three times a week. Both groups were treated for four weeks and a four-week follow-up was conducted. The scores of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Kupperman index (KI) and traditional Chinese medicine sleep syndrome scale (TCMSSS) were recorded at pre- and post-treatment, and at the follow-up. Meanwhile, adverse effects were monitored and recorded.ResultsAfter four-week treatment, the global scores of PSQI, KI and TCMSSS in both groups declined significantly (all P<0.05), and the decreases in the treatment group were more significant than those in the control group (all P<0.05). The global scores of PSQI, KI and TCMSSS in both groups at the follow-up visit were significantly different from the corresponding baseline (all P<0.05), while insignificantly different from those assessed at post-treatment (all P>0.05). The total effective rate was 93.9% in the treatment group, significantly higher than 72.2% in the control group (P<0.05). No significant adverse event was reported in this trial excepted one patient experienced slight dizziness in the first acupuncture treatment.ConclusionEA plus Luohua Anshen oral liquid is safe for perimenopausal insomnia with satisfactory short- and long-term effectiveness, and it shows certain advantage compared with using Luohua Anshen oral liquid alone.

TI  - Roles of oestradiol receptor alpha and beta against hypertension and brain mitochondrial dysfunction under intermittent hypoxia in female rats
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGICA
AB  - AimChronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) induces systemic (hypertension) and central alterations (mitochondrial dysfunction underlying cognitive deficits). We hypothesized that agonists of oestradiol receptors (ER) and prevent CIH-induced hypertension and brain mitochondrial dysfunction.
   MethodsOvariectomized female rats were implanted with osmotic pumps delivering vehicle (Veh), the ER agonist propylpyraoletriol (PPT 30g/kg/day) or the ER agonist diarylpropionitril (DPN 100g/kg/day). Animals were exposed to CIH (21%-10% FIO2 10 cycles/hour - 8hours/day - 7days) or normoxia. Arterial blood pressure was measured after CIH or normoxia exposures. Mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 production were measured in brain cortex with high-resolution respirometry, as well as activity of complex I and IV of the electron transport chain, citrate synthase, pyruvate, and lactate dehydrogenase (PDH and LDH).
   ResultsPropylpyraoletriol but not DPN prevented the rise of arterial pressure induced by CIH. CIH exposures decreased O-2 consumption, complex I activity, and increased H2O2 production. CIH had no effect on citrate synthase activity, but decreased PDH activity and increased LDH activity indicating higher anaerobic glycolysis. Propylpyraoletriol and DPN treatments prevented all these alterations.
   ConclusionsWe conclude that in OVX female rats, the ER agonist prevents from CIH-induced hypertension while both ER and ER agonists prevent the brain mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic switch induced by CIH. These findings may have implications for menopausal women suffering of sleep apnoea regarding hormonal therapy.

TI  - Factors influencing blood pressure classification for adults: Gender differences
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING PRACTICE
AB  - Aim Hypertension is a common condition contributing to many diseases. Factors influencing blood pressure (BP) classification for adults have changed over time. This study aimed to identify factors influencing BP classification according to gender. Methods Data from the Sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2014) were used in this descriptive, cross-sectional study. Participants were 1555 adults (589 men, 966 women). Measures included demographic, health-related, and lifestyle factors. Results Compared with the male normal BP group, in the male prehypertension group, body mass index, problem drinking, and reduced sleep duration were higher; and in the male hypertension group, age, poor subjective health status, body mass index, diabetes, problem drinking, smoking, and sodium intake were higher. Compared with the female normal BP group, age, and body mass index were higher in the female prehypertension group; and age, poor subjective health status, body mass index, menopause, and diabetes were higher in the female hypertension group. Conclusion Hypertension and prehypertension prevention interventions for adults should be distinguished according to gender.

TI  - Hot Flashes Associated with Menopause in the State of Campeche, Mexico: Biometric Measurement and Self-Reported Experience
T2  - CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - The purpose of this study was to apply a phenomenological perspective in order to better understand hot flashes among 87 Maya, 60 non-Maya, and 8 uncategorized women from rural and urban communities in the state of Campeche, Mexico. We combined in-depth interviews with ambulatory hot flash monitors to show that while the majority of women had biometrically measurable sternal (75%) and nuchal (81%) hot flashes, they were less likely to report hot flashes (40%) during the study period. The number of biometrically measured hot flashes differed significantly across the four communities, but the number of reported hot flashes remained equally low. Across the entire sample, Maya and non-Maya women did not differ in the likelihood of demonstrating sternal and nuchal hot flashes, but Maya women were significantly more likely to push the buttons on the monitor to subjectively report a hot flash (48% vs. 27%). Qualitative results show that these findings can be explained by attention to the language of hot flashes (calores) and by the observation that hot flashes are naturalized by the hot and humid environment into everyday life. Women do not differentiate or separate the expression of hot flashes from the lived experience of the hot climate.

TI  - The Relationship Between Progesterone, Sleep, and LH and FSH Secretory Dynamics in Early Postmenarchal Girls
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Context: During puberty, LH pulse frequency increases during sleep; in women, LH pulse frequency slows during sleep in the early/middle follicular phase (FP) of the menstrual cycle. The origin and significance of this developmental transition are unknown.
   Objective: To determine the relationship between progesterone (P4) exposure, sleep-related slowing of LH pulses in the FP, and the intercycle FSH rise, which promotes folliculogenesis, in early postmenarchal girls.
   Methods: 23 girls (gynecologic age 0.4 to 3.5 years) underwent hormone measurements and pelvic ultrasounds during two consecutive cycles and one frequent blood sampling study with concurrent polysomnography during the FP.
   Results: Subjects demonstrated one of four patterns during cycle 1 that represent a continuum of P4 exposure: ovulatory cycles with normal or short luteal phase lengths or anovulatory cycles +/- follicle luteinization. Peak serum P4 and urine pregnanediol (Pd) in cycle 1 were inversely correlated with LH pulse frequency during sleep in the FP of cycle 2 (r = -0.5; P = 0.02 for both). The intercycle FSH rise and folliculogenesis in cycle 2 were maintained after anovulatory cycles without P4 or Pd exposure or nocturnal slowing of LH pulse frequency in the FP.
   Conclusions: During late puberty, rising P4 levels from follicle luteinization and ovulation may promote a slower LH pulse frequency during sleep in the FP. However, a normal FSH rise and follicle growth can occur in the absence of P4-associated slowing. These studies therefore suggest that an immature LH secretory pattern during sleep is unlikely to contribute to menstrual irregularity in the early postmenarchal years.

TI  - Effectiveness of a treadmill-based aerobic exercise intervention on pain, daily functioning, and quality of life in women with primary dysmenorrhea: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a treadmill-based aerobic exercise intervention on pain and associated symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea.
   Methods: Seventy women with primary dysmenorrhea were included in the study. The experimental group underwent supervised aerobic training for 4 weeks followed by unsupervised home exercise for the next 6 months. The control group continued usual care. The primary outcome was pain. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (QoL), daily functioning, and sleep.
   Results: After the 4-week training, compared to the control group exercise significantly improved primary outcomes pain quality (mean difference (MD) -1.9, 95% CI 3.8 to - 0.04, p < .05), and intensity (MD -4.7, 95% CI -9.3 to - 0.09, p < .05), but not present pain. Significant effects were also reported for pain interference (MD -1.7, 95% CI -3.4 to -0.02, p < .05) at 4 weeks; the other outcomes did not significantly differ between groups at this time. During the follow-up period of 7-months, the effect on pain improved to 22 mm (95% CI 18 to 25). Significant benefits of exercise were maintained up to 7-months for present pain, QoL and daily functioning.
   Conclusion: Exercise has significant effects on primary dysmenorrhea-related pain, QoL and function.

TI  - Hypertension and atrial fibrillation in obstructive sleep apnea: Is it a menopause issue?
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder, in which loss of pharyngeal dilator muscle tone during sleep causes recurrent collapse of the upper airway and temporary cessation of breathing. Repeated apneas and hypopneas lead to cycles of intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia, increased negative intrathoracic pressure and arousals from sleep. These consequences of OSA are associated with a cascade of cardiovascular and neurohumoral consequences, including sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, raised heart rate variability, increases in blood pressure, myocardial wall stress, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, platelet aggregation and impaired vascular endothelial function, which contribute, in turn, to increased cardiovascular risk and, in particular, to the development of chronic systemic arterial hypertension and arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF). Given that the prevalence of OSA is modified by age and gender, OSA-related cardiovascular diseases may also be affected by the same factors. This review focuses on the potential role of OSA in systemic arterial hypertension and AF, and discusses the most interesting studies on age and gender as predisposing factors.

TI  - Menopause and Sleep Apnea
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic and common adult disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of upper-airway obstruction and reopening during sleep. OSA is associated with intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic overactivity, oxidative stress and high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. It is known to be more common in men than women, partly due to differences in anatomy and functional respiratory components. There are also gender differences in reported symptoms, leading to potential under-diagnosis in females. This gender difference tends to decrease after menopause, demonstrating a role of menopausal status itself in OSA phenotypes. Aging, fat mass distribution, sex hormones and upper-airway collapsibility are postulated to play a major role in these findings. This review focuses on the most recent studies exploring gender differences in the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical features of OSA. It discusses the role of menopause in this, and explore the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

TI  - Effects of Pilates training on sleep quality, anxiety, depression and fatigue in postmenopausal women: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Objectives: To analyze the effects that a Pilates-based exercise program has on sleep quality, anxiety, depression and fatigue in community-dwelling Spanish postmenopausal women aged 60 and over.
   Study design: A total of 110 women (69.15 +/- 8.94 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. They were randomly allocated to either a control (n = 55) or a Pilates (n = 55) group.
   Main outcome measures: Sleep quality and self-perceived fatigue were assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Fatigue Severity Scale, respectively. Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
   Results: Significant improvements were observed after Pilates training in all PSQI domains as well as in the PSQI total score, with small to medium-size effects, while significant between-group differences in post-intervention measures were observed only for sleep duration (d = 0.69) and sleep disturbances (d = 0.78). Moreover, intra-and inter-group statistical differences were observed for depression (d = 0.39 and d = 0.86, respectively) and for anxiety (d = 0.43 and d = 1.27 respectively). Finally, participants in the Pilates group experienced a decrease in self-perceived fatigue after the intervention period (d = 0.32).
   Conclusions: For community-dwelling Spanish postmenopausal women aged 60 years and over, a twelve-week Pilates exercise intervention has beneficial effects on sleep quality, anxiety, depression and fatigue.

TI  - Effect of acupuncture on insomnia in menopausal women: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: The National Institutes of Health estimates the prevalence of insomnia in menopausal women at 40-50%. Some studies have shown that acupuncture might be effective in treating primary insomnia and insomnia related to depression and stroke. Although there are some programs supporting insomnia during the menopausal transition, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCT) to provide evidence regarding their effectiveness. We design a RCT of suitable sample size to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with insomnia during the menopausal transition and to form an optimized acupuncture treatment protocol.
   Method/Design: In this randomized, single-site, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 84 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group (n = 42) or the sham control group (n = 42) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will receive a total of 18 treatment sessions for eight consecutive weeks. Treatments will be given three times per week in the first four weeks, twice a week for the next two weeks, and finally once weekly for the final two weeks. Treatment will utilize eight main acupoints (GV20, GV24, GV29, RN6, RN4, SP6, HT7, EX-HN22) and extra two acupoints based on syndrome differentiation. The primary outcome will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary outcomes will be measured by sleep parameters recorded in the Actigraphy (SE, TST, SA), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Menopause Quality of Life (Men-QOL). The primary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and the first and third month after the end of treatment.
   Discussion: If the results confirm that acupuncture is effective and safe for the treatment on insomnia in menopausal women, this positive outcome could provide evidence for clinical application.

TI  - Endometriosis as a Comorbid Condition in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS): Secondary Analysis of Data From a CFS Case-Control Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: Endometriosis (EM) is a recognized co-morbid condition in women with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This analysis evaluates the impact of EM on the health of women with CFS by comparing selected health characteristics and laboratory parameters in women with CFS with and without EM (CFS+ EM and CFS-only).
   Methods: This secondary analysis included all 36 women with CFS from a cross-sectional study of CFS in Wichita, KS, conducted between 2002 and 2003. The health characteristics and laboratory parameters of interest included functioning, fatigue, CFS-related symptoms, gynecologic history, routine laboratory parameters, inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, allostatic load, and sleep parameters (overnight polysomnography). We used parametric or non-parametric tests to compare group differences in the selected health characteristics and laboratory parameters. For examining the association between EM and variables of interest, logistic regression models were performed and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported for the magnitude of associations. Statistical significance was set at 0.05 (two-sided).
   Results: The mean age of this study sample was 50.9 years. Of women with CFS, 36.1% reported having EM. Age and body mass index (BMI) did not differ between CFS+ EMand CFS-only groups. When examining the impact of EM, compared to women with CFS-only, women with both CFS and EM were more likely to report chronic pelvic pain [OR = 9.00 (95% CI, 1.47-55.25)] and hysterectomy [OR = 10.3 (1.82-58.39)], had more CFS symptoms (6.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.3, p = 0.02), younger mean age at menopause onset (36.4 +/- 3.0 vs. 47.0 +/- 2.7 years, p = 0.03), higher mean number of obstructive apnea episodes per hour (20.3 vs. 4.4, p = 0.05) and reported more negative life events (15.8 vs. 4.4, p = 0.05). Other parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups.
   Conclusions: We found more than a third of women with CFS reported endometriosis as a comorbid condition. The endometriosis comorbidity was associated with chronic pelvic pain, earlier menopause, hysterectomy, and more CFS-related symptoms. However, endometriosis in women with CFS did not appear to further impact functioning, fatigue, inflammatory markers, or other laboratory parameters. Further investigations including younger women are warranted.

TI  - Sleep architecture is altered in the reserpine-induced fibromyalgia model in ovariectomized rats
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a musculoskeletal chronic pain syndrome with various concomitant symptoms like sleep disorders. FM patients are mainly women and menopause might play an important role in the altered processing of somatosensory information. Adverse effects and moderated efficacy of drugs promote treatment discontinuation by patients. Animal models of FM report pain and depression-like behaviors, but none of them have explored sleep disturbance as possible marker in the preclinic diagnostic. The aim of this study was to investigate alterations of the sleep architecture in the reserpine (RES)-induced FM model in ovarectomized (OVX) rats. The behavioral thresholds of nociceptive response in the experimental FM were analyzed in a first block using muscle pressure, tactile response and allodynia to cold stimulus. In a second block, the sleep-wake cycle was examined in a polysomnographic study. Groups (n = 8) consisted in: (a) no treatment, (b) RES vehicle, (c) RES alone, (d) RES + vehicle of fluoxetine (FLX, antidepressant reference drug), and (e) RES + FLX. Our results demonstrated that RES induced pain-related behavior (50-70%) in OVX rats and altered sleep architecture by the increase of total wake time (38%), diminution of the no-REM stage (SWS-I 33% and SWS-II 76%), and abolition of the REM sleep, effects that were partially reverted in the presence of FLX. In conclusion, our results support the face validity of the RES-induced pain-related behavior as FM model showing nociceptive behavioral responses associated to sleep alterations observed as symptoms in FM patients; thus, these evidences substantiate its usefulness to look for alternatives of treatment for FM symptoms.

TI  - Quality of life under extended continuous versus intermittent adjuvant letrozole in lymph node-positive, early breast cancer patients: the SOLE randomised phase 3 trial
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the phase III SOLE trial, the extended use of intermittent versus continuous letrozole for 5 years did not improve disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Intermittent therapy with 3-month breaks may be beneficial for patients' quality of life (QoL).
   METHODS: In the SOLE QoL sub-study, 956 patients completed the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) symptom and further QoL scales up to 24 months after randomisation. Differences in change of QoL from baseline between the two administration schedules were tested at 12 and 24 months using repeated measures mixed-models. The primary outcome was change in hot flushes at 12 months.
   RESULTS: There was no difference in hot flushes at 12 months between the two schedules, but patients receiving intermittent letrozole reported significantly more improvement at 24 months. They also indicated less worsening in vaginal problems, musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, physical well-being and mood at 12 months. Overall, 25-30% of patients reported a clinically relevant worsening in key symptoms and global QoL.
   CONCLUSION: Less symptom worsening was observed during the first year of extended treatment with the intermittent administration. For women experiencing an increased symptom burden of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy, an intermittent administration is a safe alternative.

TI  - The associations between menopausal symptoms and sleep quality in Spanish postmenopausal women
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Objectives: Around the menopause, sleep disturbances frequently occur or worsen and are associated with decreased health quality and physical and psychological problems. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep quality and its association with the impact of menopausal symptoms in Spanish postmenopausal women. Methods: A total of 278 postmenopausal women (age 60.95 +/- 8.01 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were used to analyze sleep quality and severity of menopausal symptoms, respectively. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: The linear regression showed that a greater impact of menopausal symptoms (MRS total score) was associated with worse scores regarding sleep adequacy (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.056), snoring (p = 0.020, R-2 = 0.036), awaken short of breath (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.089), and quantity of sleep (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.075) domains. Anxiety (p < 0.001) and worse somatic symptoms (p = 0.001) were related to greater sleep disturbances (R-2 = 0.164). We also found relationships of heightened psychological symptoms (p < 0.001) and low physical activity level (p = 0.003) with increased daytime somnolence (R-2 = 0.064). Finally, higher MRS total score and anxiety levels were associated with worse sleep quality assessed by MOS-SS Sleep Problems Index I (R-2 = 0.179, p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) and Sleep Problems Index II (R-2 = 0.146, p < 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively). Conclusions: Anxiety and severity of menopausal symptoms were associated with poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, low physical activity level and worse psychological symptoms in menopause were predictors for increased somnolence. Therefore, screening for these factors in postmenopausal women is important, since they may be susceptible for intervention.

TI  - No correlation between lunar and menstrual cycle-an early report by the french physician J. A. Murat in 1806
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Jean Arnaud Murat was a physician at the Medical School of Montpellier in France. In 1806 he published his outstanding book "De L'Influence de la Nuit sur les Maladies ou Traite des Maladies Nocturne". In his book he concentrated on the following questions: - Does the night has an influence on a disease? - Are there diseases in which this is more or less obvious? - What is the physical background of this influence? Murat described in detail certain diseases which dominate at night and he concluded that the most evident motivation for his observations is the constant and periodic movement of the earth around its axis, resulting in a period of about 24 h, and the elliptic rotation around the sun. Most important Murat presented for the first time data that the menstrual cycle is not governed by the lunar cycle.

TI  - The Effect of Exercise on Glucoregulatory Hormones: A Countermeasure to Human Aging: Insights from a Comprehensive Review of the Literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Hormones are secreted in a circadian rhythm, but also follow larger-scale timetables, such as monthly (hormones of the menstrual cycle), seasonal (i.e., winter, summer), and, ultimately, lifespan-related patterns. Several contexts modulate their secretion, such as genetics, lifestyle, environment, diet, and exercise. They play significant roles in human physiology, influencing growth of muscle, bone, and regulating metabolism. Exercise training alters hormone secretion, depending on the frequency, duration, intensity, and mode of training which has an impact on the magnitude of the secretion. However, there remains ambiguity over the effects of exercise training on certain hormones such as glucoregulatory hormones in aging adults. With advancing age, there are many alterations with the endocrine system, which may ultimately alter human physiology. Some recent studies have reported an anti-aging effect of exercise training on the endocrine system and especially cortisol, growth hormone and insulin. As such, this review examines the effects of endurance, interval, resistance and combined training on hormones (i.e., at rest and after) exercise in older individuals. We summarize the influence of age on glucoregulatory hormones, the influence of exercise training, and where possible, examine masters' athletes' endocrinological profile.

TI  - Neurokinin B and Neurokinin-3 Receptor Signaling: Promising Developments in the Management of Menopausal Hot Flushes
T2  - SEMINARS IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Vasomotor symptoms, including hot flushes and night sweats, pose a significant symptomatic burden to women undergoing menopause, and negatively impact on both their physical and psychological well-being. Management of these symptoms can be challenging, with the use of conventional hormone replacement therapy limited by duration of treatment and clinical contraindications. Recent advances in our understanding of the neuroendocrine regulation of the reproductive axis and thermoregulation postmenopause has helped identify a promising new therapeutic target to ameliorate hot flushes. Antagonism of the neurokinin B/neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) signaling pathway has emerged as an efficacious treatment in managing vasomotor symptoms, with evidence of rapid and sustained reduction in hot flush frequency and severity and improvements in secondary quality-of-life measures such as sleep. Within this review, we will explore the growing body of evidence supporting the use of NK3R antagonists in the management of vasomotor symptoms, and the possible utility in managing dysfunctional sex-hormone-dependent disorders and glycolipid metabolism disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome.

TI  - Home Oxygen and 2-Year Outcomes of Preterm Infants With Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - OBJECTIVES:To compare medical and developmental outcomes over the first 2 years of life in extremely preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who were discharged on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula with outcomes of infants with a similar severity of respiratory illness who were discharged breathing in room air.METHODS:We performed a propensity score-matched cohort study. Eligible infants were born at <27 weeks' gestation, were receiving supplemental oxygen or respiratory support at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, and were assessed at 18 to 26 months' corrected age. Study outcomes included growth, resource use, and neurodevelopment between discharge and follow-up. Outcomes were compared by using multivariable models adjusted for center and age at follow-up.RESULTS:A total of 1039 infants discharged on supplemental oxygen were propensity score matched 1:1 to infants discharged breathing in room air. Infants on oxygen had a marginal improvement in weight z score (adjusted mean difference 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00 to 0.22), with a significantly improved weight-for-length z score (adjusted mean difference 0.13; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.20) at 22 to 26 months' corrected age. Infants on oxygen were more likely to be rehospitalized for respiratory illness (adjusted relative risk 1.33; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.53) and more likely to use respiratory medications and equipment. Rates of neurodevelopmental impairment were similar between the groups.CONCLUSIONS:In this matched cohort of infants with BPD, postdischarge oxygen was associated with marginally improved growth and increased resource use but no difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Ongoing and future trials are critical to assess the efficacy and safety of postdischarge supplemental oxygen for infants with BPD.

TI  - The Association of Body Mass Index and Body Composition with Pain, Disease Activity, Fatigue, Sleep and Anxiety in Women with Fibromyalgia
T2  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - The link between fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and obesity has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among body mass index (BMI) and body composition parameters, including fat mass, fat mass percentage, and visceral fat, as well as FMS features, such as tender point count (TPC), pain, disease activity, fatigue, sleep quality, and anxiety, in a population of FMS women and healthy controls. A total of seventy-three women with FMS and seventy-three healthy controls, matched on weight, were included in this cross-sectional study. We used a body composition analyzer to measure fat mass, fat mass percentage, and visceral fat. Tender point count (TPC) was measured by algometry pressure. The disease severity was measured with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) and self-reported global pain was evaluated with the visual analog scale (VAS). To measure the quality of sleep, fatigue, and anxiety we used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI), the Spanish version of the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively. Of the women in this study, 38.4% and 31.5% were overweight and obese, respectively. Significant differences in FIQ-R.1 (16.82 +/- 6.86 vs. 20.66 +/- 4.71, p = 0.030), FIQ-R.3 (35.20 +/- 89.02 vs. 40.33 +/- 5.60, p = 0.033), and FIQ-R total score (63.87 +/- 19.12 vs. 75.94 +/- 12.25, p = 0.017) among normal-weight and overweight FMS were observed. Linear analysis regression revealed significant associations between FIQ-R.2 ((95% CI) = 0.336, (0.027, 0.645), p = 0.034), FIQ-R.3 ((95% CI) = 0.235, (0.017, 0.453), p = 0.035), and FIQ-R total score ((95% CI) = 0.110, (0.010, 0.209), p = 0.032) and BMI in FMS women after adjusting for age and menopause status. Associations between sleep latency and fat mass percentage in FMS women ((95% CI) = 1.910, (0.078, 3.742), p = 0.041) and sleep quality and visceral fat in healthy women ((95% CI) = 2.614, (2.192, 3.036), p = 0.008) adjusted for covariates were also reported. The higher BMI values are associated with poor FIQ-R scores and overweight and obese women with FMS have higher symptom severity. The promotion of an optimal BMI might contribute to ameliorate some of the FMS symptoms.

TI  - Nocturnal heart rate variability moderates the association between sleep-wake regularity and mood in young adults
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives Sleep-wake regularity (SWR) is often disrupted in college students and mood disorders are rife at this age. Disrupted SWR can cause repetitive and long-term misalignment between environmental and behavioral cycles and the circadian system which may then have psychological and physical health consequences. We tested whether SWR was independently associated with mood and autonomic function in a healthy adult cohort.
   Methods We studied 42 college students over a 3 week period using daily sleep-wake diaries and continuous electrocardiogram recordings. Weekly SWR was quantified by the interdaily stability of sleep-wake times (ISSW) and mood was assessed weekly using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. To assess autonomic function, we quantified the high-frequency (HF) power of heart rate variability (HRV). Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the relationship between repeated weekly measures of mood, SWR, and HF.
   Results Low weekly ISSW predicted subsequent poor mood and worsening mood independently of age, sex, race, sleep duration, and physical activity. Although no association was found between ISSW and HF, the ISSW-mood association was significantly moderated by nocturnal HF, i.e. reported mood was lowest after a week with low ISSW and high HF. Prior week mood scores did not significantly predict the subsequent week's ISSW.
   Conclusions Irregular sleep-wake timing appears to precede poor mood in young adults. Further work is needed to understand the implications of high nocturnal HRV in those with low mood and irregular sleep-wake cycles.

TI  - Racial/ethnic disparities in women's sleep duration, continuity, and quality, and their statistical mediators: Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives To describe racial/ethnic differences in sleep duration, continuity, and perceived sleep quality in postmenopausal women and to identify statistical mediators of differences in sleep characteristics.
   Methods Recruited from the observational Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), 1,203 (548 white, 303 black, 147 Chinese, 132 Japanese, and 73 Hispanic; mean age 65 years, 97% postmenopausal) women participated in a week-long actigraphy and daily diary study in 2013-2015. Actigraphic measures of sleep duration and wake after sleep onset (WASO), and diary-rated sleep quality were averaged across the week. Candidate mediators included health-related variables; stress; and emotional well-being assessed up to 13 times across 18 years from baseline to sleep study.
   Results Whites slept longer than other groups; the significant mediators were concurrent financial hardship and increasing number of stressors for Hispanics or Japanese versus whites. Whites had less WASO than blacks and Hispanics; significant mediators were concurrent number of health problems, physical inactivity, waist circumference, vasomotor symptoms, number of life stressors, and financial hardship, and increasing number of health problems from baseline to sleep study. Whites reported better sleep quality than blacks, Chinese, and Japanese; significant mediators were concurrent physical inactivity, vasomotor symptoms, positive affect, and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions Sleep differences between blacks or Hispanics versus whites were mediated by health problems, number of stressors, and financial hardship, whereas sleep differences between Chinese or Japanese versus whites were mediated by emotional well-being. This is the first study using formal mediational approaches.

TI  - Prevalence of sleep disturbances: Sleep disordered breathing, short sleep duration, and non-restorative sleep
T2  - RESPIRATORY INVESTIGATION
AB  - Recently, interest in sleep disturbances, such as sleep disordered breathing (SDB), short sleep duration, and non-restorative sleep (NRS), has been increasing. The potentially large public health implications of sleep disturbances indicate a need to determine their prevalence in a general population. This review describes the characteristics of population-based sleep cohorts from past to present. Unavoidable methodological and baseline characteristic heterogeneity was found between studies. The prevalence of SDB (apnea hypopnea index (AHI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), or oxygen desaturation index (ODI) >= 5/h) was 24.0-83.8% in men and 9.0-76.6% in women, and that of moderate-to-severe SDB (AHI, RDI, or ODI >= 15/h) was 7.2-67.2% in men and 4.0-50.9% in women. Additionally, the prevalence of SDB in post-menopausal women was 3-6 times higher than in pre-menopausal women. The prevalence of subjective short sleep duration (<6 h) was 7.5-9.6%, while that of objective short sleep duration (<6 h) was 22.1-53.3%. The prevalence of NRS was 19.2-31.0% in men and 26.3-42.1% in women, as determined from studies using a yes-no questionnaire, while a multi-national survey using a telephone-based expert system showed a wide range of prevalence between countries, from 2.4% to 16.1%. An association between SDB, short sleep duration, and NRS has recently been suggested. To gain a better understanding of the burden of sleep disturbances, a consensus on the definition of several sleep disturbances is needed, as methodological heterogeneity exists, including SDB scoring rules, subjective versus objective data collection for short sleep duration, and the definition of NRS itself.

TI  - 25-Hydroxyvitamin D status, light exposure and sleep quality in UK dwelling South Asian and Caucasian postmenopausal women
T2  - JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB  - There is a lack of research into 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status, light exposure and sleep patterns in South Asian populations. In addition, results of research studies are conflicting as to whether there is an association between 25(OH)D status and sleep quality.
   We investigated 25(OH)D status, self-reported and actigraphic sleep quality in n = 35 UK dwelling postmenopausal women (n = 13 South Asians, n = 22 Caucasians), who kept daily sleep diaries and wore wrist-worn actiwatch (AWL-L) devices for 14 days. A subset of n = 27 women (n = 11 South Asian and n = 16 Caucasian) also wore a neck-worn AWL-L device to measure their light exposure.
   For 25(OH)D concentration, South Asians had a median +/- IQR of 43.8 +/- 28.2 nmol/L, which was significantly lower than Caucasians (68.7 +/- 37.4 nmol/L)(P = 0.001). Similarly, there was a higher sleep fragmentation in the South Asians (mean +/- SD 36.9 +/- 8.9) compared with the Caucasians (24.7 +/- 7.1) (P = 0.002). Non-parametric circadian rhythm analysis of rest/activity patterns showed a higher night-time activity (L5) (22.6 +/- 14.0 vs. 10.5 +/- 4.4; P = 0.0008) and lower relative amplitude (0.85 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.02; P < 0.0001) in the South Asian compared with the Caucasian women. More South Asians (50%) met the criteria for sleep disorders (PSQI score > 5) than did Caucasians (27%) (P = 0.001, Fishers Exact Test). However, there was no association between 25(OH)D concentration and any sleep parameter measured (P > 0.05) in either ethnic group. South Asians spent significantly less time in illuminance levels over 200 lx (P = 0.009) than did Caucasians.
   Overall, our results show that postmenopausal South Asian women have lower 25(OH)D concentration than Caucasian women. They also have higher sleep fragmentation, as well as a lower light exposure across the day. This may have detrimental implications for their general health and further research into sleep quality and light exposure in the South Asian ethnic group is warranted.

TI  - Sleep quality and related factors in postmenopausal women
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Sleep disorders, resulting from hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms, are common in both peri- and postmenopausal women. Poor sleep quality is associated with increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk, depression and a global impairment in health status.
   Objectives: Our study aimed to assess sleep quality in a sample of postmenopausal women and to identify the factors associated with poor sleep quality. It also considered the negative impact of sleep disorders such as insomnia, hypersomnia and breathing disturbances.
   Subjects & methods: Data came from a cross-sectional study of 195 postmenopausal women conducted at the Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Their sociodemographic, gynecological and clinical characteristics were recorded and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Oviedo Sleep Questionnaire (Cuestionario Oviedo de Sueno, COS).
   Results: The mean PSQI score was 6.90 +/- 4.43. Sleep problems were common, with 46.7% of participants scoring over 5 on the PSQI. Snoring was reported by 13% of the patients (PSQI item 10 A). While 10% of the poor sleepers reported episodes of apnea during rest (PSQI item 10B), 7.1% reported leg spasm (PSQ I item 10C). The mean total COS score was 17.57 +/- 7. According to COS item 1, all the subjects reported some dissatisfaction with the quality of their sleep. According to the COS, the prevalence of insomnia was 3.6% using ICD-10 criteria and 15.4% using DSM-IV criteria. The mean ESS score was 6.12 +/- 4.09.
   Conclusion: Postmenopausal women are likely to complain of disturbed sleep. Almost half of the women in this survey said their sleep quality was impaired, and most of that group would benefit from medical attention.

TI  - Insomnia and depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition: theoretical and therapeutic implications of a self-reinforcing feedback loop
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Insomnia is a common and recurring condition during the menopausal transition that negatively affects both quality of life and health. Peri-menopausal insomnia has a multifactorial etiology; previous depression, hormonal changes and age/hormone-related irregularity in circadian rhythms can contribute to menopausal insomnia. Age-related poor health, pain and stress may favor the development of insomnia, while vasomotor symptoms, in particular hot flashes, may contribute to chronic forms of insomnia by activating a vicious cycle. Insomnia increases two- to threefold the risk of developing depressive symptoms during the peri-menopause. In fact, the menopausal transition is a window of vulnerability for the development of depressive symptoms, in which the risk of a major depressive disorder is 2-4 times greater than in the premenopausal period. Depression naturally has a negative impact on daily functioning, quality of life and health. Since the relationship between insomnia and depressive symptoms has been shown to be bidirectional, the aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of their association in the context of the menopausal transition. By exploring the potential pathways of their bidirectional relationship, this overview should be useful for preventive and therapeutic purposes. By treating insomnia we may be able to interrupt the self-reinforcing feedback loop with depressive symptoms, and thereby improve affective symptoms and women's wellbeing in this period of their life.

TI  - Supraphysiologic-dose anabolic-androgenic steroid use: A risk factor for dementia?
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Supraphysiologic-dose anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with physiologic, cognitive, and brain abnormalities similar to those found in people at risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease and its related dementias (AD/ADRD), which are associated with high brain beta-amyloid (A beta) and hyperphosphorylated tau (tauP) protein levels. Supraphysiologic-dose AAS induces androgen abnormalities and excess oxidative stress, which have been linked to increased and decreased expression or activity of proteins that synthesize and eliminate, respectively, A beta and tau-P. A beta and tau-P accumulation may begin soon after initiating supraphysiologic-dose AAS use, which typically occurs in the early 20s, and their accumulation may be accelerated by other psychoactive substance use, which is common among non-medical AAS users. Accordingly, the widespread use of supraphysiologic-dose AAS may increase the numbers of people who develop dementia. Early diagnosis and correction of sex-steroid level abnormalities and excess oxidative stress could attenuate risk for developing AD/ ADRD in supraphysiologic-dose AAS users, in people with other substance use disorders, and in people with low sex-steroid levels or excess oxidative stress associated with aging.

TI  - Factors Associated With Preterm Infants' Circadian Sleep/Wake Patterns at the Hospital
T2  - CLINICAL NURSING RESEARCH
AB  - This prospective repeated-measures study explored potential factors (postmenstrual age, body weight, gender, chronological age, illness severity, and circadian rhythm) related to preterm infants' circadian sleep/wake patterns. Circadian sleep/wake patterns were measured using an Actiwatch for 3 continuous days in preterm infants (gestational age of 28-36.4 weeks) in a neonatal intensive care unit and hospital nursery. Potential factors associated with circadian sleep/wake patterns were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation. For our sample of 30 preterm infants, better sleep/wake patterns were associated with male gender, younger postmenstrual and chronological age, lower body weight, and less illness severity. Preterm infants' total sleep time (B = 41.828, p < .01) and percentage of sleep time (B = 3.711, p < .01) were significantly longer at night than during the day. These findings can help clinicians recognize preterm infants' sleep problems, signaling the need to provide individualized support to maintain these infants' sleep quality during their early life.

TI  - Sleep quality, sleep duration and sexual health among older people: Findings from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS
AB  - Context: How sleep quality and sexual health are associated among community-dwelling individuals remains largely unknown.
   Objective: We examined the association of sleep disturbance and sleep duration with a range of measures assessing sexual activities, functioning and concerns in a representative sample of older people.
   Methods: Participants were community-dwelling adults aged 50-90 + years from wave 6 (2012/2013) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) who reported any sexual activity in the last year. Sleep disturbance, sleep duration and sexual health were measured by self-report at wave 6. Retrospective reports of restless sleep (waves 1-6 [2002-2013]) were also examined. The association between sleep measures and sexual health was assessed using logistic regressions stratified by gender and adjusted for demographic, health and lifestyle factors with results expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: Among both men and women disturbed sleep was associated with reported declines in sexual activity and function over the last year, and increased concern about their sexual desire, frequency of sexual activity and sexual functioning. Robust associations between high sleep disturbance and vaginal pain (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.21, 2.31) and vaginal dryness (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.24, 2.30) were also observed among women. Retrospective reports of restless sleep showed a dose-response relationship with reported declines in sexual health over the last year, and increased concerns about sexual expression and functioning.
   Conclusions: Self-reported sleep disturbance and retrospective restless sleep were mainly associated with subjective assessments of recent declines in sexual activity and functioning, and higher levels of sexual concerns.

TI  - The relationship between sleep quality and lifestyle in postmenopausal Iranian women: a cross-sectional study
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - One of the most frequent symptoms in postmenopausal women is sleep disturbance. This study aimed to determine the relationship between sleep quality and lifestyle factors in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women (n = 252) in Ahvaz, Iran with an age range of 45-55 years, were enrolled from April to December 2015. The study tools included the Lifestyle Questionnaire (LSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The LSQ contains 10 lifestyle factors: physical health, physical activity, weight control and nutrition, psychological health, spiritual health, social health, medications and narcotics avoidance, illness prevention, accident prevention, and environmental health. Data were analyzed using, chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficients, analysis of variance, and multiple linear regressions. In unadjusted analyses, physical health, physical activity, nutrition, mental health, spiritual health, social health, and medication and narcotics avoidance scores were significantly higher in women without sleep disruption than in those with light and moderate sleep disruption (p < .001). Adjusting for confounding factors, sleep disruption was directly related to duration since the final menstrual period (p < .001), and inversely related to physical health (p = .04) and spiritual health (p = .028). Lifestyle factors were related to sleep disruption in postmenopausal women. Policymakers should consider education on healthy lifestyles for women.

TI  - Wearable Sensors Reveal Menses-Driven Changes in Physiology and Enable Prediction of the Fertile Window: Observational Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Previous research examining physiological changes across the menstrual cycle has considered biological responses to shifting hormones in isolation. Clinical studies, for example, have shown that women's nightly basal body temperature increases from 0.28 to 0.56 degrees C following postovulation progesterone production. Women's resting pulse rate, respiratory rate, and heart rate variability (HRV) are similarly elevated in the luteal phase, whereas skin perfusion decreases significantly following the fertile window's closing. Past research probed only 1 or 2 of these physiological features in a given study, requiring participants to come to a laboratory or hospital clinic multiple times throughout their cycle. Although initially designed for recreational purposes, wearable technology could enable more ambulatory studies of physiological changes across the menstrual cycle. Early research suggests that wearables can detect phase-based shifts in pulse rate and wrist skin temperature (WST). To date, previous work has studied these features separately, with the ability of wearables to accurately pinpoint the fertile window using multiple physiological parameters simultaneously yet unknown.
   Objective: In this study, we probed what phase-based differences a wearable bracelet could detect in users' WST, heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate, and skin perfusion. Drawing on insight from artificial intelligence and machine learning, we then sought to develop an algorithm that could identify the fertile window in real time.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study, recruiting 237 conception-seeking Swiss women. Participants wore the Ava bracelet (Ava AG) nightly while sleeping for up to a year or until they became pregnant. In addition to syncing the device to the corresponding smartphone app daily, women also completed an electronic diary about their activities in the past 24 hours. Finally, women took a urinary luteinizing hormone test at several points in a given cycle to determine the close of the fertile window. We assessed phase-based changes in physiological parameters using cross-classified mixed-effects models with random intercepts and random slopes. We then trained a machine learning algorithm to recognize the fertile window.
   Results: We have demonstrated that wearable technology can detect significant, concurrent phase-based shifts in WST, heart rate, and respiratory rate (all P<.001). HRV and skin perfusion similarly varied across the menstrual cycle (all P<.05), although these effects only trended toward significance following a Bonferroni correction to maintain a family-wise alpha level. Our findings were robust to daily, individual, and cycle-level covariates. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning algorithm that can detect the fertile window with 90% accuracy (95% CI 0.89 to 0.92).
   Conclusions: Our contributions highlight the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning's integration into health care. By monitoring numerous physiological parameters simultaneously, wearable technology uniquely improves upon retrospective methods for fertility awareness and enables the first real-time predictive model of ovulation.

TI  - Prospective observational study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the pollen extract Serelys (R) in the management of women with menopausal symptoms
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Safety concerns or contraindications to the use of hormones have resulted in a rise of the use of herbal medicinal products for the management of menopausal symptoms. The pollen extract SerelysA (R) represents, due to its ingredients and mode of action, a new and innovative alternative for the management of these symptoms. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of SerelysA (R). A prospective, open, observational, and multicentre study was performed on 104 menopausal women. The patients received over 3 months the pollen extract SerelysA (R) containing the extracts PI82 and GC Fem in a dosage of twice 160 mg extract and 5 mg vitamin E. Using a validated menopausal rating score, the improvement of menopausal symptoms was recorded. A significant decrease of different menopausal symptoms was observed between the starting point of the study and after 12 weeks (p < .0001). Hot flashes were reduced by 48.5%, sleep disturbance by 50.1%, depressive mood by 51.2%, irritability by 47.9%, fatigue by 47.8%, vaginal dryness by 39.63% and muscles and joint pain by 27.4%. The pollen extract SerelysA (R) reduced significant menopausal symptoms showing a very low side effect profile.

TI  - Time Restriction of Food Intake During the Circadian Cycle Is a Possible Regulator of Reproductive Function in Postadolescent Female Rats
T2  - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
AB  - Background: We previously reported that skipping breakfast is associated with menstrual disorders of female college students during postadolescent maturation.
   Objective: In this study, we investigated the effects of meal timing during circadian cycle on the ovarian function using young female rats. Methods: Considering that rats are nocturnally active, 8-wk-old female Wistar rats were classified into 3 groups: fed during the daytime only (nonactive phase), night-time only (active phase), or control group I (without time or calorie restriction, free access to a standard caloric diet, 20.0% protein, 62.9% carbohydrate, and 7.0% fat, 3.95 kcal/g) for 4 wk. The changes in body weight and frequency of ovulation in each group were evaluated by a weight scale and a vaginal smear, respectively. At the end of the period of dietary restriction, ovaries were removed, and the numbers of growing follicles (mean diameter >250 mu m) and corpora lutea (>600 mu m) were examined using hematoxylin-eosin-stained tissue sections. In addition, 8-wk-old female rats were fed only during the night-time for 4 wk under a 20%-reduced food supply of the control group II (without any restriction).
   Results: In the daytime-fed group, the frequency and number of ovulations were significantly decreased compared with those in the control group I (P < 0.05), with a reduced body weight gain concomitant with about 20% of reduction in the daily food intake. In contrast, in the night-time-fed group, even when a 20% reduction in the daily food intake was loaded, their estrus cyclicity did not change despite significant reductions in weight gain and food intake compared with control group II.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that restricting food intake to the inactive phase impairs ovarian function in postadolescent female rats, suggesting that the timing of food intake during circadian cycle is one of the crucial factors interfering with the reproductive function.

TI  - Vertebral fragility fractures - How to treat them?
T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH IN CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY
AB  - Approximately 20% of men and women aged 50 years or older will present with a vertebral fragility fracture - a prevalence that steadily increases with age. The condition may be associated with severe pain and disability, significant reductions in overall quality of life, mobility, social participation, sleep quality and increased fear for the future. There is, however, no current consensus on what constitutes the best management of symptomatic vertebral fractures. Moreover, evidence supporting common treatment approaches is scarce and often of poor quality. The lack of adequate management of VFF and associated osteoporosis and the burden of this condition to patient and society are estimated to increase substantially in coming years as recurrent, disabling episodes are set to occur. This chapter will address these issues, including a discussion on existing care pathways for vertebral fragility fractures, and an overview of the evidence supporting recommendations of the main international clinical practice guidelines.

TI  - Frequency of Premenstrual Symptoms and Its Impact on Quality of Life in our Society
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL & HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Aim: To determine the frequency of premenstrual Symptoms in our society and its impact on quality of life.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, three hundred and fifty patient included in the study. The study was conducted at Department of gynecology, Combined Military Hospital Multan from June 2017 to June, 2018. The demographic information was noted. Various symptoms included Weight Gain, Mood changes / irritability, Depression, Anger, Negative thoughts, Bloatedness, Breast Pain, Appetite Changes, Sleep Changes, Headache, Tiredness, Lack of Concentration or poor work performance were asked from patients through questionnaire and their impact on quality of life interpreted as routine life unaffected, difficult to cope with these symptoms and symptoms making routine life impossible without medication was computed.
   Results: There were 350 patients in the study group mean age of the patients were 30.29 +/- 2.94 years. Weight gain was reported in 285(81.4%) of patient, Mood changes / irritability in 298 (85.1%) patient, depression 263(75.1%), Anger 277(79.1%), Negative thoughts 198(56.5%), Bloated 313(89.4%), Breast Pain 269(76.8%), Appetite Changes 258 (73.7%), Sleep Changes 311(88.8%), Headache 243(69.4%), Tiredness 315(90%), and lack of concentration or poor work performance 302(86.2%), were reported. The effect of these symptoms, or their impact on quality of life was further analyzed on SPSS22.
   Conclusion: Premenstrual Symptoms are frequently encountered by females. But as gnaecological problem it is neither given importance nor consideration for treatment. As the symptoms are usually ignored or mixed with social taboos, it is better to make awareness among women regarding diet, exercise and life style changes for mild symptoms.

TI  - Loss-of-function mutations with circadian rhythm regulator Per1/Per2 lead to premature ovarian insufficiency
T2  - BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB  - The mechanism underlying premature ovarian insufficiency remains incompletely understood. Here we report that mice with Per1(m/m); Per2(m/m) double mutations display a decrease in female fertility starting approximately at 20 weeks old, with significantly less pups born from 32 weeks old onwards. Histological analysis revealed that a significant reduction of ovarian follicles was observed in the Per1/Per2 mutants compared with the littermate controls examined at 26 and 52 weeks old, while the difference was not statistically significant between the two groups at 3 and 8 weeks old. We further showed that vascular development including the ovarian follicle associated vascular growth appeared normal in the Per1/Per2 mutant mice, although clock genes were reported to regulate angiogenesis in zebrafish. The findings imply that loss-of-function mutations with Per1/Per2 result in a premature depletion of ovarian follicle reserve leading to the decline of reproductive capacity.
   Disruption of circadian rhythm or its underlying regulatory network contributes to the premature depletion of ovarian follicle reserve.

TI  - BIOREGULATION OF AMPLITUDE-PHASE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CANDIDA ALBICANS BY WOMEN REPRODUCTIVE TRACT MICROSYMBIONTS
T2  - INFEKTSIYA I IMMUNITET
AB  - In this study, we propose a chronobiological method for examining inter-microbial interactions in bacterial and fungal associations in female reproductive tract. Fungal and bacterial species were isolated in 45 women of reproductive aged 19-35, with regular menstrual cycle, applying no hormonal contraceptives, without previous gynecological surgery, abortions, miscarriages with vaginal eubiosis and dysbiosis in history. Sexually transmitted diseases (HIV infection, syphilis, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, chlamydiosis) were excluded in all subjects. Proliferation rate, morphogenesis and phospholipase activity were examined within the 48-hour period every 4 hours, in winter time, Moon phase IV. The data obtained were assessed by using Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, and least squares method. All subjects were divided into the groups: group 1 - women with vaginal eubiosis, group 2 - women with vaginal dysbiosis. It was shown that in all subjects experimental parameters of C. albicans cultures showed a diurnal dynamics characterized in healthy women by circadian rhythms with a single peak of activity. However, in women with vaginal dysbiosis C. albicans was characterized by significant ultradian (around 12 hours long) rhythms with two peaks of biological activity. Concurrence and consistency in manifested physiological functions related to clinical isolates was coupled to temporal pattern of distributed biological resources in fungi depending on course of infectious process. It was found that in vaginal eubiosis exometabolites released by dominant associated microbiota did not significantly change microbiota-related amplitude-phase parameters. The data obtained evidenced that temporal pattern of parameters related to C. albicans from healthy individuals was stable and independent on bacterial metabolites. In contrast, dominant microsymbiont in vaginal dysbiosis inhibited fungi-related rhythms, which might be important in establishing lactobacillus-associated biotope colonization resistance. Effects of metabolites released by the associated microbiota typical to dysbiosis was revealed by increased mesor, amplitude, preserved biorhythm spectral pattern in examined properties as well as amplitude-phase characteristics indicating at enhanced or sustained C. albicans adaptive potential. Therefore, the amplitude-phase parameter of C. albicans physiological activity served as a marker of opposite (enhanced/weakened) effect of microsymbiont survival described in "microbial dominant-associate" pairs.

TI  - The power of small changes: Comprehensive analyses of microbial dysbiosis in breast cancer
T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-REVIEWS ON CANCER
AB  - Disparate occurrence of breast cancer remains an intriguing question since only a subset of women with known risk factors develop cancer. Recent studies suggest an active role of local and distant microbiota in breast cancer initiation, progression, and overall prognosis. A dysbiotic microbiota predisposes the body to develop cancer by inducing genetic instability, initiating DNA damage and proliferation of the damaged progeny, eliciting favorable immune response, metabolic dysregulation and altered response to therapy. In this review, we present our analyses of the existing datasets and discuss the local dysbiosis observed in breast cancer patients and different aspects of breast carcinogenesis that can be potentially influenced by local breast microbiota. Striking differences between microbial community compositions in breast of cancer patients compared to healthy individuals were noted. Differences in microbiome were also apparent between benign and malignant disease and between nipple aspirate fluid of healthy individuals and breast survivors. We also discuss the identification of distinct bacterial, fungal, viral as well as parasite signatures for breast cancer. These microbes are capable of producing numerous secondary metabolites that can act as signaling mediators effecting breast cancer progression. We review how microbes potentially alter response to therapy affecting drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor effects and toxicity. In conclusion, breast harbors a community of microbes that can communicate with the host cells inducing downstream signaling pathways and modulating various aspects of breast cancer growth and metastatic progression and an improved understanding of microbial dysbiosis can potentially reduce breast cancer risk and improve outcomes of breast cancer patients.
   The human microbiome, now referred to as, the "forgotten organ" contains a metagenome that is 100-fold more diverse compared to the human genome, thereby, is critically associated with human health [1,2]. With the revelations of the human microbiome project and advent of deep sequencing techniques, a plethora of information has been acquired in recent years. Body sites like stomach, bladder and lungs, once thought to be sterile, are now known to harbor millions of indigenous microbial species. Approximately 80% of the healthy microbiome consists of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes accompanied by Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Cyanobacteria [2-7] The role of microbiome in diabetes, obesity and even neurodegenerative diseases was greatly appreciated in the last decade [1,7-14] and now it has been established that microbiome significantly contributes to many organ specific cancers [1,15,16].

TI  - Progesterone Is Important for Transgender Women's Therapy-Applying Evidence for the Benefits of Progesterone in Ciswomen
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Background: Although the 2017 Endocrine Society Guidelines for gender dysphoria stipulated that cross-sex hormone therapy (CHT) achieve gonadal steroid levels equivalent to those of a cisperson of the chosen sex, for transgender women (male-to-female gender dysphoria), current gonadal therapy is usually estradiol. Accumulated evidence indicates that normally ovulatory menstrual cycles are necessary for ciswomen's current fertility, as well as for later-life bone and cardiovascular health and the prevention of breast and endometrial cancers.
   Evidence Acquisition: Extensive past clinical experience with transgender women's CHT using estradiol/estrogen combined with progesterone/medroxyprogesterone and pioneering the addition of spironolactone. Comprehensive progesterone physiology research plus a brief review of transgender women's literature to assess current therapy and clinical outcomes, including morbidity and mortality.
   Purpose: To emphasize that both ovarian hormones, progesterone as well as estradiol, are theoretically and clinically important for optimal transgender women's CHT.
   Evidence Synthesis: It is important to add progesterone to estradiol and an antiandrogen in transgender women's CHT. Progesterone may add the following: (i) more rapid feminization, (ii) decreased endogenous testosterone production, (iii) optimal breast maturation to Tanner stages 4/5, (iv) increased bone formation, (v) improved sleep and vasomotor symptom control, and (vi) cardiovascular health benefits.
   Conclusions: Evidence has accrued that normal progesterone (and ovulation), as well as physiological estradiol levels, is necessary during ciswomen's premenopausal menstrual cycles for current fertility and long-term health; transgender women deserve progesterone therapy and similar potential physiological benefits.

TI  - Sleep disturbance in women who undergo surgical menopause compared with women who experience natural menopause
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Women who undergo surgical menopause (SM) experience a relatively more acute and precipitous drop of estrogen compared with women who experience natural menopause (NM). Few studies, however, have compared sleep quality in women who experience natural versus SM.
   Methods: Participants were 526 postmenopausal women (mean age 60.2 +/- 7.64). All participants completed self-report questionnaires about insomnia symptoms, sleep-interfering behaviors, depression, sleep quality, and gynecological history. Analysis of covariance was conducted to compare women who experienced NM versus SM on sleep variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether NM or SM groups predicted insomnia status. Regression-based moderation analysis was conducted to explore the moderating effect of type of menopause on the relationship between sleep-interfering behaviors and insomnia symptoms.
   Results: Among the sample, 81.6% (n = 429) reported going through NM and 18.4% (n = 97) reported going through SM. The SM group was significantly younger by 7.2 years (P < 0.001). Women in the SM group reported significantly worse sleep quality (P = 0.007), especially for sleep duration (P = 0.001) and habitual sleep efficiency (P = 0.010) compared with women in the NM group. Regression analysis indicated that individuals in the SM group were 2.131 (95% CI 1.055-4.303) times more likely to have insomnia compared with the NM group (P = 0.027). In addition, women in the SM group who displayed more sleep-interfering behaviors also had a higher severity of insomnia symptoms compared with women who experience NM (beta = 0.26, P = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Menopause can be both physically and psychologically challenging, but women who undergo SM experience worse sleep quality compared with women who experience NM, and may benefit from behavioral interventions.

TI  - Impact of sex steroids and reproductive stage on sleep-dependent memory consolidation in women
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY
AB  - Age and sex are two of the three major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (ApoE-e4 allele is the third), with women having a twofold greater risk for Alzheimer's disease after the age of 75 years. Sex differences have been shown across a wide range of cognitive skills in young and older adults, and evidence supports a role for sex steroids, especially estradiol, in protecting against the development of cognitive decline in women. Sleep may also be a protective factor against age-related cognitive decline, since specific electrophysiological sleep events (e.g. sleep spindle/slow oscillation coupling) are critical for offline memory consolidation. Furthermore, studies in young women have shown fluctuations in sleep events and sleep-dependent memory consolidation during different phases of the menstrual cycle that are associated with the levels of sex steroids. An under-appreciated possibility is that there may be an important interaction between these two protective factors (sex steroids and sleep) that may play a role in daily fluctuations in cognitive processing, in particular memory, across a woman's lifespan. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of sex steroid-dependent influences on sleep and cognition across the lifespan in women, with special emphasis on sleep-dependent memory processing. We further indicate gaps in knowledge that require further experimental examination in order to fully appreciate the complex and changing landscape of sex steroids and cognition. Lastly, we propose a series of testable predictions for how sex steroids impact sleep events and sleep-dependent cognition across the three major reproductive stages in women (reproductive years, menopause transition, and post-menopause).

TI  - Acupuncture in Obstetrics and Gynecology
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
AB  - Importance Acupuncture is a key component of therapy in traditional Chinese medicine. Only in the last few decades has acupuncture become popular in the United States. The mechanism behind acupuncture's effects on the body and brain has not been completely elucidated, but there is evidence that acupuncture has effects on the endocrine, immune, and sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It may also act through electrical and mechanical signaling through the connective tissue and fascia. Despite this uncertainty, the positive effects of acupuncture have been well established. Objective In this review, we discuss the basic concepts of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture and examine the evidence regarding the use of acupuncture in obstetrics and gynecology. Evidence Acquisition We conducted a literature review of acupuncture in obstetrics and gynecology using PubMed. Results The available data demonstrate that acupuncture is beneficial in the treatment of labor pain, back pain in pregnancy, and dysmenorrhea. It is unclear if acupuncture is effective for hyperemesis, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and menopausal hot flushes, or if moxibustion is effective in correcting breech presentation. There are limited but positive data regarding menopause-related sleep disturbances, depression in pregnancy, and overactive bladder. Acupuncture is not beneficial for improving outcomes in in vitro fertilization. Conclusions and Relevance Acupuncture is an increasingly popular therapy with many potential applications in obstetrics and gynecology. A general understanding of the basic principles of acupuncture and the safety and efficacy of its practice is necessary for the general obstetrician and gynecologist to make informed recommendations to patients. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to identify the basic concepts of traditional Chinese medicine and how it differs from Western medicine; describe common obstetrical and gynecologic issues that can be successfully treated with acupuncture; and distinguish the main issues in designing acupuncture studies regarding blinding, choosing a control group, and identifying areas of potential bias.

TI  - Efficacy of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Treatment-Induced Menopausal Symptoms in Breast Cancer Survivors: Results of a Randomized Contra led Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - PURPOSE We evaluated the effect of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), with or without therapist support, on the perceived impact of hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS) and overall levels of menopausal symptoms (primary outcomes), sleep quality, HF/NS frequency, sexual functioning, psychological distress, and health-related quality of life in breast cancer survivors with treatment-induced menopausal symptoms.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS We randomly assigned 254 breast cancer survivors to a therapist-guided or a self-managed iCBT group or to a waiting list control group. The 6-week iCBT program included psycho-education, behavior monitoring, and cognitive restructuring. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and at 10 weeks and 24 weeks postrandomization. We used mixed-effects models to compare the intervention groups with the control group over time. Significance was set at P < .01. An effect size (ES) of .20 was considered small, .50 moderate and clinically significant, and .80 large.
   RESULTS Compared with the control group, the guided and self-managed iCBT groups reported a significant decrease in the perceived impact of HF/NS (ES, .63 and .56, respectively; both P < .001) and improvement in sleep quality (ES, .57 and .41; both P< .001). The guided group also reported significant improvement in overall levels of menopausal symptoms (ES, .33; P= .003), and NS frequency (ES, .64; P< .001). At longer-term followup (24 weeks), the effects remained significant, with a smaller ES for the guided group on perceived impact of HF/NS and sleep quality and for the self-managed group on overall levels of menopausal symptoms. Additional longer-term effects for both intervention groups were found for hot flush frequency.
   CONCLUSION iCBT, with or without therapist support, has clinically significant, salutary effects on the perceived impact and frequency of HF/NS, overall levels of menopausal symptoms, and sleep quality. (C) 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - The Contribution of the Circadian Gene Bmal1 to Female Fertility and the Generation of the Preovulatory Luteinizing Hormone Surge
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ENDOCRINE SOCIETY
AB  - In rodents, the preovulatory LH surge is temporally gated, but the timing cue is unknown. Estrogen primes neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) to secrete kisspeptin, which potently activates GnRH neurons to release GnRH, eliciting a surge of LH to induce ovulation. Deletion of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 results in infertility. Previous studies have found that Bmal1 knockout (KO) females do not display an LH surge at any time of day. We sought to determine whether neuroendocrine disruption contributes to the absence of the LH surge. Because Kiss1 expression in the AVPV is critical for regulating ovulation, we hypothesized that this population is disrupted in Bmal1 KO females. However, we found an appropriate rise in AVPV Kiss1 and Fos mRNA at the time of lights out in ovariectomized estrogen-treated animals, despite the absence of a measureable increase in LH. Furthermore, Bmal1 KO females have significantly increased LH response to kiss-10 administration, although the LH response to GnRH was unchanged. We then created Kissl- and GnRH-specific Bmall KO mice to examine whether Bmal1 expression is necessary within either kisspeptin or GnRH neurons. We detected no significant differences in any measured reproductive parameter. Our results indicate that disruption of the hypothalamic regulation of fertility in the Bmal1 KO females is not dependent on endogenous clocks within either the GnRH or kisspeptin neurons.

TI  - Risk factors for precompetitive sleep behavior in elite female athletes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is of major importance for the athletes' short and long-term health, performance and recovery; however, published studies on athletes' sleep and even fewer before competition are scarce. This study evaluated the risk factors of sleep in young female gymnasts before an international competition.
   METHODS: Sixty-seven rhythmic gymnasts (M=18.7, SD=2.9 years) of high performance (M=36.6, SD=7.6 h/week) were evaluated regarding training and sport practice, body composition, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, precompetitive anxiety by the Sport Competition Anxiety Test form A, and detailed dietary intake just prior to a world competition.
   RESULTS: The majority of the participants (83.6%) presented reduced body fat levels (M=9.1, SD=2.1%) and low energy availability (EA, M=31.5, SD=11.9 kcal/kgFFM/day). They slept 8h10 +/- 1h30/night on weekdays and 8h40 +/- 00h40/night on weekends, 67% suffered from mild daytime sleepiness and 78% had a reduced sleep quality. Precompetitive anxiety was on average moderate (M=22.7, SD=3.2). The risk factors for short sleep duration were: 1.92 for a training volume>30 hours/week (95% CI 0.84-4.39), 4.57 for menstruation (95% CI 1.17-17.77), 6.62 for bedtime >= 11:00 PM (95% CI 1.74-25.10), 1.40 for BF<12% (95% CI 1.03-1.92), 2.19 for FFM<30 kg (95% IC 0.94-4.94), 2.37 for BMR<1100 kcal/day (95% CI 1.06-5.32), 1.90 for EEE >= 700 kcal (95% CI 0.92-3.93) and 3.17 for EA<45 kcal/kg FFM/day (95% CI 0.846.59). Age, performance, sleep duration on weekdays and precompetitive stress were also predictors for a reduced sleep quality and/or abnormal daytime sleepiness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Age, training regime, menstruation, individual preferences for bedtime, body composition and energy were important predictors of gymnasts' precompetitive sleep with consequences upon their sleep duration, SQ and DS.

TI  - The Association Between Menopausal Symptoms and General Health Among Iranian Women With Menopause: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH AND REPRODUCTION SCIENCES
AB  - Objectives: Health promotion leads to a higher quality of life among women. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between menopausal symptoms and general health among women with menopause.
   Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional, 600 postpartum women in Ahvaz, Iran were selected and recruited using the randomized cluster sampling method during 2013-2014. The data were collected by the women's demographic characteristics instrument, as well as the Goldenberg's and menopausal symptoms questionnaires. In addition, descriptive statistics and logistic regression were employed for data analysis by the SPSS software, version 19. The statistical tests were performed at 95% confidence interval.
   Results: As regards the menopausal symptoms, sleep disorders (39%), myalgia (42.7%), and hot flashes (32.5%) were reported as moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively. Further, 50.2% of the participants had impaired general health. Finally, job, hot flashes, sleep disorders, myalgia, depression, and aggressiveness were associated with general health (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: In general, there is a need to improve public health and reduce menopausal symptoms among postmenopausal women since menopause is changed to a crisis in a woman's life.

TI  - Management of Early Menopause Using Traditional Persian Medicine: A Case Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH AND REPRODUCTION SCIENCES
AB  - Interruption of the activity of ovary before the age of forty is called premature ovarian failure (POE) in which ovaries lose their follicular and hormonal functions. A decline in the number of ovules before the age of menopause is a physiologic phenomenon. In the present case report, treatment of a patient by POF was reported using traditional Persian medicine principles. In Persian medicine, each humor has its own temperament. A change in the temperament and quality or quantity of these humors causes the disease and therefore modifying the temperament is the milestone of treatment. The patient was a 39-year-old married woman with irregular menstruation cycles and fmally, cessation of menstruation. In this period, the patient had vaginal dryness, severe dyspareunia, gastritis, and parasomnia. At first, some instructions were ordered to change her lifestyle, for example, a change in food intakes, enough sleep, and exercise. In addition, several medications were ordered including the digestive system electuary (Majoun Jahaz Hazemeh), Eyaraj Fighara capsule and powder containing Glycyrrhiza glabra roots, Foeniculum vulgare and white sugar, oil massage of the abdomen and flanks, and cupping of the uterus. At the end of treatment, complete rehabilitation was achieved and menstruation irregularity, gastritis, and parasomnia were resolved. Based on the results, if a patient follows the rules and has a healthy lifestyle, inappropriate humor is unable to appear, the healing can be stable, and this disease or similar melancholic disorders fail to occur.

The identification of mechanisms related to stress vulnerability and development of PTSD specifically in a veteran population may aid in the prevention of PTSD and identification of novel treatment targets.
   Methods: Veterans with PTSD (n= 27), trauma-exposed veterans with no PTSD (TEC, n= 18) and non-traumaexposed controls (NTEC, n= 28) underwent single-voxel proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3 Tesla in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) using a two-dimensional (2D) J-resolved point spectroscopy sequence in addition to completing a clinical battery.
   Results: The PTSD and TEC groups demonstrated lower gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)/H2O (p= 0.02) and glutamine (Gln)/H2O (p= 0.02) in the dACC as compared to the NTEC group. The PTSD group showed a trend towards higher Glu/GABA (p= 0.053) than the NTEC group. Further, GABA/H2O in the dACC correlated negatively with sleep symptoms in the PTSD group (p= 0.03) but not in the TEC and NTEC groups.
   Limitations: Cross-sectional study design, concomitant medications, single voxel measurement as opposed to global changes, absence of measure of childhood or severity of trauma and objective sleep measures, female participants not matched for menstrual cycle phase.
   Conclusions: Exposure to trauma in veterans may be associated with lower GABA/H2O and Gln/H2O in the dACC, suggesting disruption in the GABA-Gln-glutamate cycle. Further, altered Glu/GABA in the dACC in the PTSD group may indicate an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Further, lower GABA/H2O in the ACC was associated with poor sleep in the PTSD group. Treatments that restore GABAergic balance may be particularly effective in reducing sleep symptoms in PTSD.

TI  - Head cooling during sleep improves sleep quality in the luteal phase in female university students: A randomized crossover-controlled pilot study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Although selective head-cooling has been reported to decrease scalp and tympanic temperature and improve sleep quality, whether head-cooling during sleep can improve sleep quality in women during the luteal phase has not been elucidated. This randomized, controlled crossover open trial aimed to investigate the effect of head cooling during sleep on sleep quality in women during the luteal phase. Female university students aged 19-25 years with increased daytime sleepiness during the luteal phase were recruited by poster advertisement at their university from May to June 2016 and from May to June 2017. Fourteen women aged 19-22 years participated in this study. The temperature-controllable cooling sheet containing tubes filled with circulating water was used for head-cooling, and the head-cooling and the controlled temperature were set at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively. Electroencephalogram data were obtained using a single-channel portable electroencephalogram device. The difference in sleep-related variables and tympanic temperature between head-cooling and control were analyzed using a linear mixed model. The proportion of arousal was lower with head cooling than with the control. In contrast, the proportion of non-REM3 and the delta power were higher with head cooling than with the control. The proportion of non-REM2 and non-REM3 among sleep EEG stages were positively and negatively correlated with the mean tympanic temperature during sleep, respectively. However, arousal and REM were not correlated with tympanic temperature. We considered the reduction of arousal time by head-cooling might be related to scalp temperature rather than tympanic temperature. Further, our results suggested that head-cooling also improved subjective sleep comfort. In conclusion, head-cooling during sleep could improve sleep quality in young women during the luteal phase.

TI  - Chinese Medicines Improve Perimenopausal Symptoms Induced by Surgery, Chemoradiotherapy, or Endocrine Treatment for Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The application of surgery, chemoradiotherapy, and endocrine treatment successfully increases survival rates of breast cancer patients. However, perimenopausal symptoms, the main side effects of these treatments, often afflict patients and reduce their quality of life. Perimenopausal symptoms include vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, arthromuscular symptoms, and osteoporosis. Currently, there are no satisfactory treatments for perimenopausal symptoms that result from these treatments. Therefore, alternative and complementary therapies including herbal medicines represented by Chinese medicines (CMs), acupuncture, massage, and psychotherapy are increasingly being expected and explored. In this paper, we review the effects and potentials of several CM formulae, along with some active ingredients or fractions from CMs, Chinese herbal extracts, and other herbal medicines, which have drawn attention for improving perimenopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients. We also elaborate their possible mechanisms. Moreover, further studies for evaluation of standardized clinical efficacy should be scientifically well-designed and continuously performed to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of CMs for perimenopausal symptoms due to breast cancer therapy. The safety and value of estrogen-containing CMs for breast cancer should also be clarified.

TI  - Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Menopause
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Menopause is associated with problematic symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep problems, mood disorders, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and declines in cognitive functioning. Many women seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for symptom management. This article critically reviews the existing literature on CAM treatments most commonly used for menopausal symptoms. Electronic searches were conducted to identify relevant, English-language literature published through March 2017. Results indicate that mind and body practices may be of benefit in reducing stress and bothersomeness of some menopausal symptoms. In particular, hypnosis is a mind-body intervention that has consistently shown to have a clinically significant effect on reducing hot flashes. Evidence is mixed in regard to the efficacy of natural products and there are some safety concerns. Health care providers should consider the evidence on CAM in providing an integrative health approach to menopausal symptom management.

TI  - Obesity and cancer risk: Emerging biological mechanisms and perspectives
T2  - METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL
AB  - Continuously rising trends in obesity-related malignancies render this disease spectrum a public health priority. Worldwide, the burden of cancer attributable to obesity, expressed as population attributable fraction, is 11.9% in men and 13.1% in women. There is convincing evidence that excess body weight is associated with an increased risk for cancer of at least 13 anatomic sites, including endometrial, esophageal, renal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas; hepatocellular carcinoma; gastric cardia cancer; meningioma; multiple myeloma; colorectal, postmenopausal breast, ovarian, gallbladder and thyroid cancers. We first synopsize current epidemiologic evidence; the obesity paradox in cancer risk and mortality; the role of weight gain and weight loss in the modulation of cancer risk; reliable somatometric indicators for obesity and cancer research; and gender differences in obesity related cancers. We critically summarize emerging biological mechanisms linking obesity to cancer encompassing insulin resistance and abnormalities of the IGF-I system and signaling; sex hormones biosynthesis and pathway; subclinical chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress; alterations in adipokine pathophysiology; factors deriving from ectopic fat deposition; microenvironment and cellular perturbations including vascular perturbations, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, endoplasmic reticulum stress and migrating adipose progenitor cells; disruption of circadian rhythms; dietary nutrients; factors with potential significance such as the altered intestinal microbiome; and mechanic factors in obesity and cancer. Future perspectives regarding prevention, diagnosis and therapeutics are discussed. The aim of this review is to investigate how the interplay of these main potential mechanisms and risk factors, exerts their effects on target tissues provoking them to acquire a cancerous phenotype.

TI  - Low estradiol levels escalate menopausal symptoms leading to mild cognitive impairment in postmenopausal women
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDONESIA
AB  - BACKGROUND Women in menopause experience dramatic alterations in gonadal hormone concentrations, including diminished estradiol levels. It has been hypothesized that these hormonal changes may be responsible for the occurrences of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, sleep disruption, night sweats, and irritability, as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in postmenopausal women. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine if there is any association between hormonal changes and menopausal symptoms, including MCI in postmenopausal women.
   METHODS A total of 245 postmenopausal women were recruited for this cross-sectional study and classified into 2 groups; MCI and non-MCI groups. Diagnosis of MCI was made using the modified Petersen criteria. Variables such as subjects' age, duration of menopause, menopausal symptoms, anthropometric status, hormone levels, and cognitive status were assessed and statistically analyzed.
   RESULTS Of the 245 subjects enrolled in this study, 53.9% had MCI. Multivariate analysis found that sleep disruption and estradiol levels were independent risk factors of MCI in postmenopausal women. No significant correlation was found between menopausal symptoms and estradiol concentration.
   CONCLUSIONS Low estradiol levels were associated with higher risks of experiencing menopausal symptoms and MCI. Sleep disruption and estradiol levels were the most influential factors in the development of MCI in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Epidemiology of low-energy fracture in Chinese postmenopausal women: changing trend of incidence since menopause and associated risk factors, a national population-based survey
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to report the incidence of low-energy fracture since menopause in postmenopausal women <= 70 years and to explore associated risk factors
   Methods: This was a part of the Chinese National Fracture Survey (CNFS), which was carried out in eight provinces of China mainland between January and May 2015. Data on 68,783 postmenopausal women <= 70 years were extracted from the CNFS database for calculations and analyses.
   Results: A total of 309 women were confirmed to have low-energy fractures in 2014, indicating the incidence of 449.2 (95% CI, 399.3-499.2) per 100,000 women. There were two obvious peaks of fracture incidence at the 4th year and the 9th year since menopause. From the 10th year on, the fracture incidence rate presented the relatively steady trends over years, only with slight interannual fluctuation. After adjustment for confounding variables, advanced age, higher latitude, milk intake >= 1/d, residence >= 2nd floor without elevator, alcohol consumption, sleep duration <7 h/d, history of past fracture, and more births were identified as significant risk factors. Supplementation of calcium or vitamin D or both was associated with 44% of fracture reduction (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.84).
   Conclusions: These data on low-energy fractures in postmenopausal women provided an updated clinical evidence base for better national healthcare planning and preventive efforts in China.

TI  - The effect of a polarity intervention on the insomnia and anxiety in middle-aged Quebec women
T2  - RECHERCHE EN SOINS INFIRMIERS
AB  - Many symptoms of menopause may contribute to poor sleep and insomnia. These symptoms may also be associated with anxiety and affect the quality of women's lives. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a polarity therapy on insomnia and anxiety for women aged 40 to 60 years old. Forty-seven women participated in this experimental study. The participants were randomly assigned to the experiment group (n = 25)-receiving 4 sessions on polarity-or to the control group (n = 22)-receiving information on healthy sleep habits. Data were collected during the pre-test and the post-test using the Morin Insomnia Severity Index and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (FormY). A significant difference was found between the groups and the measurement time with respect to insomnia scores (F = 28.66; p < 0.0001) and anxiety scores (F = 14.14; p < 0.0001). Women who received the polarity intervention showed a significant decrease in the severity of their insomnia and of their state of anxiety compared to those in the control group during post intervention. The polarity intervention was effective in reducing the women's symptoms of insomnia and anxiety in the middle-aged women.

TI  - Sleep disorders in polycystic ovary syndrome: influence of obesity and hyperandrogenism
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the sleep of subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with and without hyperandrogenism, in comparison with a healthy control group and examine the effects of hyperandrogenism and obesity on sleep parameters.
   METHODS: A total of 44 volunteers were recruited to participate in the study. Clinical, biochemical and polysomnographic parameters were used to diagnose PCOS and hyperandrogenism. The evaluation of sleep quality was made using validated questionnaires and polysomnography test. The frequency of obstructive sleep apnea was also compared between the groups.
   RESULTS: The study revealed that women with PCOS presented poorer subjective sleep quality, increased incidence of snoring and a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnea, based on the Berlin questionnaire. Also, after adjusting for body mass index, PCOS subjects had rapid eye movement (REM) time lower than those in the control group. PCOS women versus those without hyperandrogenism did not differ on any sleep measurement. Women with obstructive sleep apnea were only diagnosed in the PCOS group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PCOS impairs subjective sleep quality, as well as objective sleep quality, due to a reduction in REM sleep stage time in women diagnosed with the syndrome. Obesity affected sleep-related parameters but hyperandrogenism had no effect. Only the PCOS group had obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis.

TI  - Proteomic biomarkers of cognitive impairment in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
T2  - SLEEP AND BREATHING
AB  - PurposeThere are currently no biomarkers that are associated with cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). This pilot study performed an exploratory plasma proteomic analysis to discover potential biomarkers and explore proteomic pathways that differentiate OSAS subjects with and without CI.MethodsParticipants were selected from a cohort of women within 5years of menopause not on hormone replacement therapy between the ages of 45-60years. The Berlin questionnaire was used to select OSAS participants who then completed the MCFSI (Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument) to measure cognition. Six subjects with the highest MCFSI scores (5 denoting CI) were compared to six with normal scores. Proteomic analysis was done by Myriad RBM using a targeted ELISA for 254 serum proteins. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins was performed using STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) software.ResultsDistinct proteomic signatures were seen in OSAS subjects with CI as compared to those without CI. Proteins including insulin, prostasin, angiopoietin-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and interleukin-1 beta were overexpressed in OSAS subjects with CI. Proteins underexpressed in CI participants included cathepsin B, ceruloplasmin, and adiponectin. Pathway analysis revealed prominence of insulin-regulated vascular disease biomarkers.ConclusionsProteomic biomarkers in participants with cognitive impairment suggest roles for insulin, and vascular signaling pathways, some of which are similar to findings in Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of CI in OSAS will help focus clinical trials needed in this patient population.

TI  - Polyneuropathy in Severely Obese Women Without Diabetes: Prevalence and Associated Factors
T2  - OBESITY SURGERY
AB  - Background Obesity and its complications are prevalent in women and increase with age. Polyneuropathy (PNP) is a complication of obesity and bariatric surgery (BS). In subjects with severe (grades II and III) obesity and without DM who are candidates for BS, the prevalence of PNP and associated conditions are not well characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PNP in severely obese (SO) women without DM or common nutritional deficiencies in order to determine factors associated with the presence of PNP.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was performed on 450 SO women. They were evaluated with the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, a Sleep Apnea Questionnaire, and the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Data on blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamin B12, and postmenopausal (PM) status were also collected. Patients with DM and other common causes of PNP were excluded. To evaluate which variables were independently associated with PNP (dependent variable), Poisson regression models were used.
   Results The prevalence of PNP was 11.6%. In univariate analysis, PNP was associated with age, PM status, and diagnosis of systemic arterial hypertension (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.016, respectively), and there was a trend toward an association with sleep apnea risk (p=0.101). In multivariate analysis, PM status (PR=2.836, 95% CI 1.735-4.636, p=0.001) and age (PR=1.0511, 95% CI 1.031-1.071, p=0.001) were independently associated with PNP diagnosis in two different models.
   Conclusion Even prior to BS, PNP is highly prevalent and is associated with PM status and age in SO women without diabetes.

TI  - Treating insomnia improves depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal in postmenopausal women: comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), sleep restriction therapy, and sleep hygiene education
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Depression increases during menopause, and subclinical depressive symptoms increase risk for major depression. Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. \
   Materials and methods: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34 +/- 5.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up.
   Results: CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects.
   Conclusions: CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI.

TI  - Contraceptive Methods and the Impact of Menstruation on Daily Functioning in Women with Sickle Cell Disease
T2  - SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: Women with sickle cell disease (SCD) are living longer as a result of advances in the care of their underlying disease. With the population growing of women living with SCD, reproductive health issues in this population have become an emphasized area of medical care. We sought to describe current patterns of contraception use, menstruation, and quality-of-life (QOL) measures in women with SCD.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, we administered paper surveys at two academic medical centers to women aged 10 to 55 years with SCD to capture current contraceptive use, characteristics of menstrual cycles, and QOL metrics.
   Results: Of the 103 women who participated, 12.7% (13/102) experienced a duration of menses > 7 days (defined here as prolonged menstrual bleeding). Approximately half of women (51.5%, 53/103) used some form of contraception, with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections and condoms being the most common. During their last menstrual periods, women with both dysmenorrhea and prolonged menstrual bleeding (6.9%, 7/102) were more likely to experience more days of poor QOL, with more nights with sleep disturbance (P = 0.001) and more days with trouble taking care of themselves (P = 0.003), as well as being unable to do things they previously enjoyed (P = 0.001), compared with those with neither phenomenon (28.2%, 29/103).
   Conclusions: Dysmenorrhea and prolonged menstrual bleeding negatively affect the QOL of women with SCD. Menstrual histories and preventive measures for menstruation-related morbidity should be incorporated into routine evaluations of women with SCD.

TI  - Exercise and Insomnia Risk in Middle-Aged Women
T2  - JNP-JOURNAL FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS
AB  - Middle-aged women are at risk for insomnia, which may be ameliorated by exercise; however, the appropriate dose is ill defined. The association between an exercise dose and insomnia symptoms in middle-aged women was investigated in a cross-sectional descriptive study using self-report surveys for activity, insomnia, and menopause symptoms. Insomnia symptoms were assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index, and other symptoms and activities were assessed by an author-developed questionnaire. Logistic regression identified that self-selected/paced exercise levels are associated with significant (P < .05) risk reduction for insomnia symptoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Alterations in Temporal Summation of Pain and Conditioned Pain Modulation Across an Episode of Experimental Exercise-Induced Low Back Pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN
AB  - Persistent pain conditions, including low back pain (LBP), are often accompanied by alterations in pronociceptive and antinociceptive mechanisms, as quantified by temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). It remains unclear whether altered pain sensitivity, CPM, and/or TSP are a consequence of pain presence or determine the degree of pain development. Pressure pain sensitivity, TSP, and CPM were assessed across an episode of exercise-induced LBP maintained for several days. Thirty healthy individuals participated in 3 experimental sessions: before (day 0), 2 days after fatiguing back muscle exercise with exercise-induced LBP present (day 2), and after pain resolution (day 7). Both handheld and cuff pressure pain thresholds, along with TSP (10-cuff pain stimuli at .5 Hz) and CPM (cuff pain detection threshold prior versus during painful pressure conditioning) were assessed, alongside questionnaires pertaining to pain, disability, mood, sleep, menstruation, physical activity, and catastrophizing. The exercise-induced LBP model produced mild pain and disability, and reductions in pressure pain thresholds over both the lumbar and distant testing sites (p <.007). No pain-related changes were observed for TSP (p >.44) or CPM (p >.17). The baseline TSP was associated with the peak pain intensity of the exercise-induced LBP (p <.003).
   Perspective: Pressure pain sensitivity was impacted by the presence of exercise-induced LBP, whereas TSP seemed to be more stable and was instead associated with the intensity of pain developed. No significant pain-related changes or associations were observed for CPM, suggesting this measure may have less usefulness in mild musculoskeletal pain conditions.

TI  - Melatonin: Another avenue for treating osteoporosis?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH
AB  - Melatonin is a signal molecule that modulates the biological circadian rhythms of vertebrates. Melatonin deficiency is thought to be associated with several disorders, including insomnia, cancer, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulating evidence has also indicated that melatonin may be involved in the homeostasis of bone metabolism. Age-related reductions in melatonin are considered to be critical factors in bone loss and osteoporosis with aging. Thus, serum melatonin levels might serve as a biomarker for the early detection and prevention of osteoporosis. Compared to conventional antiosteoporosis medicines, which primarily inhibit bone loss, melatonin both suppresses bone loss and promotes new bone formation. Mechanistically, by activating melatonin receptor 2 (MT2), melatonin upregulates the gene expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), BMP6, osteocalcin, and osteoprotegerin to promote osteogenesis while inhibiting the receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) pathway to suppress osteolysis. In view of the distinct actions of melatonin on bone metabolism, we hypothesize that melatonin may be a novel remedy for the prevention and clinical treatment of osteoporosis.

TI  - Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in polycystic ovary syndrome
T2  - CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Objective Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased obesity with a greater propensity to weight gain and a lack of sustainable lifestyle interventions. Altered brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is a potential contributor to obesity in PCOS. BAT activity and modulation have not been studied in PCOS. This observational study explored BAT thermogenesis and its associations in women with and without PCOS. Participants and methods Cutaneous temperature was recorded from supraclavicular (indicator of BAT activity) and upper arm regions using dataloggers (SubCue, Calgary, Canada) in a cross-sectional substudy, nested within a randomized control trial, of community-recruited premenopausal women with (n = 47, Rotterdam diagnostic criteria) and without (n = 11) PCOS. Results Complete temperature data were available in 44 PCOS (mean age: 30.0 +/- 6.2, mean BMI: 29.3 +/- 5.5) and 11 non-PCOS (mean age: 33.0 +/- 7.0, mean BMI: 25 +/- 3) women. Women with PCOS had lower supraclavicular skin temperature compared to controls overall (33.9 +/- 0.7 vs 34.5 +/- 1, P < 0.05) and during sleep (34.5 +/- 0.6 vs 35.2 +/- 0.9, P < 0.001). In the PCOS group, supraclavicular skin temperature overall and over sleep and waking hours correlated inversely with testosterone (r = -0.41 P < 0.05, r = -0.485 P r = -0.450 P < 0.01 respectively). Testosterone levels explained approximately 15%, 30% and 20% of the variability in supraclavicular skin temperature overall and over sleep and waking hours in women with PCOS, respectively. Conclusion Women with PCOS have lower BAT activity compared to controls. BAT thermogenesis is negatively associated with androgen levels in PCOS.

TI  - Sleep restriction alters reactive aggressive behavior and its relationship with sex hormones
T2  - AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR
AB  - Few studies have experimentally manipulated sleep to study its effect on aggressive behavior. The current study examined how reactive aggression was affected by having sleep restricted to 4-hours on a single night, a level of disruption commonly experienced. Both rested and sleep-restricted participants completed the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), a laboratory task in which participants seek to earn points, are provoked by a fictitious opponent stealing their points, and may choose to steal points in response. Logistic mixed-effect models were used to investigate the effect of sleep restriction and the role of sex hormones on the odds of choosing to steal. For men, and women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction did not result in significant changes reactive aggression, although the patterns of aggressive behavior appeared less reactive and retaliatory in nature. For women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction was associated with higher levels of reactive aggression. For both men and women in the luteal phase, sleep restriction disrupted an association between hormone change over the task (testosterone and estradiol, respectively) and reactive aggression that was observed in their control participants. In addition, higher testosterone before the PSAP in men was associated with maintaining a high level of stealing over the task. These results indicate a complex dynamic in which sex hormones and sleep interact to predict aggressive behavior in response to provocation.

TI  - Quality of life in climacteric women assisted by primary health care
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This cross-sectional study evaluated the quality of life and associated factors of climacteric women in Brazil using a random and representative sample of women assisted by primary care professionals. We investigated the variables using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, MENQOL, whose mean scores were compared using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests according to the sample characteristics. The variables associated with the outcomes in univariate analyses with a p <= 0.2 were jointly evaluated using multiple linear regression. In this study, 849 women ranging in age from 40 to 65 years were evaluated. The predictors of poor quality of life in the vasomotor domain were women with severe climacteric symptoms (p<0.001), increased Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.006), sleep (p = 0.022), and postmenopausal (p<0.001) alterations. For the psychosocial domain, the associated variables were severe climacteric symptoms (p<0.001) and sleep alterations (p<0.001); for the physical domain, the associated variables were severe climacteric symptoms (p<0.001), increased BMI (p<0.001), sleep (p<0.001), and postmenopausal (p<0.001) alterations. Severe climacteric symptoms, low sleep quality, increased BMI, and postmenopausal status were factors that were more associated with impairments in quality of life. With the increase in life expectancy, we suggest that greater attention should be paid to women's quality of life associated with climacteric symptoms.

TI  - Revisiting the biological perspective in the use of biopsychosocial assessments in social work
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The call for increased attention to the biopsychosocial perspective in social work practice is now decades old in the USA. And yet the challenge of teaching and learning from this perspective for those with limited background in biology calls for more inter-disciplinary examples to assist students with the process of engaging in theory-informed practice. In addition to identifying the key elements of human biology, this review of the literature focuses on four examples of client behaviors that receive little or no attention in most current textbooks on the inter-disciplinary nature of human behavior in the social environment; namely, the psychobiology of sleep, the sociobiology of eating, the neurobiology of post-partum depression, and the behavioral endocrinology of menopause. This review concludes with implications for practice.

TI  - Impact of obstructive sleep apnea on cerebral blood flow
T2  - POSTEPY HIGIENY I MEDYCYNY DOSWIADCZALNEJ
AB  - Aim: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with growing incidence. Major risk factors for OSA are obesity, aging, gender and menopause. As life expectancy lengthens and the obesity epidemic is ongoing, we can assume that OSA will affect an increasing part of the population. Pathological consequences of this disease include an increased risk of arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, heart failure as well as cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke, transient ischemic attack and cognitive dysfunction. The cerebrovascular system differs significantly from other vessels in the body. Brain oxygen demands constitute about 20% of the total oxygen consumed by the body.
   Conclusions: OSA significantly affects the cerebral blood flow both during sleep and daily activities. This can have serious health consequences and makes the brain more vulnerable to ischemia. In this review we describe the impact of OSA on cerebral circulation during both sleep and wakefulness and we also outline the pathophysiology of these changes.
   Results: In patients with other risk factors for cerebral ischemia, early screening and treatment for OSA should be introduced.

TI  - Early versus late wake therapy improves mood more in antepartum versus postpartum depression by differentially altering melatonin-sleep timing disturbances
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Peripartum major depression (MD) disables mothers and impairs emotional and neurocognitive development of offspring. We tested the hypothesis that critically-timed wake therapy (WT) relieves peripartum MD by altering melatonin and sleep timing, differentially, in antepartum vs. postpartum depressed patients (DP).
   Methods: In a university clinical research center, we initially randomized 50 women-26 antepartum (17 healthy comparison-HC, 9 DP) and 24 postpartum (8 HC, 16 DP)-to a cross-over trial of one night of early-night wake therapy (EWT: sleep 3: 00-7: 00 am) vs. late-night wake therapy (LWT: sleep 9: 00 pm-01: 00 am). Ultimately, we obtained mood, overnight plasma melatonin and polysomnography for: 15 antepartum women receiving EWT, 18 receiving LWT; 15 postpartum women receiving EWT, 14 receiving LWT.
   Results: EWT improved mood more in antepartum vs. postpartum DP in conjunction with reduced (normalized) melatonin-sleep phase-angle differences (PADs) due to delayed melatonin onsets and advanced sleep onsets, and increased (from baseline) total sleep times (TST). LWT improved mood more in postpartum vs. antepartum DP in conjunction with increased TST.
   Limitations: Small samples potentially rendered the study underpowered to detect group differences, making confirmation with larger samples essential. Sufficient follow-up data were not available in most women to document the duration of the mood response to wake therapy.
   Conclusions: EWT benefitted antepartum DP more by realigning melatonin and sleep timing, whereas LWT benefitted postpartum DP more by increasing TST. Thus, consistent with precision medicine aims, maximum mood benefits accrue from timing sleep/wake interventions to specific peripartum circadian pathophysiologies.

TI  - Multiple poor sleep characteristics and metabolic abnormalities consistent with metabolic syndrome among white, black, and Hispanic/Latina women: modification by menopausal status
T2  - DIABETOLOGY & METABOLIC SYNDROME
AB  - Poor sleep is a potential risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MetS), and its relationship with MetS may vary by race/ethnicity and menopausal status among women.
   We used Sister Study enrollment data from 2003 to 2009 to investigate the cross-sectional associations between multiple subjective sleep characteristics and having ae 3 prevalent metabolic abnormalities consistent with MetS among white, black, and Hispanic/Latina women. Self-reported sleep characteristics included average sleep duration (short [< 7 h] vs. recommended [7-9 h]), sleep debt (ae 2-h difference between shortest and longest sleep duration, napping ae<yen> 3 times/week, and insomnia symptoms (difficulty falling or staying asleep). We used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare MetS prevalence between women with poor sleep (e.g., short sleep, sleep debt, frequent napping, or insomnia symptoms [all yes vs. no]) and non-poor sleep within menopausal status categories (premenopausal or postmenopausal). We adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, mental health, and health behaviors.
   Among 38,007 eligible women (13,988 premenopausal, 24,019 postmenopausal), mean age was 55 +/- 8.8 years, racial/ethnic composition was 86.63% white, 8.53% black, and 4.84% Hispanic/Latina, and 12% had MetS. Associations between certain poor sleep characteristics [i.e., short sleep (PRpremenopausal = 1.23 [95% CI 1.06-1.42], PRpostmenopausal = 1.09 [1.02-1.16], p(short sleep*menopause) = 0.0070) and insomnia symptoms (PRpremenopausal = 1.21 [1.05-1.41], PRpostmenopausal = 1.11 [1.05-1.18], p(insomnia symptoms*menopause) = 0.035)] and prevalent MetS were stronger among premenopausal compared to postmenopausal women, but did not vary by race/ethnicity. Associations between concurrent short sleep/insomnia symptoms and MetS were stronger among white and Hispanic/Latina postmenopausal women compared to their black counterparts. Menopausal status and race/ethnicity did not modify positive associations for other poor sleep characteristics.
   Poor sleep was positively associated with MetS prevalence. Associations between individual poor sleep characteristics (i.e., short sleep, insomnia symptoms) were stronger among premenopausal compared to postmenopausal women but did not vary by race/ethnicity.

TI  - Onset Patterns and Course of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Background: Epidemiologic studies of myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) have examined different aspects of this disease separately but few have explored them together.
   Objective: Describe ME/CFS onset and course in one United States-based cohort.
   Methods: One hundred and fifty subjects fitting Fukuda 1994 CFS criteria completed a detailed survey concerning the initial and subsequent stages of their illness. Descriptive statistics, graphs, and tables were used to illustrate prevalence and patterns of characteristics.
   Results: The most common peri-onset events reported by subjects were infection-related episodes (64%), stressful incidents (39%), and exposure to environmental toxins (20%). For 38% of subjects, more than 6 months elapsed from experiencing any initial symptom to developing the set of symptoms comprising their ME/CFS. Over time, the 12 most common symptoms persisted but declined in prevalence, with fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, exertion-related sickness, and flu-like symptoms declining the most (by 20-25%). Conversely, cognitive symptoms changed the least in prevalence, rising in symptom ranking. Pregnancy, menopause, and menstrual cycles exacerbated many women's symptoms. Fatigue-related function was not associated with duration of illness or age; during the worst periods of their illness, 48% of subjects could not engage in any productive activity. At the time of survey, 47% were unable to work and only 4% felt their condition was improving steadily with the majority (59%) describing a fluctuating course. Ninety-seven percent suffered from at least one other illness: anxiety (48%), depression (43%), fibromyalgia (39%), irritable bowel syndrome (38%), and migraine headaches (37%) were the most diagnosed conditions. Thirteen percent came from families where at least one other first-degree relative was also afflicted, rising to 27% when chronic fatigue of unclear etiology was included.
   Conclusions: This paper offers a broad epidemiologic overview of one ME/CFS cohort in the United States. While most of our findings are consistent with prior studies, we highlight underexamined aspects of this condition (e.g., the evolution of symptoms) and propose new interpretations of findings. Studying these aspects can offer insight and solutions to the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition.

TI  - Risk factors for sexual dysfunction in BRCA mutation carriers after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to identify risk factors for sexual dysfunction in BRCA mutation carriers who have undergone risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with and without RRSO were surveyed to determine sexual function (Female Sex Function Index [FSFI]), demographics, medical history, sleep quality, depression, and anxiety scores. Characteristics of patients with the lowest quartile of FSFI scores (< 14 +/- 8.8) were analyzed to identify risk factors for the most severe phenotype.
   Results: In the 804 women surveyed, 764 underwent RRSO. Of the 529 (69%) carriers with completed FSFI questionnaires in the RRSO cohort, sexual dysfunction was reported in 77.3%. Poor sleep (P = 0.002), hot flashes (P = 0.002), lack of current systemic hormone therapy (HT) use (P = 0.002), depression (P< 0.001), and anxiety (P = 0.001) were associated with sexual dysfunction. In adjusted analyses, depression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.4, 95% CI, 1.4-4.1) and hot flashes (aOR 1.9, 95% CI, 1.2-3.0) remained significantly associated with sexual dysfunction. Depression was also a significant risk factor for the most severe degree of sexual dysfunction (OR 2.1, 95% CI, 1.3-3.5) and had the greatest impact on Arousal and Satisfaction domain scores of the FSFI. Current systemic HT use seemed to decrease the risk for sexual dysfunction (aOR 0.6, 95% CI, 0.4-1.0).
   Conclusions: Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent in BRCA mutation carriers after RRSO. Depression seems to be a significant risk factor for sexual dysfunction in this patient population and may be under-recognized and undertreated. Patient and provider education on sexual side effects after surgery and risk factors for sexual dysfunction is necessary to decrease postoperative sexual distress. HT may be associated with improved sexual function after surgery.

TI  - Decreasing sleep-related symptoms through increasing physical activity among Asian American midlife women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The beneficial effects of physical activities on sleep-related symptoms have been reported in the literature, and physical activity has been suggested as an efficient strategy to reduce sleep-related symptoms among midlife women. The effect of Web-based physical activity promotion programs on sleep-related symptoms have, however, rarely been explored, especially among midlife racial/ethnic minority women. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the preliminary efficacy of a WPAPP on self-reported sleep-related symptoms and physical activity of Asian American midlife women.
   Methods: This pilot study was a randomized repeated measures pretest/posttest control group study (14 in an intervention group and 12 in a control group). Multiple instruments were used to measure background characteristics (eg, sociodemographic and health status), sleep-related symptoms and physical activity experiences at pretest, post 1 month, and post 3 months. The data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat linear mixed-model growth curve analysis.
   Results: After adjusting for covariates and random intercept, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in the total numbers of psychological (P = 0.0956) and total sleep-related symptoms (P = 0.0733) at post 1 month. Also, both groups showed a significant increase in physical activity (active living habits) at post 3 months (P = 0.0353).
   Conclusions: The WPAPP is potentially beneficial in decreasing Asian American midlife women's sleep-related symptoms and promoting their lifestyle physical activity.

TI  - Demands for perimenopausal health care in women aged 40 to 60 years-a hospital-based cross-sectional study in Shanghai, China
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to describe the major complaints of menopausal symptoms among middle-aged women who initiated healthcare seeking for menopausal symptoms and to understand the factors influencing women's decisions to seek perimenopausal health care in Shanghai, China.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in five hospitals in Shanghai. Women aged 40 to 60 years at their first visit to the perimenopausal outpatient departments/clinics were investigated in person over a 3-month period. Information on sociodemographics, menopausal symptoms, and experiences in seeking perimenopausal health care was collected using a structured questionnaire. Menopausal symptoms were assessed with the modified Kupperman Menopausal Index (mKMI).
   Results: A total of 316 women were enrolled in the study, with an average age of 50.5 years (SD: 5.1 y). The prevalence of menopausal syndrome (mKMI >6 points) was 80%, with 7% of the cases being severe. The top five reported symptoms were hot flushes/sweating (62%), fatigue (54%), sleep disturbance (51%), mood swings (40%), and joint/muscle pain (40%). The median interval between symptom occurrence and seeking perimenopausal health care was 5.0 months (IQR: 2.0-23.3 mo). Cox regression analysis revealed that older age, no health insurance, employment, multiple symptoms, sleep disturbance, urinary incontinence, and visits to nonspecialized departments were significantly associated with a longer delay in seeking perimenopausal health services (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The prevalence of menopausal syndrome was relatively high among 40- to 60-year-old women who initiated healthcare seeking in Shanghai. Months of delay occurred before they sought perimenopausal health services. The delay was related to age, the nature and number of symptoms, working status, and health insurance. Improvement of the menopausal health knowledge in Chinese middle-aged women may lead to more timely healthcare seeking. Professional and accessible perimenopausal health services are in high demand in Shanghai.

TI  - Guidelines for the Evaluation and Treatment of Perimenopausal Depression: Summary and Recommendations
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - There is a new appreciation of the perimenopausedefined as the early and late menopause transition stages as well as the early postmenopauseas a window of vulnerability for the development of both depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes. However, clinical recommendations on how to identify, characterize and treat clinical depression are lacking. To address this gap, an expert panel was convened to systematically review the published literature and develop guidelines on the evaluation and management of perimenopausal depression. The areas addressed included: (1) epidemiology; (2) clinical presentation; (3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; (4) effects of hormone therapy; and (5) efficacy of other therapies (e.g., psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). Overall, evidence generally suggests that most midlife women who experience a major depressive episode during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression. Midlife depression presents with classic depressive symptoms commonly in combination with menopause symptoms (i.e., vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance), and psychosocial challenges. Menopause symptoms complicate, co-occur, and overlap with the presentation of depression. Diagnosis involves identification of menopausal stage, assessment of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of the psychosocial factors common in midlife, differential diagnoses, and the use of validated screening instruments. Proven therapeutic options for depression (i.e., antidepressants, psychotherapy) are the front-line treatments for perimenopausal depression. Although estrogen therapy is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression, there is evidence that it has antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women, particularly those with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Data on estrogen plus progestin are sparse and inconclusive.

TI  - Sleep duration and risk of breast cancer: The JACC Study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - PurposeThe evidence on beneficial or adverse effects of sleep duration on risk of breast cancer remains controversial and limited, especially in Asia.MethodsA prospective study of 34,350 women aged 40-79years in whom sleep duration, and menstrual and reproductive histories were determined by a self-administered questionnaire. The follow-up period was from 1988 to 2009, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer incidence were calculated for shorter sleep duration in reference to sleep duration of 8h/day by Cox proportional hazard models.ResultsDuring 19.2-year median follow-up (236 cases), we found a significant inverse association between sleep duration and risk of breast cancer, especially among postmenopausal women and women with low parity (nulliparous and women with <3 children); the multivariable HRs (95% CIs) among postmenopausal women who reported 7h/day and 6h/day of sleep in reference to 8h/day were 1.49 (0.81-2.76) and 1.98 (1.08-3.70) (P for trend=0.028), respectively, and the corresponding values among women with low parity were 1.50 (0.96-2.35) and 1.76 (1.01-2.79) (P for trend=0.018).ConclusionsShort sleep duration was associated with increased risk of incident breast cancer, especially among postmenopausal women and women with low parity.

TI  - Sex differences in sleep and sleep loss-induced cognitive deficits: The influence of gonadal hormones
T2  - HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Males and females can respond differentially to the same environmental stimuli and experimental conditions. Chronic sleep loss is a frequent and growing problem in many modern societies and has a broad variety of negative outcomes for health and well-being. While much has been done to explore the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on cognition in both human and animal studies over the last few decades, very little attention has been paid to the part played by sex differences and gonadal steroids in respect of changes in cognitive functions caused by sleep loss. The effects of gonadal hormones on sleep regulation and cognitive performances are well established. Reduced gonadal function in menopausal women and elderly men is associated with sleep disturbances and cognitive decline as well as dementia, which suggests that sex steroids play a key role in modulating these conditions. Finding out whether there are sex differences in respect of the effect of insufficient sleep on cognition, and how neuroendocrine mediators influence cognitive impairment induced by SD could provide valuable insights into the best therapies for each sex. In this review, we aim to highlight the involvement of sex differences and gonadal hormone status on the severity of cognitive deficits induced by sleep deficiency in both human and animal studies.

TI  - Geographical Differences in Trigger Factors of Tension-Type Headaches and Migraines
T2  - CURRENT PAIN AND HEADACHE REPORTS
AB  - In this review, we discussed the types and frequencies of trigger factors of primary headache [migraine and tension-type headache (TTH)] among adult patients. We assessed the influence of geographical location, ethnicity and gender on the various trigger factors of a migraine and a TTH. We also evaluated the trigger factors among the multi-ethnic Southeast Asian adult patients. In a recent study, odor triggered more migrainous headaches compared to the other primary headaches. Odor was observed to be specific of migraines. Moreover, stress is one of the most common trigger factors for patients with migraines and TTHs worldwide. Migrainous patients have an increased sensitivity in comparison to non-migrainous patients. Furthermore, these patients have much difficulty in adapting to the high level of sensitivity, and the sensitized brain is therefore more vulnerable to trigger factors. In addition, the presence of one trigger factor may increase the exposure of other trigger factors. This phenomenon is more marked in the patients with migraines who have stress and menstruation as triggers, predisposing them to be more sensitive to other triggers. In conclusion, the geographical location factor has an influence on the trigger factors of headaches. Ethnicity may have an effect due to the cultural differences. Change in weather and sunlight are important commonly identified trigger factors for headaches. Moreover, gender differences in some trigger factors are present among the patients with headaches, especially sunlight and sleep deprivation. More research studies can be conducted to have a better understanding on trigger factors in the future. This will enable proper identification of trigger factors, leading to a decrease in the number of headache episodes and an improvement in quality of life for patients.

TI  - Treating chronic insomnia in postmenopausal women: a randomized clinical trial comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, sleep restriction therapy, and sleep hygiene education
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Insomnia is a leading cause of disability in postmenopausal women. Multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is a first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, but support for its efficacy in treating menopause-related insomnia is scarce. The present study evaluated whether CBTI is an efficacious treatment for menopause-related chronic insomnia, and whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious compared with CBTI.
   Methods: In a single-site, randomized controlled trial, 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 +/- 5.64 years) with chronic DSM-5 insomnia disorder related to menopause were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education (SHE), SRT, or CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and sleep diaries served as primary outcomes.
   Results: From baseline to posttreatment, ISI decreased 7.70 points in the CBTI group (p <.001), 6.56 points in the SRT group (p <.001), and 1.12 in the SHE group (p =.01). Although average sleep duration increased in all groups by 6 month follow-up, CBTI patients obtained 40-43 more minutes of nightly sleep than those who received SHE or SRT. Remission rates in the CBTI (54%-84%) and SRT (38%-57%) groups were higher than SHE patients (4%-33%) at posttreatment and 6 month follow-up. CBTI patients were generally more likely to remit than SRT patients.
   Conclusions: CBTI and SRT effectively treat menopause-related insomnia disorder and are superior to SHE. Response to CBTI and SRT is similar, but CBTI outperforms SRT in improving sleep maintenance, which may increase likelihood of remission.

TI  - Joint effects of multiple sleep characteristics on breast cancer progression by menopausal status
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Sleep has been closely linked to breast cancer risk. However, the association between sleep and breast cancer prognosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the separate and joint effects of multiple sleep characteristics on breast cancer prognosis among Chinese women.
   Methods: A total of 1580 breast cancer patients were recruited between October 2008 and December 2014 and followed up until December 31, 2017 in Guangzhou. Multivariate Cox models were conducted to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for breast cancer prognosis in association with sleep characteristics.
   Results: Long sleep duration at night (>9 h) (HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.01-5.42), poor sleep quality (HR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.74-5.47), and impaired daytime function (HR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.65-3.79) after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression. Both short sleep duration (<6 h) (HR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.06-3.77, P-interaction = 0.011) and long sleep duration (>9 h) (HR = 4.69, 95% CI: 1.31 -16.78, P-interaction = 0.187) increased the progression risk only among patients with impaired but not normal daytime function. In addition, daytime napping significantly modified the effect of short sleep duration on the progression (HR = 3.55, 0.59, 95% CI: 1.55-7.97, 0.23-1.53 for patients without and with daytime napping, respectively, P-interaction = 0.005). Stratification results suggested that the associations were more evident among pre-menopausal patients, although no significant interaction was observed.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggested that inadequate sleep duration to feel one's best and poor sleep quality after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression, particularly for pre-menopausal women. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neuronal SIRT1 Regulates Metabolic and Reproductive Function and the Response to Caloric Restriction
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ENDOCRINE SOCIETY
AB  - Sirt1 is an NAD-dependent, class III deacetylase that functions as a cellular energy sensor. In addition to its well-characterized effects in peripheral tissues, emerging evidence suggests that neuronal Sirt1 activity plays a role in the central regulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. In this study, we generated mice expressing an enzymatically inactive form (N-MUT) or wild-type (WT) SIRT1 (N-OX) in mature neurons. N-OX male and female mice had impaired glucose tolerance, and N-MUT female, but not male, mice had improved glucose tolerance compared with that of WT littermates. Furthermore, glucose tolerance was improved in all mice with caloric restriction (CR) but was greater in the N-OX mice, who had better glucose tolerance than their littermates. At the reproductive level, N-OX females had impaired estrous cycles, with increased cycle length and more time in estrus. LH and progesterone surges were absent on the evening of proestrus in the N-OX mice, suggesting a defect in spontaneous ovulation, which was confirmed by the ovarian histology revealing fewer corpora lutea. Despite this defect, the mice were still fertile when mated to WT mice on the day of proestrus, indicating that the mice could respond to normal pheromonal or environmental cues. When subjected to CR, the N-OX mice went into diestrus arrest earlier than their littermates. Together, these results suggested that the overexpression of SIRT1 rendered the mice more sensitive to the metabolic improvements and suppression of reproductive cycles by CR, which was independent of circadian rhythms.

TI  - Effect of lavender aromatherapy through inhalation on quality of life among postmenopausal women covered by a governmental health center in Isfahan, Iran: A single-blind clinical trial
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background: Various studies indicate the negative effects of menopausal symptoms and complications on the quality of life (QOL) of women. The tendency to use different methods of complementary medicine to control menopausal symptoms is increasing. In addition, lavender essential oil has been shown to have positive effects on some symptoms associated with menopause. Thus, the present study was conducted with the aim to determine the effect of lavender aromatherapy on the QOL of postmenopausal women.
   Materials and methods: A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted on 62 postmenopausal women referred to health centers of Isfahan, Iran. The subjects were divided into two groups of control and intervention. The intervention group inhaled 2% lavender essential oil every night before bedtime for 20 minutes during one month. The control group received the placebo (distilled water) in the same manner as the intervention group. The data collection tools were the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL)and a demographic characteristics questionnaire. The results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests in SPSS software.
   Results: The independent t-test showed a significant difference in the mean total score of QOL and its various dimensions (vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual dimensions) after the intervention between the aromatherapy and placebo groups (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Inhalation aromatherapy using lavender essential oil can improve the QOL of postmenopausal women with a reduction in the severity of complications and physical-psychological symptoms.

TI  - Social jetlag and menstrual symptoms among female university students
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Menstrual symptoms may have a significant impact on women's lives. Many women experience menses-related health problems, such as menstrual pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and premenstrual syndrome, during their reproductively fertile years. Circadian misalignment in shift workers has been reported to contribute to menstrual cycle irregularity and/or painful menstruation. However, the relationship between social jetlag (SJL) and menstrual symptoms/menstrual cycle has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to elucidate this relationship among female university students. One-hundred and fifty female university students (mean [SD]: 18.8 [0.71]-years old) completed self-reported questionnaires consisting of menstrual symptoms and menstrual cycle, sleep quality and sleep habits, quality of life, and demographic variables. The average menstrual cycle was 32.0 [5.4] days. The percentage of students who showed menstrual cycle irregularity, having less than 25 days or more than 39 days of menstrual cycle during the previous four menstrual cycles, was 60.6%. SJL, the difference between mid-sleep time on free days and mid-sleep time on school days, was categorized into small (absolute SJL < 1 h) or large (>= 1 h). Overall, 78.0% of participants had SJL >= 1 h. Among the menstrual symptoms, pain, behavioral change, and water retention subscale scores were significantly higher in the SJL >= 1 h group than in the SJL < 1 h group. However, no significant differences were found in concentration, autonomic reaction, or negative affect subscale scores between the two groups. The menstrual cycle was 31.2 [5.5] days in the SJL < 1 h group and 32.2 [5.4] days in the SJL >= 1 h group, without significant difference. Logistic regression analysis showed that more than 1 h of SJL was a significant associated factor with severe menstrual symptom, independently of sleep duration and late chronotype. This study indicated that SJL was a significant factor associated with severe menstrual symptoms, suggesting the possibilities of association between circadian system and reproductive function among humans.

TI  - Sleep well in the prime of life
T2  - GYNAKOLOGISCHE ENDOKRINOLOGIE
AB  - This article deals with the causes, sequelae and treatment options for sleep disorders, particularly for women in the menopause. In addition to an overview of physiological mechanisms of sleep regulation and the function of the so-called internal clock, a detailed presentation of age-related alterations and sex-specific differences in the control of the sleep-wake rhythm is given. With respect to the treatment of sleep disorders, an in-depth investigation of the negative effects of an exaggerated attention on sleep and the sleep-promoting effect of sufficient exposure to daylight are presented. In addition to behavioral medical interventions, there are also possibilities for pharmaceutical support of sleep, e.g. using hormone substitution in age-related melatonin deficiency or administration of estrogen or progesterone for menopausal and postmenopausal women. In certain situations the use of prescription only soporifics, particularly benzodiazepine agonists is also possible. If these treatment options are unsuccessful, referral to a specialized sleep disorders center should be undertaken in order to exclude other organic diseases.

TI  - The menstrual cycle associated with insomnia in newly employed nurses performing shift work: a 12-month follow-up study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to investigate whether insomnia among newly-employed shift-working nurses is associated with menstrual cycle irregularity.MethodsWe followed 287 nurses employed between 2015 and 2016 for 12 months. An Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was completed to determine levels of insomnia 6 months after beginning work. At baseline and at 12-month follow-up, menstrual cycle information was obtained using clinical interviews. We analyzed baseline data separately by prevalence (participants with menstrual irregularity, n=287) and incidence (participants with no reported menstrual irregularity, n=238).ResultsIn a multivariate logistic regression analysis, including age, body mass index, and physical activity, insomnia was associated with a 2.05-fold increase in the odds of newly developing menstrual cycle irregularity compared with not having insomnia [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-3.77]. Insomnia was associated with a 3.05-fold increase in the prevalence of menstrual cycle irregularity compared with not having insomnia (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.81-5.13). As the ISI score increased, both the incidence and prevalence odds of menstrual cycle irregularity tended to increase.ConclusionsInsomnia can induce menstrual cycle irregularity among nurses working shifts, and insomnia may have an important role in the pathway from shift work to menstrual dysfunction, aside from the possible effects of circadian rhythm disruption.

TI  - Psychosocial Stress Before a Nap Increases Sleep Latency and Decreases Early Slow-Wave Activity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Sleep disturbances are an important risk factor for stress-related diseases such as burnout or depression. In particular, slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep might be eminently relevant for optimal maintenance of mental health and cognitive functioning. In spite of the clinical importance and the pertinence of stress-related processes in everyday life, the physiological mechanisms of the association between stress, sleep, and cognition are not well-understood. In the present study, we carefully mapped the time course of the influence of a psychosocial stressor on sleep architecture and sleep-related oscillations during a midday nap. We induced stress using a psychosocial laboratory stressor, the Montreal Imaging Stress Task, vs. a neutral control task. Afterward, participants were allowed to take a 90-min nap (n = 20) or stayed awake (n = 19) and cortisol was measured via saliva samples. We hypothesized that stress would decrease sleep efficiency and SWA in a time-dependent manner, with impairing effects on cognitive functioning. Psychosocial stress resulted in increased cortisol levels, which were elevated throughout the study interval. In the nap group, psychosocial stress increased sleep latency, but had only minor effects on sleep architecture. Still, SWA in the first 30 min of sleep was significantly reduced, whereas alpha activity was enhanced. These effects vanished after approximately 30 min. No impairing effect on cognitive functioning occurred. Our results show that psychosocial stress before sleep has an impact on sleep latency and early SWA during sleep. In contrast to our hypothesis, the effects were rather small and short-lasting. Importantly, cognitive functioning was maintained. We conclude that the effects of psychosocial stress before a nap are possibly better compensated than previously believed.

T2  - HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES
AB  - BackgroundThis study evaluated the impact of an exercise program on quality of life in older breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.MethodsOlder breast cancer survivors were randomized into two groups: combined training: resistance + aerobic exercise program for nine months (n=18) or control group (n=18). Quality of life was assessed by the questionnaires SF36, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC QLQ-BR23 at baseline, and at three, six, and nine months. The exercise group performed 40min of resistance exercises on machines followed by 30min of aerobic training on a treadmill 3x/wk. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the groups over time.ResultsSignificant time x group interactions and moderate to high effect sizes were found for physical functioning, physical health, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, fatigue, sleep disturbance, body image, and upset by hair loss, favoring the exercise group.ConclusionThis study demonstrated the potential benefits and high clinical relevance of exercise programs to improve quality of life in older breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.

T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - For 15years, the Collaborative Group for Research of the Climacteric in Latin America (REDLINC) has been conducting research on several topics including age of menopause, metabolic syndrome, quality of life and climacteric symptoms, sexual dysfunction, poor quality of sleep and insomnia, and use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in the general population and among gynecologists. Examples of data to have emerged for this region include the age of menopause (49years), a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (42.9%), and a new waist circumference cut-off value for the Latin American population (88cm). Sexual dysfunction, poor quality of life, and sleep disorders have a prevalence of over 50%, with obesity and sedentary lifestyles affected importantly. MHT use is still low (12.5%), lack of prescription the most important reason for not using it, and gynecologists use MHT for themselves but do not recommend it often to their patients. The prevalence of alternative therapy use, recommended by physicians, is high.

TI  - The neurokinin B pathway in the treatment of menopausal hot flushes
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Hot flushes remain a debilitating aspect of menopause, disrupting daytime activities and sleep, and may last for years. Estrogen replacement is an effective treatment, but takes time to become maximally effective and is contraindicated in a significant proportion of women, most notably after breast cancer. Effective, non-hormonal therapies are therefore required. Recent years have seen substantial increases in understanding of the role of novel neuropeptides and tachykinins in hypothalamic function, particularly in the regulation of the reproductive axis through control of gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion, but with links to the control of vasomotor function. Neurokinin B, often co-expressed with kisspeptin in hypothalamic neurons, appears to be a key factor in the control of both systems. Several neurokinin B antagonists have been developed; data are emerging as to their effectiveness in the treatment of menopausal hot flushes. While data remain limited, these agents appear to have a remarkably fast onset of action, with the first 1 or 2days of administration, and with a dramatic effect on both daytime flushes and night sleep disturbance. If safety and long-term function can be confirmed, these novel agents will be an important advance in therapy.

TI  - Optimizing quality of life through sex steroids by their effects on neurotransmitters
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - Menopause-related symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, weight gain, and decreased sexual functioning all have negative impacts on quality of life and affect daily activities such as sleep, work, and leisure activities. During the menopause transition, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurosteroids undergo important changes as a consequence of the failure of gonadal hormone production, at a time when many central nervous system activities deteriorate. Sex hormones have been implicated in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, dendritic branching, myelination, and other important mechanisms of neural plasticity. Knowledge of interactions between sex steroid hormones and the dominant neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and glutamate, will give women and health providers an important tool for improving their health and well-being. From the concept of neurosteroids derives another treatment strategy: the use of pharmaceutical agents that increase the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids within the nervous system. This approach has so far been hampered by lack of knowledge concerning the regulation of the biosynthetic pathways of neurosteroids and their relationship with sex steroids produced by the peripheral gland or with exogenous steroids. The present review summarizes some of the available clinical and experimental findings supporting the critical role of neurosteroids in postmenopausal women and their impact on quality of life.

T2  - VIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERCULTURAL EDUCATION AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRANSCULTURAL HEALTH: THE VALUE OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH FOR A GLOBAL, TRANSCULTURAL WORLD (EDUHEM 2018)
AB  - The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using lavender wipes and pillows on sleep problems of women in menopause as a semi-experimental pre-test/posttest. This study was completed with 52 women out of 60 applied to a family health center in the eastern Black Sea region Turkey with sleep complaints in the November-December 2017. In this study Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia Severity Index and lavender oil were employed. The woman was asked to puff a lavender oil spray twice on their wipe and place it in the uppermost pocket of their clothes nearest to the nose, keep it there until bed time, and sleep with a lavender scented pillow for 15 days. Statistical significance was determined between pre-test and post-test in total PSQI and subgroups (p <0.05). The study shows that the use of lavender increases sleep quality.

TI  - Andropause - facts and myths
T2  - PEDIATRIA I MEDYCYNA RODZINNA-PAEDIATRICS AND FAMILY MEDICINE
AB  - According to the Polish Menopause and Andropause Society, andropause is a period of the male aging process defined by gradually declining production of androgenic hormones (testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone), growth hormones and melatonin. The drop in hormone production usually occurs in men over 50 years of age. The symptomatology of these disorders includes gradual deterioration in the quality of life, general well-being and professional performance, libido disorders, sexual dysfunction, intellectual impairment and sleep disturbances. The aim of this paper is to present the pathophysiology of andropause, taking into account the clinical and laboratory diagnostic work-up, available treatment modalities as well as myths about the andropausal period. Since the vast majority of men (several million in Poland) experience systemic changes related to andropause, the topic should be approached holistically, with a proper degree of empathy. A variety of therapeutic modalities are available, which should be employed according to defined principles and contraindications. Unfortunately, a large group of men believe that "this is how it is supposed to be at this age and nothing can be done about it - this is just biology." This belief, however, is a myth and not a reality. It should be fought against, primarily by raising public awareness, applying prophylactic measures and ultimately through medical interventions.

TI  - Effect of symptoms of climacteric syndrome, depression and insomnia on self-rated work ability in peri- and post-menopausal women in non-manual employment
T2  - ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective. The aim of the study was evaluation of the relationship between severity of symptoms of climacteric syndrome, depressive disorders and sleep problems, and the self-rated work ability of peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women in non-manual employment.
   Materials and method. The study included 287 women aged 45-60 years, employed in various institutions as non-manual workers. Work Ability Index, Greene Climacteric Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Athens Insomnia Scale were used.
   Results. The examined peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women in non-manual employment obtained good work ability on the Work Ability Index. The severity of menopausal syndrome, according to the Greene Climacteric Scale, was moderate, placing the examined women between results for the general population of women and the pattern for menopausal women. Depressive disorders ranked between low mood and moderate depression. No depression was observed in 59% of the women, whereas moderate depression was observed in 39%, and severe depression in only 2%. Sleep disorders were on the border of normal range. As many as 46% of the women had no sleep problems, which was on the border of normal range in 36%. Only 19% of the examined women suffered from insomnia. Work ability correlated negatively with depression and insomnia severity, as well as with psychological and vasomotor symptoms of climacteric syndrome, but not to its somatic symptoms.
   Conclusions. Preventing the occurrence and treatment of menopausal symptoms, sleep and mood disorders may contribute to maintaining the work ability of women in peri- and post-menopausal age.

TI  - Lipid status and oxidative stress in menopausal women with obstructive apnea syndrome
T2  - TERAPEVTICHESKII ARKHIV
AB  - Aim: to assess lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system parameters in peri- and postmenopausal women with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
   Materials and methods. 37 perimenopausal women and 43 postmenopausal ones were examined. OSAS diagnosis was made on the basis of the clinical picture and the polysonmography results. In perimenopause, the main group consisted of 18 women, in postmenopausal women 17. All comparison groups are comparable by age and body mass index. Lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system parameters by spectrophotometric methods were determined. Non-parametric criteria were used to analyze the group differences for the independent simples.
   Results and discussion. The increase of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed in perimenopausal women with OSAS as compared to control. The increase of TC, triacylglycerol (TG), LDL-C, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels and decrease of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-D) level were found in postmenopausal women with OSAS as compared to control. Accumulation of ketodienes and conjugated trienes in perimenopausal women with OSAS and thiobarbituric acid reactants with a decrease of total antioxidant activity of blood serum in postmenopausal women with OSAS as compared to control was observed. Moreover, postmenopausal women with OSAS have a higher lipid peroxidation substrates and diene conjugates levels with a lower a-tocopherol level and total antioxidant activity compared with perimenopausal patients.The integral indicator of oxidative stress assessment indicates an imbalance in the lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system in menopausal women with OSAS.
   Conclusion. The results obtained indicate a violation of lipid metabolism and the development of oxidative stress in patients with OSAS. This is most pronounced in the postmenopause due to the aggravation of the pathological condition.

TI  - Menopausal Acne - Challenges And Solutions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Although acne is a disease predominant in adolescence, it is being increasingly observed in adult life, including the menopausal period. The etiology of menopausal acne is multifactorial, with hormonal imbalance being the major culprit. There is a relative increase of androgens in the menopausal female that leads to clinical hyperandrogenism manifesting as acne, hirsutism and androgenetic alopecia. Other endocrine disorders including thyroid abnormalities, hyperprolactinemia and insulin resistance also play a role. Genetics, stress, dietary changes, lack of sleep and exercise and other lifestyle changes are implicated as trigger factors. Most menopausal women with isolated few acne lesions have normoandrogenic serum levels and do not require extensive investigations. However, baseline investigations including total testosterone are useful. Patients must also be evaluated for associated comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. A detailed history can help to exclude polycystic ovarian syndrome, late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia or medications as a cause of acne. The evaluation of menopausal acne and the approach to treatment depend on the severity of acne and associated features. In patients with mild acne without virilization, prolonged topical therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Though combined oral contraceptives are effective, they are relatively contraindicated in the postmenopausal period. Spironolactone is the first choice of therapy in the subset of patients that require oral anti-androgen therapy. Procedural treatment can be useful as it can also help in the treatment of associated acne scars and concomitant skin aging. It is also important to focus on lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, controlling obesity, having a healthy diet, exercise and proper skin care routine to reduce acne. The focus of this article is on the clinical presentation and management challenges of menopausal acne, which represents a special subtype of acne.

TI  - Grip Strength: An Indispensable Biomarker For Older Adults
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - Grip strength has been proposed as a biomarker. Supporting this proposition, evidence is provided herein that shows grip strength is largely consistent as an explanator of concurrent overall strength, upper limb function, bone mineral density, fractures, falls, malnutrition, cognitive impairment, depression, sleep problems, diabetes, multimorbidity, and quality of life. Evidence is also provided for a predictive link between grip strength and all-cause and disease-specific mortality, future function, bone mineral density, fractures, cognition and depression, and problems associated with hospitalization. Consequently, the routine use of grip strength can be recommended as a stand-alone measurement or as a component of a small battery of measurements for identifying older adults at risk of poor health status.

TI  - Sexual function and distress in postmenopausal women with chronic insomnia: exploring the role of stress dysregulation
T2  - NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP
AB  - Objective: Menopause triggers changes in sexual function and many women develop sexual problems. Insomnia is common in postmenopausal women, and disturbed sleep has been linked to poor sexual health. Thus, postmenopausal women with insomnia may be especially vulnerable to developing sexual difficulties. This study estimated rates of sexual distress in postmenopausal women with chronic insomnia and explored associations between various facets of sexual health, insomnia symptoms, and insomnia-related stress dysregulation.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Large multi-site health system in the US.
   Participants: 150 postmenopausal women diagnosed with DSM-5 chronic insomnia disorder (56.44 +/- 5.64 years) completed measures of sexual distress, sexual function, hot flashes, insomnia symptoms, depression, and stress dysregulation in the forms of cognitive-emotional arousal (worry, rumination), sleep reactivity, and somatic hyperarousal.
   Results: Nearly half of the sample endorsed clinically significant sexual distress (46.9%). Insomnia symptoms were largely associated with poor sexual arousal, orgasmic dysfunction, sexual distress, and sexual dissatisfaction. Insomnia-related stress dysregulation was similarly associated with these facets of sexual health but was also linked to problems with low desire and greater vaginal pain during sex. Hot flashes and depression were negatively associated with sexual health.
   Conclusion: Postmenopausal women with chronic insomnia endorse high rates of sexual distress. Although compromised sexual function appears directly related to poor sleep itself, our data suggest that stress dysregulation may play vital role in sexual problems endorsed by postmenopausal insomniacs, particularly regarding low desire and vaginal pain. Prospective research is needed to characterize the evolution of these co-occurring symptoms.

TI  - Health Characteristics Associated With Hot Flashes in Women With HIV During Menopause: An Integrative Review
T2  - JANAC-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF NURSES IN AIDS CARE
AB  - Hot flashes (HFs) are a prominent symptom of menopause known to unfavorably influence mood, sleep, and quality of life. More women living with HIV are entering menopause and may experience a greater prevalence of HFs and more severe HFs compared with uninfected women. This integrative review evaluated existing evidence on potential health characteristics associated with HFs in women living with HIV during menopause. A search strategy was conducted within 6 databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the review, and the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice model was used to evaluate methodological quality and appraisal of the evidence. Five articles met the review eligibility criteria. Three content categories emerged from the key findings of the 5 articles: HIV-specific characteristics, mental health and cognitive characteristics, and quality of life and social characteristics. Implications for research and clinical care were identified.

TI  - Psychosomatic and vasomotor symptom changes during transition to menopause
T2  - MENOPAUSE REVIEW-PRZEGLAD MENOPAUZALNY
AB  - Menopause is the condition in which the gradual decline in ovarian function finally leads to the permanent cessation of menstruation. Oestrogen deficiency may cause early symptoms during the menopausal transition and late symptoms after menopause. Menopause is a normal period of life. During this period, women need adaptation to new biological, social, and psychological parameters. Vasomotor symptoms are among the most common menopausal symptoms. Menopause per se is not correlated with specific psychiatric disorders, but data suggest that perimenopausal women are more likely to develop depressive disorders even without a previous history. Vasomotor symptoms are correlated with mood and sleep disturbances, neuroticism, anxiety, decreased cognitive function, and stress. Personality traits, social, and other factors are also important mediators of vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal transition phase.
   This is a review based on the existing evidence concerning the correlation between psychosomatic and vasomotor symptoms of menopause during the menopausal transition period. Healthcare providers should take these correlations into consideration when planning the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms during menopause are associated with significant social costs. There are numerous traditional hormone therapy, and complementary and alternative therapy including over-the-counter treatments and dietary supplements for managing menopause-related vasomotor symptoms. Additional costs include follow-up physician visits, laboratory testing, management of adverse events, and loss of productivity at work. Social support and planning may help women to deal with menopausal symptoms and may reduce overall social costs during this transitional phase.

TI  - Improving Daytime Functioning, Work Performance, and Quality of Life in Postmenopausal Women With Insomnia: Comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, Sleep Restriction Therapy, and Sleep Hygiene Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: Insomnia is a chief complaint among postmenopausal women, and insomnia impairs daytime functioning and reduces quality of life. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia improves daytime function in this population. This study evaluated whether CBTI improves daytime fatigue, energy, self-reported sleepiness, work productivity, and quality of life in postmenopausal women with insomnia, and whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious.
   Methods: Single-site, randomized control trial. One hundred fifty postmenopausal women (56.44 +/- 5.64 years) with perimenopausal or postmenopausal onset or exacerbation of chronic insomnia were randomized to 3 treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up.
   Results: CBTI and SRT produced moderate-to-large improvements in fatigue, energy, sleepiness, and work function at post treatment and 6 months later. The CBTI group reported better quality of life as indicated by substantial improvements in emotional well being and resiliency to physical and emotional problems, whereas the SRT and SHE groups only showed improvements in resiliency to physical problems. Pain complaints decreased as sleep improved but were not associated with specific treatment conditions. Similarly, insomnia remitters reported fewer daytime and nighttime hot flashes, although reductions were not associated with any specific treatment.
   Conclusions: CBTI and SRT are efficacious options for postmenopausal women with chronic insomnia. Both interventions improve daytime function, quality of life, and work performance, although CBTI produces superior results including the added benefit of improved emotional health.

TI  - Sleep Quality, Job Stress and Job Performance in Middle Age Women
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 20TH CONGRESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ERGONOMICS ASSOCIATION (IEA 2018), VOL VII: ERGONOMICS IN DESIGN, DESIGN FOR ALL, ACTIVITY THEORIES FOR WORK ANALYSIS AND DESIGN, AFFECTIVE DESIGN
AB  - Researchers have pointed out that work stress could cause poor sleep quality. Many women with menopause symptoms complained about couldn't fall asleep, easy to wake up and difficult to stay asleep. Long term poor sleep quality not only affects concentration, responsiveness, and memory but also leads to a decline in cognitive abilities such as memory, learning, reasoning, counting, expressing complex languages, and making decisions. The cognitive ability is a very critical factor influencing job performance. Therefore, without quality sleep, the job performance could be decreased and further affect the life satisfaction negatively. The study adopts Job Stress Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires and self-rated job performance to understand the relationship between all those factors. The results of this study are not only able to understand the relationship between sleep quality, job stress and job performance, but also can be used as a reference while establishing polices to improve menopause women's working intension.

TI  - Does an early rural life influence selected health-related parameters of female university students?
T2  - ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective. The aim of the study was to define whether in a group of young women the place of residence in their childhood and adolescence, as well as moving from a rural to an urban area, have affected their biological condition.
   Materials and method. The data were obtained from 1,305 unmarried and childless women aged 18-25. The respondents were university students. Each person's height, weight and waist circumference were measured, and the BMI, WHR, and WHtR indices were calculated. A survey was used to collect data on the females' socio-economic status, their health condition and course of menstruation cycle.
   Results. In the whole sample, apart from WHR, there was no significant difference in anthropometric characteristics depending on the urbanization degree of the place of residence before commencing studies. In comparing the two groups of women, changing place of residence from a village to a city and from a city to another city, more differences were visible. Women of rural origin presented significantly higher values of BMI, waist circumference and WHtR than those from the city. They were also more frequently characterized by overweight and abdominal obesity. The women from other cities were characterized by underweight and too low amount of abdominal adipose tissue. Health problems were found in both groups. Students of rural origin more rarely declared changes in body weight and health condition after beginning studies. Students of urban origin were more often affected by sleeping problems and spine pains.
   Conclusions. The results of the study do not indicate that a change of place of residence has a stronger effect on the biological condition of rural women than their urban peers.

TI  - The relationship between menopausal symptoms and metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
AB  - The most common symptoms during menopausal transition and menopause are vasomotor symptoms. We aimed to investigate the relationship between menopausal symptoms and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in postmenopausal women. Two hundred and fifty-four and 317 postmenopausal women were in the MetS and non-MetS groups, respectively. The total menopause rating scale and psychological subscale scores were higher in the MetS group than the non-MetS group, and the differences were significant (p<.05). A positive correlation was found between the abdominal circumferences, systolic-diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides and total MRS scores. However, a significant positive correlation was found between the abdominal circumference and total urogenital scores (p=.008).Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? MetS and its dominant component (abdominal obesity) significantly increase the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms. Data regarding the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and vasomotor symptoms remain limited.What do the results of this study add? We showed that sleeping problems, depressive symptoms and bladder problems were more frequently encountered in the MetS group than in the non-MetS group (p<0.05).What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? There is a need for more randomised controlled studies to demonstrate the relationship between MetS and the severity of menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Short Sleep Duration Is Associated With Increased Serum Homocysteine: Insights From a National Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: Both short sleep duration and increased serum homocysteine levels are associated with cardiovascular events. However, research on the relationship between sleep duration and serum homocysteine levels is sparse. The aim of this study is to examine the association between sleep duration and serum homocysteine levels from a national database.
   Methods: In total, 4,480 eligible participants older than 20 years who had serum homocysteine data and reported sleep duration were enrolled from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 2005 to 2006. The association between sleep duration and serum homocysteine levels was analyzed using multivariate regression models for covariate adjustment.
   Results: Serum homocysteine level was lowest in individuals with a sleep duration of 7 hours and increased in those with both shorter and longer self-reported total sleep time (groups were categorized into <= 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, and >= 9 hours). After adjustment for covariates, those in the group sleeping <= 5 hours had significantly higher serum homocysteine levels than the reference group (sleep duration of 7 hours). In subgroup analyses by sex, body mass index (BMI), and ethnicity, the association between short sleep duration (<= 5 hours) and higher serum homocysteine levels persisted in women, individuals with obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)), and non-Hispanic whites.
   Conclusions: This study highlighted that short sleep duration was associated with higher serum homocysteine levels in women, individuals with obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)), and non-Hispanic whites; this finding might suggest increased vulnerability to cardiovascular risk or other atherothrombotic events in these groups in the context of short sleep.

TI  - Temporal Analysis of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain and Sleep in Postmenopausal Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: To investigate the temporal association between chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) and sleep in women who are postmenopausal in a 10-day actigraphic study. This is a microlongitudinal study in which 52 participants were allocated to 4 groups women who are postmenopausal: control (CTRL, n = 10), chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP, n = 12), insomnia (INS, n = 15) and chronic musculoskeletal pain+insomnia (CMP+INS, n = 15).
   Methods: All volunteers underwent a clinical interview and completed questionnaires, used an actigraph, and kept sleep diaries for 10 consecutive days.
   Results: Women in the CMP+INS group presented more sleep episodes (mean of 1.02 episodes) and longer sleep latency (8.97 minutes), as well as higher pain intensity during the day compared to the other groups. Sleep duration recorded by actigraphy directly predicted pain intensity the following morning on waking, with a 1-unit increase in pain intensity, for every 6.9 minutes more of sleep. Higher pain intensity at bedtime was a significant predictor of both increased time in bed and sleep duration, meaning that for each 1-unit increase in pain intensity at bedtime, sleep duration increased by an average of 6.7 minutes.
   Conclusions: Data showed that the coexistence of insomnia and CMP results in greater pain intensity and alterations in sleep homeostasis. Collectively, the data indicate that there is a bidirectional and directly proportional relationship between sleep duration and pain intensity in women who are postmenopausal with insomnia. This result strongly suggests that both sleep and pain conditions should be targeted in the treatment of women who are postmenopausal.

TI  - Relationship between melatonin and bone resorption rhythms in premenopausal women
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL METABOLISM
AB  - Although evidence exists for a daily rhythm in bone metabolism, the contribution of factors such as melatonin levels, the light-dark cycle, and the sleep-wake cycle is difficult to differentiate given their highly correlated time courses. To examine these influences on bone resorption, we collected 48-h sequential urine samples under both ambulatory (8-h sleep:16-h wake) and constant routine (CR) (constant wake, posture, nutrition and dim light) conditions from 20 healthy premenopausal women. Urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s; ng/h) and the bone resorption marker amino-terminal cross-linked collagen I telopeptide (NTx; bone collagen equivalents nM/h) were assayed and fit by cosinor models to determine significant 24-h rhythms and acrophase. Most participants had significant 24-h aMT6s rhythms during both ambulatory and CR conditions (95 and 85%, respectively), but fewer had significant 24-h NTx rhythms (70 and 70%, respectively). Among individuals with significant rhythms, mean (+/- SD) aMT6s acrophase times were 3:57 +/- 1:50 and 3:43 +/- 1:25h under ambulatory and CR conditions, respectively, and 23:44 +/- 5:55 and 3:06 +/- 5:15h, respectively, for NTx. Mean 24-h levels of both aMT6s and NTx were significantly higher during CR compared with ambulatory conditions (p<0.0001 and p=0.03, respectively). Menstrual phase (follicular versus luteal) had no impact on aMT6s or NTx timing or 24-h levels. This study confirms an endogenous circadian rhythm in NTx with a night-time peak when measured under CR conditions, but also confirms that environmental factors such as the sleep-wake or light-dark cycles, posture or meal timing affects overall concentrations and peak timing under ambulatory conditions, the significance of which remains unclear.

TI  - Testing a behavioral intervention to improve adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET)
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB  - Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is used to prevent recurrence and reduce mortality for women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Poor adherence to AET is a significant problem and contributes to increased medical costs and mortality. A variety of problematic symptoms associated with AET are related to non-adherence and early discontinuation of treatment. The goal of this study is to test a novel, telephone-based coping skills training that teaches patients adherence skills and techniques for coping with problematic symptoms (CST-AET). Adherence to AET will be assessed in real-time for 18 months using wireless smart pill bottles. Symptom interference (i.e., pain, vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, vaginal dryness) and cost-effectiveness of the intervention protocol will be examined as secondary outcomes. Participants (N = 400) will be recruited from a tertiary care medical center or community clinics in medically underserved or rural areas. Participants will be randomized to receive CST-AET or a general health education intervention (comparison condition). CST-AET includes ten nurse-delivered calls delivered over 6 months. CST-AET provides systematic training in coping skills for managing symptoms that interfere with adherence. Interactive voice messaging provides reinforcement for skills use and adherence that is tailored based on real-time adherence data from the wireless smart pill bottles. Given the high rates of non-adherence and recent recommendations that women remain on AET for 10 years, we describe a timely trial. If effective, the CST-AET protocol may not only reduce the burden of AET use but also lead to cost-effective changes in clinical care and improve breast cancer outcomes.

TI  - PREVALENCE OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME AMONG MEDICAL AND NURSING STUDENTS AT TAIBAH UNIVERSITY, MADINAH, KSA
T2  - INDO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was frequent among young women worldwide. The prevalence of PMS has been reported in 20 to 32 % of premenopausal and 30-40% of the reproductive female population. A little is known about it among Saudi university students.
   Aim: To estimate Premenstrual Syndrome prevalence among Female medical and nursing students at Taibah University, Madinah, Saudi Arabia and to identify its associated predictors.
   Materials and Methods: Across sectional study was conducted over 600 Medical & Nursing students over the academic year of 2017/2018. An electronic Questionnaire has been used for data collection. The PMS was assessed by the PMS scale with its lowest score of 42 and highest score of 210. The prevalence of PMS was estimated and related to students' characteristics. For statistical analyses purposes, Univariate analyses and predictive regression analyses has been used.
   Results: The final rate of response rate was 87.3%. PMS prevalence in the respondents (N=524) female students was 50.2% (263/524; 95% CI=45.8-54.6%). The prevalence was varied by students' characteristics. The predictors of PMS in this study were the age at menarche, daily sleeping hours and dietary habit. Students with their age at menarche between 12-13 years showed significant reduced by 45% among (OR=0.55; 95% CI=0.35-0.92), the same is also applies among those with 5-8 sleeping hours per day (OR=0.50; 95% CI=0.27-0.99). Daily consumption of chocolate, caffeine and diary food, however, were associated with increased risk.
   Conclusion: A considerable high prevalence of PMS was found among the studied students. Health education, medical treatment and counseling services should be available at health care facilities.

TI  - Association between sleep quality and bone mineral density in Chinese women vary by age and menopausal status
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Sleep quality is closely related to bone health. Aging and estrogen deficiency are known determinants of poor sleep quality and osteoporosis. However, the impact of aging and menopause on the associations between sleep quality and bone mineral density (BMD) remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between sleep quality and BMD in Chinese women vary by age groups and menopausal status.
   Methods: A total of 2067 women aged 18e80 years were included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the score >7 was indicative of poor sleep quality. BMD was determined using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants were categorized into three age groups. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to evaluate the associations between sleep quality and BMD. Covariates included in the models were age, menopausal status, weight, height, percent body fat, physical activity, alcohol drinking, calcium supplement use, marital status, education and metabolic diseases.
   Results: We observed that poor sleep quality was correlated to low total BMD and legs BMD in middle-aged women after adjusting for potential confounders. Furthermore, when we reran the regression models based on menopausal status in middle-aged women, significant associations between BMD and sleep quality were observed in premenopausal and early postmenopausal groups.
   Conclusion: Our findings showed a more robust association between sleep quality and BMD in premenopausal and early menopausal groups. Further studies should be conducted to explore whether sleep quality intervention would improve bone health of women in these periods and prevent osteoporosis in their late life.

TI  - The Effect of Pelvic Floor Muscles Exercise on Quality of Life in Women with Stress Urinary Incontinence and Its Relationship with Vaginal Deliveries: A Randomized Trial
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Introduction. Urinary incontinence (UI) is a health problem affecting the quality of women's lives (QOL) at various life stages. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) can be caused by previous vaginal deliveries and is especially likely to occur in the perimenopausal period. The most commonly recommended first-choice treatment methods involve exercises for the pelvic floor muscles (PFM). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of isolated PFM exercises and combined training of the PFM and the m.transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle on the QoL of patients with SUI with regard to the number of vaginal deliveries. Material and Methods. 137 women with SUI were qualified for analysis (mean age 53,1 +/- 5,5). To assess the effectiveness of PFM training QOL questionnaire was used (ICIQ-LUTS qol). PFM training for groups A (PFM+TrA) and B (PFM) was intended for 12 weeks. Statistica v. 12.0 PL, StatSoft, USA, was used for statistical calculations. Results. The analysis demonstrated that conservative treatment based on the A training program (PFM + TrA) yielded statistically significantly better results than the B program (PFM), with the improvement observed in such QoL domains as the performance of household duties, physical activity and travelling, social limitations, emotions, sleep problems and fatigue, the frequency of changing panty liners, fluid intake control, and embarrassment. Conclusion. Both the combined training of the PFM and the synergistic (TrA) muscle and the isolated PFM exercises improve the QoL of women with SUI. Nonetheless, the combined PFM and TrA muscle physiotherapy is more effective. The exercises for the PFM and the synergistic muscle give better results in women who have given birth fewer than three times than isolated PFM exercises.

TI  - Psychosocial and health-related risk factors for depressive symptom trajectories among midlife women over 15 years: Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background. Psychosocial and health-related risk factors for depressive symptoms are known. It is unclear if these are associated with depressive symptom patterns over time. We identified trajectories of depressive symptoms and their risk factors among midlife women followed over 15 years.
   Methods. Participants were 3300 multiracial/ethnic women enrolled in a multisite longitudinal menopause and aging study, Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Biological, psychosocial, and depressive symptom data were collected approximately annually. Group-based trajectory modeling identified women with similar longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms. Trajectory groups were compared on time-invariant and varying characteristics using multivariable multinomial analyses and pairwise comparisons.
   Results. Five symptom trajectories were compared (50% very low; 29% low; 5% increasing; 11% decreasing; 5% high). Relative to whites, blacks were less likely to be in the increasing trajectory and more likely to be in the decreasing symptom trajectory and Hispanics were more likely to have a high symptom trajectory than an increasing trajectory. Psychosocial/health factors varied between groups. A rise in sleep problems was associated with higher odds of having an increasing trajectory and a rise in social support was associated with lower odds. Women with low role functioning for 50% or more visits had three times the odds of being in the increasing symptom group.
   Conclusions. Changes in psychosocial and health characteristics were related to changing depressive symptom trajectories. Health care providers need to evaluate women's sleep quality, social support, life events, and role functioning repeatedly during midlife to monitor changes in these and depressive symptoms.

TI  - Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate Among Latinos in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ENDOCRINE SOCIETY
AB  - Low blood dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels have strong positive associations with stroke and coronary heart disease. However, it is unclear whether DHEAS is independently associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, we examined the association between cardiovascular risk factors and DHEAS concentration among a high-risk population of Latinos (Puerto Ricans aged 45 to 75 years at baseline) in a cross-sectional analysis of the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study. Of eligible participants, 72% completed baseline interviews and provided blood samples. Complete data were available for 1355 participants. Associations between cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, total cholesterol, high-density lipid cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose) and log-transformed DHEAS (mg/dL) were assessed. In robust multivariable regression analyses, DHEAS was significantly inversely associated with age (beta = -12.4; 95% CI: -15.2, -9.7; per 5 years), being female (vs. male) (beta = -46; 95% CI: -55.3, -36.6), and plasma triglyceride concentration (beta = -0.2; 95% CI: -0.3, -0.1; per 10 mg/dL) and was positively associated with total cholesterol and plasma glucose levels (beta = 1.8; 95% CI: 0.6, 3 and beta = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.3, respectively, per 10 mg/dL) after adjustment for smoking, alcohol, and physical activity and for postmenopausal hormone use in women. Estimates were unchanged after adjustment for measures of chronic disease and inflammation. Women exhibited a stronger age-related decline in DHEAS and a positive association with glucose in contrast to findings among men (P-interaction < 0.05). In conclusion, in this large study of Latinos with a heavy cardiovascular risk factor burden, we observed significant associations between cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and DHEAS, with variations by sex. These findings improve our understanding of the role DHEAS may play in CVD etiology. Copyright (C) 2019 Endocrine Society.

TI  - Relationship between serum IL-1 and insomnia and liver depression in patients with perimenopausal non-organic sleep disorder
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
AB  - The aim of the study was to detect the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in serum of patients with perimenopausal non-organic sleep disorder (PNSD) and to study the relationship between IL-1 and the severity of insomnia and liver depression, so as to benefit the prevention of PNSD. A total of 268 cases of perimenopausal patients from the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Fujian Provincial Hospital and the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Jinshan Branch of Fujian Provincial Hospital were selected from March 2014 to June 2017. Among them, 182 patients developed non-organic insomnia (observation group). The remaining 86 patients were included in the control group. Serum levels of IL-1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Scores of liver depression were determined and graded. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess the severity of insomnia. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between PSQI, IL-1 and liver depression grade. Scores of liver depression in the observation group were significantly higher than those in control group (p<0.05). In the observation group, and PSQI scores in patients with different grades of liver depression are significantly different (p<0.05). Average level of IL-1 in the observation group was significantly higher than that in control group (p<0.05). With the increase of liver depression grade, the expression level of IL-1 was also increased (p<0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that PSQI was positively correlated with liver depression score, and the level of IL-1 was positively correlated with the liver depression grade in patients with PNSD. (r=0.724, p=0.012; r=0.765, p=0.008). Expression of IL-1 in women with PNSD is significantly upregulated, and different degrees of liver depression also exist. Higher expression level of IL-1 is accompanied by more serious liver depression and higher degree of insomnia.

TI  - Associations of Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Assault, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder With Menopause Symptoms Among Midlife and Older Women
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - IMPORTANCE Little is known about the prevalence of traumatic exposures among midlife and older women and the association of these traumatic exposures with health issues.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of intimate partner violence (IPV), sexual assault, and posttraumatic stress with menopause symptoms among midlife and older women.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross sectional analysis of data from a multiethnic cohort of 2016 women 40 to 80 years of age in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system was conducted from November 15, 2008, to March 30, 2012. Statistical analysis was conducted from June 8, 2016, to September 6, 2017.
   EXPOSURES Lifetime physical or emotional IPV, sexual assault, and current symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, assessed with standardized questionnaires.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Difficulty sleeping, vasomotor symptoms, and vaginal symptoms, assessed with standardized questionnaires.
   RESULTS Among the 2016 women enrolled, the mean (SD) age was 60.5 (9.5) years, and 792 of 2011 with race/ethnicity data (39.4)% were non-Latina white (403 [20.0%) Latina, 429 [21.3%] black, and 387 [19.2%] Asian). Lifetime emotional IPV was reported by 423 women (21.0%), lifetime physical IPV was reported by 316 women (15.7%), sexual assault was reported by 382 women (18.9%), and 450 of 2000 women (22.5%) had current dinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. In multivariable analyses adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, educational level, body mass index, menopause status, hormone therapy, and parity, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were associated with difficulty sleeping (odds ratio [On 3.02; 95% CI, 2.22-4.09), vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes: OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.34-2.12; night sweats: OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.37-2.15), and vaginal symptoms (vaginal dryness: OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.37-2.18; vaginal irritation: OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.66-2.93; pain with intercourse: OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.57-2.98). Emotional IPV was associated with difficulty sleeping (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09-1.71), night sweats (OR, 1.50; 95% CI. 1.19-1.89), and pain with intercourse (OR, 1.60; 95% CI. 1.14-2.25). Physical IPV was associated with night sweats (OR. 1.33; 95% CI. 1.03-1.72). Sexual assault was associated with vaginal symptoms (vaginal dryness: OR. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.82; vaginal irritation: OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.95; pain with intercourse: OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.00 2.06).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Lifetime history of IPV or sexual assault and current clinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder are common and are associated with menopause symptoms. These findings highlight the need for greater recognition of these exposures by clinicians caring for midlife and older women.

TI  - Depressive Symptoms and Bio-psychosocial Problems among Postmenopausal Women of Udupi District, Karnataka, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Menopause is the transition period in women's life. Though it is a normal phenomenon, it has challenging situations. Many women shift to menopause without facing psychiatric problems; however, there is evidence that 20% of them are experiencing depressive symptoms during this crucial period.
   Aim: To identify the depressive symptoms and bio-psychosocial problems of postmenopausal women.
   Materials and Methods: A descriptive survey was conducted in three Gram Panchayaths of Udupi district, Karnataka, India. Convenient sampling technique was used to select 290 postmenopausal women between 1-5-years of menopause. Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR) scale was used to assess the depressive symptoms and rating scale on bio-psychosocial problems of postmenopausal women was used to assess the bio-psychosocial problems. Descriptive (frequency and percentage) and inferential statistics (Fisher's-exact test and one way ANOVA test) were used to analyse the data.
   Results: The results showed that 20.7% of women had a mild level of depressive symptoms. Commonly reported biopsychosocial problem were leg cramps (89.7%), joint and muscle pain (87.6%), backache (87.2%), hot flushes (85.2%), fatigue (79.3%), numbness in extremities (75.9%), night sweating (67.2%), sleep disturbance (66.5%), sexual problems (49.7%), forgetting (31%) and irritation (39.6%). It was also found that there was a significant association between depressive symptoms and age (p=0.001), number of living children (p=0.003), duration after attaining menopause (p=0.012) and age at menopause (p=0.001).
   Conclusion: Menopause is one of the most significant events in women's life. Hence, nurses working in public sector need to identify problems related to postmenopausal women and provide adequate health services.

AB  - Aim To investigate the prevalence and predictors of sexual frequency, sexual desire in midlife partnered Chinese women. Methods Sexual frequency, sexual desire over the past 3 months, menopausal symptoms and other socioeconomic information were assessed for women aged 40-65 years in the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital. Results Among 3485 eligible partnered participants, the prevalence of low sexual frequency (less than once per week) and low sexual desire (less than 5 scores) were 72.74% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 71.16%-74.23%) and 71.79% (95% CI = 70.30-73.17%), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.17-1.23), more educated (>15 years) (compared with<10 years, OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.48-0.82), perimenopause, postmenopause (compared with premenopause, OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.02-2.15, OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.80-4.23), sleep disorder (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.02-1.50), unemployment (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.45-2.92) were independently associated with low sexual frequency, while multiple linear regression revealed that age beta = -0.126, 95% CI = -0.139--0.114), unemployment (beta = -0.792, 95% CI = -0.954 to -0.629),chronic diseases (compared with no disease, single disease (beta = -0.200, 95% CI = -0.020 to -0.077, multiple diseases (beta = -0.792, 95% CI = -0.859 to -0.372), body mass index (beta = -0.615, 95% CI = -0.859 to -0.372), postmenopause (beta = -0.915, 95% CI = -1.143 to -0.759) were independent indicators for low sexual desire after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion Low sexual frequency and low sexual desire were quite prevalent in midlife Chinese partnered women. Some factors, such as sleep disorder, obesity are modifiable or can be prevented or treated with safe and effective therapies.

TI  - Intermittent Hypoxemia in Infants Born Late Preterm: A Prospective Cohort Observational Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Objective To determine if late preterm infants are at increased risk of intermittent hypoxemic events compared with term infants.
   Study design Prospective, cohort, observational study of late preterm infants (34(0/7)-36(6/7) weeks gestational age) and term infants (39(0/7)-41(6/7) weeks gestational age). Overnight pulse oximetry recordings were performed on days 2-3 after birth, at term equivalent age, and at 45 weeks postmenstrual age. The primary outcome was the frequency of intermittent hypoxemic events per hour (desaturation >= 10% below the preceding baseline SpO(2)) on the oximetry recording on days 2-3 after birth. Data were analyzed by the Student t test and general linear mixed model.
   Results Eighty-five infants were enrolled (late preterm n = 43: term infants n = 42). On days 2-3 after birth, late preterm infants had more intermittent hypoxemic events than term infants (events per hour, mean +/- standard error of the mean, 2.5 +/- 1.2 vs 1.0 +/- 1.2; P < .0001). On mixed model analysis, late preterm infants had a higher frequency of intermittent hypoxemic events at term equivalent age, which decreased to a similar frequency as in term infants by 45 weeks postmenstrual age (events per hour; term equivalent age, late preterm: least squares mean, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.7-5.1] vs term: least squares mean, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.2-2.3]; 45 weeks postmenstrual age, late preterm: least squares mean, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.1-2.1] vs term: least squares mean, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.6]; P < .0005).
   Conclusions Late preterm infants are at greater risk of intermittent hypoxemia than term infants soon after birth. We speculate that preventing intermittent hypoxemia in late preterm infants may improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.

TI  - Effects of Menopausal Symptoms and Depression on the Quality of Life of Premenopausal Women With Breast Cancer in Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSCULTURAL NURSING
AB  - Introduction: As breast cancer survivors have increased, improving quality of life of the survivors becomes an important issue. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among menopausal symptoms, depression, and quality of life and to identify the factors affecting the quality of life in premenopausal women with breast cancer. Method: This was a descriptive, correlational study using structured questionnaires for 90 premenopausal women with breast cancer attending the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Korea. Results: Menopausal symptoms (r = -0.770, p < .001) and depression (r = -0.715, p < .001) negatively affected the participants' quality of life. The major factors affecting quality of life were employment (t = -2.065, p = .042), depression (t = -2.375, p = .020), and menopausal symptoms (t = -3.863, p < .001). Menopausal symptoms were the strongest negative factor (beta = -.508) affecting quality of life. Discussion and Conclusions: Developing nursing intervention congruent with the culture of Korean breast cancer women with treatment-induced menopausal symptoms is a high priority.

TI  - Modern fertility awareness methods: wrist wearables capture the changes in temperature associated with the menstrual cycle
T2  - BIOSCIENCE REPORTS
AB  - Core and peripheral body temperatures are affected by changes in reproductive hormones during the menstrual cycle. Women worldwide use the basal body temperature (BBT) method to aid and prevent conception. However, prior research suggests that taking one's daily temperature can prove inconvenient and subject to environmental factors. We investigate whether a more automatic, non-invasive temperature measurement system can detect changes in temperature across the menstrual cycle. We examined how wrist skin temperature (WST), measured with wearable sensors, correlates with urinary tests of ovulation and may serve as a new method of fertility tracking. One hundred and thirty-six eumenorrheic, non-pregnant women participated in an observational study. Participants wore WST biosensors during sleep and reported their daily activities. An at-home luteinizing hormone (LH) test was used to confirm ovulation. WST was recorded across 437 cycles (mean cycles/participant = 3.21, S.D. = 2.25). We tested the relationship between the fertile window and WST temperature shifts, using the BBT three-over-six rule. A sustained 3-day temperature shift was observed in 357/437 cycles (82%), with the lowest cycle temperature occurring in the fertile window 41% of the time. Most temporal shifts (307/357, 86%) occurred on ovulation day (OV) or later. The average early-luteal phase temperature was 0.33. C higher than in the fertile window. Menstrual cycle changes in WST were impervious to lifestyle factors, like having sex, alcohol, or eating prior to bed, that, in prior work, have been shown to obfuscate BBT readings. Although currently costlier than BBT, the present study suggests that WST could be a promising, convenient parameter for future multiparameter fertility awareness methods.

TI  - Practice and lived experience of menstrual exiles (Chhaupadi) among adolescent girls in far-western Nepal
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Menstrual exile, also known as Chhaupadi, is a tradition of "untouchability" in far-western Nepal. Forbidden from touching other people and objects, women and girls are required to live away from the community, typically in a livestock shed, during menstruation. We assessed the lived experiences of Chhaupadi among Nepalese adolescent girls in the far-western Achham district of Nepal, observed the safety and sanitation of their living spaces during Chhaupadi, and assessed the perceptions of local adult stakeholders towards the practice of Chhaupadi.
   Methods
   We collected data from 107 adolescent girls using a self-administered survey in two local schools in Achham. We also conducted a focus group discussion with seven girls, held key informant interviews, and observed the girls' living spaces during Chhaupadi, using a checklist. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative survey and thematic analyses of qualitative interviews are presented.
   Results
   The majority of the girls (n = 77, 72%) practiced exile, or Chhaupadi, during their menstruation, including 3 (4%) exiled to traditional Chhau sheds, 63 (82%) to livestock sheds, and 11 (14%) to courtyards outside their home. The remaining girls (n = 30, 28%) stayed inside the house, yet practiced some form of menstrual taboos. Of the 77 observed living spaces where the girls stayed during exile, only 30% (n = 23) had a toilet facility. Most exiled girls (97.4%) were restricted from eating dairy products. Participants reported having various psychological problems, including lonliness and difficulty sleeping while practicing Chhaupadi. Three of the girls were physically abused; nine were bitten by a snake. Notably high proportions of the living spaces lacked ventilation/windows (n = 20, 26%), electricity (n = 29, 38%), toilets (n = 54, 70%) and a warm blanket and mattress for sleeping (n = 29, 38%). Our qualitative findings supported our quantitative results.
   Conclusions
   Chhaupadi has been condemned by human rights organizations. While the government has banned the practice, implementation on the ban is proceeding slowly, especially in far-western Nepal. Thus, as a temporary measure, public health professionals must work towards promoting the health and safety of Nepalese women and girls still practicing Chhaupadi.

TI  - Associations Between Breast Cancer Survivorship and Adverse Mental Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review
T2  - JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
AB  - Background: We aimed to systematically review the evidence on adverse mental health outcomes in breast cancer survivors (>= 1 year) compared with women with no history of cancer.
   Methods: Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Social Sciences Citation Index, and through backward citation tracking. Two researchers selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias.
   Results: Sixty studies were included. Of 38 studies of depression, 33 observed more depression in breast cancer survivors; this was statistically significant in 19 studies overall, including six of seven where depression was ascertained clinically, three of four studies of antidepressants, and 13 of 31 that quantified depressive symptoms. Of 21 studies of anxiety, 17 observed more anxiety in breast cancer survivors, statistically significant in 11 studies overall, including two of four with clinical/prescription-based outcomes, and in eight of 17 of anxiety symptoms. Breast cancer survivors also had statistically significantly increased symptoms/frequency of neurocognitive dysfunction (18 of 24 studies), sexual dysfunctions (5 of 6 studies), sleep disturbance (5 of 5 studies), stress-related disorders/PTSD (2 of 3 studies), suicide (2 of 2 studies), somatisation (2 of 2 studies), and bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders (1 of 1 study each). Studies were heterogeneous in terms of participants' characteristics, time since diagnosis, ascertainment of outcomes, and measures reported. Approximately one-half of the studies were at high risk of selection bias and confounding by socio-economic status.
   Conclusions: There is compelling evidence of an increased risk of anxiety, depression and suicide, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunctions in breast cancer survivors compared with women with no prior cancer. This information can be used to support evidence-based prevention and management strategies. Further population-based and longitudinal research would help to better characterize these associations.

TI  - Intersection between gonadal function and vascular aging in women
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Vascular aging, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and large elastic arterial stiffening, is a major risk factor for age-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although women have a lower prevalence of CVD until midlife, prevalence rates increase rapidly coincident with the menopausal transition to match those observed in men. The menopausal transition, or perimeno-pause, is a chaotic period that is associated with increased symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, depressed mood, anxiety, sleep disturbances) and CVD risk factors due to changes in the hormonal environment. Because these quality of life factors and CVD risk factors also change with aging, the arteries of women appear to endure a double insult. Our laboratory has been investigating how changes in gonadal function and hormone levels with the menopause transition impacts the vascular aging process in healthy women. Our work has shown that vascular endothelial function progressively declines, and large elastic arterial stiffness is greater across the stages of the menopausal transition. This acceleration in vascular aging may be due to the loss of vasodilatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects of estradiol on the vascular wall. This minireview discusses the impact of changes in gonadal function and hormones with the menopausal transition on vascular aging in women and areas for investigations to further our understanding of the intersection between gonadal function and vascular aging.

TI  - Adiponectin levels and sleep deprivation in patients with endocrine metabolic disorders
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep abnormalities are frequent in patients with endocrine metabolic disorders (EMD) such as arterial hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Adiponectin is a peptide largely secreted by adipocytes and has various properties e.g. anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiatherogenic, pro-angiogenic, vasoprotective and insulin-sensitizing. Adiponectin inversely relates to body weight and when its concentration decreases, the resistin concentration increases resulting in greater insulin resistance.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine factors influencing adiponectin levels in a population with EMD.
   METHODS: This was a cross-sectional evaluation of 332 patients (18 to 80y) presenting arterial hypertension, pre-diabetes, diabetes, and/or obesity. Investigation included clinical evaluation of comorbidities, general blood tests and adiponectin measures (ELISA). Chronic sleep deprivation was determined if habitual sleep was <6 hours >4 days/week.
   RESULTS:Arterial hypertension (78.5%), type-2 diabetes (82.3%), and overweight (45.0%)/obesity (38.8%) were frequent. Patients with type-2 diabetes tended to have more chronic sleep deprivation (p=0.05). Adiponectin levels increased with age and were inversely correlated with sagittal abdominal diameter (p=0.04) and fasting insulin (p=0.001). Chronic sleep deprivation was associated with higher adiponectin concentration [OR=1.34; CI=1.13-1.58; p<0.005] and this was maintained after adjustment for gender, age, body mass index, menopause, arterial hypertension, American Diabetes Association classification and physical exercise levels [OR=1.38; CI=1.14-7.66: p=0.001].
   CONCLUSION: In patients with EMD, adiponectin is influenced not only by obesity but also by age and sleep deprivation. The latter finding may be explained by a compensatory effect or a counter regulation to minimize the harmful effects of sleep deprivation.

TI  - Both melatonin and meloxicam improved sleep and pain in females with primary dysmenorrhea-results from a double-blind cross-over intervention pilot study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Up to 25% of ovulating women suffer from primary dysmenorrhea, a condition associated with pain and transient-reduced quality of life, along with greater irritability and impaired sleep. In the present study, we asked whether and if so to what extent melatonin and meloxicam can improve subjective and objective sleep and reduce pain among women with primary dysmenorrhea (PD). To this end, we conducted a double-blind cross-over clinical trial lasting for three menstrual cycles. A total of 14 women (mean age M = 27.5years) with primary dysmenorrhea took part in the study. At baseline, that is, during the first menstruation, they completed a visual analogue scale to rate pain; sleep continuity was assessed via actigraphs, and overall sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Next, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either melatonin during the second, and meloxicam during the third menstruation, or meloxicam during the second, and melatonin during the third menstruation. Neither participants nor investigators were aware of participants' study assignment. During the second and third menstruations, the assessments described above were repeated. At baseline, sleep assessed both objectively and subjectively was impaired, and pain was high. Subjective sleep improved and pain decreased during the second and third menstruations irrespective of whether melatonin or meloxicam was administered first or second. Likewise, objective sleep efficiency increased and objective sleep latency shortened. The efficacy of melatonin was superior to that of meloxicam. The present pattern of results suggests that both melatonin and meloxicam are suitable to treat pain and PD-related sleep complaints among women with primary dysmenorrhea.

TI  - Menarche and menstrual problems are associated with non-suicidal self-injury in adolescent girls
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Menstrual problems and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are common in adolescent girls. This study examined whether onset of menstruation and menstrual problems were related to NSSI in Chinese female adolescents. A total of 5696 adolescent girls participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort (SABHC) study in Shandong, China. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about participants' lifetime and last-year NSSI, age at menarche, menstrual cycle interval, menstrual flow length, menstrual irregularity, period pain, body weight and height, and demographics. Impulsivity was assessed by the Eysenck I7 impulsiveness scale. Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured by the Youth Self-Report of Child Behavior Checklist. The mean age of the sample was 15.0 years (SD = 1.4). The prevalence of lifetime and last year NSSI were 28.1% and 21.4% in Chinese adolescent girls. After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates (age, body mass index, impulsivity, internalizing and externalizing problems, paternal education, and family economic status), onset of menstruation was significantly associated with increased risk of lifetime NSSI (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.20-2.20) and last year NSSI (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.37-2.67). Among adolescent girls who had menarche, often irregular menstruation and period pain were significantly and independently associated with lifetime NSSI (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.03-1.79; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.58) and last year NSSI (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.07-1.98; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.03-1.61). Our findings suggest that onset of menarche, irregular periods, and period pain appear to be associated with increased risk of NSSI. These findings highlight the importance of menstruation hygiene education and treatment of menstrual problems to reduce the risk of NSSI among adolescent girls.

TI  - Clinical Pain-related Outcomes and Inflammatory Cytokine Response to Pain Following Insomnia Improvement in Adults With Knee Osteoarthritis
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN
AB  - Objectives:Clinical insomnia is known to affect pain, but mechanisms are unclear. Insomnia can dysregulate inflammatory pathway, and inflammation plays a mediating role in pain. It is unclear whether insomnia-related alterations in inflammation can be modified with insomnia improvement, and if such alterations parallel improvement in pain. The current study objective was to provide proof of concept for the role of insomnia in inflammation and pain by testing whether improving insomnia would reduce pain and related physical function, and, concurrently, modulate inflammatory responses.Materials and Methods:Thirty adults with osteoarthritis knee pain and insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index >10) provided baseline measures of osteoarthritis and laboratory pain, and serial blood samples for inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor , before and after pain testing. To manipulate insomnia, participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (n=16); or wait-list control (n=14). At 8-weeks (time 2), all measures were repeated. To directly test insomnia improvement effects, participants were grouped by insomnia status at time 2 after confirming baseline equivalency on all outcomes.Results:Compared with those maintaining insomnia at time 2 (Insomnia Severity Index 8; n=18), those whose insomnia improved at time 2 (n=12) had significantly improved physical functioning, decline in knee pain during transfer activities, and attenuated increase in interleukin 6 and less decrease in tumor necrosis factor across the pain testing session.Discussion:These findings suggest further exploration of inflammatory pathways linking clinical insomnia, and its improvement, to chronic pain.

TI  - Sleep Apnea in Caucasian and Asian Climacteric Women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE
AB  - The aim of our study was to define the structure of sleep in Caucasian and Asian peri- and postmenopausal women with sleep apnea.
   Materials and Methods: Two hundred and forty-seven menopausal women between 45 and 60 years of age participated in this study. The participants were divided into 2 ethnic groups, taking into account the genealogy (the representatives having in two generations of parents of one ethnic group) and self-identification, taking into account phenotype elements. Caucasians were represented by the Russian ethnic group (n=115) and Asians by the Buryat ethnic group (n=132). The study included the collection of anamnestic data, physical examinations, clinical (Berlin questionnaire, general medical examination, gynecological examination, polysomnographic monitoring according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendations), and biochemical laboratory methods.
   Results: Sleep complaints, such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent night awakenings (more than 2 times), difficulties of morning awakening or problems waking up too early, were increased in perimenopausal Caucasian women. We found ethnic differences in a greater frequency of complaints in Caucasian women, but Asian women also showed a tendency to increased complaints about poor sleep. Polysomnographic monitoring revealed that OSA was more common in Asian postmenopausal women than in Caucasians. However, in structure of sleep we have not seen distinctions.
   Conclusion: For improving the quality of life, it is necessary not only to pay attention to menopausal problems, but also to solve the sleep problems associated with various strategies, both age management and lifestyle.

AB  - Background: Anxiety and depression seriously affect sleep quality and mental health of perimenopausal women. Time management training is of great value in relieving negative emotions and improving subjective wellbeing. This study aims to explore the effect of time management training on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality of perimenopausal women.
   Methods: From January 2018 to July 2018, 114 women with perimenopausal syndrome were randomly selected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China as the objects of the experimental group (n=58) and the control group (n=56). The control group did not participate in any training in this study; time management training was conducted in the experimental group according to Getting Things Done, with a total of 12 training sessions over six months with two hours for each interval of two weeks. The effect of the intervention was evaluated before and after the experiment using relevant scales.
   Results: After the intervention, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) score and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score of the experimental group are lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score and Time Management Disposition Inventory (TMDI) score of the experimental group are higher than those of the control group (P<0.05). A positive correlation exists between the improvement in time management disposition and the improvement in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Time management training has a positive effect on improving anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and time management disposition of perimenopausal women.

TI  - Onset of the Menopause Transition The Earliest Signs and Symptoms
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Although more than 80% of women experience some degree of psychological or physical symptoms around menopause, both women and clinicians have misconceptions about how hormonal changes relate to menopausal symptoms and psychological conditions. Recently, several large-scale, longitudinal studies have been conducted to better characterize symptoms and changes that occur around menopause. This article offers current evidence for symptoms that occur in the early menopause transition, including vasomotor symptoms, mood changes, sleep problems, and changes in sexual functioning.

TI  - Menstrual Cycle Hormone Changes Associated with Reproductive Aging and How They May Relate to Symptoms
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Key cycle changes occur as women transition from reproductive life to menopause, and they can be roughly linked to menopausal staging. It is important to understand the types of studies that inform the current knowledge. Patterns of symptoms within menstrual cycles (sleep, headache) generally favor worsening in association with the perimenstrual phase of the cycle, and patterns of chronic symptoms, such as hot flashes and adverse mood, appear to be worse when hormones are more variable.

TI  - Depression During and After the Perimenopause Impact of Hormones, Genetics, and Environmental Determinants of Disease
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Vulnerability to depression is increased across the menopause transition and in the early years after the final menstrual period. Clinicians should systematically screen women in this age group; if depressive symptoms or disorder are present, treatment of depression should be initiated. Potential treatments include antidepressants for moderate to severe symptoms, psychotherapy to target psychological and interpersonal factors, and hormone therapy for women with first-onset major depressive disorder or elevated depressive symptoms and at low risk for adverse effects. Behavioral interventions can improve physical activity and sleep patterns.

TI  - Sleep, Health, and Metabolism in Midlife Women and Menopause: Food for Thought
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Sleep and metabolism are essential components of health. Metabolic health depends largely on individual's lifestyle. Disturbances in sleep health, such as changes in sleep patterns that are associated with menopause/reproductive aging and chronologic aging, may have metabolic health consequences. Sleep restriction and age-related changes in sleep and circadian rhythms may influence changes in appetite and reproductive hormones, energy expenditure, and body adiposity. In this article, the authors describe how menopause-related sleep disturbance may affect eating behavior patterns, immunometabolism, immunometabolic dysfunction, and associations between sleep and metabolic outcomes.

TI  - Physical Activity and Physical Function Moving and Aging
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Evidence supports that the physical disablement process starts earlier than previously thought, in midlife when women still have many years to live. Physical activity participation and interventions have been successful in preventing disability in older adults and may be promising for maintaining function at younger ages. Changing the conversation to more relevant topics in midlife, like positive changes in body composition, sleep, and improved mood, may move the dial on participation, as midlife women do not meet guidelines for physical activity. Exploring the role of reproductive aging beyond chronologic aging may provide gender-specific insights on both disablement and participation.

T2  - PRIMARY CARE
AB  - The menopausal transition is a time when many physical and psychological changes are occurring for women. Women may experience irregular menses, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disruption, mood disorders as well as genitourinary symptoms. Despite irregular menstrual cycles, some women can still conceive. It is important to understand what is within normal physiologic changes and what may represent pathologic changes and how to further evaluate this. There are many options available to manage menopausal symptoms when they are impacting quality of life.

TI  - Could dysmenorrhea decrease strength performance when a velocity-based resistance testing is used?
T2  - SCIENCE & SPORTS
AB  - Aims. - To analyse performance across the menstrual cycle using optimal load and a velocity-based training, and to check the impact of dysmenorrhea in this type of training.
   Methods. - Five eumenorrheic women with a normal menstrual cycle participated in four performance tests: 20-meter linear sprint, counter-movement jump, bench-press and half-squat. The tests were performed at the time of menstruation and in the luteal-phase. In addition, data of mood states, sleep quality and rate of perceived exertion in both phases were collected. To analyse dysmenorrhea, subjects fulfilled a menstrual pain questionnaire. Analysing the group as a whole, better results were only found in the repetition maximum of the half-squat in the menstruation phase.
   Results. - When analysing the group dividing it according to pain variables, the group that presented some pain variable showed worse test results in both phases with respect to the no pain group in both half-squat and bench-press. In addition, the pain group showed a lower repetition maximum in both half-squat and bench-press in the luteal-phase, whereas the no pain group presented a similar repetition maximum in both phases. There were no differences in any other tests. Menstrual pain seems to be involved in the differences obtained in the test results, since the no pain group obtained better results than the pain group in both phases, and they also maintained their values constant throughout the menstrual cycle, whereas the pain group presented a decrease in performance in the luteal-phase.

TI  - Epidemiological aspects of dysmenorrhea among female students at Jouf University, Saudi Arabia
T2  - MIDDLE EAST FERTILITY SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB  - Background and objectives: Dysmenorrhea is a prevalent problem among young adults and adolescents. The objectives of the present study were to assess the prevalence, determinants, impact and treatment of dysmenorrhea among female students at Jouf University, Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was implemented among 366 female students at Jouf University through multistage proportionate sampling method. A pre-designed, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used. Descriptive and analytical statistics were conducted.
   Results: Nearly 88% of the students had dysmenorrhea (mild 8.7%, moderate 57.3%, severe 34%). Significant predictors of dysmenorrhea were cycle irregularity, heaviness of menstrual flow and longer cycle length. Two third of the students took herbs to relieve symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Fatigue, emotional disturbances, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting and sleep disturbances were the commonest associated symptoms. Effect on the daily activities because of dysmenorrhea was reported by 87% of students.
   Conclusion: A high prevalence of dysmenorrhea was detected among female students at Jouf University. Screening programs and health promotion are recommended. (C) 2018 Middle East Fertility Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Prevalence and patterns of dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome among Egyptian girls (12-25 years)
T2  - MIDDLE EAST FERTILITY SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: Most girls experience pain and other discomforting symptoms during their menstrual periods. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence, and patterns of dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) amongst girls in Beni-Suef, Egypt.
   Study design: Population-based, cross sectional study.
   Methods: This study was conducted on 4122 girls (12-25 years) representing Beni-Suef City. A structured questionnaire was used and a team of data collectors interviewed the girls.
   Results: High rates of dysmenorrhea (92%) and PMS (86.3%) among girls. A solid association between dysmenorrhea and PMS was detected. While gynaecological age was the only risk factor for dysmenorrhea, gynaecological age, marriage, educational level and sleeping hours were determinants for PMS (p <.05). Backaches, generalized aching and nervousness were the most commonly reported symptoms 63.3%, 62.4% and 43.5%, respectively. More than half of girls who experienced dysmenorrhea reported drinking herbal fluids and taking analgesics to alleviate their symptoms. Girls resorted mostly to family members to get information about menstruation.
   Conclusion and recommendations: Dysmenorrhea and PMS are highly prevalent among girls in Beni-Suef. Many risk factors have been suggested to be linked with dysmenorrhea and PMS. Health awareness programs should be encouraged to improve girls' knowledge regarding menstrual disorders. Further research should focus on the adaptive techniques used by girls to avoid the negative consequences of menstrual disorders. (C) 2018 Middle East Fertility Society.

TI  - Associations of mental health and sleep duration with menstrual cycle irregularity: a population-based study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - This study aimed to examine whether the characteristics of mental health and sleep duration, alone or in combination, are associated with menstrual cycle irregularity. This population-based, cross-sectional study analyzed the data from 4445 women aged 19-49 years, who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012. A structured questionnaire was used to assess mental health characteristics, sleep duration, and menstrual cycle irregularity. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. High stress, depressive mood, and suicidal ideation were associated with increased risk of menstrual cycle irregularity after adjusting for confounding variables (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.33 [1.07-1.65], 1.56 [1.17-2.07], and 1.37 [1.01-1.87], respectively). Short sleep duration (<= 5 h a day) was significantly associated with higher odds of severe menstrual cycle irregularity with menstrual interval of greater than 3 months (2.67 [1.35-5.27]). Participants with sleep duration of = 5 h a day with psychological stress, depressive mood, or suicidal ideation had higher odds of menstrual cycle irregularity (1.96 [1.26-3.05], 2.86 [1.50-5.44], and 2.25 [1.18-4.29]). This study suggests positive associations of mental health problems and short sleep duration with menstrual cycle irregularity among Korean female adults. Therefore, strategies to deal with psychological stress, depressive mood, and sleep duration are needed for improving the reproductive health of women suffering from menstrual disturbances.

TI  - Associations between long self-reported sleep, obesity and insulin resistance in a cohort of premenopausal Black and White South African women
T2  - SLEEP HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: South African women have disproportionately high levels of overweight and obesity, and ethnic differences in obesity and insulin resistance have been observed. We investigated associations between self-reported sleep duration, obesity and insulin resistance in Black and White South African women.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Participants: Black normal-weight (n = 122), Black obese (n = 133). White normal-weight (n = 87) and White obese (n = 63) urban South African women, aged 18 to 45y.
   Measurements: Participants completed questionnaires capturing self-reported sleep duration, demographic, socioeconomic, medical history and lifestyle information. Body composition and fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured.
   Results: The Black women reported longer sleep than the White women (median: 8 h, interquartile range: 8-10 h v 7(7-8) respectively, P< .001). Adjusted models indicated that women sleeping <7 h sleep were less likely to be obese (P = .035) or insulin resistant (P = .032), while those sleeping >9 h were more likely to be insulin resistant (P = .014) than those sleeping 7 to 9 h. Shorter self-reported sleep was associated with less insulin resistance (<7 h v 7-9 h: P = .018) and longer sleep with more insulin resistance (>9 h v 7-9 h: P = .047) in the Black but not White women.
   Conclusions: Future research that objectively measures sleep duration is needed to confirm these observations and investigate potential factors contributing to the relationship between sleep and risk for non-communicable diseases in different ethnic groups.

TI  - Triggers, Protectors, and Predictors in Episodic Migraine
T2  - CURRENT PAIN AND HEADACHE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review A wide variety of triggers prompt attacks in episodic migraine. Although experimental triggers such as glyceryl trinitrate reliably produce migraine, natural triggers are much less predictable and vary in importance between individuals. This review describes the most common triggers in episodic migraine and provides strategies for managing them in clinical practice.
   Recent Findings Multiple migraine attack triggers have been established based on patient surveys, diary studies, and clinical trials. Stress, menstrual cycle changes, weather changes, sleep disturbances, alcohol, and other foods are among the most common factors mentioned. Clinical studies have verified that fasting, premenstrual periods in women, "letdown" after stress, and most likely low barometric pressures are migraine triggers. Premonitory symptoms such as neck pain, fatigue, and sensitivity to lights, sounds, or odors may mimic triggers.
   Summary Multiple studies clearly demonstrate triggers in episodic migraine, often related to change in homeostasis or environment. Many common migraine triggers are not easily modifiable, and avoiding triggers may not be realistic. Healthy lifestyle choices such as exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and eating regularly may prevent triggers and transformation to chronic migraine over time.

TI  - Quiet sleep detection in preterm infants using deep convolutional neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Objective. Neonates spend most of their time asleep. Sleep of preterm infants evolves rapidly throughout maturation and plays an important role in brain development. Since visual labelling of the sleep stages is a time consuming task, automated analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) to identify sleep stages is of great interest to clinicians. This automated sleep scoring can aid in optimizing neonatal care and assessing brain maturation. Approach. In this study, we designed and implemented an 18-layer convolutional neural network to discriminate quiet sleep from nonquiet sleep in preterm infants. The network is trained on 54 recordings from 13 preterm neonates and the performance is assessed on 43 recordings from 13 independent patients. All neonates had a normal neurodevelopmental outcome and the EEGs were recorded between 27 and 42 weeks postmenstrual age. Main results. The proposed network achieved an area under the mean and median ROC curve equal to 92% and 98%, respectively. Significance. Our findings suggest that CNN is a suitable and fast approach to classify neonatal sleep stages in preterm infants.

TI  - The relationship between menopausal symptoms and sexual function
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - Sexual function could be affected by several factors in postmenopausal women. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between the severity of menopausal symptoms and sexual function. The study was conducted among 405 postmenopausal women aged 40-65 years, in Chalous and Noshahr, Iran, from October 2013 to May 2014. The participants were selected using a multistage sampling method. The instruments used for data collection were the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), and a demographics questionnaire. The relationship between the severity of menopausal symptoms and sexual function was examined using Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple linear and logistic regressions. The mean unadjusted FSFI and MRS scores were 24.11 and 12.45, respectively; and 61.0 percent of the participants had female sexual dysfunction (FSD) (FSFI <= 26.55). A significant negative correlation was observed between the MRS scores (total and all subscales) and the total scores for FSFI (p < 0.001). The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that with every unit increase in the total score of MRS, the likelihood of sexual dysfunction was 9.6 percent greater. We conclude that menopausal symptoms need to be considered in the design of health initiatives aimed at postmenopausal women's sexual function.

TI  - Aberrant Cerebral Activity in Early Postmenopausal Women: A Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Early postmenopausal women frequently suffer from cognitive impairments and emotional disorders, such as lack of attention, poor memory, deficits in executive function and depression. However, the underlying mechanisms of these impairments remain unclear.
   Method: Forty-three early postmenopausal women and forty-four age-matched premenopausal controls underwent serum sex hormone analysis, neuropsychological testing and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Degree centrality (DC) analysis was performed to confirm the peak points of the functionally abnormal brain areas as the centers of the seeds. Subsequently, the functional connectivity (FC) between these abnormal seeds and other voxels across the whole brain was calculated. Finally, the sex hormone levels, neuroimaging indices and neuropsychological data were combined to detect potential correlations.
   Results: Compared with the premenopausal controls, the early postmenopausal women exhibited significantly higher serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, more severe climacteric and depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality and more extensive cognitive impairments. Concurrently, the neuroimaging results showed elevated DC values in the left amygdala (AMYG.L), reduced DC values in the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG.L) and right middle occipital gyrus (MOG.R). When we used the AMYG.L as the seed point, FC with the left insula (INS.L), bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG.R) was increased; these regions are related to depressive states, poor sleep quality and decreased executive function. When bilateral MOG were used as the seed points, FC with left inferior parietal gyrus (IPG.L), this area closely associated with impaired memory, was decreased.
   Conclusion: These results illuminated the regional and network-level brain dysfunction in early postmenopausal women, which might provide information on the underlying mechanisms of the different cognitive impairments and emotional alterations observed in this group.

TI  - Association between sleep-disordered breathing and breast cancer aggressiveness
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with cancer aggressiveness, but studies focused on specific tumors are lacking. In this pilot study we investigated whether SDB is associated with breast cancer (BC) aggressiveness.
   Methods
   83 consecutive women <65 years diagnosed with primary BC underwent a home respiratory polygraphy. Markers of SDB severity included the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI4). The Ki67 proliferation index, lack of hormone receptors (HR-), Nottingham Histological Grade (NHG), and tumor stage were used as markers of BC aggressiveness. The association between SDB and molecular subtypes of BC was also assessed.
   Results
   The mean (SD) age was 48.8 (8.8) years and body mass index was 27.4 (5.4) Kg/m2. 42 women (50.6%) were post-menopausal. The median (IQR) AHI was 5.1 (2-9.4), and ODI4 was 1.5 (0.5-5.8). The median (IQR) AHI did not differ between the groups with Ki67>28% and Ki67<29% [5.1 (2.6-8.3) vs 5.0 (1.5-10), p = 0.89)], HR- and HR+ [5.7 (1.6-12.4) vs 4.9 (2-9.4), p = 0.68], NHG (Grade3, Grade2, and Gradel; p = 0.86), tumor stage (stage III-IV, stage II, and stage I; p = 0.62), or molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2, and triple negative; p = 0.90). The prevalence of an AHI >= 5 did not differ between the groups with Ki67>28% and Ki67<29% (51.2% vs 52.3%, p = 0.90), HR- and HR+ (58.3% vs 49.1%, p = 0.47), NHG categories (p = 0.89), different tumor stages (p = 0.71), or molecular subtypes (p = 0.73). These results did not change when the ODI4 was used instead of the AHI.
   Conclusion
   Our results do not support an association between the presence or severity of SDB and BC aggressiveness.

TI  - Telephone counseling: identification of symptoms in patients with lymphoma undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy
T2  - ACTA PAULISTA DE ENFERMAGEM
AB  - Objective: To identify through telephone counselling the signs and symptoms presented by patients with Hodgkin's Lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy with the protocol composed by doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine and to compare severity scores of the signs and symptoms presented in the cycles of the protocol.
   Methods: Descriptive, prospective, quantitative study. Seven patients received telephone counselling in 24 scheduled and unscheduled calls, corresponding to 6 ABVD chemotherapy cycle. The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were used for scoring the symptoms, along with a conduct protocol. A descriptive and analytical analysis was conducted.
   Results: Two hundred and eighty-six telephone calls generated 1,870 symptomatic complaints. In scheduled calls, the most prevalent complaints were fatigue, distress, lack of appetite, vomiting and nausea. As for the interference in daily life activities, the items related to general activities, work, difficulty walking, and mood changes wee reported more frequently. In unscheduled calls, lack of appetite and irregular menstruation were the most recurring complaints. The analysis of the progression of symptoms showed an increase in nausea and vomiting (p=0.02), decrease in fatigue and shortness of breath (p <= 0.03), improvement in sleep (p=0.02) and decrease of stress (p=0.02).
   Conclusion: Fatigue, nausea, vomiting and alterations in work activities were frequently reported. There was progression of nausea and vomiting but regression of fatigue and stress. Telephone consultation allowed a rapid communication and management of air expressive number of symptoms.

TI  - Assessing ventilatory instability using the response to spontaneous sighs during sleep in preterm infants
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Periodic breathing (PB) is common in newborns and is an obvious manifestation of ventilatory control instability. However, many infants without PB may still have important underlying ventilatory control instabilities that go unnoticed using standard clinical monitoring Methods to detect infants with "subclinical" ventilatory control instability are therefore required. The current study aimed to assess the degree of ventilatory control instability using simple bedside recordings in preterm infants.
   Methods: Respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) recordings were analyzed from similar to 20 minutes of quiet sleep in 20 preterm infants at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (median [range]: 36 [34-40]). The percentage time spent in PB was also calculated for each infant (%PB). Spontaneous sighs were identified and breath-by-breath measurements of (uncalibrated) ventilation were derived from RIP traces. Loop gain (LG, a measure of ventilatory control instability) was calculated by fitting a simple ventilatory control model (gain, time-constant, delay) to the post-sigh ventilatory pattern. For comparison, periodic inter-breath variability was also quantified using power spectral analysis (ventilatory oscillation magnitude index [VOMI]).
   Results: %PB was strongly associated with LG (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001) and moderately with the VOMI (r(2) = 0.21, p = 0.047). LG (0.52 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.03; p = 0.0025) and the VOMI (-8.2 +/- 1.1 dB vs. -11.8 +/- 0.9 dB; p = 0.026) were both significantly higher in infants that displayed PB vs. those without.
   Conclusions: LG and VOMI determined from the ventilatory responses to spontaneous sighs can provide a practical approach to assessing ventilatory control instability in preterm infants. Such simple techniques may help identify infants at particular risk for ventilatory instabilities with concomitant hypoxemia and its associated consequences.

TI  - Integration of Circadian and Metabolic Control of Reproductive Function
T2  - ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Optimal fertility in humans and animals relies on the availability of sufficient metabolic fuels, information about which is communicated to the brain via levels of the hormones leptin and insulin. The circadian clock system is also critical; this input is especially evident in the precise timing of the female-specific surge of GnRH and LH secretion that triggers ovulation the next day. Chronodisruption and metabolic imbalance can both impair reproductive activity, and these two disruptions exacerbate each other, such that they often occur simultaneously. Kisspeptin neurons located in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are able to integrate both circadian and metabolic afferent inputs and use this information to modulate the timing and magnitude of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge. In an environment in which exposure to high caloric diets and chronodisruptors such as artificial night lighting, shift work, and transmeridian travel have become the norm, the implications of these factors for couples struggling to conceive deserve closer attention and more public education.

TI  - Rare Presentation of Dercum's Disease in a Child with Abnormalities in Lipoprotein Metabolism
T2  - ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE CARDIOLOGIA
AB  - Adiposis dolorosa, or Dercum's disease, is a subcutaneous accumulation of fat in the body accompanied by intense, chronic, and symmetrical pain, often disabling, and usually not responsive to conventional analgesics. It was first described by Dercum, recognized as a separate disease in 1892,(1) and further reported by White in 1899.(2) Termed in the literature Dercum's disease, Morbus Dercum, lipomatosis dolorosa, adiposalgia, adiposis dolorosa, and adipose tissue rheumatism, this condition is more prevalent in young women, aged 35 to 50 years, and affects preferably those in the post-menopause phase.(1-)(3) Adiposis dolorosa can also occur in multiple familial lipomatosis, a condition associated with multiple lipomas.(4) Other symptoms and signs include psychiatric (depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, memory and concentration impairment), cardiovascular (tachycardia), pulmonary (shortness of breath), rheumatological (fatigue, weakness, joint and muscle aches) and gastrointestinal (bloating, constipation) disorders.(3)
   Dercum's disease was described as a general disease of the lymphatic system. In 2014, Rasmussen et al.(5) suggested that this is a lymphovascular disorder with abnormalities in the adipose tissue deposition and lymphatic transport, showing that lipomas appeared to be fed and drained by functional lymphatics. In addition, Huang et al.(6) have reinforced the importance of lymphatic system in cholesterol transport, showing the association with ApoA1, HDL formation, and lymphatic transport to the blood for scavenging by the HDL receptor, or scavenger receptor B1.(6)
   Although the majority of Dercum's disease cases occurs sporadically, there are reports suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance, with variable expression. The prevalence and the pathophysiology are also unknown, but inflammation, endocrine, adipose tissue, and nervous system dysfunction, trauma, mechanical pressure on the nerves, are possible etiological conditions.(3-4) Considering the abnormal fat deposition, presence of inflammation, and possible metabolic and lipoprotein abnormalities, an increased risk for atherosclerosis should be expected. Albeit the increased fat mass accumulation in Dercum's disease, it has not been yet reported in association with cardiovascular diseases.(7)

TI  - Sleep Disorders are a Prevalent and Serious Comorbidity in Dry Eye
T2  - INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE
AB  - PURPOSE. Sleep is an essential life habit and closely associated with lifespan, diabetes, hypertension, and mental health. Sleep disorders are a prominent, but overlooked problem in patients with dry eye disease (DED), characterized by a poor sleep index, short sleep duration, long sleep latency, and poor subjective sleep. DED and sleep disorders are more prevalent in women than men. Moreover, sleep quality in DED is worse than in other eye diseases, including glaucoma, retinal diseases, cataract, and allergic and chronic conjunctivitis.
   METHODS. We reviewed the literature for studies investigating sleep and health, eyes and sleep, and DED and sleep, in terms of systemic and eye health, especially in women.
   RESULTS. Two studies reported that approximately half of patients with DED suffer from poor sleep. The severity of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, is correlated strongly with sleep disorders in DED, and the symptoms and signs of DED, especially pain, also are correlated with sleep quality. Sleep disorders are documented in primary Sjogren's syndrome and an association with sleep apnea and depression is suggested. Primary Sjogren's syndrome includes arthritis and other rheumatic disease causing pain and fatigue; however, how sicca contributes to sleep disorders is not known.
   CONCLUSIONS. Possible explanations for sleep disorders in DED may be depression, pain, and eye exposure at night. Reciprocal effects may be expected and consultation-liaison psychiatry is recommended for the management of sleep disorders in DED. Topical medication and lid heating also may be advantageous for sleep quality in DED.

TI  - Association between sex hormones and ambulatory blood pressure
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION
AB  - Introduction: Higher levels of total testosterone and lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) have been associated with increased blood pressure (BP) in women with an inverse association between total testosterone and BP among men. Fewer studies have examined associations with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), blunted nocturnal BP decline or the role of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), a precursor to androgens.
   Methods: Baseline blood samples were assayed for 229 normotensive men (>= 50 years) and women (>= 55 years) participating in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL. Standardized seated BP (SBP and DBP) and 24-h ABP were measured by trained technicians. Self-reported cardiovascular risk factors and sociodemographic variables were reported on baseline questionnaires. Sex stratified linear regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, BMI, smoking and alcohol estimated the association between each sex hormone and measures of BP and 24-h ABP. Logistic regression used to estimate associations with blunted nocturnal decline (> 10% reduction in SBP or DBP during sleeping hours).
   Results: Total testosterone and SHBG demonstrated significant inverse correlations with SBP whereas DHEAS was not significantly associated with BP. Among men, in multivariable analyses, each 10% increase in DHEAS was associated with a 0.41 mmHg higher seated DBP (beta= 4.29, 95% CI 0.84-7.73) and each 10% increase in total testosterone and SHBG was associated with a 0.54 mmHg (beta=-5.65, 95% CI-10.45 to-0.84) and 0.60 mm Hg (beta=-6.30, 95% CI-11.38 to-1.21) decrease in seated DBP, respectively. No significant associations were observed among women.
   Conclusion: Among men only, we observed statistically significant inverse cross-sectional associations between total testosterone and SHBG with seated DBP, and a significant positive association with DHEAS levels.

TI  - Postischemic application of estrogen ameliorates myocardial damage in an in vivo mouse model
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Cardioprotection provided by estrogen has been recognized for many years. It is noteworthy that most of these studies employ a means of preinjury application in experimental research and the preventive usage in clinical studies. Compared to pretreatment, postischemic administration of estrogen will be more practical in treating myocardial ischemia. On the other hand, defect in circadian clock gene period2 (Per2) has been shown to aggravate ischemia-induced heart damage. Given that Per2 expression decreases as a consequence of menopause, in this study, we aim to determine (1) potential improvement of myocardial function by postischemic administration of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) using an in vivo mouse myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model and (2) the role of E2 in regulating myocardial Per2 expression following I/R.
   Methods: Thirty-minute occlusion of left anterior descending artery followed by 24-h reperfusion was performed on adult C57BL ovariectomized female mice. Groups (n = 3-6/group) were as follows: (1) Sham, (2) I/R + vehicle, and (3) I/R + E2. Vehicle or 0.5 mg/kg of E2 was subcutaneously injected right after 30-min ischemia. Following 24-h reperfusion, myocardial function was determined. Heart tissue was collected for analysis of cleaved caspase-3 and Per2 expression by Western blotting, as well as proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results: I/R significantly impaired left ventricular function and increased myocardial levels of active caspase-3, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. Importantly, postischemic treatment of E2 markedly restored I/R-depressed myocardial function, reduced caspase-3 activation, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). Intriguingly, a trend of the decreased Per2 level was observed in ovariectomized female hearts subjected to I/R, whereas E2 treatment upregulated myocardial Per2 expression.
   Conclusions: Our study represents the initial evidence that postischemic administration of E2 effectively preserves the myocardium against I/R injury and this protective effect of E2 may involve upregulation of Per2 in ischemic heart. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of hypnotics on prefrontal cortex activity during a verbal fluency task in healthy male subjects: A near-infrared spectroscopy study
T2  - HUMAN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL
AB  - Objective To assess the effects of hypnotics on prefrontal cortex activity in healthy subjects using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Methods Eighteen healthy males received acute doses of ramelteon (8 mg), triazolam (0.125 mg), or placebo in a predetermined randomization schedule, with a washout period of more than 1 week. All subjects performed a verbal fluency task during NIRS assessments at baseline and at 1 and 4 hr post-dose. The number of words correctly generated during the task (behavioral performance) and scores on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) were also recorded at each test time. Results Compared with the placebo, triazolam (0.125 mg) significantly decreased oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration change in NIRS during the posttask period and significantly increased behavioral performance, whereas triazolam (0.125 mg) and ramelteon (8 mg) significantly increased SSS scores. Conclusions The differential effects of two types of hypnotics on oxy-Hb change measured by NIRS were observed in acute dosing, suggesting that when assessing brain activity of patients with psychiatric disorders, researchers should consider how certain types of hypnotics can influence brain function. This would also provide useful information to clinicians when prescribing hypnotics suitable for their patients' conditions.

TI  - Midlife Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life in Older Women
T2  - JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Midlife represents an important time to evaluate health status and health behaviors that may affect health-related quality of life (HRQL) in later years. This study examines change in women's HRQL over 11 years from ages 47-59 to 57-69 and identifies midlife characteristics that predict HRQL at older ages.
   Methods: Physical (PCS) and mental component summaries (MCS) of the SF-36 were used to assess HRQL from 2002 to 2013 in 2,614 women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a multiethnic/racial cohort study. We used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) models to obtain unadjusted predicted mean trajectories of PCS and MCS as a function of age.
   Results: LOESS predicted PCS declined from 51.6 to 47.1, whereas MCS increased from 49.2 to 53.1. In multivariable models, controlling for baseline PCS, higher baseline physical activity (p ..002) and increase in physical activity from baseline (p < .0001) predicted better PCS. 'rime since baseline (ie, aging; p < .001), higher baseline body mass index (p < .0001), increased body mass index over time (p < .0001), smoking (p < .05), two or more medical conditions (p < .0001), sleep problems (p < .0001), and urinary incontinence (p < .0001) were related to lower PCS. Early (p = .004) and late postmenopause (p = .001; vs. premenopause) and aging (p = .05) predicted higher MCS. Predictors of lower MCS were less than very good health (p < .0001), sleep problems (p < .0001), stressful life events (p < .0001), higher perceived stress (p < .0001), and higher trait anxiety (p = .004). Race/ethnicity was related to MCS, but not PCS.
   Conclusions: Several potentially modifiable midlife factors, such as improved sleep hygiene, physical activity, and body mass index, might improve HRQL for older women.

TI  - Impact of sex and menopausal status on the prevalence, clinical presentation, and comorbidities of sleep-disordered breathing
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is currently considered as a unique condition, but it has been suggested that the prevalence, clinical presentation, and associated conditions may differ by sex or by menopausal status in women. We aimed to assess the prevalence of SDB and associated comorbidities in pre- and postmenopausal women compared with men.
   Methods: Participants of the population-based HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort study underwent polysomnography in their home environment and had extensive phenotyping for diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and depression.
   Results: A total of 2121 subjects (age 40-85 [59 +/- 11] years, body mass index 25.6 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2), 1024 men and 1097 women [769 postmenopausal]) were included. SDB prevalence based on an apnea-hypopnea index of >5/h, >15/11, >20/11, and >= 30/h, respectively, was 83.8%, 49.7%, 37.5%, and 22.0% in men; 35.1%, 8.6%, 3.3%, and 1.3% in premenopausal women; and 71.6%, 29.4%, 20.7%, and 10.1% in postmenopausal women. In multivariable models, SDB severity was significantly associated with hypertension in women (p = 0.007) (mainly in postmenopausal women) but not in men (p = 0.065), with diabetes in men (p = 0.021) but not in women overall (p = 0.853) or in postmenopausal women (p = 0.725), with metabolic syndrome in men (p = 0.002) and women (p < 0.001), and with depression in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.853).
   Conclusion: SDB prevalence in this middle-aged to-older population was high, particularly in men and postmenopausal women. SDB was associated with hypertension and depression exclusively in women, whereas an association with diabetes was present only in men. These findings suggest that the SDB definition and management recommendations may need to be adapted to these groups' specificities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Pregnant Women: A Review of Pregnancy Outcomes and an Approach to Management
T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - Among obese pregnant women, 15%-20% have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and this prevalence increases along with body mass index and in the presence of other comorbidities. Prepregnancy obesity and pregnancy-related weight gain are certainly risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy, but certain physiologic changes of pregnancy may also increase a woman's risk of developing or worsening OSA. While it has been shown that untreated OSA in postmenopausal women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic comorbidities, a body of literature is emerging that suggests OSA may also have serious implications for the health of mothers and fetuses during and after pregnancy. In this review, we discuss the following: pregnancy as a vulnerable period for the development or worsening of OSA; the associations between OSA and maternal and fetal outcomes; the current screening modalities for OSA in pregnancy; and current recommendations regarding peripartum management of OSA.

TI  - Suicide Risk and the Menstrual Cycle: a Review of Candidate RDoC Mechanisms
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewRisk for suicidal behavior may fluctuate across the menstrual cycle. Here, we use the RDoC framework to review potential mechanisms by which the cycle may increase acute suicide risk.Recent FindingsThe menstrual cycle impacts the majority of RDoC constructs linked to suicide risk, particularly among hormone-sensitive women, such as those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual exacerbation of a psychiatric disorder. Despite this, there are no published studies examining suicidal ideation, planning, or behavior longitudinally across the cycle.SummaryMore work is needed to understand how hormone sensitivity may relate to both trait and state suicide risk. Intensive multilevel investigations of cyclical hormone effects on suicide risk through specific RDoC mechanisms are suggested. This is a fertile research area and may provide key insights regarding the mechanisms of acute suicide risk.

TI  - Dietary total antioxidant capacity is inversely related to menopausal symptoms: a cross-sectional study among Iranian postmenopausal women
T2  - NUTRITION
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the association between dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) and menopausal symptoms (MS) in postmenopausal middle-aged women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 400 postmenopausal women who referred to municipality health houses and health centers in south Tehran, Iran. Sociodemographic data and anthropometric measures such as body weight, height, and waist circumference were determined. Dietary intake was assessed using a 147-item validated food frequency questionnaire. Energy-adjusted DTAC was calculated using the US Department of Agriculture database. Individual MS was measured by the Menopause Rating Scale questionnaire.
   Results: Multivariable linear regression analyses indicated that DTAC was negatively associated with total Menopause Rating Scale score, somatic and psychological score, which was independent of confounding variables such as age, education, waist circumference, total physical activity, dietary intake of fiber, tea and coffee intake, total energy intake, and dietary supplement use (P < 0.001). Additionally, in logistic regression, a negative association between MS and DTAC was observed, which was independent of confounding variables (P-trend = 0.002). Logistic regression for each symptom indicated that higher DTAC was associated with reduction in hot flashes and sweating, sleep problems, anxiety, exhaustion, and difficulty concentrating. However, a significant positive association was observed between DTAC and sexual problems.
   Conclusion: DTAC is inversely associated with MS, which could be of particular significance for somatic and psychological symptoms. These findings indicate that DTAC could be an important basis for developing an effective dietary measure for reducing MS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of sleep difficulties in the vasomotor menopausal symptoms and depressed mood relationships: an international pooled analysis of eight studies in the InterLACE consortium
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background. Many women experience both vasomotor menopausal symptoms (VMS) and depressed mood at midlife, but little is known regarding the prospective bi-directional relationships between VMS and depressed mood and the role of sleep difficulties in both directions.
   Methods. A pooled analysis was conducted using data from 21 312 women (median: 50 years, interquartile range 49-51) in eight studies from the InterLACE consortium. The degree of VMS, sleep difficulties, and depressed mood was self-reported and categorised as never, rarely, sometimes, and often (if reporting frequency) or never, mild, moderate, and severe (if reporting severity). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the bi-directional associations adjusted for within-study correlation.
   Results. At baseline, the prevalence of VMS (40%, range 13-62%) and depressed mood (26%, 8-41%) varied substantially across studies, and a strong dose-dependent association between VMS and likelihood of depressed mood was found. Over 3 years of follow-up, women with often/severe VMS at baseline were more likely to have subsequent depressed mood compared with those without VMS (odds ratios (OR) 1.56, 1.27-1.92). Women with often/severe depressed mood at baseline were also more likely to have subsequent VMS than those without depressed mood (OR 1.89, 1.47-2.44). With further adjustment for the degree of sleep difficulties at baseline, the OR of having a subsequent depressed mood associated with often/severe VMS was attenuated and no longer significant (OR 1.13, 0.90-1.40). Conversely, often/severe depressed mood remained significantly associated with subsequent VMS (OR 1.80, 1.38-2.34).
   Conclusions. Difficulty in sleeping largely explained the relationship between VMS and subsequent depressed mood, but it had little impact on the relationship between depressed mood and subsequent VMS.

TI  - A systematic review of the effects of strength training in patients with fibromyalgia: clinical outcomes and design considerations
T2  - ADVANCES IN RHEUMATOLOGY
AB  - Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic and generalized musculoskeletal pain. There is currently no cure for FM, but palliative treatments are available. One type of treatment is strength training (ST). However, there is a need for more information on optimal training protocols, intensity, and volume needed to improve symptoms. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of ST in the treatment of FM through a systematic review of experimental research.
   Methods: Medical Subject Headings search terms and electronic databases including Scientific Electronic Library Online, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database were used to identify studies.
   Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 22 eligible studies. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States (36%), Finland (23%), Brazil (18%), and Sweden (18%). The studies showed that ST reduces the number of tender points, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, and improves sleep quality and quality of life in patients with FM. The intervention period ranged from 3 to 21 weeks, with sessions performed 2 times a week in 81.81% of the studies, at initial intensities of 40% of 1-repetition maximum. The repetitions ranged from 4 to 20, with no specific protocol defined for ST in FM.
   Conclusion: The main results included reduction in pain, fatigue, number of tender points, depression, and anxiety, with increased functional capacity and quality of life. Current evidence demonstrates that ST is beneficial and can be used to treat FM.

TI  - Neuroendocrine pathways driving daily rhythms in the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis of female rodents
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Rhythms in female reproduction, notably the timing of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge at the rest/activity transition, are critical to ensure that ovulation coincides with oocyte maturation and optimal sexual arousal. This fine tuning involves principally estradiol feedback as an indicator of oocyte maturation, and the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei as an indicator of time of day. Here, we review recent progress made in understanding how neuropeptides of the master clock relay time cues to the hypothalamic reproductive network, how this pathway is modulated by estradiol feedback, and what is the role of peripheral circadian clocks in timing female reproduction. Lastly, we highlight the need for investigating the impact of circadian disruptions on female fertility.

TI  - Circadian control of neuroendocrine function: implications for health and disease
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The circadian timing system orchestrates daily rhythms in physiology and behavior via the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master brain clock. Because endocrine secretions have far-reaching influence on the brain and periphery, circadian regulation of hormones is essential for normal functioning and disruptions to circadian timing (e.g., irregular sleep patterns, limited exposure to sunlight, jet lag, nighttime light exposure) have detrimental health consequences. Herein, we provide an overview of circadian timing in three major endocrine axes, the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG), hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axes, and then consider the negative health consequences of circadian disruptions in each of these systems. For example, disruptions to HPG axis circadian timing lead to a host of negative reproductive outcomes such as irregular menstrual cycles, low sperm density and increased rates of miscarriages and infertility. Dysregulation of HPA axis timing is associated with obesity and metabolic disease, whereas disruptions to the HPT axis are associated with dysregulated metabolic gene rhythms in the heart. Together, this overview underscores the significance of circadian endocrine rhythms in normal health and disease prevention.

TI  - Cortical Auditory-Evoked Responses in Preterm Neonates: Revisited by Spectral and Temporal Analyses
T2  - CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB  - Characteristic preterm EEG patterns of "Delta-brushes" (DBs) have been reported in the temporal cortex following auditory stimuli, but their spatio-temporal dynamics remains elusive. Using 32-electrode EEG recordings and co-registration of electrodes' position to 3D-MRI of age-matched neonates, we explored the cortical auditory-evoked responses (AERs) after `click' stimuli in 30 healthy neonates aged 30-38 post-menstrual weeks (PMW). (1) We visually identified auditory-evoked DBs within AERs in all the babies between 30 and 33 PMW and a decreasing response rate afterwards. (2) The AERs showed an increase in EEG power from delta to gamma frequency bands over the middle and posterior temporal regions with higher values in quiet sleep and on the right. (3) Time-frequency and averaging analyses showed that the delta component of DBs, which negatively peaked around 550 and 750 ms over the middle and posterior temporal regions, respectively, was superimposed with fast (alpha-gamma) oscillations and corresponded to the late part of the cortical auditory-evoked potential (CAEP), a feature missed when using classical CAEP processing. As evoked DBs rate and AERs delta to alpha frequency power decreased until full term, auditory-evoked DBs are thus associated with the prenatal development of auditory processing and may suggest an early emerging hemispheric specialization.

TI  - Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of perimenopausal depression: summary and recommendations
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - There is a new appreciation of the perimenopause - defined as the early and late menopause transition stages as well as the early postmenopause - as a windowof vulnerability for the development of both depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes. However, clinical recommendations on how to identify, characterize and treat clinical depression are lacking. To address this gap, an expert panel was convened to systematically review the published literature and develop guidelines on the evaluation and management of perimenopausal depression. The areas addressed included: 1) epidemiology; 2) clinical presentation; 3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; 4) effects of hormone therapy; and 5) efficacy of other therapies (eg, psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). Overall, evidence generally suggests that most midlife women who experience a major depressive episode during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression. Midlife depression presents with classic depressive symptoms commonly in combination with menopause symptoms (ie, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance), and psychosocial challenges. Menopause symptoms complicate, co-occur, and overlap with the presentation of depression. Diagnosis involves identification of menopausal stage, assessment of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of the psychosocial factors common in midlife, differential diagnoses, and the use of validated screening instruments. Proven therapeutic options for depression (ie, antidepressants, psychotherapy) are the front-line treatments for perimenopausal depression. Although estrogen therapy is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression, there is evidence that it has antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women, particularly those with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Data on estrogen plus progestin are sparse and inconclusive.

TI  - Vasomotor symptoms in women over 60: results from the Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and Sexuality (DREAMS)
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Frequency of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in older women and the contributing factors are largely undefined. We measured the frequency of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (msVMS) in women >= 60 years of age and examined their characteristics to determine factors that may associate with VMS in older women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was completed using the Menopause Health Questionnaire from the Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and Sexuality. Data were collected from women presenting for menopause consultation to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from January 1, 2006 to October 7, 2014. We created a binary variable where women were classified as having msVMS bother if they reported "quite a bit" or "extremely" compared with women reporting "not at all" or "a little bit." Women with and without msVMS were evaluated by menopause type, self-rated heath, current tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol use, as well as pertinent medication use. Associations between participant characteristics and msVMS were evaluated using logistic regression and a multivariable model with age as a covariate. Interactions between participant characteristics and age were also assessed.
   Results: Of the 4,956 women presenting for menopause consultation, 921 (18%) were >= 60 years old. Of these, 379 (41.2%) reported msVMS bother. Women with msVMS were more likely to have a history of nonspontaneous menopause and report their health as fair, versus good or excellent. Women reporting current use of hormone therapy (HT) (21%) were less likely to report msVMS compared with those not taking HT (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: A substantial number of women seen in a specialty menopause clinic were over age 60 years and reported msVMS, highlighting that VMS may be disruptive in women over a decade past the natural age of menopause.

TI  - Beyond fertility: polycystic ovary syndrome and long-term health
T2  - FERTILITY AND STERILITY
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic disorder affecting millions of women worldwide. Women with PCOS are often identified in adolescence or early adulthood with symptoms of oligomenorrhea or hirsutism or when presenting for infertility care. The health risks associated out of PCOS, however, go far beyond management of these common presenting symptoms or fertility treatment and likely extend past the reproductive years through and beyond menopause. International surveys suggest that most patients are dissatisfied with long-term counseling related to medical and psychologic issues. We performed a review of comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, depression, anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular disease, in both reproductive-age and older women with PCOS. Most meta-analyses in reproductive-age women demonstrate increased risks independent from obesity. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies including women with PCOS >40 years of age are limited in number and design, but many demonstrate that some of these comorbidities persist. All providers involved in the multidimensional care of women with PCOS should be aware of these long-term health risks to provide appropriate counseling, screening, and management options. We identify limitations that should be the focus of future studies designed to study health outcomes in postmenopausal women with PCOS. ((C) 2018 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

TI  - Effects of Ziyin Jianghuo Ningxin decoction plus dehydroepiandrosterone and femoston in treatment of patients with menopausal symptoms
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the therapeutic effect of Ziyin Jianghuo Ningxin Decoction (ZYJHNXD) plus dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in patients suffering from menopausal symptoms identified as, in terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine, symptom pattern of Yin deficiency with hyperactive fire.
   METHODS: Totally 180 postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years were assigned into four groups and accepted femoston, femoston with ZYJHNXD, femoston with DHEA, femoston with ZYJHNXD and DHEA therapies, respectively, for three months. Common questionnaire-based measure instruments included modified Kupperman index (MKI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), bone mineral density (BMD), and sleep quality were evaluated before and three months after the treatments.
   RESULTS: In all four groups, the scores of MKI, HAMA, HAMD and the levels of FSH, LH decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after the treatment, while the levels of E2, 5-HIAA, NE, and DA showed obvious elevation (P < 0.05). The group receiving ZYJHNXD and DHEA combined with femoston had superiority in the preservation of bone mineral density and improvement of total sleep time and nighttime sleep time over the other three groups.
   CONCLUSION: ZYJHNXD and DHEA combined with MHT therapy have a favorable outcome in managing menopausal symptoms, restoring hormone levels, preventing skeletal rarefaction or osteoporosis, and improving sleep quality for postmenopausal women. (C) 2018 JTCM. All rights reserved.

TI  - Circadian rhythms of factors involved in luteal regression are modified in p55 tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFRp55)-deficient mice
T2  - REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The rhythm of factors involved in luteal regression is crucial in determining the physiological duration of the oestrous cycle. Given the role of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in luteal function and circadian regulation and that most of the effects of TNF-alpha arc mediated by p55 TNF receptor (TNFRp55), the aims of the present study were to analyse the following during the luteal regression phase in the ovary of mice: (1) whether the pattern of expression of progesterone (P4) and the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of P4 is circadian and endogenous (the rhythm persists in constant conditions, (i.e., constant darkness) with a period of about 24 hours); (2) circadian oscillations in clock gene expression; (3) whether there are daily variations in the expression of key genes involved in apoptosis and antioxidant mechanisms; and (4) the consequences of TNFRp55 deficiency. P4 was found to oscillate circadianally following endogenous rhythms of clock factors. Of note, TNFRp55 deficiency modified the circadian oscillation in P4 concentrations and its enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of P4, probably as a consequence of changes in the circadian oscillations of brain and muscle ARNT-Like protein 1 (Bmal 1) and Cryptochrome 1 (Cryl). Furthermore, TNFRp55 deficiency modified the circadian rhythms of apoptosis genes, as well as antioxidant enzymes and peroxidation levels in the ovary in dioestrus. The findings of the present study strengthen the hypothesis that dysregulation of TNF-alpha signalling may be a potential cause for altered circadian and menstrual cycling in some gynaecological diseases.

TI  - Biobehavioral Responses of Preterm Infants to Conventional and Swaddled Tub Baths A Randomized Crossover Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATAL & NEONATAL NURSING
AB  - Bathing is a routine care procedure that exposes preterm infants to prolonged handling, which could cause stress and potentially disrupt infants' biobehavioral responses. The aim of this double-blind randomized crossover trial was to compare the preterm infant's body temperature, heart rate (HR), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (Spo(2)), salivary cortisol levels, and sleep-wake states during and after swaddled and conventional tub baths. Forty-three infants born at 32 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age, weighing 2225 g or less, were enrolled in the study. Infants were videotaped before and after each type of baths. The time interval between baths ranged from 24 to 72 hours to allow a washout period. Physiological, hormonal, and behavioral responses were collected at baseline and during recovery from baths. No significant differences in the mean body temperature, HR, Spo(2), salivary cortisol levels, and sleep-wake states between the bath types were observed in the baseline or recovery responses during the first 20 minutes after bath. Regardless of bath type, salivary cortisol levels showed a nonstatistical significant increase.

TI  - Poor Sleep Quality Is Associated with Higher Hemoglobin A1c in Pregnant Women: A Pilot Observational Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - We hypothesized that poor sleep quality exacerbates glucose intolerance manifested as elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which increases the risk for gestational diabetes. To test this, 38 pregnant and 22 non-pregnant (age, 18-35 years; body-mass index, 20-35 kg/m(2)) otherwise healthy women were enrolled in the study. Sleep quality was assessed during gestational week 24 (pregnant), or outside of the menstrual period (non-pregnant), using qualitative (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and objective (actigraphic wrist-watch) measures. Blood glucose, total cortisol, and depression status were evaluated. Eight pregnant and one non-pregnant women were lost to follow-up, or withdrew from the study. There was a higher incidence of poor sleep quality in pregnant (73%) relative to non-pregnant women (43%). Although actigraphic data revealed no differences in actual sleep hours between pregnant and non-pregnant women, the number of wake episodes and sleep fragmentation were higher in pregnant women. Poor sleep quality was positively correlated with higher HbA1c in both pregnant (r = 0.46, n = 26, p = 0.0151) and non-pregnant women (r = 0.50, n = 19, p = 0.0217), reflecting higher average blood glucose concentrations. In contrast, poor sleep was negatively correlated with cortisol responses in pregnant women (r = -0.46, n = 25, p = 0.0167). Three pregnant women had elevated one-hour oral glucose tolerance test results (>153 mg/dL glucose). These same pregnant women exhibited poor sleep quality. These results support the suggestion that poor sleep quality is an important risk factor that is associated with glucose intolerance and attendant health complications in pregnancy.

TI  - The effect of multi-frequency whole-body vibration on night-shifted mouse model
T2  - SLEEP AND BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS
AB  - The circadian rhythm controls several biological activities; therefore, a disorganized circadian rhythm may cause fatal health problems. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of circadian rhythm disturbances induced by simulated night shift activities on the abdominal adipose tissue, bone microstructures and muscle volume in the tibiae of mice. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of multi-frequency whole-body vibration as a countermeasure against the consequences of circadian rhythm disturbances. Twenty-four 5-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were equally assigned to three groups: the normal group (Nor), night shift group (NS), and night shift with multi-frequency whole-body vibration group (NS+V). The NS and NS+V groups were exposed to circadian rhythm disturbances for 4weeks with 3-day intervals by changing the day and night cycle based on 7o'clock. After 4weeks, morphological changes in the adipose tissue, bone microstructures and muscle volume in the tibiae were evaluated from three-dimensional images using in vivo micro-computed tomography. As a result, the volume of the abdominal adipose tissue was significantly higher in the NS than in the Nor and NS+V groups. Also, the microstructures of the tibia were more enhanced in the NS+V than the NS group. The volume of tibial muscle was increased in all groups, while there were no significant changes in muscle volume. From these results, we can conclude that circadian rhythm disturbances induced by night shift activities may reduce bone condition and increase the accumulation of abdominal adipose tissue and these negative effects may be prevented or improved through applying multi-frequency whole-body vibration.

TI  - The association of sleep duration and quality with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Women's Health Initiative
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Background/Objective: Many studies have shown a U-shaped association of sleep duration with mortality; however, this association is difficult to interpret owing to possible reverse causation, residual confounding, and measurement issues. We used data from the Women's Health Initiative to examine the associations of sleep duration, insomnia, and use of sleep aids with death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, "other" causes, and all causes combined.
   Methods: Cox proportional hazards models were used in the analysis of baseline data and in time-dependent analyses of repeated measures to estimate associations of sleep-related factors with mortality. Among 158,203 women with information regarding sleep, 30,400 total deaths, 8857 CVD deaths, 9284 cancer deaths, and 11,928 other deaths were ascertained over a median of 17.8 years.
   Results: In both baseline and time-dependent analyses, both short (<= 5 h) and long sleep (>= 9 h) durations were associated with increased risk of total, CVD, and "other" deaths, but not with cancer deaths. Insomnia showed no association with mortality, whereas use of sleep medications was associated with an increased mortality risk.
   Conclusions: While our findings showed a small but robust association of sleep duration with mortality in postmenopausal women, studies including objective measurements of sleep quality and efficiency are needed to clarify these associations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Flow mediated vasodilation compared with carotid intima media thickness in the evaluation of early cardiovascular damage in menopausal women and the influence of biological and psychosocial factors
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Women after menopause increase risk for cardiovascular disease and several factors may be related. The purpose was to study biological and psychosocial factors associated with early cardiovascular damage in pre- and postmenopausal women, assessed with carotid intima-media thickness vs flow-mediated dilatation.
   Methods: Women 45 to 57 years old were grouped in the pre (n = 60), early (n = 58) and late post-menopause (n = 59). Anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal data were registered, as well as measures of depression, anxiety, submission, perceived stress, and sleep alterations. Heart Rate Variability was recorded to obtain the information regarding sympathovagal balance. Carotid intima-media thickness and flow-mediated dilatation were assessed by ultrasound. Two-way ANOVA and multiple regression model were used.
   Results: At late postmenopause, the carotid intima-media was thicker (p < 0.001) and flow-mediated dilatation decreased (p < 0.001). Carotid intima-media thickness was associated positively with age (p < 0.001), submission score (p = 0.029), follicle stimulating hormone levels (p < 0.001), and body mass index (p = 0.009). Flow-mediated dilatation was associated only with age (p < 0.001). Regarding heart rate variability, the time domain pNN50 measurement was higher in premenopausal women (p = 0.001), Low Frequency (LF) was higher in the two groups of postmenopausal (p = 0.001) and High Frequency (HF) higher in the early postmenopausal women (p = 0.042).
   Conclusions: Under our conditions carotid intima-media thickness had higher predictive value for early cardiovascular damage at menopause. The finding of the association of the submission score, indicates de influence of stress on vascular damage.

TI  - The prevalence and associated factors o symptomatic cervical Spondylosis in Chinese adults: a community-based cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Cervical spondylosis adversely affects life quality for its heavy disease burden. The report on the community-based prevalence and associated factors of cervical spondylosis is rare, especially in Chinese population. Whether prevention is needed and how to prevent it is not clear. This study aims to explore its prevalence and related lifestyle factors and provide evidence on prevention of cervical spondylosis.
   Methods: A community-based multistage cross-sectional survey of six communities from the Chinese population was conducted. A face-to-face interview was conducted to obtain individual information, and prevalence was calculated. Single-factor analysis and multivariable logistic regressions were used to explore the associated factors in total and subgroup populations.
   Results: A total of 3859 adults were analyzed. The prevalence of cervical spondylosis was 13.76%, although it differed significantly among the urban, suburban, and rural populations (13.07%, 15.97%, and 12.25%, respectively). Moreover, it was higher in females than in males (16.51% vs 10.49%). The prevalence among different age groups had an inverted U shape. The highest prevalence was in the age group from 45 to 60 years old. The associated factors differed by subgroups. There were positive associations between engaging in mental work, high housework intensity, and sleep duration of less than 7 h/day with cervical spondylosis. Going to work on foot was a negative factor of cervical spondylosis in the total population. For people aged less than 30 years, keeping the same work posture for 1-2.9 h/day was a special related factor. Exposure to vibration was an associated factor for females aged 45-60 years. Menopause was a special related factor for women.
   Conclusions: Prevalence of cervical spondylosis was high in Chinese population. People younger than 60 years were the focus of prevention for cervical spondylosis. Moreover, the characters between male and female and among different age groups were different and required targeted interventions.

TI  - Alterations in postmenopausal plasmatic lipidome
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Menopause consists of a physiological process in women between 40 and 50 years of age, and it has substantial consequences for health, ranging from disturbances in lipid and glycidic metabolism to psychological stress and sleep alterations, thereby increasing women's risk of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we attempted to identify potential lipid alterations not identified by the classic methods.
   Methods and results
   We analyzed the serum lipid profile in 40 women in pre- and post-menopause using a lipidomic approach and mass spectrometry. Lipid species presented increased concentrations, with a difference of more than 25% post-menopause and with the ceramides (N.C23:0.Cer, N.C23:0(OH).Cer and N.C24:0(OH).Cer) standing out with a fold change of 1.68, 1.59, and 1.58, respectively. It was also observed that 14 metabolites presented a significant difference in the average concentrations between pre- and post-menopause, especially the ceramide species. Strong and positive correlations were identified between various metabolites and fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. Of note were the association ceramide (N.C10:0.Cer) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE.a.C18:0) between fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin.
   Conclusion
   This study detected lipid alterations, especially in ceramides, post-menopause, as well as correlations with glycidic and lipid markers, which may in the future be useful to investigate diseases associated with menopause.

TI  - Modeling interrelationships between health behaviors in overweight breast cancer survivors: Applying Bayesian networks
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Obesity and its impact on health is a multifaceted phenomenon encompassing many factors, including demographics, environment, lifestyle, and psychosocial functioning. A systems science approach, investigating these many influences, is needed to capture the complexity and multidimensionality of obesity prevention to improve health. Leveraging baseline data from a unique clinical cohort comprising 333 postmenopausal overweight or obese breast cancer survivors participating in a weight-loss trial, we applied Bayesian networks, a machine learning approach, to infer interrelationships between lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity), body mass index (BMI), and health outcomes (biomarkers and self-reported quality of life metrics). We used bootstrap resampling to assess network stability and accuracy, and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to compare networks. Our results identified important behavioral subnetworks. BMI was the primary pathway linking behavioral factors to glucose regulation and inflammatory markers; the BMI-biomarker link was reproduced in 100% of resampled networks. Sleep quality was a hub impacting mental quality of life and physical health with >95% resampling reproducibility. Omission of the BMI or sleep links significantly degraded the fit of the networks. Our findings suggest potential mechanistic pathways and useful intervention targets for future trials. Using our models, we can make quantitative predictions about health impacts that would result from targeted, weight loss and/or sleep improvement interventions. Importantly, this work highlights the utility of Bayesian networks in health behaviors research.

TI  - Impact of breast cancer on prospective memory functioning assessed by virtual reality and influence of sleep quality and hormonal therapy: PROSOM-K study
T2  - BMC CANCER
AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cancer in women with more than 70% of BC patients being treated with hormonal therapy (HT). Among these patients, some report difficulties in remembering what they are supposed to do at the right moment, referring to prospective memory (PM). PM is essential for autonomy and medical adherence of patients, and requires an ecological assessment. Virtual reality, that recreates naturalistic environment, seems to be a promising method to evaluate PM. Several BC patients also report sleep disturbances. Given the role of sleep on memory consolidation, it is imperative to explore the influence of sleep quality on PM in BC patients treated with HT.
   The purpose of PROSOM-K study is to assess PM functioning using virtual reality and sleep quality in BC treated or not with HT.
   Methods: PROSOM-K is a prospective study including post-menopausal BC patients <= 70 years old treated with radiotherapy (n = 25) or with radiotherapy and HT (n = 25), and healthy post-menopausal women (n = 25) matched for age and education. PM will be assessed using a virtual reality based task Other cognitive functions and psychosocial factors will be assessed with validated questionnaires and neuropsychological tests. The study is divided in 3 sessions: a session of familiarisation with the virtual environment and the PM task: a day-time session during which participants learn intentions during the morning and recall them in the evening; and a night-time session during which participants learn intentions in the evening and recall them the following morning. Women will be monitored by wrist actigraphy; during the night-time session, objective sleep quality and quantity will be measured by polysomnography.
   Discussion: This is a novel study aiming to assess PM using virtual reality, coupled with the evaluation of other cognitive functions. Polysomnographic study of sleep will provide further information about architectural sleep disturbances in BC. Association between sleep architecture parameters and PM mechanism in BC women treated with HT will be described in detail. We expect our results will provide knowledge for patients and clinicians and further help to improve patient care and cognitive therapy.

TI  - Fast food consumption alongside socioeconomic status, stress, exercise, and sleep duration are associated with menstrual irregularities in Korean adolescents: Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2013
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB  - Background and Objectives: Menstrual irregularities in adolescents are a concern because they are considered a subjective indicator of poor physical and reproductive health. Menstrual regularity is associated with many genetic and mental health factors, and lifestyle changes can markedly influence an individual's level of menstrual regularity. Therefore, we investigated associations between lifestyle factors and menstrual irregularities in Korean adolescents by analysing data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2009 to 2013. Methods and Study Design: A total of 463 female adolescents aged 15-18 years participated in this study; they were divided into two groups based on their menstrual regularity. We assessed the between-group differences in relation to lifestyle-related factors, fast food consumption, and diet quality. Results: The frequencies of consumption of soda, coffee, and fried foods were significantly higher in the irregular menstruation group. However, the nutritional quality index was not significantly different between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age at menarche (odds ratio [OR]=0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.54-0.88), higher family income (OR=0.37, 95% CI=0.15-0.91), lack of exercise (OR=10.42, 95% CI=2.73-39.8), and high stress levels (OR=4.18, 95% CI=1.02-17.12) were associated with menstrual irregularity, whereas sufficient sleep (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.39-0.60) and low frequency of eating out accounted for menstrual regularity. Conclusions: Lifestyle factors and stress levels influence menstrual regularity in Korean adolescents. Appropriate and accessible education on lifestyle management is required.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness and relaxation training for insomnia (MRTI) on postmenopausal women: a pilot study
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of mindfulness and relaxation training for insomnia on insomnia and quality of life in postmenopausal women.
   Methods: Thirty postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years, who were not using hormone therapy, and had a diagnosis of insomnia and an apnea-hypopnea index of less than 15, were randomly assigned to two groups: a mindfulness intervention group and a control group. They were assessed before the intervention, and 8 weeks after its completion using questionnaires assessing sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), quality of life in menopause (Menopause-Specific Quality of Life), menopausal symptoms (Kupperman Menopausal Index), and level of attention (Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale). They were also assessed through ambulatory polysomnography. This is a pilot study and is limited by its small sample size.
   Results: The results of the questionnaires showed significant differences in the group that received mindfulness training compared with the control group, namely, improvements in sleep quality, a reduction in the severity of insomnia, a better quality of life, improved attention levels, and a reduction in menopausal and vasomotor symptoms. Polysomnography results showed no differences between the groups.
   Conclusions: Eight weeks mindfulness meditation training improved sleep quality, quality of life, attention levels, and reduced vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women with insomnia.

TI  - Epidemiology and associated factors of migraine headache among iranian medical students: A descriptive-analytical study
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: High incidence of migraine has caused to categorize it as one of the most debilitating human diseases. This study aims to investigate the incidence of migraine headache and the factors associated with it among medical students.
   Methodology: The present research is a descriptive, cross-sectional study. The sample size includes 390 subjects that were selected through proportionate stratified random sampling. To this purpose we used a questionnaire that was designed according to international headache standards criteria. Data was analyzed by SPSS. Accordingly, chi-square, independent t-test, and logistic regression were used for evaluation of clinical data.
   Results: In the finding it was reviled that 318 subjects out of 390 participants in the study had experienced headache (81.53%). In total, 27 subjects (6.9%) were suffering from migraine including 77.8% women and 22.2% men. The most common complication of migraine headache is dizziness by 17.2%. Factors intensifying migraine headaches include stress (63%), sunlight or fluorescent light (55.6%), loud noise (48.1%), fatigue (77.8%), and overheating (51.9%).
   Conclusion: among the factors affecting the intensification of migraine headaches, stress, sunlight, noise, fatigue, heat, menstruation in women, too much work, late sleep at night and some foods such as fish, caffeine, pepper, fat and fried foods were also identified as the food factors intensifying migraine headaches. Since the students of medical sciences are a part of health care system and such headaches will reduce their efficiency in health care delivery. Socio-economic impact of migraine on quality of life of student considerable and must be emphasized in health-treatment programs and plans.

TI  - Fatigue in type 1 diabetes, prevalence, predictors and comparison with the background population
T2  - DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Aim: Fatigue is scarcely studied in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and the aims were to investigate its prevalence compared to the background population, potential associations, and to validate the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) in type 1 diabetes.
   Methods: Persons with T1D were recruited from three outpatient clinics in Norway. Fatigue was measured using the FQ, and FQ data from the Norwegian background population were used for comparison. Socio-demographic and clinical variables were obtained by self-report, clinical investigation, medical records and laboratory tests.
   Results: Of 332 eligible patients, 288 (87%) were included. Mean age was 44.65/44.95 years (SD 13.34/13.38) for females/males, respectively. Total fatigue (TF) was 15.31 (SD 5.51) compared to 12.2 (SD 4.0) in the background population (p < 0.001). HADS >= 8, current menstruation, increased leukocytes and sleep problems were associated with increased TF. Chronic fatigue (CF) was reported in 26.4% compared to 11% in the background population (p < 0.001). HADS >= 8, increased time since diagnosis and decreased sleep quality were associated with CF. The validity, internal consistency and repeatability of the FQ was confirmed.
   Conclusions: Fatigue was more common in T1D than in the background population, and associated with increased anxiety, depression and sleep problems. The FQ demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Menstrual Cycle Effects on Sleep
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE CLINICS
AB  - Subjective and objective sleep changes occur during themenstrual cycle. Poorer sleep quality in the premenstrual phase andmenstruation is common inwomenwith premenstrual symptoms or painfulmenstrual cramps. There is increased sleep spindle activity from follicular to luteal phase, potentially progesterone related. Luteal phase changes also include blunted temperature rhythm amplitude and reduced rapid eye movement sleep. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome should be screened for sleepdisordered breathing. Short sleep duration is associated with irregular menstrual cycles, which may affect reproductive health. Menstrual cycle phase and menstrualrelated disorders should be considered when assessing women's sleep complaints.

TI  - Sleep and Sleep Disorders in the Menopausal Transition
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE CLINICS
AB  - The menopausal transition is associated with an increase in insomnia symptoms, especially difficulty staying asleep, which negatively affects quality of life. Vasomotor symptoms are a key component of sleep disruption. Findings from polysomnographic studies are less consistent in showing disrupted sleep in menopausal transition independent of aging; further prospective studies are needed. Hormone therapy alleviates subjective sleep disturbances, particularly if vasomotor symptoms are present. However, because of contraindications, other options should be considered. Further work is needed to develop preventive and treatment strategies for alleviating sleep disturbances to ensure better health, quality of life, and productivity in midlife women.

TI  - Effect of omega-3 supplements on vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: We aimed to investigate the effect of omega-3 supplements on relief of vasomotor symptoms among menopausal women.
   Study design: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Web of Science, CINAHL, IranMedex and SID databases were searched until September 2017. Inclusion criteria were (1) women were experiencing vasomotor symptoms in the menopause period, (2) intervention was omega-3 supplements (3) randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-RCT, and (4) outcome measures included changes in the frequency and severity of hot flush or night sweats, sleep problems and side effects.
   Results: Three randomized controlled trials involving 483 women in the age range of 51 to 54.7 years were included in the review. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was moderate. All the participants were found to be blinded. Meta-analysis of the data showed no difference in the frequency and severity of hot flushes, insomnia severity, sleep quality, quality of life and adverse effects between the two groups. Compared to placebo group, women who received omega-3 supplements experienced lower frequency (mean difference:-1.82, 95% Cl:-2.81,-0.83) and severity (mean difference:-.89, 95% CI:-1.25,-0.53) of night sweats.
   Conclusions: RCTs which investigate the impact of omega-3 supplements on vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women are scarce. A comprehensive search in a wide range of databases found only three relevant papers. Our analysis suggests that omega-3 supplements may alleviate night sweats but have no benefit in reducing hot flushes, or improving sleep quality and quality of life during the menopausal period. We recommend high quality RCTs along with a longer follow-up period to investigate this important subject, as there was insufficient evidence to conclude that omega-3 supplements are of benefit in alleviating vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women.

TI  - Connecting clinical aspects to corticomotor excitability in restless legs syndrome: a TMS study
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - We assessed corticomotor excitability in the primary motor cortex (M1) of participants with moderateto-severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in relation to the clinical and sleep aspects of the disease. Thirty-five participants (20 F; mean age: 59.23 +/- 1.66 years; range: 42-78 years) affected by primary RLS (off medications) and 31 age-matched controls (19 F; mean age: 57.90 +/- 1.50 years; range: 43-79 years) underwent TMS following two nights of polysomnography (PSG). Paired-pulse TMS measures [short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICE)] of the dominant M1(hand) and M1(leg) muscles were collected and analyzed in relation to clinical features of RLS and PSG. We found decreased corticomotor excitability in M1(hand), whereas it was increased in M1(leg), which was greater in patients with more severe RLS. Participants with RLS with a history of dopamine-agonist-induced symptom augmentation showed decreased LICI (reduced inhibition) compared to nonaugmented participants with RLS for M1(leg). None of the TMS measures (M1(hand) or M1(leg)) correlated with the PSG parameters. This study shows hyperexcitability in M1(leg), and this appears related to RLS disease severity and decreased excitability in M1(hand). The results provide new insight into the complex neurobiology of RLS, particularly in more advanced stages of the disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The chronotype in relationships and sexual behaviour-a preliminary overview
T2  - SOMNOLOGIE
AB  - Alate chronotype (owls) is someone who tends to go to bed late, so he or she will get up later. In contrast, morning types (larks) get up earlier and go to bed earlier. Men and women differ in their chronotype. Women are usually somewhat earlier chronotypes, who go to bed earlier, fall asleep earlier, and then get up alittle earlier. Interestingly, this difference arises with puberty and ends with menopause, from which areproductive function can be interpreted. From an evolutionary Darwinian perspective, this is asexual dimorphism that can be explained by sexual selection. Various studies have indeed shown that men of the evening type reported more sexual partners, in Italy, Sri Lanka and Germany. Furthermore, studies show that assortative behaviour takes place when choosing apartner, i.e. there are more couples whose partners are similar the chronotype. However, there are still many open questions related to this topic.

TI  - Prevalence and correlates of sleep disturbance among older women in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aims and objectivesTo explore prevalence and correlates of sleep disturbance among women aged 60 and over in Vietnam.
   BackgroundSleep disturbance can negatively influence human's health. Sleep disturbance is likely to increase with age, and women appear to be more likely to experience sleep disturbance than men. Knowledge about sleep disturbance in women aged 60 and over in Vietnam is under-researched.
   DesignThe study presents results from a cross-sectional survey of 440 women aged 60 and over from 16 rural and urban suburbs in Vietnam from August 2014-January 2015
   MethodsStructured questionnaires were used to gather data about residence, age, marital status, educational attainment, employment status, income, body mass index, physical activity, exercise, perceived stress, general health status, number of chronic diseases and sleep disturbance. Descriptive analysis, bivariate correlation and binary logistic generalised linear model were used for data analysis.
   ResultsAmong older women in Vietnam, (i) the prevalence of sleep disturbance was 38.9%; (ii) the most commonly problem was difficulty maintaining sleep, followed by sleep latency, reduced sleep quality, early waking and daytime sleepiness, (iii) body mass index and physical health were significantly associated with sleep disturbance status.
   ConclusionsSleep disturbance was relatively common among older women in Vietnam. Overweight increased their sleep disturbance while physical health was negatively associated with their sleep disturbance.
   Relevance to clinical practiceThis article provided evidence about sleep problems among older women in Vietnam and suggested that interventions targeting weight control and physical health promotion would be useful to improve their sleep problems.

TI  - The relationship between diurnal cortisol secretion and climacteric-related symptoms
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Objectives: Chronic stress, also associated with climacteric-related symptoms, may influence cortisol secretion. We studied cortisol metabolism in peri- and postmenopausal women with diverse climacteric-related symptoms.
   Study design and main outcome measures: The study population was 35 women, aged 45-70 years. Plasma cortisol levels were measured from blood samples collected every 20 min over 24 h. Urinary cortisol was analysed from 24-hour urine collections. Climacteric-related symptoms (vasomotor, sleep, depressive, anxiety, cognitive, sexual, menstrual, and somatic) were evaluated with the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ). Associations between cortisol variables (24-hour, night, day, maximum, minimum, morning baseline, cortisol awakening response (CAR), area under the curve, slope, and 24-hour urinary cortisol) and the symptoms were first examined with a correlation analysis. Then, the women were divided into two groups according to their climacteric symptomatology, and differences in cortisol variables between the groups were investigated. Diurnal cortisol curves by symptomatology were also analyzed visually.
   Results: In the correlation analysis, more frequent vasomotor symptoms were associated with a higher CAR (r(s) = 0.37, p = 0.039) and lower 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion (r(s)=-0.45, p = 0.012), and more frequent depressive symptoms were associated with a higher minimum cortisol level (r(s) = 0.33, p = 0.0498). When the women were divided into two groups, women with more frequent vasomotor (p = 0.012) or somatic symptoms (p = 0.021) had a lower 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion than less symptomatic women.
   Conclusions: Although previous studies have reported associations between climacteric-related symptoms and cortisol secretion, these two factors were not substantially interrelated in our study.

TI  - Management of the Perimenopause
T2  - CLINICAL OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, represents a period of time during which newly arising symptoms can present complex management decisions for providers. Many women present to care with complaints of hot flashes, vaginal and sexual changes, altered mood and sleep, and changing bleeding patterns. The effect of these symptoms on quality of life, even before a woman enters menopause, can be significant. The appropriate evaluation and evidence-based management of women in this transition is reviewed in this article. Two case vignettes are used to highlight certain evaluation and treatment challenges.

TI  - Vasomotor and Related Menopause Symptoms
T2  - CLINICAL OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Vasomotor symptoms are the most common manifestation of the menopause transition and postmenopausal phases of reproductive life. They interfere not only in quality of life, but also contribute to sleep and mood disturbances that potentially compromise home and work effectiveness. Treatment options include hormone therapy (HT), nonhormonal prescription drugs, mind body and behavior therapies, and over-the-counter preparations. Evidence confirms that HT is the most effective option. The initial reticence to prescribe HT immediately following publication of the Women's Health Initiative has been replaced by clear guidelines for confidently identifying women for whom this therapy will be safe.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of Tripterygium wilfordii hook F for chronic urticaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The first-line agents comprising antihistamines for chronic urticaria, are not completely satisfactory. Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF), a Chinese herb, has been developed into several Tripterygium agents and have definite effects on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In chronic urticaria, however, their values of practical application remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TwHF in patients with chronic urticaria.
   Methods: Several databases were systematically searched including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China Network Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wan Fang Database, and Chinese Biomedicine. Randomized controlled trials comparing antihistamines with TwHF or Tripterygium agents in combination with antihistamines were included. Revman5.3 was utilized to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091595.
   Results: Twenty-one trials with 2565 participants were included in this analysis. Meta-analysis showed that, when antihistamines were combined with TwHF and Tripterygium agents, the curative effect in cases of chronic urticaria was superior to that of antihistamines alone (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.33-1.46). The incidence rates of gastrointestinal disorder (RR: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.70-4.99) and menstrual disorder (RR: 6.00; 95% CI: 1.79-20.13) in drug combination groups were higher than those in controls, while other adverse events were similar between the two groups. After treatment, Dermatology Life Quality Index (RR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.09-1.40), quality of sleep (RR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.07-2.12), and daily activity (RR: 1.49;95% CI: 1.25-1.78) were all improved. Furthermore, drug combination groups demonstrated less relapse (RR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.25-0.45).
   Conclusions: TwHF and Tripterygium agents, in combination with antihistamines, appear to be more effective than antihistamines alone. Nevertheless, adverse events cannot be ignored. Large sample, multi-center, high-quality clinical studies are needed to verify the exact effects and safety of TwHF and Tripterygium agents in treatment of chronic urticaria.

TI  - Maturational Changes of Delta Waves in Monozygotic and Dizygotic Infant Twins
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - AIMS : To compare developmental changes of delta 1 (0.5-2.0 Hz) and delta 2 (2.25-3.75 Hz) power spectra between healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs and among MZ and DZ twin groups during active/REM (AS/REM) and quiet/NREM (QS/NREM) sleep stages at 38th, 46th, and 52nd weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS : Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were analyzed using fast Fourier transforms. Differences in the developmental changes of delta power within twin pairs and between twin groups were estimated by calculating mean absolute differences of relative spectral values in delta 1 (0.5-2 Hz) and delta 2 (2.25-3.75 Hz) frequencies.
   RESULTS : A review of electrodes showed that relative delta 1 power decreased, whereas delta 2 power increased from 38th toward 52nd week of PMA regardless of zygosity, sleep stages, and electrode position. Twin groups did not significantly differ (P>.05) in within-pair MZ and DZ similarity for delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra; similarity between MZ twin partners for delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra was as high as that of DZ twin partners on each electrode position, sleep stage, and period of measurement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Developmental changes of delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra occurred equally in MZ and DZ twin groups during AS and QS sleep stages at 38th, 46th, and 52th PMA. The rhythm of EEG maturation evidenced by the maturation of delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra was not dependent on zygosity.

TI  - The effect of sleep hygiene education and relaxation exercises on insomnia among postmenopausal women: A randomized clinical trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING PRACTICE
AB  - Aim: This study used a randomized controlled trial model to determine the effect of progressive relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene training given to postmenopausal women with insomnia.
   Methods: A total of 161 postmenopausal women with insomnia were recruited and randomly assigned to experimental (n = 81) and control (n = 80) groups. The experimental group received sleep hygiene and progressive relaxation exercise training, but the control group only received routine health care. The relaxation exercise training was repeated once a week for 8 weeks. The study determined the effect of the intervention on insomnia symptoms. The data were collected between 15 June and 15 September 2015 and evaluated using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, chi-squared test, and Cronbach alpha analysis.
   Results: The mean (SD) score of the experimental group on the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale was 14.03 (3.4) pretest and 7.09 (3.4) posttest. The difference between the pretest and posttest scores was statistically significant (P < .001), as was the difference between the rates of insomnia symptoms between the groups posttest (P < .001).
   Conclusion: The findings of study suggest that nurses teaching progressive relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene would benefit postmenopausal women who suffer from insomnia.

TI  - Increased vulnerability to attentional failure during acute sleep deprivation in women depends on menstrual phase
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: To investigate sex differences in the effect of sleep deprivation on performance, accounting for menstrual phase in women.
   Methods: We examined alertness data from 124 healthy women and men (40 women, 84 men; aged 18-30 years) who maintained wakefulness for at least 30 hr in a laboratory setting using a constant routine protocol. Objective alertness was assessed every 2 hr using a 10 min psychomotor vigilance task. Subjective alertness was assessed every hour via the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale.
   Results: Women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle demonstrated the poorest level of performance. This poor performance was most pronounced at times corresponding to the typical sleep episode, demonstrating a window of vulnerability at night during this menstrual phase. At 24 hr awake, over 60 per cent of their responses were lapses of >500 ms and over one-third of their responses were longer lapses of at least 3 s in duration. Women in the luteal phase, however, were relatively protected from alertness failure, performing similar or better than both follicular-phase women and men.
   Conclusions: These results have important implications for education and intervention programs for shift workers, specifically during times of vulnerability to attentional failure that increase risk of injury.

TI  - Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism rapidly improves vasomotor symptoms with sustained duration of action
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective:Seventy percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms, which can be highly disruptive and persist for years. Hormone therapy and other treatments have variable efficacy and/or side effects. Neurokinin B signaling increases in response to estrogen deficiency and has been implicated in hot flash (HF) etiology. We recently reported that a neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) antagonist reduces HF in postmenopausal women after 4 weeks of treatment. In this article we report novel data from that study, which shows the detailed time course of this effect.Methods:Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, crossover trial of an oral NK3R antagonist (MLE4901) for vasomotor symptoms in women aged 40 to 62 years, experiencing 7HF/24hours some of which were reported as bothersome or severe (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02668185). Thirty-seven women were randomized and included in an intention-to-treat analysis. To ascertain the therapeutic profile of MLE4901, a post hoc time course analysis was completed.Results:By day 3 of treatment with MLE4901, HF frequency reduced by 72% (95% CI, -81.3 to -63.3%) compared with baseline (51 percentage point reduction compared with placebo, P<0.0001); this effect size persisted throughout the 4-week dosing period. HF severity reduced by 38% compared with baseline by day 3 (95% CI, -46.1 to -29.1%) (P<0.0001 compared with placebo), bother by 39% (95% CI, -47.5 to -30.1%) (P<0.0001 compared with placebo), and interference by 61% (95% CI, -79.1 to -43.0%) (P=0.0006 compared with placebo); all continued to improve throughout the 4-week dosing period (to -44%, -50%, and -70%, respectively by day 28, all P<0.0001 compared with placebo).Conclusions:NK3R antagonism rapidly relieves vasomotor symptoms without the need for estrogen exposure.

TI  - Climacteric-related symptoms in menopause transition and beyond: a prospective 19-year follow-up study on previously hysterectomized women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective:Only a few extended follow-up studies have investigated the natural progress of climacteric-related symptoms. The results have been conflicting. Thus, our aim was to evaluate, through a 19-year longitudinal study, whether these symptoms decrease or disappear as time elapses after menopause.Methods:Our study was a prospective follow-up survey of 65 hysterectomized peri or postmenopausal women. The women were interviewed at the baseline, and at 6 and 19 years thereafter. Changes in various climacteric-related symptoms were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance with time as the independent variable. The analyses were adjusted for baseline age, body mass index, employment, and use of hormone therapy. Climacteric-related symptoms were evaluated with the Women's Health Questionnaire, of which we included seven symptom domains (vasomotor, sleep, depressive, anxiety/fears, cognitive, sexual, and somatic).Results:Vasomotor symptoms decreased remarkably during the follow-up period. In addition, a statistically significant decrease was found in sleep problems and cognitive difficulties. However, the decrease was minor, and thus probably clinically insignificant.Conclusions:The only symptom with notable decrease was vasomotor symptoms. The etiology of other symptoms, commonly connected to menopause transition, is probably multifactorial and not substantially dependent on the climacteric.

TI  - Involvement of the luteinizing hormone surge in the regulation of ovary and oviduct clock gene expression in mice
T2  - GENES TO CELLS
AB  - Circadian dysfunction perturbs the female reproductive cycle. In particular, mice lacking the clock gene Bmal1 show severe infertility, implying that BMAL1 plays roles in ovulation and luteinization. Here, we examined temporal changes in clock gene expression in the ovary and oviduct before and during gonadotropin-induced follicular growth, ovulation, and luteinization in sexually immature mice. While the oviduct did not show a drastic change in clock gene expression, Bmal1 expression in the ovary was higher than that in control mice during the period from 4 to 16 hr after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. Bmal1 expression reached a maximum at 16 hr after hCG administration, when follicle luteinization occurred. In an interesting manner, administration of hCG to ex vivo-cultured oviduct triggered a shorter circadian period and inevitably resulted in phase advance. Together, our present data suggest that LH surge induces continuous expression of BMAL1 in the mouse ovary and modulates circadian phase in the mouse oviduct.

TI  - Preoperative obstructive sleep apnea screening in gynecologic oncology patients
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with a gynecologic cancer tend to be older, obese, and postmenopausal, characteristics that are associated with an increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. However, there is limited investigation regarding the condition's prevalence in this population or its impact on postoperative outcomes. In other surgical populations, patients with obstructive sleep apnea have been observed to be at increased risk for adverse postoperative events.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among gynecologic oncology patients undergoing elective surgery and to investigate for a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative outcomes.
   STUDY DESIGN: Patients referred to an academic gynecologic oncology practice were approached for enrollment in this prospective, observational study. Patients were considered eligible for study enrollment if they were scheduled for a nonemergent inpatient surgery and could provide informed consent. Enrolled patients were evaluated for a preexisting diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Those without a prior diagnosis were screened using the validated, 4-item STOP questionnaire (ie, Snore loudly, daytime Tiredness, Observed apnea, elevated blood Pressure). All patients who screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea were referred for polysomnography. The primary outcome was the prevalence of women with obstructive sleep apnea or those who screened at high risk for the condition. Secondary outcomes examined the correlation between body mass index (kg/m(2)) with obstructive sleep apnea and assessed for a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative outcomes.
   RESULTS: Over a 22-month accrual period, 383 eligible patients were consecutively approached to participate in the study. A cohort of 260 patients were enrolled. A total of 33/260 patients (13%) were identified as having a previous diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. An additional 66/260 (25%) screened at risk for the condition using the STOP questionnaire. Of the patients who screened positive, 8/66 (12%) completed polysomnography, all of whom (8/8 [100%]) were found to have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea or screening at risk for the condition increased as body mass index increased (P <.001). Women with untreated obstructive sleep apnea and those who screened at risk for the condition were found to have an increased risk for postoperative hypoxemia (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.7; P =.011) and delayed return of bowel function (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.5; P =.009).
   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea or screening at risk for the condition is high among women presenting for surgery with a gynecologic oncologist. Providers should consider evaluating a patient's risk for obstructive sleep apnea in the preoperative setting, especially when risk factors for the condition are present.

TI  - Quality of life, problems, and needs of disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years after diagnosis
T2  - QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH
AB  - After cancer treatment, it is desirable to maintain or regain a high quality of life (QoL) and the ability to accomplish everyday tasks well. Therefore, we substantiated the scarce knowledge regarding long-term QoL after breast cancer, burdensome problems, and unmet needs for more support.
   Disease-free breast cancer survivors (n = 190) who had participated in two randomized controlled exercise trials during primary treatment were followed up to 5 years post-diagnosis. QoL-related functions and symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23), health problems, and support needs were assessed. EORTC-QLQ scores were compared with age-matched normative values from the general population in Germany.
   QoL-related functions and symptoms in patients during cancer treatment were worse compared to healthy references, but largely improved over time. Yet, cognitive function and sleep were still significantly impaired at 5-year follow-up. Other common long-term problems included sexual issues (45% of survivors), hot flashes (38%), pain (34%), fatigue (24%), and polyneuropathy (21%). Regression analyses indicated fatigue having the strongest impact on global QoL. Support needs were expressed mainly for menopausal disorders (43%), physical performance (39%), sleep problems (38%), arthralgia (37%), cognitive problems (36%), weight problems (32%), and fatigue (31%).
   While QoL in disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years post-diagnosis was largely comparable to the general population on average, still many survivors suffered from adverse effects. There appears to be a need for ongoing screening and support regarding fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive problems, arthralgia/pain, menopausal/sexual symptoms, physical performance, and weight problems during and several years following breast cancer therapy.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of positional sleep apnea in the HypnoLaus population-based cohort
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objective/Background: To determine the prevalence of positional obstructive sleep apnea (POSA) and exclusive POSA (ePOSA) in the general population and to assess the factors independently associated with POSA and ePOSA according to gender and menopausal status.
   Patients/Methods: Participants of the population-based HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort underwent full polysomnography at home. POSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 5/h, and supine/nonsupine AHI ratio (sAHI/nsAHI) >= 2 (ePOSA when non-supine AHI was normalized).
   Results: In this study, 1719 subjects (40-85y.o. 46% men) with at least 30 min spent in both the supine and non-supine positions were included. OSA was present in 1224 subjects (71%) (AHI >5/H). POSA was present in 53% of all subjects, and in 75% of OSA subjects. ePOSA was present in 26% of all subjects and in 36% of OSA subjects. In multivariate analyses, lower AHI and lower BMI were both associated with POSA and ePOSA in males. In premenopausal females, no single factor was associated with POSA while a lower AHI and an Epworth sleepiness scale >10 were associated with ePOSA. In postmenopausal women, a lower BMI was associated with POSA and a lower AHI and a lower Mallampati score with ePOSA.
   Conclusions: In this large population-based study, we found that POSA is present in 53% of the middle-toolder age general population, and in 75% of OSA subjects. ePOSA was present in 36% of OSA subjects, suggesting that a large proportion of them could be treated with positional therapy. AHI and BMI were differently associated with POSA in men, and pre or post-menopausal women. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determinants of Slow-Wave Activity in Overweight and Obese Adults: Roles of Sex, Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Testosterone Levels
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Background: Slow-wave activity (SWA) in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, obtained by spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram, is a marker of the depth or intensity of NREM sleep. Higher levels of SWA are associated with lower arousability during NREM sleep and protect against sleep fragmentation. Multiple studies have documented that SWA levels are higher in lean women, compared to age-matched lean men, but whether these differences persist in obese subjects is unclear. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition associated with obesity, is more prevalent in men than in women. Sex differences in SWA could therefore be one of the factors predisposing men to OSA. Furthermore, we hypothesized that higher levels of testosterone may be associated with lower levels of SWA.
   Objective: The aim of the current study was to identify sex differences in the determinants of SWA in young and middle-aged overweight and obese adults.
   Methods: We enrolled 101 overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants from the community (44 men, 57 women) in this cross-sectional study. Participants underwent an overnight in-laboratory polysomnogram. The recordings were submitted to sleep staging and spectral analysis. Sex differences and the potential contribution of testosterone levels were evaluated after adjusting for age, body mass index and race/ethnicity.
   Results: OSA was present in 66% of men and in 44% of women. After adjustment for differences in age, race/ethnicity and BMI, the odds ratio for OSA in men vs. women was 3.17 (95% CI 1.14-9.43, p = 0.027). There was a graded inverse relationship between the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and SWA in men (beta = -0.21, p = 0.018) but not in women (beta = 0.10, p = 0.207). In a multivariate regression model, higher testosterone levels were independently associated with lower SWA in men after controlling for age, race/ethnicity and apnea-hypopnea index (beta = -0.56, p = 0.025).
   Conclusion: Increasing severity of OSA was associated with significant decrease in sleep intensity in men but not in women. Higher testosterone levels were associated with lower sleep intensity in men. Men with higher testosterone levels may therefore have lower arousal thresholds and higher ventilatory instability in NREM sleep, and be at greater risk of OSA.

TI  - The Association between Daytime Napping Characteristics and Bone Mineral Density in Elderly Thai Women without Osteoporosis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Low bone mass is more prevalent with increasing age. Studies have found associations between sleep duration, sleep quality and obstructive sleep apnea and bone mineral density (BMD). However, less is known about the relationship between daytime napping and BMD. We aimed to investigate the association between daytime napping and BMD in elderly Thai women. Demographic data, lifestyle information and sleep characteristics were obtained by interviewing 387 elderly women. Weight and height were measured. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured by radioimmunoassay. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Higher BMI and having type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were correlated with higher lumbar spine 2-4 (L2-4) BMD, while younger age, higher BMI and higher serum 25(OH)D level were correlated with higher femoral neck (FN) and total hip (TH) BMD. After adjusting for age, age at menopause, BMI, 25(OH)D level and T2DM, a higher frequency of weekly daytime napping was associated with lower FN and TH BMD but not at L2-4 BMD. Additionally, longer daytime napping duration was negatively associated with BMD at TH. In summary higher frequency and longer duration of daytime napping are associated with lower femoral BMD in elderly women. Mechanisms underlying these associations should be further explored.

TI  - Yoga and Quality of Life in Women with Primary Dysmenorrhea: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - IntroductionPrimary dysmenorrhea is a prevalent condition causing quality of life (QOL) reduction for many women, resulting from pain as well as parallel social and psychological distress. Yoga reduces pain and sympathetic reactivity, thus promoting QOL. This article reports a systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of yoga as a QOL improvement method for women with primary dysmenorrhea.
   MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines were used in preparation of this review. Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were screened through January 2017 using the keywords yoga, meditation, menstrual cycle, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and prostaglandins. English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies regarding yoga, primary dysmenorrhea, and QOL were eligible; all yoga styles were included. Two independent reviewers rated the methodological quality of each study selected for review using the Downs and Black checklist; possible scores ranged from 0 to 32. Ratings were established through consensus.
   ResultsThe search yielded a total of 378 articles, of which 14 (age range 13-45 years, N = 1409) met the criteria for final review: 8 RCTs and 6 quasi-experimental studies. Downs and Black ratings were predominantly moderate in quality with moderate risk of bias, ranging from 15 to 23 (RCTs) and 10 to 17 (quasi-experimental studies). Statistically significant improvements along most QOL domains, including physical pain, sleep, concentration, negative feelings, social relationships, work capacity, and overall QOL, were identified after a yoga intervention. Results indicate preliminary evidence for yoga as a safe and effective QOL improvement method for women with primary dysmenorrhea.
   DiscussionPractitioners may consider yoga for management of primary dysmenorrhea. However, future research using larger RCTs of high methodological quality is needed to ascertain the magnitude of yoga's clinical significance.

TI  - Impact of sleep characteristics and obesity on diabetes and hypertension across genders and menopausal status: the Nagahama study
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: The individual prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), short sleep duration, and obesity is high and increasing. The study aimed to investigate potential associations between SDB, objective sleep duration, obesity, diabetes and hypertension across genders, and the effect of pre-or post-menopausal status.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study evaluated 7051 community participants with wrist actigraphy for a week, and nocturnal oximetry 2 nights. SDB was assessed by 3 per cent oxygen desaturation index (ODI) corrected for sleep duration obtained from wrist actigraphy. Moderate-to-severe SDB was defined as ODI3% levels >= 15 per hour.
   Results: Both logODI3% and body mass index showed independent negative associations with sleep duration (beta = -0.16, p < 0.001 and beta = -0.07, p < 0.001, respectively). Moderate-to-severe SDB (men/premenopausal women/postmenopausal women; 23.7/1.5/9.5%, respectively) was associated with a higher risk of diabetes in premenopausal women (OR 28.1; 95% CI 6.35-124.6; p < 0.001) and postmenopausal women (OR 3.25; 95% CI 1.94-5.46; p < 0.001), but not in men (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.90-2.40; p = 0.119). Moderate-to-severe SDB was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in men (OR 3.11; 95% CI 2.23-4.33; p < 0.001), premenopausal women (OR 3.88; 95% CI 1.42-10.6; p = 0.008), and postmenopausal women (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.46-2.63; p < 0.001). Short sleep duration was not associated with diabetes or hypertension. The associations of obesity with diabetes or hypertension were indirectly mediated by SDB (24.0% and 21.5%, respectively), with possible sex differences emerging (men/women; 15.3/27.8% and 27.0/16.9%, respectively).
   Conclusions: Notwithstanding the cross-sectional design, SDB and obesity, but not short sleep duration, were independently associated with diabetes and hypertension, with gender and menopausal status-related differences in risk emerging.
   Statement of Significance
   Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), short sleep duration, and obesity may be associated with diabetes and systemic hypertension. However, the impact of gender and menopausal status remains virtually unexplored. This large community-based study showed that SDB and obesity were associated with shorter sleep duration, but only SDB and obesity were independently associated with diabetes and systemic hypertension and exhibited gender and menopause status-related differences in these outcomes. In addition, about 20 per cent of the effects of obesity on diabetes or systemic hypertension were indirectly mediated by SDB. Therefore, SDB and obesity but not short sleep duration may be independently associated with diabetes and systemic hypertension, with gender and menopausal status-related differences in risk emerging.

TI  - The importance of the circadian system & sleep for bone health
T2  - METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL
AB  - Adequate sleep timed appropriately during the circadian night is important for numerous biological processes and systems. New evidence suggests that both sleep timing and duration may be important for optimal bone health as well. This review examines the diurnal variation of bone turnover markers (BTMs) and the importance of circadian clock genes in regulating bone mass. In addition, this review explores the evidence for a link between shift work (and its associated disturbances in sleep duration/quality and circadian alignment) and alterations in bone metabolism and bone health. Finally, we review how commonly used medications and over-the-counter substances (e.g. caffeine, melatonin) complicate the relationship between sleep and circadian disorders and bone health.

TI  - Comparision of sleep patterns of postmenopausal against young women
T2  - RAWAL MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: To compare the sleep habits in postmenopausal against younger group of females. Cross sectional study.
   Methodology: This cross sectional study was conducted in Riphah International University Islamabad from March 2010 to 2011. Sixty females participated in the study, who were divided into two Groups: A comprising 30 young females (n=30) and Group B comprising postmenopausal females (n= 30). Both groups were selected by simple random technique. A questionnaire was designed for assessing their sleep habits and enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) technique was used to analyze serum estrogen levels. Students' t test was used for quantitative and chi square for qualitative data. A p < 0.05 or less was taken as significant.
   Results: Serum estrogen levels of postmenopausal females was significantly lower than the young females (p=0.000). Statistically significant difference was noted between the sleep habits of two groups. Postmenopausal females had lesser sleep duration (p=0.011), more frequent nocturnal arousals (p < 0,01), had morning awakening habit of rising without alarm (p=0.000) and earlier rising time in the morning (p=0.000), when compared to the young females.
   Conclusion: Steep pattern of females differs after menopause. This sleep pattern could be related to reduced serum estrogen levels observed in post-menopausal women. (Rawal Med J 201;43:452-455).

TI  - RESISTANCE EXERCISE TRAINING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN INTERVAL AEROBIC TRAINING IN REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE DURING SLEEP IN HYPERTENSIVE ELDERLY PATIENTS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
AB  - An appropriate fall in blood pressure (BP) during sleep is known to be related to a lower cardiovascular risk. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of different types of training on hypertensive elderly patients under treatment in terms of pressure variability assessed by the nocturnal decline in BP. Hypertensive elderly subjects under pharmacological treatment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 12 weeks of continuous aerobic training, interval aerobic training (IA), resistance training (R), or control (C). All subjects underwent ambulatory BP monitoring before and 24 hours after the last exercise session. The results were assessed using the mixed effects model. A greater nocturnal decline in diastolic BP compared with the wakefulness period was observed in R in comparison with C (11.0 +/- 4.1 vs. 6.0 +/- 5.7 mm Hg and p = 0.01) and with IA (11.0 +/- 4. vs. 6.5 +/- 5.1 mm Hg and p = 0.02). No fall in BP during a 24-hour period was observed in training groups compared with C, perhaps because the subjects were mostly nondippers, for whom the effect of training on BP is found to be lower. In conclusion, resistance training promoted a greater nocturnal fall in BP among hypertensive elderly subjects under treatment compared with IA subjects.

TI  - Association of 3111T/C Polymorphism of the Clock Gene with Circadian Rhythm of Melatonin in Menopausal Women with Insomnia
T2  - BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - We carried out a comparative analysis of circadian rhythms of melatonin secretion in Caucasian menopausal women with and without insomnia depending on the 3111T/C polymorphism of the Clock gene. Melatonin levels was measured in the saliva 4 times a day (06.00-07.00, 12.00-13.00, 18.00-19.00, and 23.00-00.00 h). Carriers of the TT genotype with insomnia demonstrated significantly higher level of melatonin in the early morning hours compared to the carriers of the minor allele C (12.60 +/- 7.58 and 8.98 +/- 8.62 pg/ml, respectively, p=0.023). In the control group, no statistically significant differences were revealed. The carriers of the TT genotype with sleep disorders have higher morning melatonin level compared to control group women (12.60 +/- 7.58 and 5.48 +/- 4.74 pg/ml, respectively, p=0.005) and low nocturnal melatonin level (6.42 +/- 4.97 and 12.52 +/- 10.40 pg/ml, respectively, p=0.039).

TI  - Type of Menopause, Age at Menopause, and Risk of Developing Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Postmenopausal Women
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Despite established sex differences and longstanding hypotheses of sex hormone influence in the etiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), we have found no studies that evaluated type of menopause and age at menopause, which affect postmenopausal hormonal milieu, in relation to OSA risk in women. We followed 50,473 postmenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study during 2002-2012 and 53,827 postmenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study II during 1995-2013, with 1,712 and 2,560 incident OSA diagnoses, respectively. Compared with natural menopause, the pooled hazard ratio for OSA was 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 1.38) for surgical menopause by hysterectomy/oophorectomy. The association remained the same after further accounting for age at menopause (hazard ratio = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.38). The risk associated with surgical menopause was higher among women who were not obese as well as among women who never used hormone therapy (P for interaction < 0.05). Earlier menopause was associated with higher OSA risk prior to adjustment for type of menopause (comparing those aged < 40 years versus those aged 50-54 years, hazard ratio = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.35; P for trend = 0.008), although no association was observed after the adjustment. Surgical as compared with natural menopause was independently associated with higher OSA risk in postmenopausal women. Our results provide additional evidence for a role for sex hormones, particularly abrupt hormonal changes, in modulating OSA risk.

TI  - Influence of Menopausal Status on the Symptom Experience of Women Before Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - CANCER NURSING
AB  - Background Breast cancer treatments can change women's hormonal milieu and alter their symptom experience. Little is known about associations between menopausal status and menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer before surgery.
   Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate for differences in occurrence, severity, and distress of symptoms between premenopausal and postmenopausal women before breast cancer surgery.
   Methods A total of 312 women with breast cancer completed the Menopausal Symptoms Scale, a self-report measure that evaluated the occurrence, severity, and distress of 46 common symptoms associated with menopause. Regression analyses were used to evaluate for between-group differences in these symptoms.
   Results Of the 312 patients enrolled, 37.4% (n = 116) were premenopausal, and 62.6% (n = 196) were postmenopausal. In the multivariate analysis that adjusted for 7 covariates, premenopausal patients reported higher occurrence rates for urinary frequency (P = .006) and reported lower occurrence rates for joint pain/stiffness (P = .011), difficulty falling asleep (P = .025), and vaginal dryness (P = .002). A significant interaction was found between age and menopausal status for hot flashes (P = .002), wake during the night (P = .025), and headache (P = .040).
   Conclusion Regardless of menopausal status, women reported high occurrence rates for several menopausal symptoms. Associations between some symptom occurrence rates and menopausal status depended on the patients' age.
   Implications for Practice As part of a preoperative symptom assessment, clinicians need to consider a woman's menopausal status and salient demographic and clinical characteristics. The identification of women with a higher symptom burden will assist with more effective management.

TI  - Sleep in Women Across the Life Span
T2  - CHEST
AB  - There are many ways in which women experience sleep differently from men. Women contending with distinct sleep challenges respond differently to sleep disorders, as well as sleep deprivation and deficiency, and face particular health outcomes as a result of poor sleep. Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions. Moreover, studies indicate that during times of hormonal change, women are at an increased risk for sleep disturbances such as poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, as well as sleep disorders such as OSA, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. This article reviews sleep changes in female subjects from neonatal life to menopause.

TI  - Effects of losartan and allopurinol on cardiorespiratory regulation in obstructive sleep apnoea
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - New Findings What is the central question of this study? In sleep apnoea, a putative link between intermittent hypoxia and hypertension is the generation of oxygen radicals by angiotensinII and xanthine oxidase within the chemoreflex arc and vasculature. We tested whether chemoreflex control of sympathetic outflow, hypoxic vasodilatation and blood pressure are altered by angiotensin blockade (losartan) and/or xanthine oxidase inhibition (allopurinol).
   What is the main finding and its importance? Both drugs lowered blood pressure without altering sympathetic outflow, reducing chemoreflex sensitivity or enhancing hypoxic vasodilatation. Losartan and allopurinol are effective therapies for achieving blood pressure control in sleep apnoea.
   AbstractChemoreflex sensitization produced by chronic intermittent hypoxia in rats is attenuated by angiotensinII type1 receptor (AT(1)R) blockade. Both AT(1)R blockade and xanthine oxidase inhibition ameliorate chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that treatment with losartan and allopurinol would reduce chemoreflex sensitivity and improve hypoxic vasodilatation in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. Eighty-six hypertensive patients with apnoea-hypopnoea index 25eventsh(-1) and no other cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal or metabolic disease were randomly assigned to receive allopurinol, losartan or placebo for 6weeks. Treatment with other medications and/or continuous positive airway pressure remained unchanged. Tests of chemoreflex sensitivity and hypoxic vasodilatation were performed during wakefulness before and after treatment. Ventilation (pneumotachography), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography), heart rate (electrocardiography), arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), blood pressure (sphygmomanometry), forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) and cerebral flow velocity (transcranial Doppler ultrasound) were measured during eupnoeic breathing and graded reductions in inspired O-2 tension. Losartan and allopurinol lowered arterial pressure measured during eupnoeic breathing and exposure to acute hypoxia. Neither drug altered the slopes of ventilatory, sympathetic or cardiovascular responses to acute hypoxia. We conclude that losartan and allopurinol are viable pharmacotherapeutic adjuncts for achieving blood pressure control in hypertensive obstructive sleep apnoea patients, even those who are adequately treated with continuous positive airway pressure.

TI  - Change in longitudinal trends in sleep quality and duration following breast cancer diagnosis: results from the Women's Health Initiative
T2  - NPJ BREAST CANCER
AB  - Breast cancer survivors frequently report sleep problems, but little research has studied sleep patterns longitudinally. We examined trends in sleep quality and duration up to 15 years before and 20 years after a diagnosis of breast cancer, over time among postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). We included 12,098 participants who developed invasive breast cancer after study enrollment. A linear mixed-effects model was used to determine whether the time trend in sleep quality, as measured by the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS), a measure of perceived insomnia symptoms from the past 4 weeks, changed following a cancer diagnosis. To examine sleep duration, we fit a logistic regression model with random effects for both short (<6 h) and long (>= 9 h) sleep. In addition, we studied the association between depressive symptoms and changes in WHIIRS and sleep duration. There was a significantly slower increase in the trend of WHIIRS after diagnosis (beta= 0.06; p = 0.03), but there were non-significant increases in the trend of the probability of short or long sleep after diagnosis. The probability of depressive symptoms significantly decreased, though the decrease was more pronounced after diagnosis (p < 0.01). Trends in WHIIRS worsened at a relatively slower rate following diagnosis and lower depression rates may explain the slower worsening in WHIIRS. Our findings suggest that over a long period of time, breast cancer diagnosis does not adversely affect sleep quality and duration in postmenopausal women compared to sleep pre-diagnosis, yet both sleep quality and duration continue to worsen over time.

TI  - Development and validation of a new rating scale for perimenopausal depression -the Meno-D
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The menopause transition is a time when women experience an increased risk for new onset depression, as well as relapse of depression. While there are overlapping symptoms between major depression and depression during menopause, differences suggest 'perimenopausal depression' may be a unique subtype of depression associated with characteristic symptoms. There is currently no validated scale designed to measure perimenopausal depression. The aim of the current study was to develop and validate the 'Meno-D', a self-reporting or clinician rated questionnaire, designed to rate the severity of symptoms of perimenopausal depression. The development phase of the Meno-D involved literature review, clinical observation, and focus groups. A 12-item questionnaire was developed and clinically reviewed for face validity for content. The Meno-D was administered to women experiencing symptoms of perimenopausal depression as part of a larger baseline assessment battery. Validation involved confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The development of the Meno-D resulted in 12 items. A total of 93 participants with perimenopausal depression were involved in the baseline assessments, 82 completed the Meno-D. Factor analysis identified five subscales of the Meno-D "somatic; cognitive; self; sleep; sexual" with high-internal consistency; discriminant validity and a good construct and convergent validity. The Meno-D provides a unique tool for clinicians and researchers to measure the presence of perimenopausal depression.

TI  - Effect of Gender on Chronic Intermittent Hypoxic Fosb Expression in Cardiorespiratory-Related Brain Structures in Mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - We aimed to delineate sex-based differences in neuroplasticity that may be associated with previously reported sex-based differences in physiological alterations caused by repetitive succession of hypoxemia-reoxygenation encountered during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We examined long-term changes in the activity of brainstem and diencephalic cardiorespiratory neuronal populations induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) in male and female mice by analyzing Fosb expression. Whereas the overall baseline and CIH-induced Fosb expression in females was higher than in males, possibly reflecting different neuroplastic dynamics, in contrast, structures responded to CIH by Fosb upregulation in males only. There was a sex-based difference at the level of the rostral ventrolateral reticular nucleus of the medulla, with an increase in the number of FOSB/Delta FOSB-positive cells induced by CIH in males but not females. This structure contains neurons that generate the sympathetic tone and which are involved in CIH-induced sustained hypertension during waking hours. We suggest that the sex-based difference in neuroplasticity of this structure contributes to the reported sex-based difference in CIH-induced hypertension. Moreover, we highlighted a sex-based dimorphic phenomenon in serotoninergic systems induced by CIH, with increased serotoninergic immunoreactivity in the hypoglossal nucleus and a decreased number of serotoninergic cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus in male but not female mice. We suggest that this dimorphism in the neuroplasticity of serotoninergic systems predisposes males to a greater alteration of neuronal control of the upper respiratory tract associated with the greater collapsibility of upper airways described in male OSA subjects.

TI  - Acupuncture for perimenopausal insomnia A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Perimenopausal insomnia (PI) is one of the most common complaints in women. Acupuncture is used to treat PI increasingly considering its less side effect. The subject of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for PI.
   Methods: All the randomized controlled trials(RCT) literatures of acupuncture for PI will be searched in the databases of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, Springer, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan fang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and other available resources using the subject terms of "acupuncture" and "perimenopausal insomnia" and their synonyms. The languages are limited as English and Chinese. Non-RCT literatures will be screened and relative information will be extracted. Sleep quality values is considered as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include biochemical indicators, such as hormone levels, side effects caused by acupuncture, total scores on the insomnia severity index and traditional Chinese medicine symptom changes.
   Results: This systematic review study will provide an evidence of acupuncture for PI.
   Conclusion: The study will give an explicit evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of acupuncture for PI.

TI  - What's in a name: are menopausal "hot flashes" a symptom of menopause or a manifestation of neurovascular dysregulation?
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Hot flashes have typically been classified as "symptoms of menopause" that should be tolerated or treated until they resolve. However, mounting evidence points to hot flashes as a manifestation of one or several underlying pathophysiological processes. Associations exist between the presence, timing of onset, severity, and duration of hot flashes, and the risk of several neurological (affecting sleep, mood, and cognition) and cardiovascular conditions. In addition, four consistent patterns of vasomotor disturbances have been identified across different countries, making it unlikely that these patterns are solely explained by socioeconomic or cultural factors. The changing hormonal environment of menopause may unmask differences in the autonomic neurovascular control mechanisms that put an individual woman at risk for chronic conditions of aging. These differences may have a genetic basis or may be acquired across the life span and are consistent with the variability of the clinical manifestations of aging observed in women after bilateral oophorectomy. It is time to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the four patterns of vasomotor symptoms more closely, and to shift from describing hot flashes as symptoms to be tolerated to manifestations of an underlying autonomic neurovascular dysregulation that need to be addressed.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in woman: Knowing its specificities for a better management
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases ore the first cause of death in women. Their frequency is underestimated because of their atypical feminine clinical presentation. The pathway "heart, arteries and women", initiated at Lille's hospital center in 2013, was designed to improve pluridisciplinar approaches for women. Thus, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), known as a metabolic risk factor, was studied in several works. In post-menopausal women with cardiovascular risk, frequency of OSA seems underestimated. Clinical presentation of OSA in feminine patients con be misleading, and its screening seems essential, in light of its major cardiovascular impact.

TI  - A double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel study of pollen pistil extract (Serelys) on women reporting irritability as predominant PMS symptom
T2  - JOURNAL OF HERBAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: A pollen pistil extract Serelys (formerly Femal) was reported earlier to alleviate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), including sleep disturbances. This paper focuses on previously unpublished effects of the same extract on major PMS symptoms.
   Methods: 101 women, diagnosed with PMS, were randomly treated with either placebo (51) or Serelys (50) for four (4) months. 50 of the study participants reported irritability as their predominant PMS symptom, while 34 women indicated dysphoria as their main symptom. The remaining volunteers specified several different symptoms as their major concern. Premenstrual tension observer evaluation was performed according to Steiner and the women also gave their personal evaluation scores (Visual Analogue Scale: VAS) of different PMS symptoms including irritability, tender breasts, bloating, retention of water, mood swings, raw luteal phase score and headaches.
   Results: There were significant reductions in Steiner observer evaluation symptom scores in both groups but no differences comparing groups. In the patients' self-evaluation there was a significant reduction in headache and water retention as a result of Serelys treatment. When comparing observer-generated Steiner and self-reported VAS symptom scores for patients reporting irritability as their main PMS symptom there was a significant 47% and 50% symptom reduction with Serelys treatment, which was absent in placebo (p < 0.027 and p < 0.001, respectively, comparing groups). By contrast, the dysphoria subset of patients showed no differences when comparing treatment and placebo groups.
   Conclusion: In patients reporting irritability as their most predominant PMS symptom, Serelys significantly lowered the PMS-indicators, as reflected in both observer and patieng self-evaluation symptoms' scores.

TI  - Premenstrual syndrome and sleep disturbances: Results from the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB  - The aim of this study is to compare sleep characteristics between women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and a control group. The data were extracted from an epidemiologic survey conducted in Sao Paulo (EPISONO), Brazil, which used subjective assessments and objective polysomnography records to analyze subjects' sleep pattern. Subjective questionnaires used in this study were Women's Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth sleepiness scale, Insomnia Severity Index and the general sleep questionnaire. The presence of PMS was obtained by a direct question in the Women's Questionnaire. The survey included 230 women, of whom 72.6% reported PMS. The PMS group had poorer sleep quality, a higher perception of unrefreshing sleep and more subthreshold insomnia. Participants with PMS had an increased total sleep time recorded by polysomnography and a lower saturation of peripheral oxygen. It is still unkown the mechanism behind PMS and the sleep-wake cycle. In the other hand, it is clear that PMS play a role in sleep, since women with this disorder has a poor quality of sleep and it is not refreshing. Better knowledge about this syndrome and its outcomes can help to improve their well-being and develop more precise therapeutic approaches.

TI  - The relationship between health-promoting lifestyle and sleep quality in postmenopausal women
T2  - BIOMEDICINE-TAIWAN
AB  - Background: Menopausal women are widely reported to have poor sleep quality and sleep problems. It is not clear whether increases in sleep disturbance are brought about by hormone changes associated with menopause or due to psychosocial and physical problems.
   Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 600 menopausal women aged between 40 and 60 without any known severe illnesses in the city of Qaen, Iran, from April 2015 to May 2016. Data were collected by Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
   Main outcome measures: This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between health-promoting lifestyle and sleep quality in Iranian postmenopausal women. Data were analyzed using an independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square, Spearman and univariate logistic regression.
   Result: The univariate logistic regression suggested that the physical activity dimension of lifestyle (OR = 1.095, 95% CI: 1.035-1.158, P < 0.006), non-smoking status (OR = 0.549, 95% CI: 0.331-0.912, P < 0.021) and occupation (women who were farmer compared with housewives) (OR = 0.239, 95% CI (0.074-0.775), P < 0.017) were associated with sleep quality.
   Conclusion: Postmenopausal women in this study were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was associated with low levels of physical activity, smoking and being a housewife compared to being a farmer. Therefore, there is an essential need to educate women about health-promoting behaviors including daily physical activity and avoiding smoking which are associated with quality of sleep.

TI  - Sleep after intranasal progesterone vs. zolpidem and placebo in postmenopausal women - A randomized, double-blind cross over study
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Context The loss of progesterone during menopause is linked to sleep complaints of the affected women. Previously we demonstrated sleep promoting effects of oral progesterone replacement in postmenopausal women. The oral administration of progesterone, however, is compromised by individual differences in bioavailability and metabolism of the steroid.
   Objective: We compared the sleep-endocrine effects after intranasal progesterone (MPP22), zolpidem and placebo in healthy postmenopausal women.
   Design: This was a randomized double-blind cross-over study.
   Setting: German monocentric study
   Interventions: Subjects received in randomized order four treatments, 2 doses of intranasal progesterone (4.5 mg and 9 mg of MPP22), 10 mg of zolpidem and placebo.
   Outcome measures: Main outcome were conventional and quantitative sleep-EEG variables. Secondary outcomes were the subjective sleep variables and the sleep related concentrations of cortisol, growth hormone (GH), melatonin and progesterone.
   Results: Sleep promoting effects were found after the higher dosage of MPP22 and after zolpidem. Zolpidem prompted benzodiazepine-like effects on quantitative sleep EEG as expected, whereas no such changes were found after the two dosages of MP22. Nocturnal progesterone levels increased after 9.0 mg MPP22. No other changes of hormone secretion were found.
   Conclusions: Our study shows sleep promoting effects after intranasal progesterone. The spectral signature of intranasal progesterone did not resemble the sleep-EEG alterations induced by GABA active compounds. Progesterone levels were elevated after 9.0 mg MPP22. No other endocrine effects were observed.

TI  - Influence of side-effects on early therapy persistence with letrozole in post-menopausal patients with early breast cancer: Results of the prospective EvAluate-TM study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Background: Endocrine treatment (ET) with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is the treatment of choice in post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer (EBC). However, adverse events (AEs) often lead to treatment discontinuation. This analysis aimed to identify side-effects that lead to patients failing to persist with letrozole treatment.
   Patients and methods: Post-menopausal hormone receptor-positive EBC patients starting ET with letrozole were enroled in EvAluate-TM, a non-interventional study. Information regarding treatment compliance and persistence was gathered in months 6 and 12. Persistence was defined as the time from 30 d after the start to the end of treatment. The influence on persistence of musculoskeletal syndrome, menopausal disorder, sleep disorder and other AEs within the first 30 d was analysed using Cox regression analyses.
   Results: Among 3887 patients analysed, the persistence rate after 12 months was > 85%. In all, 568 patients (14.6%) discontinued the treatment, 358 of whom (63.0%) did so only because of side-effects. The main AEs influencing persistence were musculoskeletal symptoms (hazard ratio [HR] 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-3.42), sleep disorders (HR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.41-2.70) and other AEs (HR 2.03; 95% CI, 1.51-2.73). Menopausal disorder was not associated with non-persistence (HR 1.17; 95% CI, 0.74-1.84).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that side-effects of AIs such as musculoskeletal syndrome and sleep disorder lead to ET discontinuation within the first treatment year in significant numbers of EBC patients. Compliance programmes adapted for subgroups that are at risk for early non-persistence might help to ensure the recommended therapy duration.

TI  - Sleep duration, body composition, dietary profile and eating behaviours among children and adolescents: a comparison between Portuguese acrobatic gymnasts
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Sleep, body composition and dietary intake are crucial for athletes' health and performance but have never been investigated in acrobatic gymnasts. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate sleep, body composition, dietary intake and eating behaviours of acrobatic gymnasts. Using a cross-sectional study, 82 Portuguese acrobatic gymnasts (12.8 +/- 3.1 years, 61 females and 21 males) were evaluated during the competitive period to collect training data, sleep duration, body composition, dietary intake and eating behaviours before, during and after practices. Most of the gymnasts (91.5%) slept less than 8 h/night. Female adolescents slept significantly less on weekdays than female children (P = 0.024). Female adolescents' mean body mass was below the normal and 60.0% showed menstrual irregularities; 4.9% of females bases were overweight and 2.4% obese. Male adolescents slept significantly less on weekdays than male children (P = 0.001); significant differences were shown for fat-free mass (P = 0.014); however, 3.7% were overweight. All daily energy and macronutrient intakes were significantly different according to age and gender, with exception for fibre and energy intake in females (P = 0.057 and P = 0.052, respectively), and for protein in males (P = 0.068). Female and male adolescents demonstrated significant lower energy availability (32.8 +/- 9.4 kcal/kg FFM/day and 45.1 +/- 14.7 kcal/kg FFM/day) than children (45.8 +/- 8.7 kcal/kg FFM/day and 53.8 +/- 9.1 kcal/kg FFM/day), respectively. Significant low intakes of important vitamins and minerals were reported. Most of the participants did not eat or drink during or immediately after training sessions.

TI  - Drug Therapy in Obstructive Sleep Apnea
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE CLINICS
AB  - There are several reasons to develop a pharmacologic remedy in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); but so far, there is no generally effective drug available. Previous attempts to find a drug in OSA therapy were serendipity driven in small pilot trials. There is a growing literature on phenotyping pathophysiologic mechanisms of OSA that may be exploited in strategic drug development programs. This article addresses potential pitfalls encountered in previous studies and highlights several drug candidates under development in the field.

TI  - The effect of resistance exercise on sleep: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS
AB  - Impaired sleep quality and quantity are associated with future morbidity and mortality. Exercise may be an effective non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep, however, little is known on the effect of resistance exercise. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the acute and chronic effects of resistance exercise on sleep quantity and quality. Thirteen studies were included. Chronic resistance exercise improves all aspects of sleep, with the greatest benefit for sleep quality. These benefits of isolated resistance exercise are attenuated when resistance exercise is combined with aerobic exercise and compared to aerobic exercise alone. However, the acute effects of resistance exercise on sleep remain poorly studied and inconsistent. In addition to the sleep benefits, resistance exercise training improves anxiety and depression. These results suggest that resistance exercise may be an effective intervention to improve sleep quality. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of acute resistance exercise on sleep, the physiological mechanisms underlying changes in sleep, the changes in sleep architecture with chronic resistance exercise, as well its efficacy in clinical cohorts who commonly experience sleep disturbance. Future studies should also examine time-of-day and dose eresponse effects to determine the optimal exercise prescription for sleep benefits. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Automated EEG sleep staging in the term-age baby using a generative modelling approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Objective. We develop a method for automated four-state sleep classification of preterm and term-born babies at term-age of 38-40 weeks postmenstrual age (the age since the last menstrual cycle of the mother) using multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. At this critical age, EEG differentiates from broader quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) stages to four, more complex states, and the quality and timing of this differentiation is indicative of the level of brain development. However, existing methods for automated sleep classification remain focussed only on QS and AS sleep classification. Approach. EEG features were calculated from 16 EEG recordings, in 30 s epochs, and personalized feature scaling used to correct for some of the inter-recording variability, by standardizing each recording's feature data using its mean and standard deviation. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) were trained, with the HMM incorporating knowledge of the sleep state transition probabilities. Performance of the GMM and HMM (with and without scaling) were compared, and Cohen's kappa agreement calculated between the estimates and clinicians' visual labels. Main results. For four-state classification, the HMM proved superior to the GMM. With the inclusion of personalized feature scaling, mean kappa (+/- standard deviation) was 0.62 (+/- 0.16) compared to the GMM value of 0.55 (+/- 0.15). Without feature scaling, kappas for the HMM and GMM dropped to 0.56 (+/- 0.18) and 0.51 (+/- 0.15), respectively. Significance. This is the first study to present a successful method for the automated staging of four states in term-age sleep using multichannel EEG. Results suggested a benefit in incorporating transition information using an HMM, and correcting for inter-recording variability through personalized feature scaling. Determining the timing and quality of these states are indicative of developmental delays in both preterm and term-born babies that may lead to learning problems by school age.

TI  - Measuring bothersome menopausal symptoms: development and validation of the MenoScores questionnaire
T2  - HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES
AB  - Background: The experience of menopausal symptoms is common and an adequate patient reported outcome measure is crucial in studies where women are treated for these symptoms The aims of this study were to identify a patient-reported outcome measure for bothersome menopausal symptoms and, in the absence of an adequate tool, to develop a new measure with high content validity, and to validate it using modern psychometric methods.
   Methods: The literature was reviewed for existing questionnaires and checklists for bothersome menopausal symptoms Relevant items were extracted and subsequently tested in group interviews, single interviews, and pilot tests A patient reported outcome measure was drafted and completed by 1504 women Data was collected and psychometrically validated using item response theory Rasch Models.
   Results: All questionnaires identified in the literature lacked content validity regarding bothersome menopausal symptoms and none were validated using item response theory Our content validation resulted in a draft measurement encompassing 122 items across eight domains Following psychometrical validation, the final version of our patient -reported outcome measure, named the MenoScores Questionnaire, encompassed 51 items, including one single item, covering 11 scales.
   Conclusion: Menopausal symptoms are multidimensional with some symptoms unquestionably related to the menopausal transition We identified four constructs of importance hot flushes, day and night sweats, general sweating, and menopausal specific sleeping problems The MenoScores Questionnaire is condition specific with high content validity and adequate psychometrical properties it is designed to measure bothersome menopausal symptoms and all scales are developed and psychometrically validated using item response theory Rasch Models.

TI  - Comparison of the effect of lavender and bitter orange on anxiety in postmenopausal women: A triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Introduction: This trial compared the effects of lavender and bitter orange on anxiety in postmenopausal women.
   Methods: This trial was conducted in 2015. Eligible postmenopausal women were allocated into one of two intervention groups or a control group (n = 52 per group) in a 1:1:1 ratio using a randomized block design. Intervention groups received 500mg capsules containing only bitter orange or lavender flower powder, and the control group received 500mg capsules containing starch. The Spielberger's State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used before and eight weeks after starting the intervention. Data analyses were based on intention to treat.
   Results: A one-way ANOVA showed no significant difference in mean state anxiety (P = 0.254) and trait anxiety (p = 0.972) score among the three groups before the intervention. The general linear model, adjusted for baseline state and trait anxiety scores and confounding factors, showed significant differences among the groups in the mean state anxiety (P = 0.010) and trait anxiety (p = 0.041) score after eight weeks of treatment. Bitter orange significantly reduced the mean state-anxiety scores compared with the control group [Adjusted Mean Difference (aMD): -1.99 (95% Confidence Interval, - 3.64 to -0.34)]. Lavender significantly reduced the mean state-anxiety scores compared with the control group as well [aMD: -2.45 (95% CI -4.13 to -0.77)] and Bitter orange significantly reduced the mean trait-anxiety scores compared with the control group [aMD: -1.76 (95% CI -3.45 to -0.06)]. Lavender significantly reduced the mean trait-anxiety scores compared with the control group as well [aMD: -2.05 (95% CI -3.76 to -0.33)]. There was no significant difference between bitter orange and lavender groups after intervention in the mean trait-anxiety (p = 0.731) or state-anxiety (p = 0.578) scores.
   Conclusion: The positive effect of bitter orange and lavender on anxiety in postmenopausal women suggests that they can be used to decrease anxiety in such women. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Gender differences in hypertension
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN NEPHROLOGY AND HYPERTENSION
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe review is a short discussion of sex/gender differences in blood pressure control with a focus on gender differences in hypertension awareness, prevalence, and treatment, the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines, and recent discoveries in animal models and humans on mechanisms responsible for sex/gender differences in hypertension.Recent findingsHypertension awareness is greater in women than men, the prevalence of hypertension is higher in men than women until after menopause, and although the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines recommend similar treatment for men and women, this is not currently the case in practice. New studies into mechanisms responsible for sex/gender differences in hypertension include the role of the kidneys, the renin-angiotensin system, relaxin, and developmental programming.SummarySpecific guidelines for hypertension treatment in women and men have yet to be developed. However, numerous animal and human studies have shown differences in the mechanisms responsible for blood pressure control between the sexes. Thus more research into the sex/gender differences in mechanisms responsible for hypertension are needed to determine the best treatment options that will reduce the risk of hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular diseases in both genders.

TI  - The Relationship between Household Sanitation and Women's Experience of Menstrual Hygiene: Findings from a Cross-Sectional Survey in Kaduna State, Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Global efforts to improve sanitation have emphasized the needs of women and girls. Managing menstruation is one such need, yet there is scarce research capturing current practices. This study investigated the relationships between household sanitation and women's experience of menstrual management. Secondary analyses were undertaken on data from 1994 women and girls collected through the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 survey in Kaduna, Nigeria. In multivariable models, women had higher odds of using the main household sanitation facility for menstrual management when they had access to a basic (OR = 1.76 95%CI 1.26-2.46) or limited (OR = 1.63 95%CI 1.08-2.48) sanitation facility, compared to an unimproved facility. Women with no household sanitation facility had higher odds of using their sleeping area (OR = 3.56 95%CI 2.50-5.06) or having no facility for menstrual management (OR = 9.86 95%CI 5.76-16.87) than women with an unimproved sanitation facility. Menstrual management locations were associated with ratings of their characteristics. Safely managed or basic sanitation facilities were not rated more favorably than unimproved facilities in privacy (OR = 1.02 95%CI 0.70-1.48), safety (OR = 1.45 95%CI 0.98-2.15), access to a lock (OR = 0.93 95%CI 0.62-1.37), or soap and water (OR = 1.04 95%CI 0.70-1.56). Women using their sleeping area had more favorable perceptions of their environment. Findings suggest household sanitation influences women's choices for menstrual management, but that existing indicators for improvement are not sensitive to menstrual needs.

TI  - Vasomotor symptom characteristics: are they risk factors for incident diabetes?
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), encompassing hot flashes and night sweats, may be associated with diabetes, but evidence is limited. We sought to estimate these associations.
   Methods: Among 150,007 postmenopausal Women's Health Initiative participants from 1993 to 2014, we prospectively examined associations of incident diabetes with VMS characteristics at enrollment: any VMS, severity (mild/moderate/severe), type (hot flashes/night sweats), timing (early [premenopausal or perimenopausal]/late [postmenopausal]), and duration. Cox proportional-hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Mean duration of follow-up was 13.1 years. VMS prevalence was 33%. Reporting any VMS was associated with 18% increased diabetes risk (95% CI 1.14, 1.22), which increased with severity (mild: HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08, 1.17; moderate: HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.22, 1.36; severe: HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.34, 1.62) and duration (4% per 5 years, 95% CI 1.03, 1.05), independent of obesity. Diabetes risk was more pronounced for women reporting any night sweats (night sweats only: HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.13, 1.26; night sweats and hot flashes: HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.17, 1.27) than only hot flashes (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02, 1.15) and was restricted to late VMS (late: HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07, 1.18; early and late: HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11, 1.22; early: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95, 1.04).
   Conclusions: VMS are associated with elevated diabetes risk, particularly for women reporting night sweats and postmenopausal symptoms. The menopause transition may be an optimal window for clinicians to discuss long-term cardiovascular/metabolic risk with patients and leverage the bother of existing symptoms for behavior change to improve VMS and reduce diabetes risk.

TI  - Factors associated with poor sleep during menopause: results from the Midlife Women's Health Study
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Poor sleep is one of the most common problems reported during menopause, and is known to vary throughout the menopause transition. The objective of this study was to describe the dynamics of poor sleep among participants of the Midlife Women's Health Study and to identify risk factors associated with poor sleep during the menopausal transition.& para;& para;Methods: Annual responses to surveys that included questions about the frequency of sleep disturbances and insomnia were analyzed to determine the likelihood of persistent poor sleep throughout the menopausal transition and the correlation of responses to the different sleep-related questions, including frequency of restless sleep during the first year of the study. Responses to questions about a large number of potential risk factors were used to identify risk factors for poor sleep. & para;& para;Results: Poor sleep in premenopause was not predictive of poor sleep in perimenopause, and poor sleep in perimenopause was not predictive of poor sleep in postmenopause. Frequencies of each of the measures of poor sleep were highly correlated. For all sleep outcomes, high frequency of depression was related to a high frequency of poor sleep. Vasomotor symptoms were also significantly related with a higher frequency of all poor sleep outcomes. A history of smoking was also associated with higher frequencies of insomnia and sleep disturbances.& para;& para;Conclusions: The risk factors identified for poor sleep, depression and vasomotor symptoms, were consistently associated with poor sleep throughout the menopausal transition. The likelihood of these risk factors changed from premenopause, through perimenopause, and into postmenopause, however, which could explain changes in sleep difficulties across the menopausal transition. Treatment of these risk factors should be considered when addressing sleep difficulties in menopausal women.(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sleep Disturbance and Ovarian Stimulation Outcomes in Infertility and Fertility Preservation Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess sleep patterns and ovarian stimulation outcomes in infertile as compared to fertility preservation (FP) patients with a concurrent cancer diagnosis undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH).
   STUDY DESIGN: Prospective survey study done at a single academic medical center examining sleep disturbance, medical diagnoses, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and COH stimulation results using CES-D scale in 50 infertile and 32 age-matched FP patients.
   RESULTS: Sleep disturbance was significantly higher at baseline in FP patients. Over time, sleep disturbance significantly increased in infertile patients (T1 MOS-SS SCORE= 16; T2 MOS-SS SCORE= 20) but not in FP patients (T1 MOS-SS SCORE= 32; T2 MOS-SS SCORE= 36). Sleep disturbance did correlate with CES-D scores for both infertile and FP patients. How-ever, no correlations were found between sleep disturbance and AMH, peak estradiol, total medication received, number of oocytes retrieved, and number of oocytes frozen.
   CONCLUSION: Sleep scores for infertile patients significantly increased, often reaching values equivalent to national levels cited for chronic illnesses. For both infertile and FP patients, sleep scores correlated with CES-D scores but did not correlate with ovarian stimulation outcomes.

TI  - Self-help cognitive behavior therapy for working women with problematic hot flushes and night sweats (MENOS@Work): a multicenter randomized controlled trial
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the efficacy of an unguided, self-help cognitive behavior therapy (SH-CBT) booklet on hot flush and night sweat (HFNS) problem rating, delivered in a work setting.
   Methods: Women aged 45 to 60 years, having 10 or more problematic HFNS a week, were recruited to a multicenter randomized controlled trial, via the occupational health/human resources departments of eight organizations. Participants were 1: 1 randomized to SH-CBT or no treatment waitlist control (NTWC). The primary outcome was HFNS problem rating; secondary outcomes included HFNS frequency, work and social adjustment, sleep, mood, beliefs and behaviors, and work-related variables (absence, performance, turnover intention, and work impairment due to presenteeism). Intention-to-treat analysis was used, and between-group differences estimated using linear mixed models.
   Results: A total of 124 women were randomly allocated to SH-CBT (n = 60) and NTWC (n = 64). 104 (84%) were assessed for primary outcome at 6 weeks and 102 (82%) at 20 weeks. SH-CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 6 weeks (SH-CBT vs NTWC adjusted mean difference, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.11 to -0.86; P < 0.001) and at 20 weeks (-1.09; 95% CI, -1.87 to -0.31; P<0.01). SH-CBT also significantly reduced HFNS frequency, improved work and social adjustment; sleep, menopause beliefs, HFNS beliefs/behaviors at 6 and 20 weeks; improved wellbeing and somatic symptoms and reduced work impairment due to menopause-related presenteeism at 20 weeks, compared with the NTWC. There was no difference between groups in other work-related outcomes.
   Conclusions: A brief, unguided SH-CBT booklet is a potentially effective management option for working women experiencing problematic HFNS.

TI  - PREMENUPAUSAL AND POST MENUPAUSAL IMPACT OF SERUM ESTROGEN LEVELS ON FEMALES SLEEP ROUTINE
T2  - INDO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose: To assess habits of sleep in pre and post-menopausal women and to know the correlation between sleep habits and sex hormones.
   Operational Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Location and Time: The study was conducted in Obstetrics and Gynecology department in collaboration with physiology department of Services Hospital, Lahore for the period of one year from June 2015 to June 2016.
   Methods: Sixty five women were randomly selected, 33 were menopausal (group) and 32 were post-menopausal women (Group B). Sleep habits were evaluated using the questionnaire on sleep habits and blood samples were taken to assess estrogen serum levels and assessed by enzyme linked fluorescence immunoassay (ELFA).
   Results: Compared to postmenopausal and premenopausal women, sleeping habits and significant statistically outcome proved that postmenopausal women had a low sleep latency (p=0.011) in premenopausal women. postmenopausal women woke up early in the morning without an alarm (p=0.000), and postmenopausal women woke up early in the morning and before menopausal women when the postmenopausal women were more likely to awaken premenopausal women (p<0.01) earlier witnesses (p=0.000). Estrogen Serum levels were lower in women who are postmenopausal than in premenopausal women (p=0.000).
   Conclusion: The study showed that serum estrogen levels affect women's sleep patterns throughout the menstrual cycle and menopause.

AB  - The menstrual cycle is a physiological phenomenon that is accompanied by several hormonal fluctuations involving oestrogen and progesterone. Oestrogen and progesterone exert several physiological effects. There are many questions pertaining to the influence of the physiology of menstruation on anaesthesia. We attempted to find out whether the phase of the menstrual cycle can alter the physiological functions during anaesthesia, the perioperative management and outcomes. We performed a literature search in Google Scholar, PubMed and Cochrane databases for original and reviewed articles on the phases of the menstrual cycle and their relation to anaesthesia-related physiological parameters to find an answer to these questions. Many studies have shown that women, perimenstrually, may have increased pain perception, exacerbation of systemic diseases, vocal cord/peripheral oedema and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Some of the other notable findings in most studies were sleep disturbances in the luteal phase (LP), increased occurrence of PONV in the ovulatory phase and a lower requirement of intravenous sedative and anaesthetic drug requirements in the LP. We found contradictory results concerning pain perception and PONV in relation to the follicular and LPs. However, we found that literature regarding the phase of the menstrual cycle and the haemodynamic response to intubation, anaesthesia-induced hypnosis and perioperative blood loss is relatively scarce. Thus, there is a need to conduct good quality research on these topics.

TI  - Sleep characteristics and inflammatory biomarkers among midlife women
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Research suggests that sleep disturbances are associated with elevated levels of inflammation. Some evidence indicates that women may be particularly vulnerable; increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers with sleep disturbances are primarily observed among women. Midlife, which encompasses the menopause transition, is typically reported as a time of poor sleep. We tested whether poorer objectively measured sleep characteristics were related to a poorer inflammatory profile in midlife women.
   Methods: Two hundred ninety-five peri-and postmenopausal women aged 40-60 completed 3 days of wrist actigraphy, physiologic hot flash monitoring, questionnaires (e.g. Berlin sleep apnea risk questionnaire], and a blood draw for the assessment of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen. Associations of objective (actigraphy) sleep with inflammatory markers were tested in regression models. Sleep efficiency was inverse log transformed. Covariates included age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, sleep apnea risk, homeostatic model assessment (a measure of insulin resistance), systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and physical activity.
   Results: In separate models controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and education, lower sleep efficiency was associated with higher IL-6 [b(SE) = .02 (. 10), p = .003] and VWF [b(SE) = .02 (.08), p = .002]. More minutes awake after sleep onset was associated with higher VWF [b(SE) = .12 (. 06), p = .01]. Findings persisted in multivariable models.
   Conclusions: Lower sleep efficiency and more minutes awake after sleep onset were independently associated with higher circulating levels of VWF. Lower sleep efficiency was associated with higher circulating levels of IL-6. These findings suggest that sleep disturbances are associated with greater circulating inflammation in midlife women.

TI  - Quality of life in patients with endometriosis
T2  - GYNAKOLOGISCHE ENDOKRINOLOGIE
AB  - Endometriosis, with an incidence of 10% in women of childbearing age, is more common than often thought and is considered to be a chronic disease. Symptoms can express themselves as early as menarche and change in character over time. In order to prevent chronic pelvic pain, adequate treatment of the causes of endometriosis and the resulting pain are essential to avoid impairment in quality of life. The focus of therapy is on stress, sleep disorders, relationship problems, and anxiety. If psychiatric diagnoses already exist, special attention should be paid to depression and anxiety disorders. Because the most appropriate therapy can change over time, depending on the life situation and current symptoms, women with endometriosis often need to be accompanied by an interdisciplinary team. In this article, we discuss the important aspects that should be considered to maintain a high quality of life for patients with endometriosis.

TI  - Use of psychotropic medication in women with psychotic disorders at menopause and beyond
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Purpose of reviewDrugs have been extensively prescribed for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and related disorders, as well as for the management of psychotic features in delirium, dementia and affective disorders. The aim of this narrative review is to focus on the recent literature on drug treatment in women with psychosis at the transition to menopause and subsequently.Recent findingsThe recent literature emphasizes the following points: the efficacy of antipsychotic medication in psychosis is largely confined to the alleviation of delusions and hallucinations; menopause and ageing alter the kinetics and dynamics of drug action; drugs other than antipsychotics are currently being tested to address the cognitive, affective and negative symptoms of psychotic illnesses; menopausal symptoms add to comorbidities and require simultaneous treatment, raising the probability of deleterious drug interactions; antipsychotic drugs have many side effects and contribute to high mortality rates in the older psychosis population.SummaryA major implication for research is that antipsychotic drugs with a wider range of action and with fewer side effects are urgently needed. The clinical implications of the pharmacotherapy of psychotic illness are: older women's needs must be assessed through a comprehensive history and review of systems and physical and mental examination. To avoid adverse effects, drug dosages are best kept low and polypharmacy avoided wherever possible. It is important to frequently reassess older patients, as their pharmacotherapy requirements change with age and with comorbidity.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Psychoeducation for the Reduction of Menopausal Symptoms: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Psychological and behavioural interventions may be effective in reducing menopause-related symptoms. This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in reducing menopause-related symptoms by comparing with an active control group, the menopause education control (MEC). Symptomatic peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women with mild to moderate symptoms were recruited. The primary outcome was overall menopausal symptoms measured by modified Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS). Secondary outcomes include subscales of the GCS perceived stress, mindfulness and health related Quality of Life. All outcome measures were collected at baseline, 2 months (immediately post intervention), 5 and 8 months (3 and 6 months post intervention respectively). Both MBSR (n = 98) and MEC (n = 99) groups reported a reduction in total GCS score at 8 months. Between group analysis show significant symptom score reduction in MBSR group on Anxiety and Depression subscales of GCS. No differences were found between groups on other GCS subscales and majority of the secondary outcome measures. The findings show that menopausal symptoms in both MBSR and MEC significantly reduced over the study period. MBSR show a greater reduction of psychological symptoms of depression and anxiety above active controls but do not reduce other somatic, urogenital and vasomotor symptoms.

TI  - PATTERNS OF SLEEP IMPAIRMENTS IN AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL COHORT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN IN PERUNDURAI
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Menopause is cessation of menstruation for one year. Postmenopausal period is an important phase in women's life, in which many psychophysical changes occur. Insomnia is an important issue commonly encountered in the clinical setting in this subset of women in the gynaecology OPD. Variety of sleep pattern changes occur in postmenopausal women. Many women complain of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, frequent sleep fragmentation and early morning awakenings, vivid dreams and non-restorative sleep. Other sleep disruptions commonly encountered include restless leg syndrome and obstructive sleep apnoea.
   Aims & Objectives-The aim of this study was to identify the patterns of sleep impairments in postmenopausal women. We obtained the data by interviewing 35 postmenopausal women who were presenting to the OPD. The women gave accounts of their difficulties with sleep. A variety of dimensions were identified using the rating scale.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   It is a cross-sectional study, hospital-based assessment conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at IRT Perundurai Medical College. A total of 37 consecutive sampling of healthy postmenopausal participants who presented in the outpatient department were included in the study. All the 37 study participants filled out the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) providing data for statistical analysis. The age of participants ranged from 37 to 55 years. Women receiving hormonal treatment, having serious medical comorbidities such as thyroid disorders, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, serious axis 1 psychiatric morbidity receiving treatment, hypertension and those who refused to participate were not included. PSQI was used to assess the sleep pattern in postmenopausal study population producing 7 components scores and one global score.
   RESULTS
   Among 70 women screened, 37 women fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The average global score is 4.83, which very well segregates the sleep impairment in this subgroup. Age is positively correlated with global score and parity is negatively correlated with global score. Among the individual component score, daytime dysfunction positively correlates with age and negatively correlates with parity.
   CONCLUSION
   Sleep impairments were highly prevalent, often underdiagnosed with sleep quality index well below the normal.

TI  - Measuring serum melatonin in postmenopausal women: Implications for epidemiologic studies and breast cancer studies
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Circulating melatonin is a good candidate biomarker for studies of circadian rhythms and circadian disruption. However, epidemiologic studies on circulating melatonin are limited because melatonin is secreted at night, yet most epidemiologic studies collect blood during the day when melatonin levels are very low, and assays are lacking that are ultrasensitive to detect low levels of melatonin reliably.
   Objective
   To assess the performance of a refined radioimmunoassay in measuring morning melatonin among women.
   Methods
   We used morning serum samples from 47 postmenopausal women ages 48 +/- 80 years without a history of breast cancer who participated in the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study, including 19 women who had duplicate measurements. The coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass coefficient (ICC) were estimated using the random effect model.
   Results
   Reproducibility for the assay was satisfactory, with a CV of 11.2% and an ICC of 98.9%; correlation between the replicate samples was also high (R = 0.96). In the 47 women, serum melatonin levels ranged from 0.6 to 62.6 pg/ml, with a median of 7.0 pg/ml.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that it is possible to reliably measure melatonin in postmenopausal women in morning serum samples in large epidemiologic studies to evaluate the role of melatonin in cancer etiology or prognosis.

TI  - Biological clocks and physical functioning in monozygotic female twins
T2  - BMC GERIATRICS
AB  - Background: Biomarkers of biological aging - DNA methylation age (DNAm age) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL)-correlate strongly with chronological age across the life course. It is, however, unclear how these measures of cellular wear and tear are associated with muscle strength and functional capacity, which are known to decline with older age and are associated with mortality. We investigated if DNAm age and LTL were associated with body composition and physical functioning by examining 48 monozygotic twin sisters.
   Methods: White blood cell DNAm age (predicted years) was calculated from Illumina 450 k BeadChip methylation data using an online calculator. DNAm age acceleration was defined from the residuals derived from a linear regression model of DNAm age on chronological age. LTL was measured by qPCR. Total body percentage of fat and lean mass were estimated using bioimpedance. Physical functioning was measured by grip strength, knee extension strength and by 10 m maximal walking speed test.
   Results: In all participants, DNAm age (58.4 +/- 6.6) was lower than chronological age (61.3 +/- 5.9 years). Pairwise correlations of monozygotic co-twins were high for DNAm age (0.88, 95% CI 0.79, 0.97), age acceleration (0.68, 95% CI 0.30, 0.85) and LTL (0.77, 95% CI 0.60, 0.94). Increased age acceleration i.e. faster epigenetic aging compared to chronological age was associated with lower grip strength (beta = -5.3 SE 1.9 p = 0.011), but not with other measures of physical functioning or body composition. LTL was not associated with body composition or physical functioning.
   Conclusions: To conclude, accelerated DNAm age is associated with lower grip strength, a biomarker known to be associated with physiological aging, and which predicts decline in physical functioning and mortality. Further studies may clarify whether epigenetic aging explains the decline in muscle strength with aging or whether DNAm age just illustrates the progress of aging.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF LONG-TERM MELATONIN SUPPLEMENTATION ON PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Different psychosomatic disorders are observed in postmenopausal women. The decrease of estrogen production is believed to be the main cause of their severity. It is nowadays evident that the decreased melatonin release in women at this age who suffer from postmenopausal disorders might also contribute to the severity of the symptoms. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin supplementation on female hormones release and the alteration in climacteric symptoms. The study included 60 postmenopausal women, aged 51 - 64 years, who were randomly allotted into two equal groups. Group I was recommended placebo (2 x 1 tablet) and Group II - melatonin (3 mg in the morning and 5 mg at bedtime) for 12 months. Serum levels of 17 beta-estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), melatonin and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) excretion as well as Kupperman Index (KI) and body mass index (BMI) were determined before the start and at 12 months after placebo or melatonin administration. In Group I only the value of KI slightly decreased (28.4 +/- 2.9 versus 25.6 +/- 3.8 points, P = 0,0619). In Group II - KI decreased from 29.1 +/- 2.9 to 19.7 +/- 3.1 points (P < 0.001) and BMI from 30.9 +/- 2.9 to 28.1 +/- 2.3 kg/m(2) (P < 0.05). Melatonin supplementation failed to change significantly the serum concentration of female reproductive hormones 17 beta-estradiol and FSH. We conclude that melatonin supplementation therapy exerts a positive effect on psychosomatic symptoms in postmenopausal women and can be recommended as the useful adjuvant therapeutic option in treatment of these disorders.

TI  - The clinical anatomy of fibromyalgia
T2  - CLINICAL ANATOMY
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by pain and a spectrum of psychological comorbidities, rendering treatment difficult, and often a financial burden. Findings regarding diagnosis, prevalence, comorbidities, and potential pathophysiological links are discussed herein. Fibromyalgia is a complex disorder and there are specific criteria that patients must meet for diagnosis, including scores on fibromyalgia questionnaires, commonalities of age, gender, menopause status, sleep disturbances, and mood symptoms. The close relationship between fibromyalgia and other chronic disorders should alert the physician to explore for comorbid illnesses. In this review of the clinical anatomy of fibromyalgia, we review new studies that could be significant for the current use of clinical interventions for patients with symptoms. Using standard search engines, the clinical anatomy of fibromyalgia is investigated and many related studies are mentioned herein. Fibromyalgia is considered a prototypical central chronic pain syndrome and is associated with widespread pain that fluctuates spontaneously. There is also substantial lifetime psychiatric comorbidity in individuals with fibromyalgia, resulting in a low health-related quality of life. These results have important clinical and theoretical implications, including the possibility that fibromyalgia could share underlying pathophysiological links with some psychiatric disorders. This reveals that patients with fibromyalgia have findings compatible with tissue injury pain, the pain mechanisms involving both the primary afferent neuron and the nociceptive systems in the central nervous system. (1) There is a relationship between fibromyalgia and chronic disorders. This should alert the physician to explore for comorbid illnesses. (2) There is substantial lifetime psychiatric comorbidity resulting in a low health-related quality of life. (3) Patients with fibromyalgia have findings compatible with tissue injury pain Clin.

TI  - Gender differences in obstructive sleep apnoea, insomnia and restless legs syndrome in adults - What do we know? A clinical update
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS
AB  - Research in sleep medicine over the last decades has involved a broad variety of sleep disorders in both men and women. Gender differences have been identified in sleep physiology as well as in the three most common sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), insomnia and restless legs syndrome (RLS). However, research on gender differences in sleep medicine appears limited. This clinical review aims to give an updated overview of gender differences, in relation to prevalence, clinical presentation, treatment and quality of life in OSA, insomnia and RLS. Future research directions in the adult population will also be discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The dynamics of stress and fatigue across menopause: attractors, coupling, and resilience
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the regulatory dynamics between stress and fatigue experienced by women during the menopausal transition (MT) and early postmenopause (EPM). Fatigue and perceived stress are commonly experienced by women during the MT and EPM. We sought to discover relationships between these symptoms and to employ these symptoms as possible markers for resilience.
   Methods: Participants were drawn from the longitudinal Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study. Eligible women completed questionnaires on 60+ occasions (annual health reports and monthly health diaries) (n = 56 women). The total number of observations across the sample was 4,224. STRAW+10 criteria were used to stage women in either in late reproductive, early or late transition, or EPM stage. Change values were generated for fatigue and stress and analyzed with a multilevel structural equation model; slopes indicate how quickly a person returns to homeostasis after a perturbation. Coupling of stress and fatigue was modeled to evaluate resilience, the notion of maintaining stability during change.
   Results: Eligible women were on average 35 years old (SD = 4.71), well educated, employed, married or partnered, and white. Fit indices suggested the model depicts the relationships of stress and fatigue (chi(2) (9 df) = 7.638, P = 0.57, correction factor = 4.9244; root mean square error of approximation 90% CI = 0.000 <= 0.000 <= 0.032; comparative fit index = 1.00). A loss in model fit across stages suggests that the four stages differed in their dynamics (chi(2) Delta(12 df) = 21.181, P = .048). All stages showed fixed-point attractor dynamics: fatigue became less stable over time; stress generally became more stable over time. Coupling relationships of stress on fatigue show evidence for shifts in regulatory relationships with one another across the MT.
   Conclusions: Results are suggestive of general dysregulation via disruptions to coupling relationships of stress and fatigue across the MT. Findings support a holistic approach to understanding symptoms and supporting women during the MT.

TI  - Association of vasomotor symptoms and sleep apnea risk in midlife women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the association between self-reported vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk.
   Methods: The STOP-BANG to evaluate OSA and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were administered to 2,935 women seen in the Women's Health Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, between May 2015 and December 2016. Of these, 1,691 women were included in the analysis. Total MRS and VMS ratings were compared using logistic regression, with age, smoking, and body mass index (BMI) included as covariates between women at intermediate/high risk versus low risk for OSA.
   Results: Total MRS scores were significantly higher in women with intermediate/high-risk OSA scores versus those with low-risk scores [mean (SD): 16.8 (8.0) vs 12.9 (7.0), P<0.001]. Women at intermediate/high OSA risk were older, had more education, self-reported hypertension, BMI >35 kg/m(2), and were less likely to be married or employed. Self-reported severe/very severe VMS were significantly associated with intermediate/high risk versus low risk for OSA (26.6% vs 15.0%; P<0.001). After adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, and self-reported hypertension, the odds of having intermediate/high risk for OSA were 1.87 times higher for those with severe/very severe VMS compared with those with none/mild/moderate VMS (95% CI, 1.29-2.71, P<0.001). This association persisted upon subgroup analysis based on BMI <25 kg/m(2) (odds ratio 2.15; 95% CI, 1.12-4.16, P = 0.022).
   Conclusions: Self-reported severe/very severe VMS were associated with intermediate/high risk for OSA in midlife women, even in women with BMI <25 kg/m(2). Given the limitations of the STOP-BANG tool, OSA risk may, however, have been overestimated.

TI  - Exercise-induced hypoalgesia in women with varying levels of menstrual pain
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PAIN
AB  - Background and aims: Exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is a well-established phenomenon in pain-free individuals that describes a decrease in pain sensitivity after an acute bout of exercise. The EIH response has been demonstrated to be sub-optimal in the presence of persisting pain. Menstrual pain is a common recurrent painful problem with many women experiencing high levels of pain each cycle. However, the EIH response has not been examined in a cohort of women with high levels of menstrual pain. This research aimed to examine whether EIH manifests differently in women with varying levels of menstrual pain. The primary hypothesis was that women with high levels of menstrual pain would demonstrate compromised EIH. Secondary aims were to explore relationships between EIH and emotional state, sleep quality, body mass index (BMI) or physical activity levels.
   Methods: Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured in 64 participants using a digital handheld algometer before and after a submaximal isometric-handgrip exercise. EIH index was compared between low (VAS 0-3), moderate (VAS 4-7) and high (VAS 8-10) pain groups, using a linear mixed model analysis with participant as a random effect, and site, menstrual pain category and the interaction between the two, as fixed effects.
   Results: EIH was consistently induced in all groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the pain groups for EIH index (p = 0.835) or for any co-variates (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: EIH was not found to differ between women who report regular low, moderate or high levels of menstrual pain, when measured at a point in their menstrual cycle when they are pain free.

TI  - Protocol for Exercise Program in Cancer and Cognition (EPICC): A randomized controlled trial of the effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in postmenopausal women with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB  - The Exercise Program in Cancer and Cognition (EPICC) Study is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on cognitive function in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer during the first six months of aromatase inhibitor therapy. It is estimated that up to 75% of survivors of breast cancer experience cognitive impairment related to disease and treatment. At present, there are no known interventions to improve or manage cognitive function for women with breast cancer. Here, we describe a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with allocation of 254 postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer to a supervised six-month aerobic exercise intervention or usual care. Prior to beginning aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, participants complete baseline assessments of cognitive function, cardiorespiratory fitness, blood-based biomarkers, physical activity and sleep, and symptoms (fatigue, sleep problems, depressive symptoms, anxiety). A random subset of participants (n = 150) undergoes neuroimaging procedures that include structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. All participants maintain an activity diary; physical activity and sleep monitoring is repeated three and seven months post-randomization. The remaining baseline assessments are repeated seven months post-randomization. If successful, exercise could be a low-cost method to improve cognitive function in women with breast cancer that is easily adaptable to the home or community.

TI  - First-night effect on cardiac autonomic function in different female reproductive states
T2  - JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
AB  - Decreases in heart rate variability, a marker of autonomic nervous system function, are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability increases in non-rapid eye movement sleep, peaking in slow-wave sleep. Therefore, decreasing the amount of deep sleep, for example, by introducing patients to a sleep laboratory environment, could decrease heart rate variability, increasing cardiovascular risk. We studied four groups of women with no previous sleep laboratory experience: young [n=11, 23.1 (0.5) years]; perimenopausal [n=15, 48.0 (0.4) years]; postmenopausal without hormone therapy [n=22, 63.4 (0.8) years]; and postmenopausal on hormone therapy [n=16, 63.1 (0.9) years], using a cross-sectional design. Polysomnography including electrocardiogram was performed over two consecutive nights. Heart rate variability was assessed overnight, and the first-night effect on heart rate variability was analysed. Furthermore, correlations between heart rate variability and sleep variables were analysed. Using combined groups, only minor changes were observed in non-linear heart rate variability, indicating increased parasympathetic tone from the first to the second night. No group differences in first-night effect were seen. Heart rate variability and sleep variables were not significantly correlated. Heart rate variability decreased with increasing age, and it was lowest in the postmenopausal women on hormone therapy. We conclude that a first night in a sleep laboratory elicits only minimal changes in overnight vagally mediated non-linear heart rate variability in women irrespective of reproductive state. This finding warrants further analyses in different sleep stages, but suggests that changes in sleep architecture per se do not predict the autonomic strain of a poor night.

TI  - Chronotypes and circadian timing in migraine
T2  - CEPHALALGIA
AB  - Background It has been suggested that migraine attacks strike according to circadian patterns and that this might be related to individual chronotype. Here we evaluated and correlated individual chronotypes, stability of the circadian rhythm, and circadian attack timing in a large and well-characterised migraine population.
   Methods In 2875 migraine patients and 200 non-headache controls we assessed differences in: (i) distribution of chronotypes (Munich Chronotype Questionnaire); (ii) the circadian rhythm's amplitude and stability (Circadian Type Inventory); and (iii) circadian timing of migraine attacks. Data were analysed using multinomial and linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, sleep quality and depression.
   Results Migraineurs more often showed an early chronotype compared with controls (48.9% versus 38.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.58-3.69; p<0.001); as well as a late chronotypes (37.7% versus 38.1%; adjusted OR=1.69; 95% CI=1.10-2.61; p=0.016). Migraineurs, particularly those with high attack frequency, were more tired after changes in circadian rhythm (i.e. more languid; p<0.001) and coped less well with being active at unusual hours (i.e. more rigid; p<0.001) than controls. Of 2389 migraineurs, 961 (40.2%) reported early morning attack onset.
   Conclusion Migraine patients are less prone to be of a normal chronotype than controls. They are more languid and more rigid when changes in circadian rhythm occur. Most migraine attacks begin in the early morning. These data suggest that chronobiological mechanisms play a role in migraine pathophysiology.

TI  - Effect of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy on Sleep and Activity Patterns in Early-stage Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
AB  - Treatment-emergent side effects often affect adherence to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. In the present study, we examined the sleep patterns and daytime function both objectively using actigraphy and subjectively using validated questionnaires in women receiving AI therapy. Daytime function significantly decreased after 3 months of AI therapy and correlated with increased fatigue. Larger studies are necessary to understand why daytime function is affected by AI therapy and to identify interventions to improve daytime function, which could be helpful in improving adherence to AI therapy.
   Introduction: Adherence to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is poor, often because of treatment-emergent side effects, including musculoskeletal symptoms, fatigue, and insomnia. In the present analysis, we examined the sleep patterns and daytime function both objectively using actigraphy and subjectively using validated questionnaires in women initiating AI therapy. Patients and Methods: Postmenopausal women with stage 0-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were initiating AI therapy were eligible. The patients wore actigraphy devices for 10 consecutive days and completed questionnaires at baseline before the initiation of AI and after 3 months of AI therapy. Associations between the baseline demographics and symptoms, changes in patient-reported outcomes and actigraphy measures from baseline to 3 months of AI therapy and discontinuation of AI therapy were examined using sign tests, logistic regression models, Spearman's correlation, and linear mixed models. Results: Forty-two patients (86%) completed the baseline assessments and 23 patients (47%) completed both the baseline and the 3-month assessments. Objectively measured daytime function as measured by total daytime activity decreased during the 3 months after starting AI (232,566 activity count vs. 204,205 activity count; P =.023), and the decrease was more evident in women with higher baseline physical function. Reduced daytime activity correlated with increased fatigue (r = -0.49; P =.017). Conclusion: Daytime function decreased after initiation of AI therapy and correlated moderately with increased fatigue, although no association was identified with changes in pain or sleep quality. Additional studies are required to understand why function is reduced, which could have implications for interventions to improve patient tolerance of, and persistence with, AI therapy.

TI  - Menopausal-Related Symptoms in Women One Year After Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
AB  - Context. Approximately 60% to 100% of women with breast cancer experience at least one menopausal-related symptom. Little is known about associations between menopausal status and symptoms in women 12 months after breast cancer surgery.
   Objectives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate for differences in occurrence, severity, and distress of symptoms between pre- and postmenopausal women 12 months after breast cancer surgery.
   Methods. Women with breast cancer (n = 327) completed the Menopausal Symptoms Scale, which evaluated the occurrence, severity, and distress of 46 common menopausal-related symptoms. Regression analyses were used to evaluate between-group differences in the seven symptoms that occurred in 30% and more of the sample (i.e., hot flashes, night sweats, depression, daytime sweats, joint pain or stiffness, wake during the night, and numbness or tingling).
   Results. Of the 327 patients with breast cancer, who completed the 12-month assessment, 35.2% were premenopausal and 64.8% were postmenopausal before surgery. In the conditional models, when significant interactions were found, the differences in symptom occurrence rates between pre- and postmenopausal patients depended on their age.
   Conclusion. Regardless of menopausal status, women reported relatively high occurrence rates for several menopausal symptoms. Associations between symptom occurrence rates and menopausal status depended on the patient's age. During the development of a survivorship care plan, clinicians need to assess symptom burden within the context of a woman's menopausal status and salient demographic and clinical characteristics. This approach will assist with the prescription of more effective interventions. (C) 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biological effects of melatonin on osteoblast/osteoclast cocultures, bone, and quality of life: Implications of a role for MT2 melatonin receptors, MEK1/2, and MEK5 in melatonin-mediated osteoblastogenesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH
AB  - The Melatonin Osteoporosis Prevention Study (MOPS) demonstrated that nightly melatonin resulted in a time-dependent decrease in equilibrium ratios of serum osteoclasts and osteoblasts in perimenopausal women. This study examines mechanisms related to the ratios of osteoblasts and osteoclasts using coculture models (transwell or layered) of human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs). Human MSC/PBMC cocultures exposed to melatonin in osteogenic (OS+) medium for 21days induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization; however, only in layered cocultures did melatonin inhibit osteoclastogenesis. Melatonin effects were mediated through MT2 melatonin receptors, MEK1/2, and MEK5. In layered but not transwell cocultures, melatonin increased OPG:RANKL ratios by inhibiting RANKL, suggesting that contact with osteoclasts during osteoblastogenesis inhibits RANKL secretion. Melatonin modulated expression of ERK1/2, ERK5, 1 integrin, GLUT4, and IR that was dependent upon the type of coculture; however, in both cultures, melatonin increased RUNX2 and decreased PPAR expression, indicating a role for metabolic processes that control osteogenic vs adipogenic cell fates of MSCs. Furthermore, melatonin also has osteoblast-inducing effects on human adipose-derived MSCs. In vivo, one-year nightly melatonin (15mg/L) given to neu female mice in their drinking water increased pErk1/2, pErk5, Runx2, and Opg and Rankl levels in bone consistent with melatonin's already reported bone-enhancing effects. Finally, analysis of daily logs from the MOPS demonstrated a significant improvement in mood and perhaps sleep quality in women receiving melatonin vs placebo. The osteoblast-inducing, bone-enhancing effects of melatonin and improvement in quality of life suggest that melatonin is a safe and effective bone loss therapy.

TI  - Symptoms of menopause - global prevalence, physiology and implications
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - The symptoms of menopause can be distressing, particularly as they occur at a time when women have important roles in society, within the family and at the workplace. Hormonal changes that begin during the menopausal transition affect many biological systems. Accordingly, the signs and symptoms of menopause include central nervous system-related disorders; metabolic, weight, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal changes; urogenital and skin atrophy; and sexual dysfunction. The physiological basis of these manifestations is emerging as complex and related, but not limited to, oestrogen deprivation. Findings generated mainly from longitudinal population studies have shown that ethnic, geographical and individual factors affect symptom prevalence and severity. Moreover, and of great importance to clinical practice, the latest research has highlighted how certain menopausal symptoms can be associated with the onset of other disorders and might therefore serve as predictors of future health risks in postmenopausal women. The goal of this Review is to describe in a timely manner new research findings on the global prevalence and physiology of menopausal symptoms and their impact on future health.

TI  - Poor Sleep Quality is Associated with Insulin Resistance in Postmenopausal Women With and Without Metabolic Syndrome
T2  - METABOLIC SYNDROME AND RELATED DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Poor sleep quality has previously been shown to be related to insulin resistance in apparently healthy adults. However, it is unclear whether an association between sleep quality and insulin resistance exists among adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: Participants included 347 overweight/obese postmenopausal women without type 2 diabetes (age: 57.56.5 years; body mass index [BMI]: 31.73.7kg/m(2); 54% with MetS). Sleep quality was assessed with the six-item Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale; values were categorized into quartiles. Insulin resistance was calculated from fasting glucose and insulin with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) method. Analysis of covariance models were used to examine the association between sleep quality and HOMA2-IR after accounting for MetS and covariates (e.g., BMI, cardiorespiratory fitness, and energy intake). Results: Women with the worst sleep quality had significantly higher HOMA2-IR values than women in all other quartiles (P0.05 for each), and women with MetS had significantly higher HOMA2-IR values than women without MetS (P<0.0001), but the relationship between sleep quality and HOMA2-IR did not differ between those with or without MetS (P=0.26). Women with MetS in the worst quartile of sleep quality had higher HOMA2-IR values than all other women (P<0.02). Taking >30min to fall asleep, frequent restless sleep, and frequent daytime drowsiness were each related to higher HOMA2-IR values (each P<0.04). Conclusions: Sleep quality is an important correlate of insulin resistance in postmenopausal women with and without MetS. Intervention studies are needed to determine whether improving sleep improves insulin resistance in populations at elevated cardiometabolic risk.

TI  - Circadian Rhythms and Clock Genes in Reproduction: insights From Behavior and the Female Rabbit's Brain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Clock gene oscillations are necessary for a successful pregnancy and parturition, but little is known about their function during lactation, a period demanding from the mother multiple physiological and behavioral adaptations to fulfill the requirements of the offspring. First, we will focus on circadian rhythms and clock genes in reproductive tissues mainly in rodents. Disruption of circadian rhythms or proper rhythmic oscillations of clock genes provoke reproductive problems, as found in clock gene knockout mice. Then, we will focus mainly on the rabbit doe as this mammal nurses the young just once a day with circadian periodicity. This daily event synchronizes the behavior and the activity of specific brain regions critical for reproductive neuroendocrinology and maternal behavior, like the preoptic area. This region shows strong rhythms of the PER1 protein (product of the Per1 clock gene) associated with circadian nursing. Additionally, neuroendocrine cells related to milk production and ejections are also synchronized to daily nursing. A threshold of suckling is necessary to entrain once a day nursing; this process is independent of milk output as even virgin does (behaving maternally following anosmia) can display circadian nursing behavior. A timing motivational mechanism may regulate such behavior as mesolimbic dopaminergic cells are entrained by daily nursing. Finally, we will explore about the clinical importance of circadian rhythms. Indeed, women in chronic shift-work schedules show problems in their menstrual cycles and pregnancies and also have a high risk of preterm delivery, making this an important field of translational research.

TI  - Sleep apnea and femoral neck BMD among Singaporean mid-life women
T2  - ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS
AB  - The relationship between sleep apnea and bone health remains controversial. This study explored the relationship between sleep apnea and femoral neck BMD in midlife Asian women. Partner-witnessed apnea predicted higher femoral neck BMD, an effect validated by the STOP index. Our findings suggest that sleep apnea may protect bone health.
   Purpose The menopause transition is associated with decline in bone mineral density (BMD) and sleep quality. However, any relationship between these two factors remains controversial. This study explored the association between sleep apnea and femoral neck BMD in middle-aged women.
   Methods Participants (n = 1201) aged 45-69 years attending well-women visits at the National University Hospital, Singapore were recruited. Self-reported breathing discomfort and snoring, partner-witnessed apnea and snoring were assessed from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Femoral neck BMD was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and classified into tertiles based on T-scores. Factors reported to affect sleep apnea and bone health in medical literature were potential covariates, p < 0.10. Multivariable ordinal regression analyses assessed associations between sleep measures and BMD. To further validate our findings, we analyzed four sleep apnea characteristics from the STOP questionnaire, a screening tool for sleep apnea. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0.
   Results Mean (SD) age of participants was 56.3 (6.2) years. Partner-witnessed apnea predicted higher BMD tertiles (OR per unit increase in severity 1.39, 95% CI [1.02, 1.89]), independent of age, ethnicity, diabetes, BMI, and handgrip strength. This was further corroborated by the STOP index (OR 1.45, 95% CI [1.07, 1.96]).
   Conclusions This study adds to the literature on sleep apnea and bone health in a non-Caucasian and younger population. Our findings support OSA-associated intermittent hypoxia protecting bone health.

TI  - Polymorphisms in Estrogen Synthesis Genes and Symptom Clusters During the Menopausal Transition and Early Postmenopause: Observations From the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study

AB  - During the menopausal transition and early postmenopause, participants in the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study (SMWHS) experienced one of the three symptom severity clusters identified through latent class analysis: severe hot flashes with moderate sleep, mood, cognitive, and pain symptoms (high-severity hot flash); low-severity hot flashes with moderate levels of all other symptom groups (moderate severity); and low levels of all symptom groups (low severity). In an effort to determine whether gene polymorphisms were associated with these symptom severity classes, we tested associations between gene polymorphisms in the estrogen synthesis pathways (cytochrome P450 19 [CYP 19] and 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [17HSDB1]) and the three symptom severity clusters. SMWHS participants (N = 137) recorded symptoms monthly in diaries and provided buccal smears for genotyping. Multilevel latent class analysis with multinomial regression was used to determine associations between gene polymorphisms and symptom severity clusters. Only the 17HSDB1 polymorphisms (rs615942 and rs592389) were associated significantly with the high-severity hot flash cluster versus the low-severity symptom cluster. None of the polymorphisms was associated with the moderate-severity cluster versus the low-severity symptom cluster. Findings of associations of the 17HSDB1 polymorphisms with the high-severity hot flash symptom cluster are consistent with those of an association between 17HSDB1 polymorphisms and hot flashes in the Study of Women and Health Across the Nation population and our previous findings of associations between these polymorphisms with greater estrone levels.

TI  - Exercise in the management of knee and hip osteoarthritis
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN RHEUMATOLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   This review focuses on studies published during July 2001 to August 2017 of exercise as an intervention in knee and hip osteoarthritis, including its influence on an array of patient outcomes.
   Recent findings
   Studies continue to illustrate the efficacy of exercise in treating and managing osteoarthritis, with current literature more focused on the knee compared with the hip joint. Both traditional (e.g. strength, aerobic, flexibility) and more nontraditional (e.g. yoga, Tai Chi, aquatic) training modes improve patient outcomes related to joint symptoms, mobility, quality of life, psychological health, musculoskeletal properties, body composition, sleep, and fatigue. Exercise that is adequately dosed (e.g. frequency, intensity) and progressive in nature demonstrated the greatest improvements in patient outcomes. Supervised, partially supervised, and nonsupervised interventions can be successful in the treatment of osteoarthritis, but patient preference regarding level of supervision and mode of exercise may be key predictors in exercise adherence and degree of outcome improvement. A topic of increasing interest in osteoarthritis is the supplementary role of behavior training in exercise interventions.
   Summary
   Osteoarthritis is a complex, multifactorial disease that can be successfully managed and treated through exercise, with minimal risk for negative consequences. However, to have greatest impact, appropriate exercise prescription is needed. Efforts to achieve correct exercise doses and mitigate patient nonadherence are needed to lessen the lifelong burden of osteoarthritis.

TI  - Evaluation of an association between long sleep duration and periodontal disease among men and women using nationally representative data
T2  - GACETA SANITARIA
AB  - Objective: To assess the association between long sleep duration and periodontal disease among men and women using nationally representative data.
   Methods: In this study, we performed a cross-sectional analysis and used multivariable logistic regression analysis models. We analysed data from 2012 through 2014 from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The analysis in this study was confined to a total of 14,675 respondents over 19 years of age. We used a community periodontal index code greater than or equal to 3 to define periodontitis.
   Results: The tendency of periodontitis increased with longer sleep duration in women. Compared with women who slept 5 hours or less, women with a sleep duration of 6 to 8 hours and 9 hours or more had higher odds of periodontitis at 1.29 (95% confidence interval [95%Cl]: 1.06-1.56) and 1.45 (95%Cl: 1.07-1.96), respectively, after adjustment for age, smoking, drinking, exercise, frequency of tooth brushing, self reported oral status, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, white blood cell count, income, and education. A significant relationship between sleep duration and periodontitis was not found in men.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that long sleep duration was associated with periodontitis, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, among Korean women, especially in premenopausal women. (C) 2017 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Premenstrual syndrome is one of the most common disorders of reproductive age which impact on affected women lives but how this syndrome affects the quality of life not well described. Understanding health-related quality of life from affected womens perspective is essential to support them and improve their quality of life. Thus, this study aimed to discover the experiences of affected women about quality of life. The qualitative study using conventional content analysis method. For data collection, semi-structured and in-depth individual interviews of 21 iraniain women in reproductive age were performed at Tehran university and some high schools in Tehran. Interviews continued until to saturation data. The MAXQDA10 software was used to manage qualitative data analysis. Four main categories were extracted from the study discovered that the most effective consequences on quality of life quality in affected women with the data included:(1) Physical consequences with 7 subcategories including "Cardiovascular", "Genitourinary", "Neurological", "skin and hair", "Digestive", "Musculoskeletal" and "General health disorder", (2) Psychological consequences with 3 subcategories including "Mood", "Cognitive " and " Emotional disorder" (3) Behavioral consequences with 2 subcategories "Sleep patterns changes", "Nutritional patterns changes" and (4) Familial-Social consequences with 3 subcategories " Defective interpersonal relationships", "Sexual dysfunction" and "Social isolation". The results of the study identified challenges at quality of life in women with Premenstrual syndrome. Therefore, it is necessary to create a supportive setting that improves the quality of life in affected womens.

TI  - Overview of the pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy of phospholipid liposomes (Liposom Forte (R)) in patients with depressive disorders
T2  - MINERVA PSICHIATRICA
AB  - Major depression is a disorder that impairs mood, emotional behavior and various physical functions, such as sleep and appetite. Quality of life is very poor and occasionally is not worth living. The etiology of depression is multifactorial and still largely unknown; however, there is evidence that a relationship between genetic, environmental/behavioral stress and epigenetic factors plays a central role. The pathophysiology of depressive disorders is mainly correlated with a failure of the fine interplay between monoaminergic neuronal systems (5-HT, NE and DA). Elevated glucocorticoid and glutamate level, as a result of a chronic stress, causes a reduction of neurogenesis, dendritic complexity and synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, involving proinflammatory cytokines too and contributing in turn to depression and stress related disorders. Current treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors has some limitations. Therefore, to enhance treatment efficacy and tolerability, clinicians have become increasingly interested in pharmaceutical compounds chemically different from the "classical antidepressants". In this respect particularly interesting seems the use of phospholipid liposomes (PL-Liposom Forte (R)). This review summarizes the experimental and clinical data leading to the use of natural phospholipids as therapeutic agents in depression. Experimentally phospholipids stimulate the monoaminergic systems and markedly reduce the negative effect of chronic stress on neuronal plasticity, corticosterone secretion and, in a model of neuroinflammation, antagonize the pro-inflammatory cytokines release. The results of the clinical studies performed with PL show that this treatment is well tolerated and effective in ameliorating the symptomatology of patients with different degree of depressed mood. In conclusion on the base of both experimental and clinical data, we propose the use of PL as add-on to ameliorate antidepressant treatment or even using such drugs as monotherapy.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LIFESTYLE MEDICINE
AB  - Sleep disturbances are common in postmenopausal women and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. Sleep apnea may be underdiagnosed in women, and other conditions such as insomnia and restless legs may coexist with sleep apnea. This case illustrates the complex interplay of anatomical, hormonal, metabolic and psychological factors that can interfere with restorative sleep, and the importance of both diagnostic testing and clinical history in identifying which combination of therapies will be most beneficial in improving sleep quality and quantity.

TI  - Psychosocial Outcomes 12 Months Following a Dose-Response Aerobic Exercise Intervention in Postmenopausal Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY & HEALTH
AB  - Background: We previously reported no postintervention differences in quality of life and other psychosocial outcomes when comparing 12-month high versus moderate volume of aerobic exercise in postmenopausal women. Here, we report the 24-month follow-up for these outcomes. Methods: At 24-month follow-up, 333 out of 400 postmenopausal women were randomized to a yearlong intervention of 150 (moderate) or 300 (high) minutes per week of aerobic exercise returned a battery of self-reported measures assessing quality of life, psychosocial outcomes, and sleep quality, also assessed at baseline and postintervention. Intention-to-treat analyses using linear models were conducted to determine the changes between baseline and 24-month follow-up. Results: No significant effects between moderate and high-volume aerobic exercise groups were observed among any outcomes. There was some evidence of effect moderation by baseline body mass index in relation to quality of life, psychosocial outcomes, and sleep quality, where obese women benefitted from the moderate-volume exercise and nonobese women benefitted from the high-volume exercise prescription. Conclusion: Although high-volume aerobic exercise did not improve psychosocial outcomes when compared with moderate volume at the 24-month follow-up, we did observe potential effect of moderation between obese and nonobese women. Confirmation of these interactions is warranted in this population.

TI  - Progesterone-Mediated Inhibition of the GnRH Pulse Generator: Differential Sensitivity as a Function of Sleep Status
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Context: During normal, early puberty, luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency is low while awake but increases during sleep. Mechanisms underlying such changes are unclear, but a small study in early pubertal girls suggested that differential wake-sleep sensitivity to progesterone negative feedback plays a role.
   Objective: To test the hypothesis that progesterone acutely reduces waking LH pulse frequency more than sleep-associated pulse frequency in late pubertal girls.
   Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study.
   Setting: Academic clinical research unit.
   Participants: Eleven normal, postmenarcheal girls, ages 12 to 15 years.
   Intervention: Subjects completed two 18-hour admissions in separate menstrual cycles (cycle days 6 to 11). Frequent blood sampling for LH assessment was performed at 1800 to 1200 hours; sleep was encouraged at 2300 to 0700 hours. Either oral micronized progesterone (0.8 mg/kg/dose) or placebo was given at 0700, 1500, 2300, and 0700 hours, before and during the first admission. A second admission, performed at least 2 months later, was identical to the first except that placebo was exchanged for progesterone or vice versa (treatment crossover).
   Main Outcome Measures: LH pulse frequency during waking and sleeping hours. Results: Progesterone reduced waking LH pulse frequency by 26% (P = 0.019), with no change observed during sleep (P = 0.314). The interaction between treatment condition (progesterone vs placebo) and sleep status (wake vs sleep) was highly significant (P = 0.007).
   Conclusions: In late pubertal girls, progesterone acutely reduced waking LH pulse frequency more than sleep-associated pulse frequency. Differential wake-sleep sensitivity to progesterone negative feedback may direct sleep-wake LH pulse frequency changes across puberty.

TI  - Demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing the incidence of clavicle fractures, a national population-based survey of five hundred and twelve thousand, one hundred and eighty seven individuals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS
AB  - This study aims to investigate the population-based incidence of clavicle fracture and the related risk factors in China.
   All the data on clavicle fractures were available from the China National Fracture Survey (CNFS) database performed in 2015. In the CNFS, all eligible household members were sampled from eight provinces, 24 urban cities, and 24 rural counties in China, using stratified random sampling and the probability proportional to size method. Questionnaires were sent to every participant for data collection. Information on age, gender, height, weight, ethnic group, education, professional, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleeping time per day, dietary habits, and others was collected. Fracture case was identified by patients' self report and further confirmation by medical data.
   A total of 512,187 valid questionnaires were collected, and relevant data were extracted and analyzed. There were 89 patients with 89 clavicle fractures in 2014, indicating that the incidence was 17.4 (95%CI, 13.8-21.0) per 100,000 person-years. Traffic accidents and falls were the most predominant cause for clavicle factures, leading to 91.0% of all the injuries. Over 85% of them occurred on the road and at home. Age of 45-64, average sleep time < seven hours/day, smoking, alcohol consumption and history of previous fracture were identified as independent risk factors for clavicle fracture. Overweight (BMI, 24.0-27.9) was a significant protective factor, which was estimated to reduce 72% of the clavicle fractures, compared to normal BMI (18.5-23.9).
   Public health policies focusing on decreasing alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, and encouraging individuals to obtain sufficient sleep should be implemented. Middle-aged individuals with previous history of fracture should strengthen the awareness of prevention and health care and decrease risky activities to reduce the clavicle fractures.

TI  - Depression and its link to other symptoms in menopausal transition
T2  - MIDDLE EAST FERTILITY SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Menopausal transition may occur between 45 and 55 years old and take 3-9 years. During this transition, the hormonal changes may contribute to the physical and psychological complaints in women. One of the psychological complaints is a sign of depression. However, not all of the women will experience those complaints.
   Objective: To assess the relationship between depression in menopause transition and other menopausal symptoms and factors contribute to depression among Indonesian people.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study on 133 female subjects between 45 and 55 years old. Depression measured using Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and menopausal symptoms were collected using Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). The comparison and relation were assessed for every aspect regarding depression and menopausal symptoms.
   Results: Out of 133 subjects, depression was found in 17 subjects (12.8%). Somato-vegetative symptoms were complained by 50.4% and urogenital symptoms by 75.9% subjects. There was significant correlation between depression and somato-vegetative (p = 0.008) as well as urogenital complaints among women who underwent menopause transition (p = 0.016). These findings were consistent with previous studies.
   Conclusion: Depression on menopausal transition significantly correlated with somato-vegetative and urogenital symptoms among women. Future investigations should be conducted with a cohort design to observe mood alterations during the menopause transition. (C) 2017 Middle East Fertility Society.

TI  - Sex differences in sleep-disordered breathing after stroke: results from the BASIC project
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objective/Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), an independent risk factor for stroke, is associated with worse post-stroke outcomes. Differences in the relationship between SDB and stroke may exist for women versus men. In this population-based study, we compared the prevalence of both pre- and post-stroke SDB by sex. We also explored whether menopausal status is related to post-stroke SDB.
   Patients/Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of subjects enrolled in the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. Each subject (n = 1815) underwent a baseline interview including the Berlin Questionnaire to assess pre-stroke SDB risk and, if relevant, questions regarding menopausal status. Subjects were offered overnight SDB screening with a validated portable respiratory device (n = 832 with complete data). Log Poisson and linear regression models were used to assess the differences in SDB between men and women with adjustment for demographics, stroke risk factors, stroke severity, and other potential confounders.
   Results: Women were less likely than men to be at high risk for pre-stroke SDB (56.6% versus 61.9%) (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.87 for women; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.95). A lower proportion of women than men (50.8% versus 70.2%) had post-stroke SDB by respiratory monitoring (PR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.63-0.80). SDB severity was higher for men than for women (mean difference in respiratory event index [REI] 6.5; 95% CI, 4.3-8.7). No significant association existed between post-stroke SDB and either menopausal status or age at menopause.
   Conclusions: After acute ischemic stroke, SDB was more prevalent and more severe in men than in women. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spectrum of symptoms in women diagnosed with endometriosis during adolescence vs adulthood
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis symptoms often start at a young age, and the time between symptom onset and endometriosis diagnosis can be several years. It is not clear whether the symptoms that are experienced by adolescents differ from adults. Better understanding may shorten the often lengthy delay in diagnosis.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to further elucidate the symptom presentation of adolescents as compared with adults to determine whether differences existed, based on age at surgical diagnosis that could impact time to diagnosis.
   STUDY DESIGN: This investigation was a cross-sectional study at enrollment within a longitudinal cohort of adolescents and women with endometriosis. The population-based cohort was recruited from 2 tertiary care centers and the surrounding communities. Participants included adolescents (diagnosed at <= 18 years old; n = 295) and adults (diagnosed at >18 years old; n = 107) with surgically confirmed endometriosis who were enrolled into The Women's Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood. Participants completed an expanded version of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Bio-banking Harmonization Project standard clinical questionnaire that included items regarding menstrual history, associated symptoms, and pain. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were applied to categoric data; Wilcoxon rank sum tests were applied to continuous data.
   RESULTS: Most participants (90%) experienced moderate-severe menstrual pain. On average, 3 doctors were seen before diagnosis, regardless of age at presentation (range, 0-25 years). Time from symptoms to diagnosis averaged 2 years for adolescents and 5 years for adults (P<.001). More adolescents (50%) than adults (33%) reported pain starting at menarche (P=.002) and nausea accompanying pain (69% vs 53%; P=.01). Noncyclic, general pelvic pain was prevalent. One-half of the participants reported relief of their general pelvic pain after a bowel movement. Pain interfered with work/school, daily activities, exercise, and sleep to a moderate-extreme degree; difficulties were similar by age at diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic pain was severe and noncyclic and negatively impacted quality of life. At our tertiary care centers, symptoms of endometriosis did not differ between women surgically diagnosed during adolescence compared with those diagnosed as adults. Adolescents had more nausea and symptom onset at menarche. Multi-year delays in diagnosis were common. Clinicians should be aware of these alternate symptom patterns and include endometriosis in their differential diagnosis for both adolescent and young adult women who experience noncyclic pelvic pain and nausea.

TI  - Does ovulation affect performance in tennis players?
T2  - BMJ OPEN SPORT & EXERCISE MEDICINE
AB  - Background Scientific data on the performance of collegiate female tennis players during the menstrual phases are scarce.
   Trial design Double-blind, counter-balanced, crossover trials were conducted to examine whether tennis performance was affected during menstruation, with and without dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) supplementation.
   Methods Ten Division 1 collegiate tennis players (aged 18-22 years) were evenly assigned into placebo-supplemented and DHEA-supplemented (25 mg/day) trials. Treatments were exchanged among the participants after a 28-day washout. Tennis serve performance was assessed on the first day of menstrual bleeding (day 0/28) and on days 7, 14 and 21.
   Results Mood state was unaltered during the menstrual cycles in both trials. The lowest tennis serve performance score (speed times accuracy) occurred on day 14 (P=0.06 vs day 0; P=0.01 vs day 21) in both placebo and DHEA trials. Decreased performance on day 14 was explained by decreased accuracy (P=0.03 vs day 0/28; P=0.01 vs day 21), but not velocity itself. Isometric hip strength, but not quadriceps strength, was moderately lower on day 14 (P=0.08). Increasing plasma DHEA-S (by similar to 65%) during the DHEA-supplemented trial had no effects on mood state, sleep quality or tennis serve performance.
   Conclusion We have shown that menses does not affect serve performance of collegiate tennis players. However, the observed decrement in the accuracy of serve speed near ovulation warrants further investigation.

TI  - Vasomotor and physical menopausal symptoms are associated with sleep quality
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Sleep disturbance is one of the common complaints in menopause. This study investigated the relationship between menopausal symptoms and sleep quality in middle-aged women.
   Method
   This cross-sectional observational study involved 634 women aged 44-56 years attending a healthcare center at Kangbuk Samsung Hospitals. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the associations between Menopause-specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) scores and PSQI scores and Menopause-specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) scores.
   Results
   The mean PSQI score was 3.6-2.3, and the rates of poor sleep quality(PSQI score > 5) in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women were 14.4%, 18.2%, and 30.2%, respectively. Total PSQI score, specifically the sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances scores, were significantly increased in postmenopausal women. Multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, marital status, family income, education, employment status, parity, physical activity, depression symptoms, perceived stress and menopausal status showed that higher PSQI score was positively correlated with higher vasomotor(beta = 0.240, P = 0.020) and physical(beta = 0.572, P< 0.001) scores.
   Conclusions
   Vasomotor and physical menopause symptoms was related to poor sleep quality. Effective management strategies aimed at reducing menopausal symptoms may improve sleep quality among women around the time of menopause.

TI  - Domestic light at night and breast cancer risk: a prospective analysis of 105 000 UK women in the Generations Study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Background: Circadian disruption caused by exposure to light at night (LAN) has been proposed as a risk factor for breast cancer and a reason for secular increases in incidence. Studies to date have largely been ecological or case-control in design and findings have been mixed.
   Methods: We investigated the relationship between LAN and breast cancer risk in the UK Generations Study. Bedroom light levels and sleeping patterns at age 20 and at study recruitment were obtained by questionnaire. Analyses were conducted on 105 866 participants with no prior history of breast cancer. During an average of 6.1 years of follow-up, 1775 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), adjusting for potential confounding factors.
   Results: There was no association between LAN level and breast cancer risk overall (highest compared with lowest LAN level at recruitment: HR - 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-1.15), or for invasive (HR - 0.98, 95% CI: 0.85-1.13) or in situ (HR - 0.96, 95% CI: 0.83-1.11) breast cancer, or oestrogen-receptor (ER) positive (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.84-1.14); or negative (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.82-1.65) tumours separately. The findings did not differ by menopausal status. Adjusting for sleep duration, sleeping at unusual times (non-peak sleep) and history of night work did not affect the results. Night waking with exposure to light, occurring around age 20, was associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer (HR for breast cancer overall = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99; HR for ER-positive breast cancer = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.97).
   Conclusions: In this prospective cohort analysis of LAN, there was no evidence that LAN exposure increased the risk of subsequent breast cancer, although the suggestion of a lower breast cancer risk in pre-menopausal women with a history of night waking in their twenties may warrant further investigation.

TI  - Should This Patient Receive Hormone Therapy for Her Menopausal Symptoms? Grand Rounds Discussion From Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Hormone therapy (HT) was widely prescribed in the 1980s and 1990s and has been controversial since the initial results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial in the early 2000s suggested that it increased risk for breast cancer and coronary heart disease and did not prolong life. However, more recent data and reexamination of the WHI results suggest that HT is safe and effective for many women when used around the time of menopause. Two experts debate the 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society, which recommends HT as first-line treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and apply it to the care of Ms. R, a 52-year-old woman with severe hot flashes, sleep disturbance, and irritability.

TI  - Perimenopausal- and postmenopausal sleep disorders. Perspectives of sleep medicine
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
AB  - Insomnia is a common disabling problem during the menopause. Up to 50% of women suffer from problems with initiating or maintaining sleep. Chronic insomnia is a proven risk factor for cardiovascular diseases which underlines the necessity to recognize and treat insomnia. The pathophysiology of sleep disorders during the perimenopause is multifactorial, which is a challenge for the treating physician. Besides insomnia, depression and subjective impairment of cognition play an important role. Also, vasomotor changes, such as hot flashes, perspiration, menstruation irregularities and sexual dysfunction have to be overcome. All of these play a possible role in the development of sleep disorders. Polysomnography is rarely required for the diagnosis of insomnia. Diagnosis is mainly based on medical, psychological, psychiatric and sleep history. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first line therapy in insomnia, but comorbidities play an important role to find the appropriate treatment. It is of importance that insomnia is emphasized as a distinct disorder and treated as such. Owing the complexity and burden of insomnia the presentation to a sleep specialist is often necessary.

TI  - Effects of oral versus transdermal menopausal hormone treatments on self-reported sleep domains and their association with vasomotor symptoms in recently menopausal women enrolled in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS)
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective:This study determined whether two different formulations of hormone therapy (HT): oral conjugated equine estrogens (o-CEE; 0.45mg/d, n=209), transdermal 17-estradiol (t-E2; 50g/d, n=201) plus cyclic progesterone (Prometrium, 200mg) or placebo (PBO, n=243) affected sleep domains in participants of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study.Methods:Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at baseline and during the intervention at 6, 18, 36, and 48 months. Global sleep quality and individual sleep domain scores were compared between treatments using analysis of covariance, and correlated with vasomotor symptom (VMS) scores using Spearman correlation coefficients.Results:Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (mean 6.3; 24% with score >8) were similar across groups at baseline and were reduced (improved sleep quality) by both HT (average change -1.27 [o-CEE] and -1.32 [t-E2]) when compared with PBO (-0.60; P=0.001 [o-CEE vs PBO] and P=0.002 [t-E2 vs PBO]). Domain scores for sleep satisfaction and latency improved with both HT. The domain score for sleep disturbances improved more with t-E2 than o-CEE or PBO. Global sleep scores significantly correlated with VMS severity (r(s)=0.170, P<0.001 for hot flashes; r(s)=0.177, P<0.001 for night sweats). Change in scores for all domains except sleep latency and sleep efficiency correlated with change in severity of VMS.Conclusions:Poor sleep quality is common in recently menopausal women. Sleep quality improved with both HT formulations. The relationship of VMS with domains of sleep suggests that assessing severity of symptoms and domains of sleep may help direct therapy to improve sleep for postmenopausal women.

TI  - Circadian hemodynamics in men and women with high blood pressure: dipper vs. nondipper and racial differences
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION
AB  - Objective: The 'nondipping' pattern of circadian blood pressure (BP) variation is an established independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Although this phenomenon has been widely studied, its underlying circadian hemodynamics of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) have not been well characterized. We evaluated the hypothesis that BP nondipping would be associated with a blunted night-time reduction in SVR in a biracial sample of 140 (63 African-American and 77 white) men and women with elevated clinic BP (130-159/8599 mmHg).
   Methods and results: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory hemodynamics were assessed using standard ambulatory BP monitoring coupled with synchronized ambulatory impedance cardiography. Using the criterion of less than 10% dip in SBP, there were 51 nondippers (SBP dip = 7.3 +/- 2.6%) and 89 dippers (SBP dip = 15.5 +/- 3.4%). There was minimal change in cardiac output from daytime to night-time in both dippers and nondippers. However, SVR decreased from daytime to night-time, but nondippers compared with dippers exhibited a significantly attenuated decrease in SVR from daytime to night-time (7.8 vs. 16.1%, P < 0.001). Relative to their white counterparts, African-Americans also exhibited blunted SBP dipping (10.9 vs. 14.6%, P < 0.001) as well as an attenuated decrease in SVR (10.8 vs. 15.6%, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Overall, these findings indicate that blunted night-time BP dipping is associated with impairment of the systemic vasodilation that is characteristic of the night-time sleep period and is especially prominent among African-Americans. In the context of high BP, these findings suggest that nondipping may be a manifestation, or marker, of more advanced vascular disease.

TI  - Preterm Stress Behaviors, Autonomic Indices, and Maternal Perceptions of Infant Colic
T2  - ADVANCES IN NEONATAL CARE
AB  - Background: While biological and behavioral stress response systems are intact in early gestation, preterm infants' behaviors are often more subtle and difficult to interpret compared with full-term infants. They are also more vulnerable for regulatory issues (ie, colic) that are known to impact caregiver-infant interactions. Biobehavioral measures such as behavioral responsivity and heart rate variability (HRV), particularly cardiac vagal tone, may help elucidate preterm infants' stress/regulatory systems.
   Purpose: To test the hypotheses that preterm infants' consoling behaviors and high-frequency (HF) HRV in the first week of life are significantly associated and they are inverse correlates of future colic risk.
   Methods/Search Strategy: Thirty preterm (mean +/- SE = 32.7 +/- 0.3 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA]) infants underwent direct NIDCAP (Newborn Individualized Development and Assessment Program) observation during routine care and had HRV measurements during their first week postbirth. Sixty-three percent of mothers completed the Infant Colic Scale at 6 to 8 weeks adjusted postnatal age. Nonparametric tests were used to determine associations among behaviors, HRV, and maternal perceptions of infant colic.
   Findings/Results: Self-consoling behaviors were positively associated with HF-HRV (vagal tone). In addition, stress behaviors were positively associated with low-frequency/high-frequency HRV (sympathetic dominance). Infants who displayed more stress behaviors also demonstrated more self-consoling behaviors. No significant associations were found with colic. Implications for Practice: HF-HRV provides information on the infant's capacity to modulate stress and is a useful, noninvasive measure when behaviors are more difficult to discern.
   Implications for Research: Further study in a larger sample is needed to determine whether behavioral stress measures and HF-HRV may be useful to determine colic risk.

TI  - Sleep and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis responses to metyrapone in posttraumatic stress disorder
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Disturbed sleep is a core feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized in part by decreased delta power sleep that may result from stress-related alterations in corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) regulation and glucocorticoid signaling. Overnight HPA axis response mediating sleep disturbances in men and women with PTSD was examined using a metyrapone challenge. Metyrapone blocks cortisol synthesis, removing negative feedback, and increases the release of hypothalamic CRF and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Laboratory-based polysomnography was used to monitor the sleep of 66 medically healthy, medication-free men and pre-menopausal follicular phase women including 33 with chronic PTSD (16 women and 17 men) and 33 age- and sex-matched controls (14 women and 19 men) over 3 consecutive nights. Participants completed an overnight metyrapone challenge after an adaptation and baseline night of sleep and ACTH was obtained by repeated blood sampling. Metyrapone resulted in a greater increase in ACTH and greater decreases in cortisol and delta spectral power sleep in PTSD subjects compared to controls, and a greater increase in ACTH in women compared to men. There was no sex difference in metyrapone effects on delta power sleep, and no significant metyrapone by PTSD by sex interactions with either ACTH or delta power sleep. Regression analyses indicated that a greater increase in ACTH response was associated with a greater decrease in delta power sleep response in PTSD subjects, but no such relationship was found in controls. The PTSD group difference was similar in men and women. These results suggest that stress-related alterations of the HPA axis in PTSD may contribute to sleep difficulties. Therapeutics that target the HPA axis may offer promise as a potential future treatment for PTSD and related sleep difficulties.

TI  - The premenstrual syndromes PMD and PMDD. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder-myth or disorder in need of treatment?
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
AB  - Background. Approximately 70-90% of women of reproductive age have some physical and mental discomfort or dysphoria in the second half of the menstrual cycle, especially in the week before menstruation. Symptoms are often mild, but can be severe enough to substantially affect daily activities. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects 3-8% of premenopausal women. Objective. Premenstrual psychiatric syndromes were not defined by specific criteria until DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edn) in 2013 and will shortly be followed by ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th edn). Thus clinical diagnosis was difficult.
   Material and methods. Diagnostic criteria of PMDD according to DSM-5, etiology and treatment options are reported.
   Results. According to the DSM-5 criteria PMDD is defined as the occurrence of at least five symptoms in most menstrual cycles during the past year, such as affective lability, irritability, depressed mood, anxiety, loss of interest, lethargy, changes in appetite or sleep, loss of control or bloating. These symptoms need to begin the week before and improve a few days after the onset of menstruation (on-off phenomenon). Therapy options include serotonin reuptake inhibitors in continuous and also intermittent intake in the luteal phase as well as oral contraceptives.
   Conclusion. The diagnostic criteria facilitate the diagnosis, e.g., based on a cycle diary and improvement in the treatment of women suffering from PMDD.

TI  - Differences in symptom clusters before and twelve months after breast cancer surgery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
AB  - Purpose: Given the inter-relatedness among symptoms, research efforts are focused on an evaluation of symptom clusters. The purposes of this study were to evaluate for differences in the number and types of menopausal related symptom clusters assessed prior to and at 12-months after surgery using ratings of occurrence and severity and to evaluate for changes in these symptom clusters over time.
   Methods: Prior to and at 12 months after surgery, 392 women with breast cancer completed the Menopausal Symptoms Scale. Exploratory factor analyses were used to identify the symptom clusters.
   Results: Of the 392 women evaluated, the mean number of symptoms (out of 46) was 13.2 (+/- 8.5) at enrollment and 10.9 (+/- 8.2) at 12 months after surgery. Using occurrence and severity, three symptom clusters were identified prior to surgery. Five symptom clusters were identified at 12 months following surgery. Two symptom clusters (i.e., pain/discomfort and hormonal) were relatively stable across both dimensions and time points. Two symptom clusters were relatively stable across both dimensions either prior to surgery (i.e., sleep/psychological/cognitive) or at 12 months after surgery (i.e., sleep). The other four clusters (i.e., irritability, psychological/cognitive, cognitive, psychological) were identified at one time point using a single dimension.
   Conclusions: While some menopausal-related symptom clusters were consistent across time and dimensions, the majority of symptoms clustered together differently depending on whether they were evaluated prior to or at 12 months after breast cancer surgery. An increased understanding of how symptom clusters change over time may assist clinicians to focus their symptom assessments and management strategies.

TI  - Association between obesity and sleep disorders in postmenopausal women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective:To investigate the relationship between obesity and sleep architecture in postmenopausal women.Methods:One hundred seven postmenopausal women from the Ambulatory of Integrative Treatment for Female Sleep Disorders were invited by telephone to participate in this study. Fifty-three completed the study. We included women aged 50 to 70 years, and excluded women on hormone therapy or missing data. The study consisted of two meetings, including a full-night polysomnography. Menopause status was confirmed by amenorrhea for at least 1 year. Anthropometric measurements included: body mass, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and neck circumference. Participants were allocated into two groups according to BMI: nonobese group (BMI <30kg/m(2)) and obese group (BMI 30kg/m(2)).Results:The obese group had significantly (P<0.01) increased values of BMI, neck circumference, waist circumference, and hip circumference. WHR was similar between the groups (P=0.77). Obese participants had significantly increased values of respiratory disturbance index (16.4 vs 9.3n degrees/h) and apnea-hypopnea index (14.2 vs 5.6n degrees/h). Rapid eye movement sleep latency was positively correlated to body mass (r=P<0.01), BMI (P<0.01), and hip circumference (P=0.01). WHR was negatively correlated to sleep efficiency (P=0.03). The linear regression model showed that BMI (P<0.01) and WHR (P<0.01) were positive predictors of rapid eye movement sleep latency.Conclusion:In postmenopausal women, high BMI and abdominal obesity are sources of sleep disturbances, decreasing deep sleep, and sleep efficiency, while increasing the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.

TI  - Daily inspiratory muscle training lowers blood pressure and vascular resistance in healthy men and women
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Previous work has shown that inspiratory muscle training (IMT) lowers blood pressure after a mere 6weeks, identifying IMT as a potential therapeutic intervention to prevent or treat hypertension. Here, we explore the effects of IMT on respiratory muscle strength and select cardiovascular parameters in recreationally active men and women. Subjects were randomly assigned to IMT (n=12, 75% maximal inspiratory pressure) or sham training (n=13, 15% maximal inspiratory pressure) groups and underwent a 6-week intervention comprising 30breathsday(-1), 5daysweek(-1). Pre- and post-training measures included maximal inspiratory pressure and resting measures of blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity and systemic vascular resistance. We evaluated psychological and sleep status via administration of the Cohen-Hoberman inventory of physical symptoms and the Epworth sleepiness scale. Male and female subjects in the IMT group showed declines in systolic/diastolic blood pressures (-4.3/-3.9mmHg, P<0.025) and systemic vascular resistance (-3.5mmHgminl(-1), P=0.008) at week 6. There was no effect of IMT on cardiac output (P=0.722), heart rate (P=0.795) or spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (P=0.776). The IMT subjects also reported fewer stress-related symptoms (pre- versus post-training, 12.5 +/- 8.5 versus 7.2 +/- 9.7, P=0.025). Based on these results, we suggest that a short course of IMT confers significant respiratory and cardiovascular improvements and parallel (modest) psychological benefits in healthy men and women.

TI  - Effect of sleep curtailment on dietary behavior and physical activity: A randomized crossover trial
T2  - PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR
AB  - Our objective was to clarify the effect of sleep curtailment on energy intake (EI) and physical activity under freeliving conditions. Participants were 16 healthy women aged 21-22 years. A randomized crossover trial design was used to compare a short sleep condition (SS): 4 h/night (2:00-6:00) and a control sleep condition (CS): 7 h/night (23:00-6:00). Each condition comprised 3 consecutive nights. Sleep duration was assessed using a wristwatch-type accelerometer at home. All living activities except sleeping were free-living. Physical, activity was assessed using a tri-axial accelerometer,, and was categorized by intensity level (sedentary; sedentary to light; moderate to vigorous). Participants were asked to purchase and consume meals with visible nutrient information. EI was evaluated by adding values from these food labels. Mean sleep duration in the two conditions was significantly different (4.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.4 h, p < 0.01). For the shared wakefulness period in the two conditions (6:00-23:00), step counts and physical activity were not significantly different. Sedentary time (878 +/- 61 vs. 727 +/- 40 min, p < 0.01), and sedentary to light-intensity activity time (1122 +/- 18 vs. 932 +/- 63 min, p < 0.01) were significantly increased in SS (waking time, 06:00-02:00) compared with CS (waking time, 06:00-23:00). However, these significant effects were clearly attenuated after adjustment for awake time (p > 0.05). Total EI was not significantly different between conditions (8.64 +/- 0.82 vs. 8.46 +/- 1.28 MJ, p > 0.05), nor were leptin levels (p > 0.05), but insulin and cortisol levels after SS were significantly higher than after CS (p < 0.05). In this study, physical activity was increased in the SS condition and attributed to differences in awake time between conditions. However, there were no differences in EI. Further studies to investigate the effect of sleep curtailment on weight gain through stress and insulin resistance are necessary.

TI  - Quality of life among postmenopausal women enrolled in the Minnesota Green Tea Trial
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - Background: Postmenopausal symptomatology has not been elucidated in large, long-term human clinical trials. Our objective was to measure quality of life in postmenopausal women aged 50-70 years.
   Methods: A Menopause-Specific Quality of Life-Intervention (MENQOL) questionnaire was completed by women enrolled in the Minnesota Green Tea Trial (n = 932) to assess vasomotor, physical, sexual, and psychosocial symptoms in the years following menopause. Responses were coded; mean overall and domain scores ranged from 1 to 8. A higher score indicated more severe symptoms.
   Results: Mean overall MENQOL scores were highest in women aged 50-54.9 years. A pattern of reduced symptom severity with increasing age was observed overall and within each domain. Women aged 50-54.9 years had more severe night sweats and sweating than other age groups (P <= 0.001) and more severe hot flashes than women aged >= 60 years (P << 0.001). No differences between age groups were seen on mean score in the Sexual domain. Compared with women aged 50.0-54.9 years (the reference group), study participants aged 60-64.9 and >= 65 years had lower MENQOL scores in the Psychosocial domain (P = 0.029 and P << 0.001). Women aged 50-54.9 years had more severe symptoms related to negative mood than women >= 65 years (P <= 0.009). Compared with women aged 50-54.9 years, those in the age groups 60-64.9 and >= 65 years had lower scores for "poor memory" (2.98 +/- 1.75 and 2.66 +/- 1.68 vs. 3.43 +/- 1.87, P << 0.001). Women >= 65 years reported lower scores for "feeling tired or worn out", "difficulty sleeping", and "lack of energy" than all other age groups (P <= 0.003).
   Conclusion: The findings of this descriptive analysis of postmenopausal women may help clinicians counsel women about expectations and treatment options to address menopause-associated symptoms and the relationship between postmenopausal symptoms and overall health.

TI  - Spa therapy (balneotherapy) relieves mental stress, sleep disorder, and general health problems in sub-healthy people
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
AB  - To investigate the relieving effects of hot spring balneotherapy on mental stress, sleep disorder, general health problems, and women's health problems in sub-healthy people, we recruited 500 volunteers in sub-health in Chongqing, and 362 volunteers completed the project, including 223 in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. The intervention group underwent hot spring balneotherapy for 5 months, while the control group did not. The two groups took questionnaire investigation (general data, mental stress, emotional status, sleep quality, general health problems, as well as some women's health problems) and physical examination (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood lipid, blood sugar) 5 months before and after the intervention, respectively. After intervention, sleep disorder (difficulty in falling asleep (P = 0.017); dreaminess, nightmare suffering, and restless sleep (P = 0.013); easy awakening (P = 0.003) and difficulty in falling into sleep again after awakening(P = 0.016); and mental stress (P = 0.031) and problems of general health (head pain (P = 0.026), joint pain(P = 0.009), leg or foot cramps (P = 0.001), blurred vision (P = 0.009)) were relieved significantly in the intervention group, as compared with the control group. While other indicators (fatigue, eye tiredness, limb numbness, constipation, skin allergy) and women's health problems (breast distending pain; dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation) were relieved significantly in the self-comparison of the intervention group before and after intervention (P < 0.05), but showed no statistically significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). All indications (except bad mood, low mood, and worry or irritability) in the intervention group significantly improved, with effect size from 0.096 to 1.302. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the frequency, length, and location of balneotherapy in the intervention group were the factors influencing emotion, sleep, and health condition (P < 0.05). Relief of insomnia, fatigue, and leg or foot cramps was greater in old-age group than in young-aged group (P < 0.05). Physical examination found that waist circumferences in women of various ages under 55 years were significantly reduced in the intervention group (P < 0.05), while that in men did not significantly change (P > 0.05). Spa therapy (balneotherapy) relieves mental stress, sleep disorder, general health, and reduces women's waist circumferences in sub-healthy people.

TI  - Sleep-Wake Disturbance A systematic review of evidence-based interventions for management in patients with cancer
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
AB  - BACKGROUND: New or worsening sleep-wake disturbance (SWD) can occur throughout the cancer trajectory.
   OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to critically review available empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions for SWD, highlighting new evidence since the 2006 and 2009 Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) SWD publications.
   METHODS: A systematic review of studies published from 2009-2017 was conducted to identify effective interventions for cancer-related SWD. The PEP weight of evidence classification schema was used to categorize the strength of evidence.
   FINDINGS: Cognitive behavioral intervention/approach is the only intervention that is recommended for practice. Mindfulness-based stress reduction and exercise interventions are likely to be effective but require more evidence. Pharmacologic interventions, relaxation, imagery, meditation, acupuncture, yoga, massage, and psychoeducation have insufficient evidence.

TI  - Real-world experience of women using extended-cycle vs monthly-cycle combined oral contraception in the United States: the National Health and Wellness Survey
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: The real-world experience of women receiving extended-cycle combined oral contraception (COC) versus monthly-cycle COC has not been reported.
   Methods: Data were from the United States 2013 National Health and Wellness Survey. Eligible women (18-50 years old, premenopausal, without hysterectomy) currently using extended-cycle COC (3 months between periods) were compared with women using monthly-cycle COC. Treatment satisfaction (1 "extremely dissatisfied" to 7 "extremely satisfied"), adherence (8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (c)), menstrual cycle-related symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health state utilities (Medical Outcomes Short Form Survey-36v2 (R)), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), sleep difficulties, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-General Health, and healthcare resource use were assessed using one-way analyses of variance, chi-square tests, and generalized linear models (adjusted for covariates).
   Results: Participants included 260 (6.7%) women using extended-cycle and 3616 (93.3%) using monthly-cycle COC. Women using extended-cycle COC reported significantly higher treatment satisfaction (P = 0.001) and adherence (P = 0.04) and reduced heavymenstrual bleeding (P = 0.029). A non-significant tendency toward reduced menstrual pain (39.5% versus 47.3%) and menstrual cycle-related symptoms (40.0% versus 48.7%) was found in women using extended-cycle versus monthly-cycle COC. Significantly more women using extended-cycle COC reported health-related diagnoses, indicating preferential prescription for extended-cycle COC among women reporting more health problems. Consistent with this poorer health, more women using extended-cycle COC reported fatigue, headache, and activity impairment (P values < 0.05). There were no other significant differences between groups.
   Conclusions: This real-world observational study supports extended-cycle COC as a valuable treatment option with high satisfaction, high adherence, and reduced heavy menstrual bleeding.

TI  - Brain Structure and Function in Women with Comorbid Bipolar and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Introduction: Hormonal fluctuations associated with female reproductive life events may precipitate or worsen affective episodes in women with bipolar disorder (BD). Previous studies have shown that women with BD report higher rates of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) than controls. Further, bipolar women who report premenstrual worsening of mood display a worse course of their bipolar illness. Despite this, the neural correlates of comorbid BD and PMDD have not been investigated.
   Methodology: Eighty-five [CTRL, n = 25; PMDD, n = 20; BD, n = 21; BD with comorbid PMDD (BDPMDD), n = 19], regularly cycling women, not on hormonal contraception, underwent two MRI scans: during their mid-follicular and late luteal menstrual phases. We investigated resting-state functional connectivity (Rs-FC), cortical thickness, and subcortical volumes of brain regions associated with the pathophysiology of BD and PMDD between groups, in the mid-follicular and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. All BD subjects were euthymic for at least 2 months prior to study entry.
   Results: Women in the BDPMDD group displayed greater disruption in biological rhythms and more subthreshold depressive and anxious symptoms through the menstrual cycle compared to other groups. Rs-FC was increased between the L-hippocampus and R-frontal cortex and decreased between the R-hippocampus and R-premotor cortex in BDPMDD vs. BD (FDR-corrected, p < 0.05). Cortical thickness analysis revealed decreased cortical thickness of the L-pericalcarine, L-superior parietal, R-middle temporal, R-rostral middle frontal, and L-superior frontal, as well as increased cortical thickness of the L-superior temporal gyri in BDPMDD compared to BD. We also found increased left-caudate volume in BDPMDD vs. BD (p(CORR) < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Women with BD and comorbid PMDD display a distinct clinical and neurobiological phenotype of BD, which suggests differential sensitivity to endogenous hormones.

TI  - Effect of soy lecithin on fatigue and menopausal symptoms in middle-aged women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
T2  - NUTRITION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Lecithin is a complex mixture of phospholipids which compose lipid bilayer cell membranes. Lipid replacement therapy, or administration of phospholipids for the purpose of repairing the dmaged cell membranes, had been shown to alleviate fatigue. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of soy lecithin on fatigue in middle-aged women, as well as other menopausal symptoms and various health parameters.
   Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 96 women aged 40 to 60 years who complained of fatigue. The participants were randomized to receive active tablets containing high-dose (1200 mg/day; n = 32) or low-dose (600 mg/day; n = 32) soy lecithin, or placebo (n = 32), for 8 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated: age, menopausal status, lifestyle factors, physical and psychological symptoms of menopause, subjective symptoms of insomnia and fatigue, body composition, cardiovascular parameters, and physical activities and objective sleep states obtained from actigraphy before and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. Fatigue was evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS)-brief, Menopausal Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Brief Fatigue Inventory.
   Results: Eighty-nine women completed the study. There were no significant differences in the changes in Chalder Fatigue Scale score (placebo vs low-dose vs high-dose groups: -2.9 +/- 1.1, -3.2 +/- 1.1, and -3.5 +/- 1.0; P=0.79). On the other hand, the improvements were greater in the high-dose group compared with the placebo group concerning vigor scores in the POMS-brief (1.9 +/- 0.7 vs 0.2 +/- 0.6; P = 0.02), diastolic blood pressure (-4.1 +/- 1.8 vs 1.2 +/- 1.9; P =0.05), and cardio-ankle vascular index (-0.4 +/- 0.2 vs 0.07 +/- 0.1; P = 0.03) after 8 weeks of treatment.
   Conclusions: High-dose (1200 mg/day) soy lecithin not only increases vigor, but also lowers the diastolic blood pressure and cardio-ankle vascular index in middle-aged women who present with fatigue.

TI  - Therapeutic tactics in the hypothalamic syndrome of puberty in girls.
T2  - MEDICAL PERSPECTIVES-MEDICNI PERSPEKTIVI
AB  - Hypothalamic syndrome of puberty (HSP) is a pathological symptom complex that occurs as a result of dysfunction of hypothalamus, pituitary gland and other endocrine glands during puberty. Purpose - to improve the therapeutic tactics in patients with HSP based on the results of study of the clinical course of the disease, the state of the nervous and endocrine systems. The study included 125 patients aged 11-17 years with HSP, divided into two clinical groups: 50 patients aged 11-14 years and 75 girls aged 15-17 years. The examination included the collection of anamnesis, anthropometric, general clinical and gynecological examination, the study of hormonal profile, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, instrumental studies, consultations of a neurologist, endocrinologist. It was found that the formation and course of HSP in girls during puberty occurs against a background of perinatal hypoxic involvement of the central nervous system, early obesity, viral loads, disorders of menstrual function, increased secretion of prolactin, androgens, cortisol and reduced level of estradiol. Neurofunctional research methods confirmed the functional nature of changes in the central nervous system in patients with hypothalamic syndrome of puberty. HSP therapy should be comprehensive and systematic, including normalization of body weight, correction of nutrition, mental and physical activity, sleep, thyroid function, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, menstrual cycle. In the follow-up dynamics after 2-3 courses of therapy (on average 6-15 months), restoration of the menstrual cycle was observed in all 25 (100%) patients with secondary amenorrhea and regression of cystic ovarian formations in all 11 (100%) patients. Weight loss was noted in most patients with overweight and obesity in 70 (92.1%) cases.

TI  - Modeling Individual Cyclic Variation in Human Behavior
T2  - WEB CONFERENCE 2018: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW2018)
AB  - Cycles are fundamental to human health and behavior. Examples include mood cycles, circadian rhythms, and the menstrual cycle. However, modeling cycles in time series data is challenging because in most cases the cycles are not labeled or directly observed and need to be inferred from multidimensional measurements taken over time. Here, we present Cyclic Hidden Markov Models (CyHMMs) for detecting and modeling cycles in a collection of multidimensional heterogeneous time series data. In contrast to previous cycle modeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered in modeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with both discrete and continuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data; and they can share information across individuals to accommodate variation both within and between individual time series.
   Experiments on synthetic and real-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengths more accurately than existing methods, with 58% lower error on simulated data and 63% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performing baseline. CyHMMs can also perform functions which baselines cannot: they can model the progression of individual features/symptoms over the course of the cycle, identify the most variable features, and cluster individual time series into groups with distinct characteristics. Applying CyHMMs to two real-world health-tracking datasets-of human menstrual cycle symptoms and physical activity tracking data-yields important insights including which symptoms to expect at each point during the cycle. We also find that people fall into several groups with distinct cycle patterns, and that these groups differ along dimensions not provided to the model. For example, by modeling missing data in the menstrual cycles dataset, we are able to discover a medically relevant group of birth control users even though information on birth control is not given to the model.

TI  - Female Sex and Alzheimer's Risk: The Menopause Connection
T2  - JPAD-JOURNAL OF PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Along with advanced age and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-4 genotype, female sex is a major risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering that AD pathology begins decades prior to clinical symptoms, the higher risk in women cannot simply be accounted for by their greater longevity as compared to men. Recent investigation into sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms behind AD risk has implicated the menopause transition (MT), a midlife neuroendocrine transition state unique to females. Commonly characterized as ending in reproductive senescence, many symptoms of MT are neurological, including disruption of estrogen-regulated systems such as thermoregulation, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as depression and impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Preclinical studies have shown that, during MT, the estrogen network uncouples from the brain bioenergetic system. The resulting hypometabolic state could serve as the substrate for neurological dysfunction. Indeed, translational brain imaging studies demonstrate that 40-60 year-old perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exhibit an AD-endophenotype characterized by decreased metabolic activity and increased brain amyloid-beta deposition as compared to premenopausal women and to age-matched men. This review discusses the MT as a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions to compensate for brain bioenergetic crisis and combat the subsequent increased risk for AD in women.

TI  - Metabolic and neurobehavioral response following intraovarian administration of autologous activated platelet rich plasma: First qualitative data
T2  - NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This work assessed sexual and neurobehavioral parameters after ovarian treatment with autologous PRP.
   DESIGN: Questionnaire study.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients receiving ovarian PRP injection (n=80) due to low ovarian reserve and/or at least 1 prior failed IVF cycle were sampled. Pre- and post-treatment levels in self-reported daily energy, sleep quality, skin tone/hair thickness/nail growth, cognitive clarity, menstrual pattern, cervical mucus/vaginal lubrication, libido, sexual activity, ability to achieve orgasm, and overall sexual experience were measured.
   RESULTS: Mean +/- SD age and baseline BMI among patients were 45.5 +/- 6yrs and 25 +/- 5.1 kg/m(2), respectively. Average weight loss after ovarian PRP was 1kg (p=0.056). After ovarian PRP, superior nail growth, skin tone, and hair thickness was observed by 46.3% of patients [95% CI=35%, 57.8%]; the same ratio experienced increased "clarity of thinking" following the procedure. Irregular or absent menses affected 56.3% of patients at enrollment, and menses returned or cyclicity improved in 24.4% after treatment [95% CI=12.9%, 39.5%]. Increased post-treatment vaginal lubrication/cervical mucus production was reported by 51.3% of women [95% CI=39.8%, 62.6%] accompanied by increased libido in 55% [95% CI=43.5%, 66.2%]. More frequent sexual activity after ovarian PRP was noted from 46.3% of subjects [95% CI=35%, 57.8%] coinciding with a 45% improvement in overall sexual experience before vs. after ovarian PRP [95% CI=33.9%, 56.5%].
   CONCLUSION: This investigation is the first to document responses across neurobehavioral and metabolic parameters after ovarian PRP. Injection of PRP-derived growth factors directly into ovarian tissue seems to enable a local signaling milieu favoring development of hormonally active ovarian elements, thus "re-potentiating" low or absent reserve.

TI  - Girls' Menstrual Management in Five Districts of Nepal: Implications for Policy and Practice
T2  - STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE
AB  - Discriminatory practices related to menstruation affect the social, mental and physical wellbeing of girls in many low- and middle-income countries. We conducted mixed methods research in five districts of Nepal to explore how menstruation affected girls' ability to fully participate in school and community life. We conducted 860 structured interviews, 26 group interviews and 10 focus group discussions with schoolgirls in rural areas. 14 semi-structured interviews with girls' mothers, and 10 interviews with health teachers. Girls in all districts experienced social, material and information barriers to confident menstrual management. Menstrual blood was believed to carry diseases, and girls' movement was restricted to contain ritual pollution and protect them from illness, spirit possession, and sexual experiences. Taboos prevented girls from worshipping in temples or in their home, and some girls were not allowed to enter the kitchen, or sleep in their home while menstruating. Teachers and parents felt unprepared to answer questions about menstruation and focused on the maintenance of restrictions. Teachers and students were embarrassed discussing menstruation in school and classes were not questiondriven or skills-based. Gender disaggregated teaching of menstruation and engagement of health facility staff may have positive effects. Community participatory approaches that engage girls, their families and the wider community are necessary to address harmful cultural practices. Cross-sectoral approaches to provide clean, private, safe spaces for girls and increased availability of preferred materials could enable confident menstrual management.

TI  - Association of Menopausal Symptoms with Different Constitutions in Climacteric Women
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE RESEARCH
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the body constitution and menopausal symptoms in climacteric women. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 427 women aged 40-60 years from the hospital and nearby community. In addition to filling out a questionnaire on menopause rating scale - Traditional Chinese version, the participants completed the body constitution questionnaire. This classifies a person to 1 or more of 3 imbalanced constitutional types, which are yin-xu, yang-xu and stasis-stagnation. We constructed logistic regression models to estimate probabilities of the menopausal symptoms among climacteric women presenting with various menopausal status and differing body constitutions. Results: The frequency and scores of the yin-xu, yang-xu, and stasis-stagnation constitutions were significantly higher in perimenopausal and postmenopausal than premenopausal women. Compared to the non-constitution women, the odds ratio of having hot flushes, sleeping disorders, sexual problems, irritability, and anxiety were significantly higher with the yin-xu constitution. The women with a yang-xu constitution had significantly higher odds ratios for having bladder problems, muscle and joint problems, depressive mood, and heart discomfort. Symptoms of heart discomfort, physical and mental exhaustion, and sleeping disorders were correlated to the stasis-stagnation constitution. Conclusion: With the additional key symptoms related to the 3 constitutional types, physicians performing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are able to diagnose the menopausal syndrome more accurately. Integrating menopausal symptoms with TCM constitutional theory will contribute to a more rapid diagnosis and treatment of menopausal syndrome. (c) 2018 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg

TI  - Sleep Disturbances in Midlife Women at the Cusp of the Menopausal Transition
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: To compare causes of sleep disturbance and to compare self-reported sleep duration among groups of late premenopausal women and early perimenopausal women.
   Methods: In a longitudinal study of a community-based sample of healthy women 40 to 50 years of age, menstrual cycle and symptom data were collected every 2 months; anthropometric measures, a urine sample for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) measures were collected every 6 months.
   Results: At 12 to 18 months, 206 women remained premenopausal and 69 women became perimenopausal. Poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5) was experienced by 42% of the total cohort. Awakening to use the bathroom was the most frequent reason (81%) for sleep disturbance in the entire cohort, followed by feeling too hot (26 degrees/4. However, premenopausal women were significantly more likely to awaken to use the bathroom than perimenopausal women (P = .047), and perimenopausal women were more likely than premenopausal women to awaken because of feeling too hot (P = .002). Women in early perimenopause reported shorter sleep duration (P = .007) and worse sleep quality (P = .05) than premenopausal women of similar age.
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbance is a significant issue for midlife women regardless of age or reproductive stage. Identification of salient factors that disrupt sleep, such as nocturia prior to menopausal transition or feeling too hot early in menopausal transition, will provide direction for developing tailored intervention strategies to improve sleep and quality of life.

TI  - Sex-dependent correlation between survival and expression of genes related to the circadian oscillator in patients with colorectal cancer
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Recent evidence supports the important role of the circadian system in cancer progression in humans. The aim of the present study is to evaluate clock (cry1, cry2 and per2) and clock-controlled (vascular endothelial growth factor-a, early growth response protein 1 and estrogen receptor beta) gene expression in colorectal cancer and adjacent tissue and identify a possible link between survival of patients and expression of above mentioned genes. The study includes 64 patients of both sexes with previously diagnosed colorectal cancer. RNA was extracted from the tumor tissue and adjacent parts of the resected colon, and real-time PCR was used for detection of clock gene expression. Expression of cry2 and per2 was significantly downregulated in tumor tissue compared to adjacent tissues. After splitting of the cohort according to sex, we detected downregulated levels of cry2 and per2 in male patients, but not in females. Splitting of male and female sub-cohorts according to presence of metastases revealed significant donwregulation of cry2 expression in female patients without distant metastasis. Better survival rate was associated with low expression of cry2 in female patients. Moreover, we observed an increase in cry1 expression in female patients with distant metastases in tumor compared to adjacent tissue. Accordingly, women with high expression of cry1 in tumor tissue displayed worse survival, which was not observed in men. Taken together, expression of clock and clock-controlled genes in tumors of males and females clustered according to presence of distant metastases correlated with survival analysis. Studied clock-controlled genes also showed sex-dependent changes. Low expression of vegf-a in tumor correlated with better survival in men but not in women. High expression of estrogen receptor beta mRNA was related to better survival in women but not in men. Low expression of vegf-a, egr1 and estrogen receptor beta
   was associated with worse survival in women compared to men. Our data indicate sex-dependent associations between clock and clock-controlled gene expression in cancer tissue and patient's survival prognosis.

TI  - Dysautonomia in the pathogenesis of migraine
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction: Migraine is a common complex neurological disorder involving multiple brain areas that regulate autonomic, affective, cognitive, and sensory functions. This review explores autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in migraine headache sufferers.
   Areas covered: Reference material for this review was obtained through PubMed searches. Migraine attacks can present with up to 4 phases (premonitory, aura, headache, postdrome) each with distinguishable signs and symptoms. Altered ANS tone can be found from the premonitory through the postdrome phases. Features of the migraine attack that are indicative of altered autonomic function, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria, eyelid edema, conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, and ptosis, are discussed and putative mechanisms explored. In addition, alteration of ANS function by endogenous and exogenous stressors, such as bright lights, hunger, poor sleep quality, menses, and special dietary components is discussed. The influence of currently employed pharmacological treatments on altered autonomic function during the migraine attack is explored.
   Expert commentary: Migraine-related alterations in ANS function have a complex pattern, but, in general, an imbalance occurs between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Through an improved understanding the role of autonomic changes in pathogenesis of migraine, it may be possible to develop even more effective treatments for migraine sufferers.

TI  - Correlation between allopregnanolone levels and depressive symptoms during late menopausal transition and early postmenopause
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: This observational, cross-sectional study included 140 women with climacteric symptoms. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between the presence and severity of depressive symptoms and allopregnanolone levels in women during late menopausal transition and early postmenopause.Methods: The study group was divided into two groups: 45 women in late menopausal transition and 95 early postmenopausal women. We evaluated Kupperman index, Hamilton scale and serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, 17-estradiol, prolactin, total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and allopregnanolone levels.Results: We found that serum allopregnanolone concentration was lower in early postmenopausal women compared to women in late menopausal transition; that there was a correlation between serum allopregnanolone levels in early postmenopausal women and time since last menstruation, intensity of climacteric symptoms, and intensity of depression symptoms and that there was a correlation between serum allopregnanolone levels and several depression symptoms presence (shallow sleep and symptoms of the digestive tract in women during late menopause transition; feelings of guilt, sleep disorders and general somatic symptoms in early postmenopausal women).Conclusion: We concluded that reproductive aging is characterized by a reduction of allopregnanolone circulating levels that correlate to Hamilton depression index in early postmenopause and presence of specific depressive symptoms during late menopausal transition and early postmenopause.

TI  - Sleep and Breast Cancer in the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Study Objectives: Night shift work is associated with increased breast cancer risk, possibly from altered sleep. Epidemiologic evidence is sparse regarding sleep disturbances and breast cancer tumor markers. We examined sleep disturbance in association with breast tumor aggressiveness and mortality following diagnosis.
   Methods: We analyzed associations of measures of sleep disturbance in a sample of 1,122 incident breast cancer cases from the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) Study. Sleep disturbance was assessed using self-administered questionnaires; responses about difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently, having trouble staying asleep, and waking up feeling tired and worn out were used to create a summary sleep disturbance score. We used general linear models to examine associations of sleep disturbance with markers of tumor aggressiveness among cases: estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status; tumor size, stage, grade, lymph node involvement, and presence of metastasis. In addition, we examined the association between sleep disturbance and survival using Cox regression.
   Results: Among breast cancer cases, sleep disturbance was higher for women with ER-/PR-tumors compared to women with ER+/PR+ tumors, even after adjusting for potential covariates (P for trend = .02).Results suggest that the association of sleep quality differs by menopausal status, where mild sleep disturbance is associated with higher breast cancer mortality in premenopausal women; however, we had a relatively small sample size.
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbance may be associated with aggressive subtypes of breast cancer; however, further studies are needed.

TI  - Influence of Sleep Stage on LH Pulse Initiation in the Normal Late Follicular Phase and in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
T2  - NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Objective: During the early follicular phase, sleep-related luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse initiation is positively associated with brief awakenings but negatively associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The relationship between sleep architecture and LH pulse initiation has not been assessed in other cycle stages or in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Design and Methods: We performed concomitant frequent blood sampling (LH pulse analysis) and polysomnography on 8 normal women (cycle day 7-11) and 7 women with PCOS (at least cycle day 7). Results: In the normal women, the 5 min preceding LH pulses contained more wake epochs and fewer REM epochs than the 5 min preceding randomly determined time points (wake: 22.3 vs. 9.1%, p = 0.0111; REM: 4.4 vs. 18.8%, p = 0.0162). However, LH pulse initiation was not related to wake or REM epochs in PCOS; instead, the 5 min preceding LH pulses contained more slow-wave sleep (SWS) than the 5 min before random time points (20.9 vs. 6.7%, p = 0.0089). Compared to the normal subjects, the women with PCOS exhibited a higher REM-associated LH pulse frequency (p = 0.0443) and a lower proportion of wake epochs 0-5 min before LH pulses (p = 0.0205). Conclusions: Sleep-related inhibition of LH pulse generation during the later follicular phase is normally weakened by brief awakenings and strengthened by REM sleep. In women with PCOS, LH pulse initiation is not appropriately discouraged by REM sleep and may be encouraged by SWS; these abnormalities may contribute to a high sleep-related LH pulse frequency in PCOS.

TI  - Comparison of the effect of lavender and bitter orange on sleep quality in postmenopausal women: A triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - This trial compared the effects of lavender and bitter orange on sleep quality in postmenopausal women. This trial was conducted in 2015. Eligible postmenopausal women were allocated into one of two intervention groups or a control group (n=52 per group) in a 1:1:1 ratio using a randomized block design. Intervention groups received 500mg capsules containing only bitter orange or lavender flower powder, and the control group received 500mg capsules containing starch. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory was used before and eight weeks after starting the intervention. Data analyses were based on intention to treat. A one-way ANOVA showed a slightly significant difference in mean sleep score among the three groups before the intervention (p=.045). The general linear model, adjusted for baseline sleep score and confounding factors, showed significant differences among the groups in the mean sleep score after eight weeks of treatment (p<.001). Bitter orange and lavender significantly improved the mean sleep score compared with the control group (p<.001 and p=.003, respectively). The positive effect of bitter orange and lavender on sleep quality in postmenopausal women suggests that they can be used to improve sleep quality in such women.

TI  - Eszopiclone for insomnia
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Insomnia is a major public health issue affecting between 6% to 10% of the adult population in Western countries. Eszopiclone is a hypnotic drug belonging to a newer group of hypnotic agents, known as new generation hypnotics, which was marketed as being just as effective as benzodiazepines for this condition, while being safer and having a lower risk for abuse and dependence. It is the aim of the review to integrate evidence from randomised controlled trials and to draw conclusions on eszopiclone's efficacy and safety profile, while taking methodological features and bias risks into consideration.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy and safety of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia compared to placebo or active control.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and registry databases WHO trials portal, ClinicalTrials.gov) with results incorporated from searches to 10 February 2016. To identify trials not registered in electronic databases, we contacted key informants and searched reference lists of identified studies. We ran an update search (21 February 2018) and have placed studies of interest in awaiting classification/ongoing studies. These will be incorporated into the next version of the review, as appropriate.
   Selection criteria
   Parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eszopiclone with either placebo or active control were included in the review. Participants were adults with insomnia, as diagnosed with a standardised diagnostic system, including primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently extracted outcome data; one reviewer assessed trial quality and the second author cross-checked it.
   Main results
   A total of 14 RCTs, with 4732 participants, were included in this review covering short-term (<= 4 weeks; 6 studies), medium-term (> 4 weeks <= 6 months; 6 studies) and long-term treatment (> 6 months; 2 studies) with eszopiclone. Most RCTs included in the review included participants aged between 18 and 64 years, three RCTs only included elderly participants (64 to 85 years) and one RCT included participants with a broader age range (35 to 85 years). Seven studies considered primary insomnia; the remaining studies considered secondary insomnia comorbid with depression (2), generalised anxiety (1), back pain (1), Parkinson's disease (1), rheumatoid arthritis (1) and menopausal transition (1).
   Meta-analytic integrations of participant-reported data on sleep efficacy outcomes demonstrated better results for eszopiclone compared to placebo: a 12-minute decrease of sleep onset latency (mean difference (MD)-11.94 min, 95% confidence interval (CI)-16.03 to -7.86; 9 studies, 2890 participants, moderate quality evidence), a 17-minute decrease of wake time after sleep onset (MD-17.02 min, 95% CI-24.89 to -9.15; 8 studies, 2295 participants, moderate quality evidence) and a 28-minute increase of total sleep time (MD 27.70 min, 95% CI 20.30 to 35.09; 10 studies, 2965 participants, moderate quality evidence). There were no significant changes from baseline to the first three nights after drug discontinuation for sleep onset latency (MD 17.00 min, 95% CI-4.29 to 38.29; 1 study, 291 participants, low quality evidence) and wake time after sleep onset (MD-6.71 min, 95% CI-21.25 to 7.83; 1 study, 291 participants, low quality evidence). Adverse events during treatment that were documented more frequently under eszopiclone compared to placebo included unpleasant taste (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.21; 9 studies, 3787 participants), dry mouth (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 6 studies, 2802 participants), somnolence (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 8 studies, 3532 participants) and dizziness (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; 7 studies, 2933 participants). According to the GRADE criteria, evidence was rated as being of moderate quality for sleep efficacy outcomes and adverse events and of low quality for rebound effects and next-day functioning.
   Authors' conclusions
   Eszopiclone appears to be an efficient drug with moderate effects on sleep onset and maintenance. There was no or little evidence of harm if taken as recommended. However, as certain patient subgroups were underrepresented in RCTs included in the review, findings might not have displayed the entire spectrum of possible adverse events. Further, increased caution is required in elderly individuals with cognitive and motor impairments and individuals who are at increased risk of using eszopiclone in a non-recommended way.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of stellate ganglion block and paroxetine on hot flashes and sleep disturbance in breast cancer survivors
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The incidence of menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and sleep disturbance, caused by drug treatment is a common problem in breast cancer survivors. Considering the limitations of hormone therapy in such patients, several studies have been conducted to find alternative methods. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of stellate ganglion block (SGB) with that of paroxetine, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medicine for the treatment of hot flashes and ensuing sleep disturbance.
   Patients and methods: A total of 40 patients survived from breast cancer and complaining of these symptoms were equally assigned to two groups of 20 each. In the study group, SGB was performed successfully under sonography guidance using 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine, and in the control group (paroxetine), the daily administration of 7.5 mg of paroxetine was conducted for 6 weeks. The frequency and severity of hot flash attacks and sleep quality of patients were evaluated prior to the intervention and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks. The incidence of adverse events during treatment or follow-up was recorded.
   Results: A significant decrease in hot flash score and sleep disturbance index (SDI) was observed in both groups. Comparison of the results showed no noticeable difference between the two groups. Two participants in the control group had discontinued medication due to gastrointestinal symptoms, and only one case of mild headache was reported in the study group.
   Conclusion: SGB is as much effective as paroxetine in controlling hot flashes and sleep disturbances in breast cancer survivors and is associated with few complications.

TI  - Effects of hormonal contraceptives on sleep - A possible treatment for insomnia in premenopausal women
T2  - SLEEP SCIENCE
AB  - Due to the changes that took place since the 1970s, women have achieved important socioeconomic positions. Many tasks, including domestic and familiar ones, continue to be under women's responsibility, which leads to an overload work. Additionally, the female organism has its peculiarities due to hormonal changes. Adding all these factors up, women seem to be more vulnerable to stressing factors and consequently, might be prone to present several health problems. Within this scenario, one can point out insomnia as a highly prevalent disease among women, directly affecting performance and quality of life. Progesterone has an important effect over sleep, acting both as a hypnogenic and as a respiratory stimulant. Hormonal contraceptives are largely recognized among the modern society women; however, little is known about the effects of these drugs on sleep. This proposal hypothesizes that the use of hormonal contraceptives, mainly those based on progestagens could be a new therapeutic element for the treatment of insomnia and one more tool to be used to improve women's sleep pattern and quality of life.

TI  - Insights into the Role of Circadian Rhythms in Bone Metabolism: A Promising Intervention Target?
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Numerous physiological processes of mammals, including bone metabolism, are regulated by the circadian clock system, which consists of a central regulator, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the peripheral oscillators of the BMAL1/CLOCK-PERs/CRYs system. Various bone turnover markers and bone metabolism-regulating hormones such as melatonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) display diurnal rhythmicity. According to previous research, disruption of the circadian clock due to shift work, sleep restriction, or clock gene knockout is associated with osteoporosis or other abnormal bone metabolism, showing the importance of the circadian clock system for maintaining homeostasis of bone metabolism. Moreover, common causes of osteoporosis, including postmenopausal status and aging, are associated with changes in the circadian clock. In our previous research, we found that agonism of the circadian regulators REV-ERBs inhibits osteoclast differentiation and ameliorates ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice, suggesting that clock genes may be promising intervention targets for abnormal bone metabolism. Moreover, osteoporosis interventions at different time points can provide varying degrees of bone protection, showing the importance of accounting for circadian rhythms for optimal curative effects in clinical treatment of osteoporosis. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about circadian rhythms and bone metabolism.

TI  - Beyond photoaging: additional factors involved in the process of skin aging
T2  - CLINICAL COSMETIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Studies assessing the impact of extrinsic factors on skin aging have increased during the last with the increase in life expectancy. Although most of the studies are about the sun radiation impact, many factors should be considered in elderly people, beyond environmental conditions. Lifestyle factors, like diet, sleeping, smoking, should be analyzed carefully, as common age-related conditions (menopause, diabetes, pulmonary diseases, etc.). All these factors could accelerate the natural decline of skin structure and functions, possibly affecting the responses to treatments and drugs. This review demonstrates that growing evidence regarding environmental factors that are associated with lifestyle and comorbidities deserve greater attention from researchers and dermatologists and may require new approaches in the management of skin aging.

TI  - Association of the melatonin circadian rhythms with clock 3111T/C gene polymorphism in Caucasian and Asian menopausal women with insomnia
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - A comparative analysis of melatonin circadian rhythms in Caucasian (incoming population) and Asian (indigenous population) menopausal women with/without sleep disorders depending on the genotype of Clock 3111T/C gene polymorphism was realized. The melatonin level in the saliva was determined four times a day (6:00-7:00, 12:00-13:00, 18:00-19:00, 23:00-00:00 h). The Caucasian women-carriers of the TT-genotype with insomnia as compared to control grouphad a higher morning melatonin level and a lower night melatonin level. The Asian women with TT-genotype and insomnia had a lower levels of melatonin as compared to control at daytime, evening and night. A significantly higher melatonin level in the early morning hours was detected in the Caucasian women-carriers of the TT-genotype with insomnia as compared to group women-carriers of the minor 3111C-allele. There were no statistically significant differences in the circadian rhythms of melatonin in the Asian women depending on the genotype of the Clock 3111T/C polymorphism. An assumption with respect to the protective role of the minor allele 3111C in the development of insomnia associated with the displacement of melatonin circadian rhythms in the representatives of the incoming population was made.

TI  - A new animal model for menopausal transition: combination of ovariectomy and empty bottle stimulation
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Previous small animal models for menopausal transition are mainly performed to mimic the biochemical changes of patients with menopausal transition. The psychological symptoms in animal models are often overlooked. To mimic clinical situation, we developed a new mouse model of menopausal transition: the combination of bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) and empty bottle stimulation (EBS). After OVX and 21days of EBS, behavioral test and pentobarbital-induced sleep test were carried out. Then all the animals were euthanized for further investigations. Compared with the control group, the combination of OVX and EBS group (OVX+EBS) showed higher bodyweight, lower organ index of uteri, and lower concentrations of serum estradiol. In addition, behavioral manifestations, sleep quality, and morphologic features in OVX+EBS group showed significant differences compared with the control group. OVX alone or EBS alone failed to include all the changes of OVX+EBS group. These findings indicate ovariectomy or EBS alone could not well mimic the symptoms of menopausal transition. The combination of bilateral ovariectomy and EBS offers an easy and repeatable method for building comprehensive menopausal transition model in mice.

Tasks: to review foreign papers where factors are considered which provoke development of depression: hormonal, psychological, social as well as neuromediators, hormonal and immune disturbances in depressive disorders in women with physiological climacteric and climacteric syndrome; issues of differential diagnostics of depressions, psychopharmaco- and psychotherapy with subsequent evaluation of clinical efficiency; personality profile of pateints with affective psychopathology.
   Methods of search: by keywords in Web of Science Core Collection database across foreign journals (20122016). Criteria of inclusion of papers in the review are determined by themes of studies: 1) women of climacteric age; 2) presence of depression or depressive symptoms; 3) presence of climacteric disturbances. In the abstract-bibliographic and scientometric database Web of Science Core Collection 70 bibliographic sources are selected across foreign journals between 2012 and 2016, including journals with high Impact Factor. Studies included in the review are performed at the university clinics, specialized centers. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of female patients meet the criterion of compatibility. Most discussed papers are devoted to study of clinical and social-psychological factors of development of climacteric depression. In a number of papers the efficiency of antidepressant therapy, alternative methods and supplementary therapy in women with depressive disorders, climacteric disturbances and co-occurring physical diseases is shown. Most works are performed with involvement of questionnaires (sociodemographic data, anamnesis) and international clinical scales. The main results of the discussed papers are outlined in thematic rubrics.
   Conclusion. The European and American papers are used in this review more frequently; studies from Asian countries are used more seldom. Reviewed foreign publications reflect worldwide trend to increase of climacteric depression (CD) in the female population with presence in the anamnesis of adolescent (psychoendocrine alteration) and postpartum depression, premenstrual syndrome. Low timely diagnostics of depressions, high incidence rate of somaticized CD are noted. In the structure of climacteric syndrome the psychoemotional disturbances predominate above neurovegetative and metabolic-endocrine or are combined with vegetative dysfunction. The participation in formation of CD (with predominance of mild/moderate severity) of neurohormonal, genetic, biochemical, social-environmental, psychological factors is shown. In the reviewed sources low mood, loss of previous priorities, decrease of productivity and concentration of attention, position of being unprotected, dependence, lack of confidence, self-humiliation, repentance, unbelief in future, insomnias, hypo-/hyperrexia with change of body mass are described in CD but there are no publications on suicidal ideation. It is indicated that CD can flow with hysteric-and nosophobic, somatohypochondriac and asthenohypochondriac component. The authors consider that somatization as an experience of climacteric stress leads to somaticized CD with accent on physical symptoms and repression of depression and anxiety although an association of specific somatic nosologies with symptoms of CD is not described. The association of CD with social-environmental factors (gender, education, profession, social position, financial wealth) is discussed, achievement of the woman is considered as a factor of reduction of CD risk. The authors are highly interested in search for genetic markers (heredity, suicides in relatives), impairment of neuromediator exchange (neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline), neuromorphologic alterations in brain sensorimotor cortex (motor function, attention, perception, memory, and emotional-motivational response), hormonal disturbances (neuroendocrine and metabolic) and psychoneuroimmunological patterns of association with CD. Psychopharmacotherapy in CD is constructed with account for depressive symptoms (antidepressants of activating/sedative action in long-term maintenance regime), background and co-occurring diseases (adequate and pathogenetic and immunotherapy) with involvement in case of absence of contraindications of substitutive hormonotherapy (estrogen, progesterone). Beyond conventional schemes of the therapy the alternative therapy of CD (acupuncture, yoga, phytoestrogen collections, and food additives) is discussed. For heightening the efficiency and safety of the therapy of CD the training in detection of CD signs both for female patients and nurses, psychologists, social workers is proposed.

TI  - The effect of vitamin D supplement on the score and quality of sleep in 20-50 year-old people with sleep disorders compared with control group
T2  - NUTRITIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Objectives: Sleep quality may be directly related with vitamin D serum level. Some studies found that people with lower vitamin D serum level experienced a lower sleep quality. Consequently, this study aimed at determining the effect of vitamin D supplements on sleep score and quality in 20-50 year-old people with sleep disorders.
   Methods: This double blind, clinical trial was performed in November 2015-February 2016 on 89 people with sleep disorders based on Petersburg's Sleep Index. Patient samples were divided randomly into two groups: intervention and placebo. At the end of the study, the data on 89 subjects (44 in intervention group and 45 people in placebo group) were examined. Intervention group received a 50 000-unit vitamin D supplement, one in a fortnight for 8 weeks. Meanwhile, placebo group received placebo. Before and after intervention, Petersburg's Sleep Quality Questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, general information questionnaire, sun exposure, vitamin D serum level and 3-day food record questionnaire were assessed and recorded for all participants. To analyze data, t-test, chi square, ANCOVA, U-Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon statistical tests were used.
   Findings: Based on the results of the present study, at the end of the study sleep score (PSQI) reduced significantly in vitamin recipients as compared with placebo recipients (P< 0.05). This difference was significant even after modifying confounding variables (P< 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study shows that the use of vitamin D supplement improves sleep quality, reduces sleep latency, raises sleep duration and improves subjective sleep quality in people of 20-50 year-old with sleep disorder.

TI  - First-Night Effect on Sleep in Different Female Reproductive States
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: In sleep laboratory studies, the new environment is generally considered to disturb sleep during the first night. However, older women have rarely been studied. Although menopause and hormone therapy affect sleep, their impact on the first-night effect is virtually unknown. Participants: Four groups of women with no sleep laboratory experience: young on hormonal contraceptives (n = 11, 23.1 [0.5] years), perimenopausal (n = 15, 48.0 (0.4] years), postmenopausal without hormone therapy (HT; off-HT, n = 22, 63.4 [0.8] years) and postmenopausal with HT (n = 16, 63.1 [0.9] years). Procedure: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Polysomnography was performed over two consecutive nights and the first-night effect and group differences were evaluated. Questionnaire-based insomnia and sleepiness scores were correlated to sleep variables and their between-night changes. Results: Although sleep in young women was deeper and less fragmented than in the other groups, first-night effect was similar in all study groups. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and S1 and S2 sleep increased, and wake after sleep onset, awakenings per hour of sleep, S2 and REM latencies, and percentage of SWS decreased from the first to the second night. Perimenopausal women had more insomnia complaints than other women. Insomnia complaints were associated with more disturbed sleep but not with the first-night effect. Conclusions: A first night in a sleep laboratory elicits a marked interference of sleep architecture in women of all ages, with a carryover effect of lighter sleep on the second study night. Menopausal state, HT use, or insomnia complaints do not modify this effect.

TI  - Insomnia and sexual dysfunction associated with severe worsening of the quality of life in sexually active hysterectomized women
T2  - SLEEP SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: Hysterectomy is a common gynecologic surgery carried out to remove the pathologic uterus. Objective: To establish if sleep disorders and sexual function are associated with deterioration of the quality of life (QoL) in hysterectomized and sexually active women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out with inhabitants from two cities of the Colombian Caribbean. The pollsters invited women aged between 40-59 years to participate; in their communities they applied surveys with demographic characteristics: Female Sexual Function Index, Atenas Insomnia Scale and Menopause Rating Scale. Sexually active women were selected; then the association was established with logistic regression. Results: 522 women were studied with an average age of 50 years: 30% oophorectomized, 59.8% Hispanic, 40.2% afro-descendants and 22.2% hormonal therapy users. 80% of them had somato/vegetative, psychological or urogenital deterioration; 29.1% with severe deterioration of QoL and 47.5% with insomnia. Out of 390 (74.7%) with sexual activity, 59.7% suffered from sexual dysfunction. Insomnia: OR:3.05 [95%CI:1.86-4.99], sexual dysfunction OR:3.52 [95%CI:2.01-6.17], dissatisfaction about sexuality OR:4.77 [95%CI:2.08-10.93], low or non-existent sexual desire OR:2.94 [95%CI:1.65-5.25], daytime drowsiness OR:3.15 [95%CI:1.596.24] and decrease in daytime well-being OR:3.18 [95%CI:1.79-5.64]. These were factors associated with severe worsening of QoL, while the presence of genital lubrication was protective, OR: 0.44 [95%CI:0.21-0.93], p=0.0332. Conclusion: It was observed that insomnia and sexual dysfunction behaved as factors associated with three times more severe deterioration of the QoL in climacteric and sexually active women previously hysterectomized.

TI  - Progesterone for treatment of symptomatic menopausal women
T2  - CLIMACTERIC
AB  - This review's purpose is to highlight evidence that oral micronized progesterone (progesterone) is effective for hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms, VMS), improves sleep and is likely safe in menopausal women (who are more than 1year since last menstruation). Methods include randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) supplemented with basic science, population and observational data as needed. The barrier to use of progesterone is lack of awareness that safety concerns with estrogen-including menopausal hormone therapy' (MHT) are not applicable to progesterone. In a single 3-month RCT, progesterone (300mg at bedtime) was effective treatment of VMS in 133 healthy menopausal women. It caused an overall 55% VMS decrease, no withdrawal-related VMS rebound and a greater VMS decrease in 46 women with 50 moderate-intense VMS/week. Progesterone is equally or more effective than estradiol in improving cardiovascular endothelial function and caused no cardiovascular safety concerns in a 3-month RCT. An 8-year prospective cohort study (E3N) in more than 80000 menopausal women showed progesterone prevented breast cancer in estrogen-treated women. Multiple RCTs confirm that progesterone (300mg daily at bedtime) does not cause depression and improves deep sleep. In conclusion, progesterone effectively treats VMS, improves sleep and may be the only therapy that symptomatic women, who are menopausal at a normal age and without osteoporosis, need.

TI  - A STUDY ON THE FREQUENCY OF COMMON SYMPTOMS OF HUMORS EXCESS AND UTERINE TEMPERAMENT IN PATIENTS WITH OLIGOMENORRHEA
T2  - INDO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Oligomenorrhea is one of the most common menstrual disorders in women at reproductive age with different complications. Oligomenorrhea is referred to as "Ehtebas-e Tams" in the Persian medicine (Iranian Traditional Medicine). In Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) textbooks, temperament (Mizaj) and humors have an important role in diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Since the humors excess is one of the causes of Ehtebas-e Tams, this study examined the frequency of common symptoms of humors excess and uterine temperament in these patients.
   Materials and Methods: This research is a descriptive case study. One-hundred fifty women aged 18-45 years suffering from oligomenorrhea who referred to midwifery clinic during 2013-2015 were selected through convenience sampling method. In addition to the patients' demographic characteristics form, a uterine temperament questionnaire and humors excess checklist were completed.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 24.6 +/- 5.1 years. The majority of married patients, had a cold (66.1%, 74 patients) and wet (62.5%, 70 patients) uterine temperament. The most common symptoms of humors excess in patients were related to black bile (61.25%) and phlegm (59.28%). Severe anger, worry about future, and excessive thinking were the most common symptoms of black bile and body coldness, drowsiness after eating, and excessive sleeping were the most common symptoms of phlegm.
   Conclusion: According to the results of this study, and observing the prevalence of symptoms of humors excess in patients with oligomenorrhea, it is suggested that other studies be conducted to determine the standard questionnaire of the humors excess and distemperament in these patients.

TI  - Hypothyroidism Screening in Menopausal Women - A Cross-sectional study at a teaching District Headquarter Hospital in Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL & HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Aim: To determine the frequency of hypothyroidism among menopausal women.
   Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study women aged 40-55 years with signs and symptoms of menopause like hot flushes, depression, weight gain, sleeping problems,mood swings and cold intolerance were included. Females having any gynaecological pathology, on hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) , with any bleeding disorder or history of using antiplatelet medication and with previous thyroid disorder were excluded from the study.Patient's complete history and demographics were recorded. 2 ml of venous blood was collected from anterior cubital vein after an overnight fast under aseptic conditions from each individual with her consent. Serum was analysed via chemiluminescence immunoassay for TSH, T4 and T3 levels.
   Results: Out of total 100 females, hypothyroidism was found in 20(20%) women. Mean age of females was 49.78 +/- 4.65 years. The mean TSH, T3 & T4 of all the females was 3.26 +/- 2.91mIU/L, 2.13 +/- 0.64nmol/L and 98.31 +/- 30.49nmol/L respectively.
   Conclusion: Hypothyroidism is quite common amongst Pakistani perimenopausal women.There is a need to develop proper guidelines for routine screening of menopausal females for hypothyroidism as it is a potentially treatable condition with the help of thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

TI  - Polymorphism T3111C of the Clock gene in ethnic groups of women from Russia and Buryatia
T2  - VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII
AB  - Biological rhythms of organisms depend on both changing conditions of the external environment and internal "biological clock". Circadian rhythms are the response of the organism to the change of day and night. They are some of the most important biological rhythms of organisms. Circadian rhythms are regulated by the group of circadian genes. It is known that women suffer from sleep disorders more often than men. Up to 50 % of menopausal women complain of problems associated with sleeping. The study involved 403 menopausal women aged from 45 to 60 years: 214 Russians (the average age is 52.74 +/- 6.28 years) and 189 Buryats (the average age is 51.95 +/- 5.13 years) living in Eastern Siberia (Irkutsk region, Irkutsk and Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude).The prevalence of genotypes and alleles of the polymorphism T3111C of the circadian rhythm gene Clock (rs1801260) was studied in these groups. To this end, we conducted genotyping of DNA samples by polymerase chain reaction. It was shown that the compared groups have statistically significant differences in genotypes frequency (p = 0.001). It was found that in the group of Russian women the frequency of the TC genotype (p = 0.004) was significantly higher and the frequency of the TT genotype (p= 0.0001) was significantly lower than those in the sample of women of Buryatia. It was shown that in the group of Russian women allele 3111C is found in 30.4 % of cases, which is statistically significantly more often than in the group of Buryat women, where the frequency of allele 3111C was 19.3 % (p = 0.014).

TI  - Sleep quality and its association with postural stability and fear of falling among Spanish postmenopausal women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To analyze the association of sleep quality with postural balance, as measured with objective stabilometric parameters, and fear of falling (FoF), among Spanish postmenopausal women.
   Methods: In all, 250 women (60 +/- 8 years) took part in this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data were collected, as well as information concerning history of falls and FoF. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to analyze sleep quality. Measurements of sway area (S), velocity (V), and mediolateral (RMSX) and anteroposterior (RMSY) displacements of the center of pressure were obtained with a resistive multisensor platform under both eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions to assess postural control. The independent associations of sleep quality with FoF and postural control were evaluated by multivariate linear and logistic regressions, respectively, adjusting for potential confounding variables.
   Results: SEO was independently associated (adjusted R-2 = 0.073) with sleep duration (P<0.001) and subjective sleep quality (P = 0.001), VEO (adjusted R-2 = 0.156) with daytime dysfunction (P = 0.006) and sleep duration (P = 0.013), RMSXEO (adjusted R-2 = 0.118) with subjective sleep quality (P = 0.005), and RMSYEO (adjusted R-2 = 0.166) with sleep duration (P = 0.001) and daytime dysfunction (P = 0.046). Under EC condition, SEC (adjusted R-2 = 0.014) was independently related with anxiety (P = 0.034), VEC (adjusted R-2 = 0.148) with daytime dysfunction (P = 0.002) and sleep duration (P = 0.024), RMSXEC (adjusted R-2 = 0.134) with subjective sleep quality (P< 0.001), and RMSYEC (adjusted R-2 = 0.128) with sleep duration (P = 0.013) and daytime dysfunction (P = 0.033). Logistic regression showed that time since menopause (P = 0.003), body mass index (P = 0.001), and anxiety (P< 0.001), unlike sleep quality, were independently associated with FoF. The effect size of the model was medium (adjusted R-2 = 0.162).
   Conclusions: In Spanish postmenopausal women, sleep duration, subjective sleep quality, and daytime dysfunction were independent risk factors for worsened postural stability. FoF, anxiety, time since menopause onset, and body mass index, unlike sleep quality, were independently associated with poor postural stability.

TI  - The bidirectional relationship between vasomotor symptoms and depression across the menopausal transition: a systematic review of longitudinal studies
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: To explore the nature of the bidirectional relationship between vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and depression, and to determine whether hot flashes and night sweats differentially affect the association between VMS and depression through their effect on sleep disruption.
   Methods: Multiple databases were searched from 1961 until July 31, 2016, and a manual search of reference lists of identified articles was conducted. Sixteen articles that involved 10,008 participants were identified and analyzed.
   Results: The methods of analyses and measurement of VMS and depression varied across the studies. Two studies explored the bidirectional association, but only one was significant in both directions (odds ratio [OR] depression to VMS 3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-6.58; OR VMS to depression 8.88, 95% CI 2.57-30.68). In both cases, the association between VMS leading to depressive symptoms was stronger than the opposite. Eleven studies examined VMS leading to depression, but only five showed a significant effect (OR 1.57-1.81, P <= 0.02). Treating VMS and depressive symptoms as continuous variables (n = 3) diminished the relationship. Three studies showed a significant association of depression leading to VMS (OR 1.62-1.94, P <= 0.01). We found little evidence for a specific effect of night sweats on the association between VMS and depressive symptoms. The effect might not be related to sleep disruption.
   Conclusions: There is a bidirectional association between VMS and depressive symptoms. The menopausal transition appears to increase the risk of recurrent episodes of depression that might not be explained only by VMS. Further investigation is needed to explain the differential effect of night sweats and hot flashes on depression.

TI  - Health-related quality of life of young women with breast cancer. Review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the present article was to investigate the health related quality of life (QoL) of young women with breast cancer.
   Methods: For the purposes of this article, we reviewed the literature via the electronic databases Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar. Key words used were breast cancer, young women, health related quality of life, and quality of life.
   Results: Young women reported fatigue, pain in the breast and hand problems with lymphedema as the most frequent physical effects of treatment. Other physical problems were the not periodic and painful menses, vaginal dryness and loss of libido. Many young women had depressive symptoms such as depressed mood, helplessness, hopelessness, sleep loss, psychomotor retardation and disorders of appetite. There were often concerns about the health monitoring and self-image, while they were anxious if they will have a baby in the future or if they can nurture the existing ones. Many problems arose in the career of young women. They faced discrimination in the labor supply and/or layoff because they were considered unable to do their job effectively. In addition, they reported isolation problems and feeling different from other women of similar age.
   Conclusions: Young women consider that their health-related QoL is worse compared with older women. Young women worry about their future, with particular reference to their role as mothers and especially to children-bearing. The free screening and non-exclusion of young women is particularly important for breast cancer prevention and women's well-being.

TI  - SHORT-TERM HYPOXIC EXPOSURE AND TRAINING IMPROVE MAXIMAL ANAEROBIC RUNNING TEST PERFORMANCE
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of short-term hypoxic exposure and training in the performance of competitive 400- or 800-m runners. Fifteen female competitive 400- and 800-m runners volunteered to participate and were assigned to either the hypoxic (n = 7) or normoxic (n = 8) group. The subjects completed 6 days of training. The hypoxic group trained and slept in normobaric hypoxia, with oxygen concentrations of 14.4 and 16.5% for training and sleep, respectively. The normoxic group trained and slept at sea level. The subjects completed 4 sprint and 5 endurance training sessions during the camp. The subjects underwent a maximal anaerobic running test before and 8 days after the training camp. The maximal power determined by the anaerobic running test improved significantly in the hypoxic group (p <= 0.05). Blood lactate concentration at submaximal running speed (275, 300, and 375 m.min(-1)) in the hypoxic group decreased significantly (p <= 0.05) after the training period. No significant changes in these values were found in the normoxic group. These results suggest that 6 days of hypoxic exposure and training enhanced performance and improved lactate metabolism in 400- and 800-m runners.

TI  - Acute Menopausal Symptoms in Young Cancer Survivors Immediately following Chemotherapy
T2  - ONCOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of menopausal symptoms in young cancer survivors immediately following the completion of chemotherapy. Methods: This prospective cohort study followed 124 young females with a new diagnosis of cancer requiring chemotherapy to assess symptoms of menopause before treatment and immediately following chemotherapy. Symptoms were compared before and after treatment using the McNe-mar test and between cancer patients and 133 similar-aged healthy controls using Pearson chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Participants undergoing cancer therapy reported more menopausal symptoms compared to controls prior to the initiation of any treatment (hot flashes or night sweats 33 vs. 7%, p < 0.01, trouble sleeping 57 vs. 31%, p < 0.01, headaches 50 vs. 35%, p = 0.02, and decreased libido 36 vs. 16%, p < 0.01) and also reported a greater prevalence of symptoms immediately after cancer therapy compared to pretreatment prevalence (vasomotor symptoms, p < 0.01, vaginal dryness, p < 0.01, decreased concentration, p < 0.01, and body aches, p = 0.01). Cancer patients with lower antiMullerian hormone (AMH) levels after treatment (< 0.10 ng/mL) had an increased risk of vasomotor symptoms (OR 2.2, p = 0.04), mood swings (OR 2.4, p = 0.03), feeling sad (OR 2.2, p = 0.04), trouble sleeping (OR 2.7, p = 0.02), and decreased libido (OR 3.0, p = 0.03) when controlled for age and cancer type, and the incidence of these symptoms was not affected by the use of systemic hormones or psychiatric medications. Treatment length, use of alkylating agents, pelvic radiation, and marital status were also not associated with the prevalence of menopausal symptoms. Conclusions: Premeno-pausal women with a new cancer diagnosis have more menopausal symptoms than females of similar age before and after cancer treatment, the effects of which are not mitigated by systemic hormone use. Decreased AMH levels were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting physiologic symptoms after therapy. Implications for Cancer Survivors: This information is imperative for counseling; ultimately, improved symptom management during and after cancer therapies will improve quality of life in young cancer survivors.

TI  - Sleepwear with lateralized thermal properties for the treatment of sleep disturbance in women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLOTHING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Purpose The authors' innovation is specially constructed sleepwear - which the authors have dubbed Janus Sleepwear - for the treatment of sleep disturbance caused by thermal dysregulation, a problem most often seen in women. The authors have designed and tested a simple and comfortable garment with lateralized thermal properties that promotes either thermal conduction or thermal insulation depending upon body position. This innovation will allow sleepers to auto-regulate proximal skin temperature through subtle movements during brief transient arousals, preserving overall sleep architecture. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors have constructed several prototypes of sleepwear with lateralized thermal properties and conducted small-scale piloting of the garment. Volunteers wore the special sleepwear while awake and performed a series of controlled body position changes. Temperature at several proximal anatomical sites was monitored using temperature sensors known as iButtons.
   Findings Janus Sleepwear can facilitate more rapid cooling, compared to control sleepwear, when the conductive side faces the ambient environment and can maintain temperature with less loss of heat when the insulating side faces the ambient environment.
   Originality/value Thermoregulation plays a key role in promoting and maintaining sleep. Thermal dysregulation and sleep disturbance most commonly occur in women. Sensitivity to ambient temperature stressors suggests it may prove beneficial for such women to maintain as narrow a temperature range as possible during sleep. A person wearing Janus Sleepwear will be able to effectively steer her body in response to subjective and subconscious perceptions of thermal discomfort to maintain optimal conditions while asleep.

TI  - A simple risk score based on sleep quality for predicting depressive symptoms in menopausal women: a multicenter study
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: We aim to establish a simple risk score based on sleep quality for predicting depressive symptoms in menopausal women through a cross-sectional investigation.Materials and methods: A total of 705 Chinese women aged 40-60years were included in this cross-sectional investigation of a self-report questionnaire from the Physical Examination Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital. Depressive symptoms and sleep quality were evaluated using self-rating depressive symptom scale (SDS)and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. After setting up a logistic regression model and computing the odds ratio value, we further calculated and predicted the risk score for depressive symptoms and then established a risk score system. Finally, we validated the risk score in two investigations (Validation 1 and Validation 2).Results: The risk scoring system for predicting depressive symptoms included a history of cancer, subjective sleep quality, sleep disorder and daytime dysfunction, with total scores ranging from 0-35 points. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) sample curve was 0.801 (95% CI 0.753-0.848). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.832 (95% CI 0.738-0.925) in Validation 1 and 0.799 (95%CI 0.667-0.930) in Validation 2. The best cutoff point for depressive symptoms in the sample population was 8 points, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.698 and 0.824, respectively. The sensitivity was 0.775 and 0.667 in Validation 1 and Validation 2, respectively.Conclusions: The risk score for predicting depressive symptoms in menopausal women based on sleep is convenient. Because there is no complex assessment of multiple scales requiredIt may be a preliminary screening tool for depressive symptoms in menopausal women.

TI  - Sleep problems during the menopausal transition: prevalence, impact, and management challenges
T2  - NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP
AB  - A substantial number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with 26% experiencing severe symptoms that impact daytime functioning, qualifying them for a diagnosis of insomnia. Here, we review both self-report and polysomnographic evidence for sleep difficulties in the context of the menopausal transition, considering severity of sleep complaints and links between hot flashes (HFs) and depression with poor sleep. Longitudinal population-based studies show that sleep difficulties are uniquely linked with menopausal stage and changes in follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol, over and above the effects of age. A major contributor to sleep complaints in the context of the menopausal transition is HFs, and many, although not all, HFs are linked with polysomnographic-defined awakenings, with HF-associated wake time contributing significantly to overall wakefulness after sleep onset. Some sleep complaints may be comorbid with depressive disorders or attributed to sleep-related breathing or movement disorders, which increase in prevalence especially after menopause, and for some women, menopause, age, and environmental/behavioral factors may interact to disrupt sleep. Considering the unique and multifactorial basis for sleep difficulties in women transitioning menopause, we describe clinical assessment approaches and management options, including combination treatments, ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia to hormonal and nonhormonal pharmacological options. Emerging studies suggest that the impact of severe insomnia symptoms could extend beyond immediate health care usage and quality of life issues to long-term mental and physical health, if left untreated in midlife women. Appropriate treatment, therefore, has immediate benefit as well as advantages for maintaining optimal health in the postmenopausal years.

TI  - MultIethNic Study of BrEast ARterial Calcium Gradation and CardioVAscular Disease: cohort recruitment and baseline characteristics
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: MultIethNic Study of BrEast ARterial Calcium Gradation and CardioVAscular Disease (MINERVA) was designed to answer the question of whether a novel continuous breast arterial calcification (BAC) mass score improves cardiovascular risk stratification among asymptomatic postmenopausal women. This article describes recruitment and baseline characteristics.
   Methods: MINERVA is a multiethnic longitudinal cohort study. The phenotype data include BAC mass by densitometry applied to digital mammograms, sociodemographic factors, self-reported medical history, medications, parental history, reproductive history, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, anthropometry, ankle-brachial index, blood pressure, laboratory panel, breast volumes, cognitive function, bioelectrical impedance, habitual diet, dietary supplements, sleep, psychosocial factors, and sun exposure.
   Results: A total of 5145 women aged 60 to 79 years with available digital, uncompressed mammograms were recruited from the membership of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California between October 24, 2012 and February 13, 2015 and completed a baseline clinic visit or an abbreviated phone questionnaire. Of those, 4153 underwent phlebotomy and have blood biomarkers. Overall prevalence of BAC was 26%, and it varied by age and race. The mean (SD) BAC mass was 12 (23) mg and the range 0-342 mg.
   Conclusions: MINERVA is the first cohort with a continuous measure of BAC. The cohort is large, ethnically diverse, and deeply phenotyped in terms of socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical factors, and blood biomarkers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identification and prediction of the fertile window with a new web-based medical device using a vaginal biosensor for measuring the circadian and circamensual core body temperature
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Fertility awareness-based (FAB) methods represent a term that includes all family planning methods that are based on the identification of the fertile window. They are based on the woman's observation of physiological signs of the fertile and infertile phases of the menstrual cycle. The first approach consists basically in symptothermal methods accompanied by cervical mucus measurements and clinical menstrual cycling data recording. The second most often used methods are the urinary measurement of E3G and luteinizing hormone (LH) with a personalized computer system. Hence these systems lack the efficacy of the continuous circadian and circamensual measurement of the core body temperature. Only this approach enables the accurate detection of the ovulation during the fertile window. A new medical device called OvulaRing has been developed to fill this gap. In the present study, the system and its first clinical results are presented. OvulaRing is a medical device used just like a tampon. The device is a vaginal ring of evatane that contains an integrated biosensor. This sensor measures continuously every 5 min the core body temperature throughout the entire cycle. This device allows a circadian and circamensual intravaginal exact measurement. With this system, 288 measurements are created per day. The system can detect retrospectively and predict prospectively the fertile window of the users. One hundred and fifty eight women aged between 18 and 45 years used this medical device in an open non-randomized clinical study for 15 months. A total of 470 cycles could be recorded and were able for analysis. By the same time in a subgroup of patients, hormonal assessments of LH, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and progesterone as well as vaginal ultrasound were performed in parallel between the 9th and the 36th day of the cycle. The validation error due to software errors was 0.89% for the retrospective analysis; that means that the accuracy for the detection of the ovulation was 99.11%. Accuracy of 88.8% for a window of 3 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation and the 3 days after ovulation was achieved for the prospective analysis. In the subgroup of woman with recorded pregnancies, it could be shown that after 3.79 months of use (median) pregnancies were observed. In 67.72% in up to 3 months, in 16.36% between 3 and 6 months of use, in 7.27% between 7 and 9 months, in 5.45% between 10 and 12 months and in 1.82% between 13 and 15 months of use of the system. With this new web-based system, a precise determination of the fertile window even in women with ultralong cycles (>35days) could be detected independently of their personal live circumstances. Exact determination of the fertile window is herewith possible so that OvulaRing represents an evolution in the FAB method for the cycle diagnosis of women with regular, irregular or anovulatory menstrual cycles.

TI  - Factors associated with general and health-related quality of life in menopausal transition among women from Serbia
T2  - WOMEN & HEALTH
AB  - This study assessed factors associated with quality of life (QOL) among Serbian peri- and postmenopausal women using two menopause-specific scales. This cross-sectional study included 500 women aged 40-65years who had a gynecologic check-up in one of two Community Health Centers in Belgrade during February 2014 to January 2015. Women completed: a questionnaire about socio-demographics, habits, and health status; a menopause-specific questionnaire, Utian's Quality of Life Scale (UQOL); and a Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Higher education was associated with better occupational UQOL and memory/concentration, but with lower emotional UQOL and more anxiety/fears. City center residency was associated with better occupational and sexual UQOL. Being employed was associated with better occupational UQOL and lower anxiety/fears. Higher income was associated with better emotional UQOL. Not having uterine prolapse, insomnia, or tachycardia was associated with better occupational UQOL and fewer sleep problems. Higher parity was associated with better sexual UQOL. Having regular recreation was associated with better health and sexual UQOL but with more frequent vasomotor symptoms. Leaner women felt more attractive. QOL during the menopausal transition does not entail only somatic symptoms and therefore requires a more comprehensive approach that includes psychosocial underpinnings.

TI  - Reflex epilepsy: triggers and management strategies
T2  - NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
AB  - Reflex epilepsies (REs) are identified as epileptic seizures that are consistently induced by identifiable and objective-specific triggers, which may be an afferent stimulus or by the patient's own activity. RE may have different subtypes depending on the stimulus characteristic. There are significant clinical and electrophysiologic differences between different RE types. Visual stimuli-sensitive or photosensitive epilepsies constitute a large proportion of the RE and are mainly related to genetic causes. Reflex epilepsies may present with focal or generalized seizures due to specific triggers, and sometimes seizures may occur spontaneously. The stimuli can be external (light flashes, hot water), internal (emotion, thinking), or both and should be distinguished from triggering precipitants, which most epileptic patients could report such as emotional stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol, and menstrual cycle. Different genetic and acquired factors may play a role in etiology of RE. This review will provide a current overview of the triggering factors and management of reflex seizures.

TI  - Effects of Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Interventions on Insomnia Symptoms and Self-reported Sleep Quality in Women With Hot Flashes: A Pooled Analysis of Individual Participant Data From Four MsFLASH Trials
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health network conducted three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing six interventions treating vasomotor symptoms (VMS), and also collected self-reported sleep outcomes. A fourth RCT assessed an intervention for insomnia symptoms among women with VMS. We describe these seven interventions' effects relative to control in women with comparably severe insomnia symptoms and VMS.
   Methods: We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 546 peri-and postmenopausal women with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) >= 12, and >= 14 bothersome VMS/week across the four RCTs. Interventions included the following: escitalopram 10-20 mg/day; yoga; aerobic exercise; 1.8 g/day omega-3 fatty acids; oral 17-beta-estradiol 0.5-mg/day; venlafaxine XR 75-mg/day; and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Outcome measures were ISI and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) over 8-12 weeks of treatment.
   Results: CBT-I produced the greatest reduction in ISI from baseline relative to control at -5.2 points (95% CI -7.0 to -3.4). Effects on ISI were similar for exercise at -2.1 and venlafaxine at -2.3 points. Comparably small decreases in ISI were observed with escitalopram, yoga, and estradiol. The largest reduction in PSQI from baseline was with CBT-I at -2.7 points (-3.9 to -1.5), although PSQI decreases of 1.2 to 1.6 points were significantly better than control with escitalopram, exercise, yoga, estradiol, and venlafaxine. Omega-3 supplements did not improve insomnia symptoms.
   Conclusions: This study's findings support current recommendations for CBT-I as a first line treatment in healthy midlife women with insomnia symptoms and moderately bothersome VMS.

TI  - Risk Factors for Bone Loss in Patients Having Clinical Conditions That Restrict Physical Activity
T2  - REHABILITATION NURSING
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of sleep duration, depression, and other factors on the risk for low bone mineral density (BMD) in patients having physical restrictions due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or asthma.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: The 2008-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey assesses sociodemographic, physiological, and behavioral factors, including depression and sleep duration. The records of 512 individuals were examined in the present survey.
   Findings: Among men, absence of a depressive mood was associated with greater lumbar spine BMD, and among women, adequate sleep duration was associated with greater lumbar spine BMD.
   Conclusions: This study of individuals having restricted physical activity due to a respiratory or circulatory problem indicated that men without depression and women with adequate sleep had greater BMD.
   Clinical Relevance: Interventions that improve sleep duration and provide a stable psychological state may help to prevent declines of BMD in this population.

TI  - Determinants of prolactin in postmenopausal Chinese women in Singapore
T2  - CANCER CAUSES & CONTROL
AB  - Purpose Mechanistic and observational data together support a role for prolactin in breast cancer development. Determinants of prolactin in Asian populations have not been meaningfully explored, despite the lower risk of breast cancer in Asian populations.
   Methods Determinants of plasma prolactin were evaluated in 442 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based prospective cohort study. At baseline all cohort members completed an in-person interview that elicited information on diet, menstrual and reproductive history, and lifestyle factors. One year after cohort initiation we began collecting blood samples. Quantified were plasma concentrations of prolactin, estrone, estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Analysis of covariance method was used for statistical analyses with age at blood draw, time since last meal, and time at blood draw as covariates.
   Results Mean prolactin levels were 25.1% lower with older age at menarche (p value = 0.001), and 27.6% higher with greater years between menarche and menopause (p value = 0.009). Prolactin levels were also positively associated with increased sleep duration (p value = 0.005). The independent determinants of prolactin were years from menarche to menopause, hours of sleep, and the plasma hormones estrone and SHBG (all p values < 0.01).
   Conclusion The role of prolactin in breast cancer development may involve reproductive and lifestyle factors, such as a longer duration of menstrual cycling and sleep patterns.

TI  - Sleep and circadian disruption and incident breast cancer risk: An evidence-based and theoretical review
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Opportunities for restorative sleep and optimal sleep-wake schedules are becoming luxuries in industrialized cultures, yet accumulating research has revealed multiple adverse health effects of disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms, including increased risk of breast cancer. The literature on breast cancer risk has focused largely on adverse effects of night shift work and exposure to light at night (LAN), without considering potential effects of associated sleep disruptions. As it stands, studies on breast cancer risk have not considered the impact of both sleep and circadian disruption, and the possible interaction of the two through bidirectional pathways, on breast cancer risk in the population at large. We review and synthesize this literature, including: 1) studies of circadian disruption and incident breast cancer; 2) evidence for bidirectional interactions between sleep and circadian systems; 3) studies of sleep and incident breast cancer; and 4) potential mechanistic pathways by which interrelated sleep and circadian disruption may contribute to the etiology of breast cancer.

TI  - Biochemistry of the menopause
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.

TI  - Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and Sexuality (DREAMS): A cohort profile
T2  - MATURITAS
AB  - The Women's Health Clinic (WHC) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, has provided consultative care to women with menopausal and sexual health concerns since 2005. Clinical information on the 8688 women seen in the WHC through May 2017 who gave consent for the use of their medical records in research is contained in the Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and Sexuality (DREAMS). Initially, DREAMS was created to improve the clinical care of women, but it has become a valuable research tool. About 25% of the DREAMS women have been seen in the WHC 2 or more times, allowing for passive longitudinal follow-up. Additionally, about 25% of the DREAMS women live in the 27-county region included in the expanded Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system, providing additional information on those women. The cohort has been used to investigate associations between: caffeine intake and vasomotor symptom bother; recent abuse (physical, sexual, verbal, and emotional) and menopausal symptoms; specific menopausal symptoms and self-reported view of menopause; and obstructive sleep apnea risk and vasomotor symptom severity and the experience of vasomotor symptoms in women older than 60 years. A study nearing completion describes a clinical series of over 3500 women presenting for sexual health consultation by sexual function domain and by decade of life. Other studies under way are determining correlates with sexual health and dysfunction. Planned studies will investigate associations between the experience with menopause and the risk of disease.

TI  - Females exposed to 24 h of sleep deprivation do not experience greater physiological strain, but do perceive heat illness symptoms more severely, during exercise-heat stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB  - There is limited and inconclusive evidence surrounding the physiological and perceptual responses to heat stress while sleep deprived, especially for females. This study aimed to quantify the effect of 24h sleep deprivation on physiological strain and perceptual markers of heat-related illness in females. Nine females completed two 30-min heat stress tests (HST) separated by 48h in 39 degrees C, 41% relative humidity at a metabolic heat production of 10Wkg(-1). The non-sleep deprived HST was followed by the sleep deprivation (SDHST) trial for all participants during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Physiological and perceptual measures were recorded at 5min intervals during the HSTs. On the cessation of the HSTs, heat illness symptom index (HISI) was completed. HISI scores increased after sleep deprivation by 28 +/- 16 versus 20 +/- 16 (P=0.01). Peak (39.40 +/- 0.35 degrees C vs. 39.35 +/- 0.33 degrees C) and change in rectal temperature (1.91 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.93 +/- 0.34 degrees C), and whole body sweat rate (1.08 +/- 0.31 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.36Lh(-1)) did not differ (P>0.05) between tests. No difference was observed in peak, nor rise in: heart rate, mean skin temperature, perceived exertion or thermal sensation during the HSTs. Twenty-four hours sleep deprivation increased perceptual symptoms associated with heat-related illness; however, no thermoregulatory alterations were observed.

TI  - A Bayesian parametric model for quantifying brain maturation from sleep-EEG in the vulnerable newborn baby
T2  - 2018 40TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)
AB  - Newborn babies, particularly preterms, can exhibit early deviations in sleep maturation as seen by Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. This may be indicative of cognitive problems by school-age. The current 'clinically-driven' approach uses separate algorithms to first extract sleep states and then predict EEG 'brain-age'. Maturational deviations are identified when the brain-age no longer matches the Postmenstrual Age (PMA, the age since the last menstrual cycle of the mother). However, the PMA range where existing sleep staging algorithms perform optimally, is limited, which subsequently limits the PMA range for brain-age prediction.
   We introduce a Bayesian Parametric Model (BPM) as a single end-to-end solution to directly estimate brain-age, modelling for sleep state maturation without requiring a separately optimized sleep staging algorithm. Comparison of this model with a traditional multi-stage approach, yields a similar Krippendorff's alpha = 0.92 (a performance measure ranging from 0 (chance agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement)) with the BPM performing better at younger ages <30 weeks PMA. The BPM's potential to detect maturational deviations is also explored on a few preterm babies who were abnormal at 9 months follow-up.

TI  - Menstrual Cycles of Autonomic Functions and Physical Activities
T2  - 2018 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AWARENESS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (ICAST)
AB  - Although there are many reports on the fluctuation of autonomic nervous function associated with the menstrual cycle, most of them are the comparison between two points during follicular and luteal phases. Also, autonomic nervous functions under free behavior are influenced by physical activities which could be also affected by the menstrual cycle. This study proposed a method using data of physical activity and heart rate variability measured over the total period of a menstrual cycle and analyzed activity-type-specific autonomic nervous functions. This method revealed the fluctuations of autonomic nervous functions with menstrual cycle that were not reported previously.

TI  - Prevalence of somatic and urogenital symptoms as well as psychological health in women aged 45 to 55 attending primary health care: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Women's physical and mental ill-health such as stress-related symptoms, depression, pain, hypertension and urogenital health shows a marked increase around the ages 45-55 years. These women are an important group for Primary Health Care (PHC) due to their prevalent symptoms and illnesses. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of somatic, psychological and urogenital symptoms in women aged 45-55 attending PHC and evaluate factors associated with severe symptoms.
   Methods: One hundred and thirty-one women were recruited from PHC in southwestern Sweden. Data were obtained from two self-reported questionnaires, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
   Results: Exhaustion, depressive mood, muscle and joint problems, sleep and sexual problems were the most prevalent reported symptoms. Half of the women reported heart discomfort. Depression and increasing age were correlated to more severe symptoms.
   Conclusion: We recommend that cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal symptoms, sexual problems, sleeping problems and mental health should be actively asked for when women aged 45 to 55 attend PHC. We propose that preventive counselling of women in PHC before the age 45 should be evaluated in future studies.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, Mindfulness, and Yoga in Patients With Breast Cancer with Sleep Disturbance: A Literature Review
T2  - BREAST CANCER-BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH
AB  - The number of patients with breast cancer diagnosed with sleep disturbance has grown substantially within the United States over the past 20 years. Meanwhile, there have been significant improvements in the psychological treatment of sleep disturbance in patients with breast cancer. More specifically, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), mindfulness, and yoga have shown to be 3 promising treatments with varying degrees of benefit, supporting data, and inherent limitations. In this article, we will outline the treatment approach for sleep disturbance in patients with breast cancer and conduct a comprehensive review of CBT-I, mindfulness, and yoga as they pertain to this patient population.

TI  - Cardiometabolic Risk in PCOS: More than a Reproductive Disorder
T2  - CURRENT DIABETES REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is diagnosed by its characteristic reproductive features. However, PCOS is also associated with metabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. The severity of these abnormalities varies according to the reproductive phenotype, with the so-called NIH or classic phenotype conferring the greatest metabolic risk. The increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is well established among affected women with the NIH phenotype, but whether PCOS also confers an increased risk for cardiovascular events remains unknown. Recent Findings Recent studies in daughters of affected women have found evidence for pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction prior to menarche. Further, genetic analyses have provided evidence that metabolic abnormalities such as obesity and insulin resistance contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. Summary PCOS increases the risk for T2D. However, the risk for cardiovascular disease has not been quantified, and prospective, longitudinal studies are still critically needed.

TI  - Oral Contraceptives and Renal Water Handling
T2  - PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB  - To test the hypothesis that use of oral contraceptives (OC) changes diurnal variation in fluid balance mechanisms including blood pressure, secretion of vasopressin and oxytocin, and renal water and electrolyte excretion. Fifteen naturally cycling (NC) women in mid-follicular phase and 11 long-term OC users were included in a 24-h standardized inpatient study for measurements of vasopressin, oxytocin, sodium, and osmolality in plasma as well as urinary excretion of electrolytes, aquaporin-2, and prostaglandin E2. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored noninvasively. Plasma vasopressin showed circadian rhythm (P = 0.02) and were similar in both groups (P = 0.18) including nighttime increases (P < 0.001). There was no circadian rhythm in plasma oxytocin within (P = 0.84) or between groups (P = 0.22). OC users had significantly lower plasma osmolality (Delta osm: 3.05 +/- 0.29 mosm/kg, P = 0.04) and lower plasma sodium (Delta Na+: 0.91 +/- 0.09 mmol/l, P = 0.05). The two groups showed similar nighttime decreases in diuresis (1.08 +/- 0.04 mL/(kg +/- h), P < 0.001) and increases in urine osmolality (109 +/- 9 mosm/kg, P = 0.02), but similar rates of excretion of Aquaporin-2, prostaglandin E2 and sodium. Nighttime decreases in mean arterial pressure of approximately 13% were significant in both groups (P < 0.001), but 24-h average mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in OC users than in controls (+ 4.7 +/- 0.4 mmHg, P = 0.02). Packed cell volumes were similar between groups (P = 0.54). OC does not change the diurnal patterns of renal fluid excretion, but resets the osmoreceptors for vasopressin release and leads to a significant increase in arterial blood pressure.

TI  - Sleep Duration and Risk of Liver Cancer in Postmenopausal Women: The Women's Health Initiative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Sleep duration has been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but its association with liver cancer remains unknown. Material and Methods: In the prospective Women's Health Initiative Study, 139,368 postmenopausal women reported sleep habits at baseline (1993-1998). We ascertained 175 incident liver cancer cases during an average 13.8 years of follow-up through August 2014. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate a hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for risk of liver cancer in association with nocturnal sleep duration. Results: Compared to women reporting 6-8 hours of sleep, the HR for liver cancer was 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.53) for women reporting 9 hours of sleep. Among the obese women, the HR associated with 9 hours of sleep was 3.18 (95% CI 1.84-8.60). The HR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.34-2.53) among nonobese women (p value for interaction=0.18). Short sleep duration (5 hours) was not associated with liver cancer risk. Conclusion: Long sleep duration was associated with a moderate increase in liver cancer risk in obese postmenopausal women in the United States. Larger study is needed to confirm our observation on effect modification by adiposity status.

TI  - The Follicle-Stimulating Hormone as Best Classifier for Diagnosis of Natural Menopause
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cut-off value of parameters related to menopause in women recruited through the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study.
   Materials and Methods: A household survey sample of 397 women was submitted to biochemical analysis after overnight fasting for determination of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol levels. Volunteers were randomly selected to represent the population of SAo Paulo according to gender, age, and socioeconomic status. The cut-off values were determined from the receiver operating characteristic curve and by determining the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the parameters.
   Results: FSH, LH, and age provided >90% accuracy for defining the menopause group. Classification of menopause according to FSH level provided the highest level of accuracy (97.0%) based on a cut-off value of 21 mIU/mL as a classifier.
   Conclusions: The cut-off value for FSH alone was able to distinguish with higher efficiency premenopause and postmenopause groups. FSH levels provided greater accuracy in the diagnosis of natural menopause, compared to the other parameters.

TI  - Family nurture intervention in preterm infants increases early development of cortical activity and independence of regional power trajectories
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - Aim: Premature delivery and maternal separation during hospitalisation increase infant neurodevelopmental risk. Previously, a randomised controlled trial of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) in the neonatal intensive care unit demonstrated improvement across multiple mother and infant domains including increased electroencephalographic (EEG) power in the frontal polar region at term age. New aims were to quantify developmental changes in EEG power in all brain regions and frequencies and correlate developmental changes in EEG power among regions.
   Methods: EEG (128 electrodes) was obtained at 34-44 weeks postmenstrual age from preterm infants born 26-34 weeks. Forty-four infants were treated with Standard Care and 53 with FNI. EEG power was computed in 10 frequency bands (1-48 Hz) in 10 brain regions and in active and quiet sleep.
   Results: Percent change/week in EEG power was increased in FNI in 132/200 tests (p < 0.05), 117 tests passed a 5% False Discovery Rate threshold. In addition, FNI demonstrated greater regional independence in those developmental rates of change.
   Conclusion: This study strengthens the conclusion that FNI promotes cerebral cortical development of preterm infants. The findings indicate that developmental changes in EEG may provide biomarkers for risk in preterm infants as well as proximal markers of effects of FNI.

TI  - Simultaneous measurement of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase: Application and recommendations
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Salivary cortisol (sCort) and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) constitute proxy measures of the two major stress response systems, i.e. the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system, respectively. Potentially confounding determinants of sCort and sAA may limit a reliable concurrent measurement of both biomarkers, if not adequately considered. We reviewed the most important determinants of sCort and sAA and provide recommendations for handling these potential confounders. We focused on a selection of confounders, resulting in an in-depth consideration of age, sex steroid-related factors, somatic health, acute medication, smoking, consumption of food and drinks, alcohol consumption, physical activity/fitness, and sleep. Our review further highlights the importance of the consideration of potential confounders for a reliable and valid simultaneous measurement of sCort and sAA. We further provide recommendations about which and how to handle relevant confounders in the study design or data analysis.

TI  - Sleep characteristics, light at night and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Increasing numbers of women in the US are getting too little sleep. Inadequate sleep has been associated with impaired metabolic function and endocrine disruption. Sister Study cohort participants (n=50,884), completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires on sleep patterns. Incident breast cancers estrogen receptor (ER) status of the tumor were ascertained from questionnaires and medical records. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Analyses of sleep characteristics reported at the first follow-up interview included only participants who were breast cancer-free at time of follow-up interview. Over similar to 7 years of follow-up, 2,736 breast cancer cases (invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ) were diagnosed. There was little evidence that usual sleep duration or other sleep characteristics were associated with breast cancer. However, relative to those with no difficulty sleeping, women who reported having difficulty sleeping similar to 4 nights a week were at an increased risk of overall (HR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.09-1.61) and postmenopausal breast cancer (HR=1.51, 95% CI 1.24-1.85). Risk of ER+ invasive cancer was elevated for women who reported having a light or television on in the room while sleeping (HR=1.20, 95% CI: 0.97-1.47) or who typically got less sleep than they needed to feel their best (HR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.98-1.50). In our study, most sleep characteristics, including sleep duration, were not associated with an increased risk although higher risk was observed for some markers of inadequate or poor quality sleep.

TI  - Regular exercise improves the well-being of parents of children with cancer
T2  - PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER
AB  - Aim: Parents of children with cancer describe impaired physical and social functioning, sleep disturbance and poor mental health. Exercise-related interventions impact positively on these quality of life domains, but have not been examined in this population. The aim of this longitudinal pilot study was to explore the feasibility of a 12-week pedometer-monitored walking intervention among parents of children with cancer, assessing adherence to a set activity target of 70,000 steps per week, and to explore the benefits of physical activity on mental and physical health.
   Methods: Parents were provided with a pedometer and requested to achieve a daily step count of 10,000 steps per day for 12 weeks. Mood, well-being and psychological distress were examined using validated questionnaires (Profile of Mood States 2nd edition [POMS-2], Distress Thermometer for Parents [DT-P] and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales [DASS-42]) at baseline, midpoint (6 weeks) and endpoint (12 weeks) to identify changes in these domains with increased activity.
   Results: Fifteen parents were recruited. The majority increased their counts during the first 4 weeks of the study and maintained this to week 8 (n = 12). Time-dependent improvements were identified in the following psychometric test outcomes at week 12: DT-P score (likelihood ratio test [LRT] P = 0.02), POMS-2 total mood disturbance (LRT P = 0.03), fatigue inertia (LRT P = 0.009), tension anxiety (LRT P = 0.007) and vigour activity (LRT P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Mental health benefits of a pedometer-based exercise intervention for parents of children with cancer were identified. Such programs should be included in a holistic approach to improve the psychological outcomes of parents whose children are receiving treatment for cancer.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study is to examine the life-long relationship between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and mania/hypomania symptoms and declared personality structure among girls who are university students. Methods: A total of 294 volunteers selected by random sampling method from 13 universities located in Fatih (4), Sisli (5) and Uskudar (4) districts of Istanbul were included in the study. The inventories used in data collection phase of the study are Premenstrual Assessment Form (PAF), the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and a Sociodemographic Form developed by the research group. Results: %5.1 of the participants (n=15) are between 17-19 years of age, 83.7% (n=246) are between 20-23 years of age, 5.1% (n=15) are 24-26 years of age and 6.1% (n=18) are 27-28 years of age. There is a significant correlation between depressive affect, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, depressive thoughts, pain, appetite changes and sleep thoughts which are the dimensions of PAF and MDQ scores. There is a significant relationship between the age variable and depressive affect, depressive thoughts and MDQ scores. There is a significant relationship between depressive affect, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, depressive thoughts, pain, appetite changes and sleep thoughts which are the dimensions of Premenstrual Assessment Form and declared personality structure. Conclusion: According to the findings of our study, there is a statistically significant relationship between hormonal changes in PMS and mania/hypomania symptoms. Additionally, there is a statistically significant relationship between PMS and declared personality structure.

TI  - A case-control study on risk factors of breast cancer in Han Chinese women
T2  - ONCOTARGET
AB  - This study aimed to investigate risk factors associated with breast cancer among Han Chinese women in northern and eastern China. A matched case-control study involving 1489 patients with breast cancer and 1489 controls was conducted across 21 hospitals in 11 provinces in China, from April 2012 to April 2013. We developed a structured questionnaire to record information from face-to-face interviews with participants. Student's t-tests, Pearson's chi-square tests, and univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables with significant differences between the case and control groups. Ten variables were identified (P<0.05): location, economic status, waist-to-hip ratio, menopause, family history of breast cancer, present life satisfaction, sleep satisfaction, milk products, behavior prevention scores, and awareness of breast cancer. We identified a comprehensive range of factors related to breast cancer, among which several manageable factors may contribute to breast cancer prevention. Further prospective studies concerning psychological interventions, sleep regulation, health guidance, and physical exercise are required. A screening model for high-risk populations should be put on the agenda.

TI  - Vertigo and dizziness in adolescents: Risk factors and their population attributable risk
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objectives
   To assess potential risk factors for vertigo and dizziness in adolescents and to evaluate their variability by different vertigo types. The role of possible risk factors for vertigo and dizziness in adolescents and their population relevance needs to be addressed in order to design preventive strategies.
   Study design
   The study population consisted of 1482 school-children between the age of 12 and 19 years, who were instructed to fill out a questionnaire on different vertigo types and related potential risk factors. The questionnaire specifically asked for any vertigo, spinning vertigo, swaying vertigo, orthostatic dizziness, and unspecified dizziness. Further a wide range of potential risk factors were addressed including gender, stress, muscular pain in the neck and shoulder region, sleep duration, migraine, coffee and alcohol consumption, physical activity and smoking.
   Results
   Gender, stress, muscular pain in the neck and shoulder region, sleep duration and migraine were identified as independent risk factors following mutual adjustment: The relative risk was 1.17 [1.10 - 1.25] for female sex, 1.07 [1.02 - 1.13] for stress, 1.24 [1.17 - 1.32] for muscular pain, and 1.09 [1.03 - 1.14] for migraine. The population attributable risk explained by these risk factors was 26%, with muscular pain, stress, and migraine accounting for 11%, 4%, and 3% respectively.
   Conclusion
   Several established risk factors in adults were also identified in adolescents. Risk factors amenable to prevention accounted for 17% of the total population risk. Therefore, interventions targeting these risk factors may be warranted.

TI  - Food-Predicting Stimuli Differentially Influence Eye Movements and Goal Directed Behavior in Normal-Weight, Overweight, and Obese Individuals
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Obese individuals have been shown to exhibit abnormal sensitivity to rewards and reward-predicting cues as for example food-associated cues frequently used in advertisements. It has also been shown that food-associated cues can increase goal-directed behavior but it is currently unknown, whether this effect differs between normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals. Here, we investigate this question by using a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) task in normal-weight (N = 20), overweight (N = 17), and obese (N = 17) individuals. Furthermore, we applied eye tracking during Pavlovian conditioning to measure the participants' conditioned response as a proxy of the incentive salience of the predicted reward. Our results show that the goal-directed behavior of overweight individuals was more strongly influenced by food-predicting cues (i.e., stronger PIT effect) than that of normal-weight and obese individuals (p < 0.001). The weight groups were matched for age, gender, education, and parental education. Eye movements during Pavlovian conditioning also differed between weight categories (p < 0.05) and were used to categorize individuals based on their fixation style into "high eye index" versus "low eye index" as well. Our main finding was that the fixation style exhibited a complex interaction with the weight category. Furthermore, we found that normal-weight individuals of the group "high eye index" had higher body mass index within the healthy range than individuals of the group "low eye index" (p < 0.001), but this relationship was not found within in the overweight or obese groups (p > 0.646). Our findings are largely consistent with the incentive sensitization theory predicting that overweight individuals are more susceptible to food related cues than normal weight controls. However, this hypersensitivity might be reduced in obese individuals, possibly due to habitual/compulsive overeating or differences in reward valuation.

TI  - Sexual Dysfunction in Premenopausal Women With Obstructive Sleep Apnea
T2  - UROLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose: Sexual functions in the males with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have been well investigated in the literature; however sexual functions in the premenopausal women with OSAS have been studied to a lesser extent.
   Materials and methods: The study included 22 premenopausal women diagnosed as OSAS by the polysomnographic (PSG) evaluation. The control group included 13 premenopausal women suspected of sleep-related respiratory disorder, but whose PSG tests were determined to be normal. Both groups were administered Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS), Beck Depression Scale (BDS), and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire forms. Relations between disease parameters, and the total FSFI score, and scores of the six FSFI parameter were analyzed.
   Results: The total FSFI score in the cases with OSAS, was determined to be significantly lower than that of the control subjects (P = .031). Scores of the desire, arousal, and orgasm were determined to be significantly lower in the patient group, compared to control group (P = .034;P = .048; P = .039). The total FSFI scores, and scores of the desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain subscales in the cases did not correlate significantly with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), Non-Rapid Eye Movement 1 (NREMI)%, NREM2%, NREM3%, REM%, the time spent with saturation O-2 < 90%, minimum oxygen saturation (%), ESS scores, and BDS scores (all P > .05).
   Conclusion: Women with OSAS experience sexual dysfunction when compared with normal population. Clinical evaluation has to include also the evaluation of sexual life in women.

TI  - The effect of sex and menstrual phase on memory formation during a nap
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY
AB  - Memory formation can be influenced by sleep and sex hormones in both men and women, and by the menstrual cycle in women. Though many studies have shown that sleep benefits the consolidation of memories, it is not clear whether this effect differs between men and women in general or according to menstrual phase in women. The present study investigated the effect of sex and menstrual cycle on memory consolidation of face-name associations (FNA) following a daytime nap. Recognition memory was tested using a face-name paired associates task with a polysomnographic nap between morning and evening testing. Seventeen healthy women (age: 20.75 (1.98) years) were studied at two time points of their menstrual cycles, defined from self-report and separated by 2 weeks (perimenses: -5 days to +6 days from the start of menses, and non-perimenses: outside of the perimenses phase), and compared with eighteen healthy men (age: 22.01 (2.91) years). Regardless of menstrual phase, women had better pre-nap performance than men. Further, menstrual phase affected post-nap memory consolidation, with women showing greater forgetting in their perimenses phase compared with their non-perimenses phase and men. Interestingly, post-nap performance correlated with electrophysiological events during sleep (slow oscillations, spindles, and temporal coupling between the two), however, these correlations differed according to menstrual phase and sex. Men's performance improvement was associated with the temporal coupling of spindles and slow oscillations (i.e., spindle/SO coincidence) as well as spindles. Women, however, showed an association with slow oscillations during non-perimenses, whereas when they were in their perimenses phase of their cycle, women appeared to show an association only with sleep spindle events for consolidation. These findings add to the growing literature demonstrating sex and menstrual phase effects on memory formation during sleep.

TI  - Gender and the circadian pattern of body temperature in normoxia and hypoxia
T2  - RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Circadian patterns are at the core of many physiological processes, and their disruption can have short and long-term consequences. This essay focuses on one of the best known patterns, the daily oscillation of body temperature (Tb), and the possibility of its difference between genders. From human and animal studies globally considered, the tentative conclusion is reached that differences in Tb circadian pattern between genders are very small and probably limited to the timing of the rhythm, not to its amplitude. Such similarity between genders, despite the differences in hormonal systems, presumably testifies to the importance that the Tb circadian pattern plays in the economy of the organism and its survival against environmental challenges. The second part of the article presents some previously unpublished experimental data from behaving male and female rats during hypoxia in synchronized conditions. In adult rats hypoxia (10.5% O-2 for three days) caused a profound drop of the Tb daily oscillations; by day 3 they were 55% (female) and 22% (male) of the normoxic amplitudes, with a statistically significant gender difference. In pre-puberty rats (26-day old) hypoxia caused a major disruption of the circadian pattern qualitatively similar to the adults but not different between genders. Hence, on the basis of this preliminary set of data, it seems that sex-hormones may be a factor in how the Tb daily pattern responds to hypoxia. The implications of the effects of hypoxia on the circadian patterns, and the possibility that such effects may differ between genders, are matters that could have biological and clinical implications and deserve further investigations.

TI  - Preterm infants at discharge: nap polysomnography versus 24-hour oximetry
T2  - ACTA PAEDIATRICA
AB  - Aim: This study aimed to determine whether measures of intermittent hypoxia derived from 24-hour oximetry correlate with measures of apnoea derived from modified nap polysomnography undertaken for preterm infants before discharge.
   Methods: Infants born 32 weeks of gestation were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit and had a modified polysomnography to assess their respiratory stability once they were 35 weeks of postmenstrual age. Infants were defined as unstable if they had more than 10 obstructive events per hour or any apnoea of >20 seconds in length. Infants also had a 24-hour oximetry performed during this period. The results of the 24-oximetry desaturation index (DSI) were compared to nap polysomnography results for central and obstructive apnoea indices and correlations tested.
   Results: Twenty-four infants completed the study. There were 15 (63%) infants defined as unstable by the modified polysomnography. The 3% DSI and 4% DSI from the 24-hour oximetry were significantly higher in the unstable infants, and values for all infants correlated with the obstructive index and the central apnoea index from the modified polysomnography.
   Conclusion: The 3% DSI and 4% DSI values from a 24-hour oximetry study may provide noninvasive measures of respiratory stability in preterm infants ready for discharge.

TI  - Decreased ocular blood flow after photocoagulation therapy in neonatal retinopathy of prematurity
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - To evaluate the relationships between optic nerve head blood flow, expressed as mean blur rate (MBR) measured by laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG), and photocoagulation therapy in neonates with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
   Case series study.
   We studied 5 ROP neonates either during sleep or under sedation both before and after photocoagulation, and evaluated 8 eyes in which the circulation could be measured three times consecutively. Correlations between the MBR-A (mean of all values), MBR-V (vessel mean) and MBR-T (tissue mean) and postmenstrual age were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. In addition, correlations between the relative MBR (-A, -V, -T) value and number of photocoagulation burns and the NV score were evaluated. Differences between post-treatment MBR in ROP subjects and normal neonates' MBR were estimated using analysis of covariance (ANCoVA), with adjustment for postmenstrual age.
   The relative MBR (-A, -V, -T) values after photocoagulation were 69.6 +/- 16.0%, 66.7 +/- 17.0% and 74.3 +/- 14.6%, respectively. Postmenstrual age was significantly correlated with post-treatment MBR-A (r = 0.83, p = 0.0101), MBR-V (r = 0.85, p = 0.007) and MBR-T (r = 0.76, p = 0.0282). The relative MBR-T value was significantly correlated with the number of photocoagulation burns (r = -0.75, p = 0.033) and NV score (r = -0.72, p = 0.0437). The ANCoVA results showed no significant difference between post-treatment MBR and normal neonates' MBR.
   Photocoagulation improved the dilation of veins and tortuosity of arteries and reduced ocular blood flow in ROP subjects. Since the post-treatment MBR was not different from a normal neonate's MBR, it is suggested that the pre-treatment MBR was higher in severe ROP cases.

TI  - What Happens After Menopause? (WHAM): protocol for a prospective, multicentre, age-matched cohort trial of risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in high-risk premenopausal women
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Women at high inherited risk of ovarian cancer are advised to undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) at age 40-45 years or when their families are complete. Most women are premenopausal at this age, so RRBSO will induce surgical menopause. Despite the clear benefits of RRBSO for cancer risk reduction, much less is known about the impact on non-cancer outcomes that contribute to health and well-being and inform surveillance and management strategies.
   Methods and analysis This will be a multicentre, prospective cohort study of 105 premenopausal high-risk women undergoing RRBSO and an age-matched comparison group of 105 premenopausal women not planning oophorectomy or pregnancy in the next 2 years. The aim of this study is to measure the impact of RRBSO on sexual function (primary outcome) at 24 months in high-risk premenopausal women compared with the comparison group. Secondary outcomes include menopausal symptoms and menopause-related quality of life, mood, sleep quality, markers of cardiovascular disease and pre-diabetes, bone density and markers of bone turnover, and the impact of hormone replacement therapy use on these outcomes. Data analysis methods will include logistic and linear regression using general estimating equations accounting for the repeated outcome measurements within each participant.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by institutional ethics committees at each participating centre. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and national and international networks of centres managing high-risk women, and will inform national and international clinical guidelines.

TI  - Longitudinal Study of Insomnia Symptoms Among Women During Perimenopause
T2  - JOGNN-JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC GYNECOLOGIC AND NEONATAL NURSING
AB  - Objective: To describe the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among women during perimenopause and to examine differences in self-reported insomnia symptoms at different stages of perimenopause over 10 years.
   Design: Secondary analysis of self-reported sleep symptoms and clinical variables using 10 years of publicly available data from the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN).
   Setting: The data set of women's insomnia symptoms was obtained from publicly available data from the SWAN. The parent study settings included Detroit, Michigan; Northern New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
   Participants: Multiethnic midlife women with a mean age of 46 years (N = 3,302) categorized as pre-and perimenopausal at baseline.
   Methods: Dependent variables included self-reported insomnia symptoms: difficulty falling asleep (sleep latency), wake after sleep onset, early morning awakenings, and sleep quality. Descriptive analysis was completed for each 1-year study interval. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to identify whether insomnia symptoms changed over time by stage of perimenopause.
   Results: Insomnia symptoms were present in 31% to 42% of perimenopausal women at any 1-year study interval. Insomnia symptoms were more prevalent in the late stage of perimenopause than the early stage (p<.001). The odds of having any insomnia symptoms were 1.3 times greater for women in the late stage of perimenopause than in the early stage (95% confidence interval [1.2, 1.5], p<.001).
   Conclusion: Insomnia symptoms are prevalent in women transitioning to menopause, and stage of perimenopause may heighten the risk to develop symptoms of insomnia disorder, which is associated with negative cardiometabolic outcomes.

TI  - Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and associated factors in adolescent students of a capital of northeastern Brazil
T2  - NUTRICION HOSPITALARIA
AB  - Background: Hypovitaminosis D is a frequent problem in the world and can be influenced by several factors.
   Objective: To estimate the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and associated factors in adolescent students of a capital city of northeastern Brazil.
   Methods: Cross-sectional epidemiological study assessing 220 school adolescents of both sexes aged 15 to 19 years. A questionnaire was applied to assess sociodemographic (skin color, mother's education and receiving social benefits) and behavioral data (number of hours of sleep per day, sun exposure, physical activity and dietary vitamin D intake). Anthropometric nutritional status was assessed by BMI (body mass index) for age. Serum 25 (OH) D concentrations, PTH and serum calcium were measured by blood samples. We identified individuals with hypovitaminosis D as those with 25 (01-1) D < 30 ng/dL. The analysis of factors associated with hypovitaminosis D was performed by simple and multivariate Poisson Regression.
   Results: The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was 57.3%. The female population had a significantly higher prevalence than the male. In the final adjusted model, the variable independently associated with hypovitaminosis D in females was the lowest serum calcium concentrations, and for males it was BMI, in which adolescents who had overweight/obesity were 2.4 times more likely to have hypovitaminosis D than the eutrophic ones.
   Conclusions: The present study found a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in the analyzed population, especially in female adolescents. In addition, the factors independently associated with hypovitaminosis D were found to be overweight/obese in boys and low calcium concentrations in girls.

TI  - Distinct Trajectories of Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance in Women Receiving Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY NURSING FORUM
AB  - Purpose/Objectives: To examine self-reported severity of fatigue and disturbed sleep experienced daily by women with breast cancer during multiple cycles of chemotherapy, exploring potential classes of women experiencing similar symptom trajectories.
   Design: In a secondary analysis, classes of women experiencing similar patterns of fatigue and disturbed sleep were identified.
   Setting: Oncology clinics in the United States.
   Sample: 166 women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.
   Methods: Severity scores were self-reported daily using an automated system. Classes of fatigue and disturbed sleep severity were identified using latent growth mixture modeling.
   Main Research Variables: Fatigue, disturbed sleep, age, stage of disease, education, employment, marital status, chemotherapy regimen, hours lying down, and missed work.
   Findings: Three fatigue classes were identified: mild decreasing (59% cycle 2, 64% cycle 3), low moderate decreasing (30% cycle 2, 25% cycle 3), and high moderate decreasing (11% both cycles). Two disturbed sleep classes were identified: mild decreasing (89% cycle 2, 81% cycle 3) and increasing (11% cycle 2, 19% cycle 3). Women in the high moderate decreasing fatigue class were more likely to have received doxorubicin (p = 0.02) and spent more hours lying down (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: Patterns of symptom trajectories for fatigue and disturbed sleep were distinguished by baseline symptom severity.

TI  - Sex, stress and sleep apnoea: Decreased susceptibility to upper airway muscle dysfunction following intermittent hypoxia in females
T2  - RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a devastating respiratory control disorder more common in men than women. The reasons for the sex difference in prevalence are multifactorial, but are partly attributable to protective effects of oestrogen. Indeed, OSAS prevalence increases in post-menopausal women. OSAS is characterized by repeated occlusions of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. Dysfunction of the upper airway muscles controlling airway calibre and collapsibility is implicated in the pathophysiology of OSAS, and sex differences in the neuro-mechanical control of upper airway patency are described. It is widely recognized that chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a cardinal feature of OSAS due to recurrent apnoea, drives many of the morbid consequences characteristic of the disorder. In rodents, exposure to CIH-related redox stress causes upper airway muscle weakness and fatigue, associated with mitochondria) dysfunction. Of interest, in adults, there is female resilience to CIH-induced muscle dysfunction. Conversely, exposure to CIH in early life, results in upper airway muscle weakness equivalent between the two sexes at 3 and 6 weeks of age. Ovariectomy exacerbates the deleterious effects of exposure to CIH in adult female upper airway muscle, an effect partially restored by oestrogen replacement therapy. Intriguingly, female advantage intrinsic to upper airway muscle exists with evidence of substantially greater loss of performance in male muscle during acute exposure to severe hypoxic stress. Sex differences in upper airway muscle physiology may have relevance to human OSAS. The oestrogen-oestrogen receptor a axis represents a potential therapeutic target in OSAS, particularly in post-menopausal women. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acupuncture Improves Peri-menopausal Insomnia: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: To evaluate the short-term efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of peri-menopausal insomnia (PMI).
   Methods: Design: A randomized, participant-blind, placebo-controlled trial consisted of the acupuncture group (n = 38) and placebo-acupuncture group (n = 38).
   Setting: A tertiary teaching and general hospital. Participants: 76 peri-menopausal women with insomnia disorder based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition. Interventions: A 10-session of acupuncture at bilateral Shenshu (BL 23) and Ganshu (BL 18) with unilateral Qimen (LR 14) and Jingmen (GB 25) or Streitberger needles at the same acupoints was performed for over 3 weeks. Measurements: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) with over-night polysomnography (PSG) exam were completed at baseline and post-treatment.
   Results: After the treatments, the decrease from baseline in PSQI score was 8.03 points in acupuncture group and 1.29 points in placebo-acupuncture group. The change from baseline in ISI score was 11.35 points in acupuncture group and 2.87 points in placebo-acupuncture group. In PSG data, acupuncture significantly improved the sleep efficiency and total sleep time, associated with less wake after sleep onset and lower percent stage 1 after the treatment. No significant differences from baseline to post-treatment were found in placebo-acupuncture group.
   Conclusions: Acupuncture can contribute to a clinically relevant improvement in the short-term treatment of PMI, both subjectively and objectively.

TI  - Functional maturation in preterm infants measured by serial recording of cortical activity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Minimally invasive, automated cot-side tools for monitoring early neurological development can be used to guide individual treatment and benchmark novel interventional studies. We develop an automated estimate of the EEG maturational age (EMA) for application to serial recordings in preterm infants. The EMA estimate was based on a combination of 23 computational features estimated from both the full EEG recording and a period of low EEG activity (46 features in total). The combination function (support vector regression) was trained using 101 serial EEG recordings from 39 preterm infants with a gestational age less than 28 weeks and normal neurodevelopmental outcome at 12 months of age. EEG recordings were performed from 24 to 38 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). The correlation between the EMA and the clinically determined PMA at the time of EEG recording was 0.936 (95% CI: 0.932-0.976; n = 39). All infants had an increase in EMA between the first and last EEG recording and 57/62 (92%) of repeated measures within an infant had an increasing EMA with PMA of EEG recording. The EMA is a surrogate measure of age that can accurately determine brain maturation in preterm infants.

TI  - Hypnotherapy to Reduce Hot Flashes: Examination of Response Expectancies as a Mediator of Outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - The mechanism of action responsible for hypnotherapy's effect in reducing hot flashes is not yet known. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of response expectancies as a potential mediator. Hypnotizability was also tested as an effect moderator. Data were collected from a sample of 172 postmenopausal women, who had been randomized to receive either a 5-week hypnosis intervention or structured attention counseling. Measures of response expectancies were analyzed to determine if the relationship between group assignment and hot flashes frequency was mediated by expectancies for treatment efficacy. A series of simple mediation and conditional process analyses did not support mediation of the relationship between treatment condition and hot flash frequency through response expectancy. The effect of hypnotherapy in reducing hot flashes does not appear to be due to placebo effects as determined by response expectancies. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

TI  - Fat-Bone Interactions in Adults With Spina Bifida
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ENDOCRINE SOCIETY
AB  - Context: Spina bifida (SB) can lead to changes in body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) through diminished ambulation, renal impairment, and anticonvulsant medication. With increased life expectancy, diseases such as obesity and osteoporosis are emerging comorbidities in SB, with limited data to guide management.
   Objective: To examine the relationship between cardiometabolic factors, body composition, BMD, and minimal trauma fractures (MTFs) in adults with SB.
   Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
   Setting and Participants: Forty-nine adults with SB (median age, 32.7 years; interquartile range, 22.6 to 39.0) who had undergone dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry imaging at a single tertiary hospital from 2004 to 2015.
   Results: The mean body mass index was 31.7 +/- 7.5 kg/m2; 26 (53.1%) were obese. Using age-and sexmatched fat percentiles from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, 62.5% had a total body percentage fat greater than the 95th percentile. Low bone mass (defined as a Z-score of <=-2.0) was present in 21.9% at the L1 vertebra and in 35.1% at the femoral neck. Ten (20.4%) had a history of MTFs. A BMD or Z-score at L1, femoral neck, or total body site did not correlate with the occurrence of MTF. Fat mass was significantly and positively associated with BMD after adjustment for age, sex, and height and accounted for 18.6% of the variance in BMD (P = 0.005). The prevalence of metabolic comorbidities, such as hypertension (20.4%) and obstructive sleep apnea (16.3%), was high.
   Conclusions: Obesity and low BMD are common in young adults with SB. An increased fat mass correlated significantly with BMD. The prevalence of metabolic complications in patients with SB is increased and deserves further study. Copyright (c) 2017 Endocrine Society.

TI  - Reproductive dysfunction and associated pathology in women undergoing military training
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS
AB  - Introduction Evidence from civilian athletes raises the question of whether reproductive dysfunction may be seen in female soldiers as a result of military training. Such reproductive dysfunction consists of impaired ovulation with or without long-term subfertility.
   Methods A critical review of pertinent evidence following an extensive literature search.
   Results The evidence points towards reduced energy availability as the most likely explanation for exercisei-nduced reproductive dysfunction. Evidence also suggests that reproductive dysfunction is mediated by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, with elevated ghrelin and reduced leptin likely to play an important role. The observed reproductive dysfunction exists as part of a female athletic triad, together with osteopenia and disordered eating. If this phenomenon was shown to exist with UK military training, this would be of significant concern. We hypothesise that the nature of military training and possibly field exercises may contribute to greater risk of reproductive dysfunction among female military trainees compared with exercising civilian controls. We discuss the features of military training and its participants, such as energy availability, age at recruitment, body phenotype, type of physical training, psychogenic stressors, altered sleep pattern and elemental exposure as contributors to reproductive dysfunction.
   Conclusions We identify lines of future research to more fully characterise reproductive dysfunction in military women and suggest possible interventions that, if indicated, could improve their future well-being.

TI  - Daily rhythms count for female fertility
T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Female ovulation depends on a surge in circulating luteinizing hormone (LH) which occurs at the end of the resting period and requests high circulating estradiol. This fine tuning involves both an estradiol feedback as an indicator of oocyte maturation, and the master circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nuclei as an indicator of the time of the day. This review describes the mechanisms through which daily time cues are conveyed to reproductive hypothalamic neurons to time the pre-ovulatory surge. In female rodents, neurotransmitters released by the suprachiasmatic nuclei activate the stimulatory kisspeptin neurons and reduce the inhibitory RFRP neurons precisely at the end of the afternoon of proestrus to allow a full surge in LH secretion. From these findings, the impact of circadian disruptions (during shift or night work) on female reproductive performance and fertility should now being investigated in both animal models and humans.

TI  - The Effect of Melatonin on the Sexual Function among Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial
T2  - NURSING AND MIDWIFERY STUDIES
AB  - Background: Menopause is associated with alterations in women's behaviors and sexual function. Altered sexual function can in turn causes serious health problems for women and negatively affect their marital relationships. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin on the sexual function of postmenopausal women. Methods: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was made in 2012-2013 on 240 postmenopausal women who aged 40-60 and referred to public obstetrics and gynecology clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. Participants were randomly divided into a melatonin and placebo group. Women in the melatonin and the placebo groups, respectively, received melatonin (3-mg tablets) and placebo for 3 consecutive months. Before and every 1 month during the intervention, participants' sexual function was assessed using Female Sexual Function Index. The repeated measures analysis of variance, the least significant difference, the independent sample t test, the Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were done for data analysis. Results: Sexual function mean score in the melatonin and placebo groups significantly increased from 12.49 +/- 7.07 to 20.72 +/- 8.57 and from 12.11 +/- 7.82 to 15.55 +/- 9.06, respectively. Yet, the amount of increase in the melatonin group was significantly higher than the placebo group. Moreover, there were significant differences between the groups regarding the variations of sexual function mean score across the four assessment points (P < 0.001). In addition, except for the baseline assessment point, the mean score of sexual function in the melatonin group was significantly greater than the control group at all other assessment points (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Melatonin significantly improves sexual function among postmenopausal women.

T2  - IATREIA
AB  - Introduction: the menopausal manifestations should be studied by ethnic considerations.
   Objective: to identify the most prevalent menopausal manifestations and to evaluate quality of life according to menstrual states.
   Methods: this study is a part of CAVIMEC [Quality of Life in Menopause and Colombian Ethnic Groups], performed with Cervantes Scale, which evaluates CV in menopause, in 646 Afro-Colombians, aged 40-59 years, living in populations of the Caribbean and Pacific.
   Results: mean age 48.7 +/- 5.7 years, 69.1% with obesity/overweight, 22.7% with university/technological studies and 40.5% postmenopausal. The most prevalent manifestations: hot flashes 76.4%; suffocation 73.1%; Muscle/joint pain 71.3%; they couldn't sleep 61.8%; easy sweating episode 55.8%; dry skin 50.4% and headache that increased during the day 44.2%. The third part could not be good by the nerves, things like boring, lost the ability to relax or noticed that everyone was spinning 24.4% had less interest in sex and 14.4% had not significant sexuality. Postmenopausal women had worse scores in most of the manifestations and in the domains of health, psychic, sexuality, relationship, vasomotor, health, aging and global.
   Conclusion: hot flashes, suffocations and muscle/joint pain were the manifestations most prevalent, in seven out of ten. Postmenopausal women had worse quality of life.

TI  - Elderly Women's Experience of the Role of Hydrotherapy in Health: Content Analysis
T2  - QUALITATIVE REPORT
AB  - Living to an old age is considered by many elderly women to bring about a decreased quality of life. Hydrotherapy allows individuals to engage in certain physical activities that cannot be done outside the water. The purpose of this study was to explore elderly women's experience of the role of hydrotherapy in their health and was conducted in selected pools of Guilan province in Iran in 2015-2016. Twenty-three elderly women were selected using a purposeful sampling strategy. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews; Researchers used a qualitative design, based on a content analysis approach. Analysis results were identified as 3 main themes and 12 subthemes. Improved physical health: reduced consumption of painkillers, improved balance, pleasant breathing, easy menopause; Moving toward ability: increased independence, role fulfillment, application of efficient strategies, will to health; Psychological and social relief: sense of liveliness, reduced stress, peaceful sleep and re-emergence in society. "Competence development" was identified as the central code. Results indicate that participation in hydrotherapy by elderly women supported the benefit of advising them to participate in hydrotherapy sessions, as well as government's cooperation with regard to creating proper conditions for improving the health and life quality of this valuable population.

TI  - Unobtrusive assessment of neonatal sleep state based on heart rate variability retrieved from electrocardiography used for regular patient monitoring
T2  - EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
AB  - As an approach of unobtrusive assessment of neonatal sleep state we aimed at an automated sleep state coding based only on heart rate variability obtained from electrocardiography used for regular patient monitoring. We analyzed active and quiet sleep states of preterm infants between 30 and 37 weeks postmenstrual age. To determine the sleep states we used a nonlinear kernel support vector machine for sleep state separation based on known heart rate variability features. We used unweighted and weighted misclassification penalties for the imbalanced distribution between sleep states. The validation was performed with leave-one-out-cross-validation based on the annotations of three independent observers. We analyzed the classifier performance with receiver operating curves leading to a maximum mean value for the area under the curve of 0.87. Using this sleep state separation methods, we show that automated active and quiet sleep state separation based on heart rate variability in preterm infants is feasible.

TI  - Effect of Time of Administration of Teriparatide on Bone Mineral Density in Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL DENSITOMETRY
AB  - Teriparatide (TPTD) (recombinant DNA origin human parathormone [1-34]) is approved for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO). There are reports of factors that affect the response to TPTD in GIO treatment. This work describes the case of a 71-yr-old woman diagnosed with lupus nephropathy treated with 40 mg/d of meprednisone, and who suffered multiple vertebral fractures. Despite treatment with a single 5 mg dose of zoledronic acid, the patient continued to have vertebral fractures. Treatment with 20 mu g/d of subcutaneous TPTD (PTH1-34, Forteo; Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, IN) was initiated. Nine months after the onset of treatment, bone mineral density (BMD) assessment showed a 5% decrease in lumbar spine BMD. Factors potentially affecting the results were analyzed. The patient reported injecting TPTD at night and was instructed to inject TPTD in the morning before breakfast. After changing the time of TPTD administration and 22 mo after initiating treatment, BMD assessment was repeated and showed an 18% increase at the lumbar spine and no new vertebral fractures. The time of TPTD administration might affect the response to TPTD in GIO treatment.

TI  - Complexity Analysis of Neonatal EEG Using Multiscale Entropy: Applications in Brain Maturation and Sleep Stage Classification
T2  - ENTROPY
AB  - Automated analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) data for the brain monitoring of preterm infants has gained attention in the last decades. In this study, we analyze the complexity of neonatal EEG, quantified using multiscale entropy. The aim of the current work is to investigate how EEG complexity evolves during electrocortical maturation and whether complexity features can be used to classify sleep stages. First , we developed a regression model that estimates the postmenstrual age (PMA) using a combination of complexity features. Then, these features are used to build a sleep stage classifier. The analysis is performed on a database consisting of 97 EEG recordings from 26 prematurely born infants, recorded between 27 and 42 weeks PMA. The results of the regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the EEG complexity and the infant's age. Moreover, the PMA of the neonate could be estimated with a root mean squared error of 1.88 weeks. The sleep stage classifier was able to discriminate quiet sleep from nonquiet sleep with an area under the curve (AUC) of 90%. These results suggest that the complexity of the brain dynamics is a highly useful index for brain maturation quantification and neonatal sleep stage classification.

TI  - Sex differences in age-related changes in the sleep-wake cycle
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Age-related changes in sleep and circadian regulation occur as early as the middle years of life. Research also suggests that sleep and circadian rhythms are regulated differently between women and men. However, does sleep and circadian rhythms regulation age similarly in men and women? In this review, we present the mechanisms underlying age-related differences in sleep and the current state of knowledge on how they interact with sex. We also address how testosterone, estrogens, and progesterone fluctuations across adulthood interact with sleep and circadian regulation. Finally, we will propose research avenues to unravel the mechanisms underlying sex differences in age-related effects on sleep.

TI  - Ovarian hormones, sleep and cognition across the adult female lifespan: An integrated perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Loss of ovarian function in women is associated with sleep disturbance's and cognitive decline, which suggest a key role for estrogens and/or progestins in modulating these symptoms. The effects of ovarian hormones on sleep and cognitive processes have been studied in separate research fields that seldom intersect. However, sleep has a considerable impact on cognitive function. Given the tight connections between sleep and cognition, ovarian hormones may influence selective aspects of cognition indirectly, via the modulation of sleep. In support of this hypothesis, a growing body of evidence indicates that the development of sleep disorders following menopause contributes to accelerated cognitive decline and dementia in older women. This paper draws from both the animal and human literature to present an integrated view of the effects of ovarian hormones on sleep and cognition across the adult female lifespan.

TI  - Effect of different light-dark schedules on estrous cycle in mice, and implications for mitigating the adverse impact of night work
T2  - GENES TO CELLS
AB  - Approximately 20% of workers in developed countries are involved in night work. Nevertheless, many studies have strongly suggested that night-work-induced chronic circadian misalignment increases the risk of a diverse range of health problems. Although a relation between night work and irregular menstrual cycles has been indicated epidemiologically, a direct causal link remains elusive. Here, we report that repetitive reversal of light-dark (LD) cycles triggers irregular estrous cycles in mice. The findings showed that the estrous cycle remained irregular for more than four weeks after the mice were returned to regular LD cycles. Importantly, the magnitude of the negative impact of reversed LD cycles on the estrous cycle, or more specifically the decreased number of normal estrous cycles during the observation period, was dependent on the difference in the frequency of LD reversal. Presently, no clear solution to prevent night-work-mediated menstrual abnormalities is available, and reducing night work in modern society is difficult. Our findings indicate that optimizing work schedules could significantly prevent menstrual problems without reducing total night-work time.

TI  - Distal skin vasodilation promotes rapid sleep onset in preterm neonates
T2  - JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
AB  - Although sleep is of paramount importance for preterm neonates, care of the latter in a neonatal intensive care unit does not favour sleep. Given that several studies in adults have described a .;vegetative preparedness to sleep' (in which distal skin vasodilation before lights-out promotes rapid sleep onset), we looked at whether or not this process operates in preterm neonates. Sleep propensity was assessed in terms of the duration of a spontaneous episode of wakefulness (W). Skin temperatures at six body sites (the abdomen, pectoral region, eye, hand, thigh and foot) were measured (using infrared thermography) during nocturnal polysomnography in 29 9-day-old preterm neonates (postmenstrual age: 209 +/- 9 days). We then determined whether the duration of the W episode depended upon the local skin temperatures measured at the start, during and end of the episode. The W episode was shorter when distal skin temperatures (thigh, hand and foot) and the pectoral temperature were higher at the end of the episode (i.e. at sleep onset). The relationship with the duration of the W episode was not significant for temperatures measured at the start of the W episode. We observed gradual distal vasodilation at the pectoral region, the thigh, hand and foot (i.e. affecting most of the body's skin surface) during W episodes. Our results constitute initial evidence to show that distal vasodilation may have a key role in facilitating sleep onset in very preterm neonates.

TI  - Intermittent 96-Hour Auricular Electroacupuncture for Hot Flashes in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Pilot Study
T2  - MEDICAL ACUPUNCTURE
AB  - Objective: The hot flash is a common vasomotor disorder that causes distress in menopausal women and that can be debilitating in men with prostate cancer who are treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The utility of auricular electroacupuncture (AEA) was tested exclusively for a small cohort of men with ADT-induced vasomotor symptoms while the men underwent a course of curative radiotherapy.
   Materials and Methods: Prior to and during radiotherapy treatment, men with vasomotor symptoms were given repeated questionnaires regarding severity and frequency of hot flashes, quality of life (QoL), and sleep over a 6-week span of an AEA protocol. Each subject's heart rate variability (HRV) was obtained repeatedly every week in an ambulatory setting with a BlueCardio device (BlueCardio, Miami, FL). The AEA intervention was given with a Neurova device (Nunka Corporation, CM Wellness Clinic, Pompano Beach, FL) that used three needles at Master points Sympathetic, Shen Men, and Point Zero, which were located precisely with a bipolar point finder. Intermittent microcurrent stimulation was given every other week for 96 hours, using a cyclic programmed output of 2 hours on and 2 hours off.
   Results: Of 10 men completing the 6-week protocol, all responded with significantly lower frequency, duration, and severity of vasomotor symptoms; QoL and sleep scores improved significantly. The HRV analysis showed significantly lower low-frequency/high-frequency power ratios in each individual, compared to baseline, that were consistent with the subjective responses.
   Conclusions: Vasomotor disturbance, caused by gender hormone withdrawal-either naturally or in patients treated with ADT, as in this study-is a well-defined neurophysiologic condition. This disorder is a constellation of findings that reflect autonomic disturbances of excessive sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activity. AEA intervention with the Neurova device is simple to administer, is well-tolerated, and appears to be effective for restoring autonomic balance. Further evaluation of AEA for vasomotor disturbances could provide more insight into the mechanisms of AEA neuromodulation and potentially lead to approaches for treating not only these symptoms but also other neurologic conditions with components of autonomic disturbances.

TI  - Weight Gain in Women at Midlife: A Concise Review of the Pathophysiology and Strategies for Management
T2  - MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS
AB  - Weight gain accompanied by an increased tendency for central fat distribution is common among women in midlife. These changes are a result of aging, decreasing estrogen levels after menopause, and other unique influences in menopausal women that interfere with the adoption of healthy lifestyle measures. Central obesity, in particular, results in several adverse metabolic consequences, including dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women, the importance of weight management in midlife cannot be overemphasized. In addition, weight gain in midlife contributes to other health risks including cancer, arthritis, mood disorders, and sexual dysfunction. It is imperative that primary care physicians screen midlife women for overweight/obesity and offer appropriate advice and referral. In addition to counseling regarding lifestyle change, behavioral modification, and psychological support, it is important to address the unique barriers to adoption of healthy lifestyle measures in postmenopausal women, including the presence of vasomotor symptoms, mood disorders, and sleep disturbance. When indicated, menopausal hormone therapy should be considered to manage bothersome symptoms. Despite its favorable influence on body fat distribution, menopausal hormone therapy cannot be recommended as a treatment for central obesity in midlife women.

TI  - Regulatory aspects of the human hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis
T2  - BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Thyroid hormones are essential for growth, differentiation and metabolism during prenatal and postnatal life. The hypothalamus-pituitary -thyroid (HPT)-axis is optimized for these actions. Knowledge of this hormonal axis is derived from decades of experiments in animals and man, and more recently from spontaneous mutations in man and constructed mutations in mice. This review examines the HPT-axis in relation to 24 h TSH profiles in men in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including obesity, age, longevity, and primary as well as central hypothyroidism. Hormone rhythms can be analyzed by quantitative methods, e.g. operator-independent deconvolution, approximate entropy and fitting the 24-h component by Cosinor analysis or related procedures. These approaches have identified some of the regulatory components in (patho)physiological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of age, sex and body mass index on cortisol secretion in 143 healthy adults
T2  - ENDOCRINE CONNECTIONS
AB  - Context: Studies on 24-h cortisol secretion are rare. The impact of sex, age and adiposity on cortisol levels, often restricted to one or a few samples, are well recognized, but conflicting.
   Objective: To investigate cortisol dynamics in 143 healthy men and women, spanning 7 decades and with a 2-fold body mass index (BMI) range with different analytic tools.
   Setting: Clinical Research Unit.
   Design: Cortisol concentrations in 10-min samples collected for 24 h. Outcomes were mean levels, deconvolution parameters, approximate entropy (ApEn, regularity statistic) and 24-h rhythms.
   Results: Total 24-h cortisol secretion rates estimated by deconvolution analysis were sex, age and BMI independent. Mean 24-h cortisol concentrations were lower in premenopausal women than those in men of comparable age (176 +/- 8.2 vs 217 +/- 9.4 nmol/L, P = 0.02), but not in subjects older than 50 years. This was due to lower daytime levels in women, albeit similar in the quiescent overnight period. Aging increased mean cortisol by 10 nmol/L per decade during the quiescent secretory phase and advanced the acrophase of the diurnal rhythm by 24 min/decade. However, total 24-h cortisol secretion rates estimated by deconvolution analysis were sex, age and BMI independent. ApEn of 24-h profiles was higher (more random) in premenopausal women than those in men (1.048 +/- 0.025 vs 0.933 +/- 0.023, P = 0.001), but not in subjects older than 50 years. ApEn peaked during the daytime.
   Conclusion: Sex and age jointly determine the 24-h cortisol secretory profile. Sex effects are largely restricted to age <50 years, whereas age effects elevate concentrations in the late evening and early night and advance the timing of the peak diurnal rhythm.

TI  - Managing Menopausal Symptoms and Associated Clinical Issues in Breast Cancer Survivors
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB  - Objective: Review evidence to guide management of menopausal signs and symptoms in women after breast cancer and make recommendations accordingly.
   Evidence: Randomized controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies.
   Background: Symptoms and clinical problems associated with estrogen depletion-sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis-confront the estimated 9.3 million breast cancer survivors globally.
   Recommendations: Following breast cancer, women should not generally be treated with menopausal hormone therapy or tibolone but should optimize lifestyle. Women with moderate to severe symptoms may benefit from mind-brain behavior or nonhormone, pharmacologic therapy. The selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and gabapentenoid agents improve VMS and quality of life. For osteoporosis, nonhormonal agents are available. Treatment of VVA remains an area of unmet need. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is absorbed in small amounts with blood levels remaining within the normal postmenopausal range but could potentially stimulate occult breast cancer cells, and although poorly studied, is not generally advised, particularly for those on aromatase inhibitors. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone and oral ospemiphene have been approved to treat dyspareunia, but safety after breast cancer has not been established. Vaginal laser therapy is being used for VVA but efficacy from sham-controlled studies is lacking. Therapies undergoing development include lasofoxifene, neurokinin B inhibitors, stellate ganglion blockade, vaginal testosterone, and estetrol.
   Conclusions: Nonhormone options and therapies are available for treatment of estrogen depletion symptoms and clinical problems after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Individualization of treatment is essential.

TI  - Influence of estrous cycle hormonal fluctuations and gonadal hormones on the ventilatory response to hypoxia in female rats
T2  - PFLUGERS ARCHIV-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Sex hormones may influence many physiological processes. Recently, we demonstrated that hormonal fluctuations of cycling female rats do not affect respiratory parameters during hypercapnia. However, it is still unclear whether sex hormones and hormonal fluctuations that occur during the estrous cycle can affect breathing during a hypoxic challenge. Our study aimed to evaluate respiratory, metabolic, and thermal responses to hypoxia in female rats on different days of the estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) and in ovariectomized rats that received replacement with oil (OVX), estradiol (OVX + E-2), or a combination of estradiol and progesterone (OVX + E2P). Ventilation (V (E)), tidal volume (V (T)), respiratory frequency (fR), oxygen consumption (VO2), and V (E)/VO2 were not different during the estrous cycle in normoxia or hypoxia. Body temperature (Tb) was higher during estrus, but decreased similarly in all groups during hypoxia. Compared with intact females in estrus, gonadectomized rats also had lower Tb in normoxia, but not in hypoxia. OVX rats experienced a significant drop in the ventilatory response to hypoxia, but hormonal replacement did not restore values to the levels of an intact animal. Our data demonstrate that the different phases of the estrous cycle do not alter ventilation during normoxia and hypoxia, but OVX animals display lower ventilatory responses to hypoxia compared with ovary-intact rats. Because estradiol and progesterone replacement did not cause significant differences in ventilation, our findings suggest that a yet-to-be-defined non-steroidal ovarian hormone is likely to stimulate the ventilatory responses to hypoxia in females.

TI  - The pharmacodynamic effects of combined administration of flibanserin and alcohol
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB  - What is known and objectiveFlibanserin is a serotonin 5-HT1A agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist approved for the treatment of acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. Because of the increased risk of hypotension- and syncope-related adverse events (AEs) observed with coadministration of flibanserin and alcohol, alcohol use is contraindicated. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between flibanserin and alcohol, the results of a dedicated phase 1 alcohol-interaction study and a pooled analysis of phase 3 studies of premenopausal women with HSDD are presented.
   MethodsIn the phase 1 study, healthy participants (males [n=23] and females [n=2]) were randomly assigned to one of five sequence groups, which determined the order in which they were to receive flibanserin 100 mg or placebo, with or without ethanol 0.4g/kg or 0.8g/kg. Change from baseline in seated blood pressure, orthostatic vital signs, AEs and visual analogue scale sedation outcomes were examined. Blood samples were collected at baseline and for up to 4hours after dosing to determine flibanserin area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 hours (AUC(0-4)). Pooled data from five phase 3 studies of patients receiving flibanserin 100 mg once daily (n=1543), or placebo (n=1905), were analysed.
   ResultsIn the phase 1 study, the incidence of hypotension and syncope increased when flibanserin was coadministered with ethanol. Sedation increased 20% and 27% from baseline with flibanserin plus ethanol 0.4g/kg and 0.8g/kg, respectively, at 4 hours post-dose. In the pooled analysis of phase 3 studies, 58.2% and 63.6% of participants receiving flibanserin or placebo, respectively, reported baseline alcohol use. In patients receiving flibanserin, fatigue and dizziness occurred more frequently in patients with vs. without alcohol use.
   What is new and conclusionResults from this study suggest that increased incidence of hypotension- and syncope-related events may result from a pharmacodynamic interaction between flibanserin and alcohol, although the clinical significance of these interactions in real-world populations remains unclear.

TI  - Habitual sleep quality and diurnal rhythms of salivary cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone in postmenopausal women
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been suggested as a potential mechanism linking sleep and cardiometabolic disorders. However, the associations of two primary outputs of the HPA axis, cortisol and its antagonist dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), with sleep are less well studied. In the Nurses' Health Study II, 233 postmenopausal women provided five timed saliva samples over one day (immediately upon waking, 45 min, 4 h, and 10 h after waking, and prior to going to sleep) to measure cortisol and DHEA. Of these, 209 completed assessment of their habitual sleep patterns using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We used piecewise linear mixed models to compare cross-sectional associations of slopes reflecting diurnal cortisol and DHEA rhythms with overall sleep quality and with seven sub-components. Overall, we observed no differences in the diurnal patterns of cortisol or DHEA between good versus poor sleepers as assessed by the global PSQI score. However, longer sleep latency was associated with significantly reduced cortisol awakening rise (p = 0.02). Poorer subjective sleep quality (p = 0.02), shorter sleep duration (p = 0.02), and lower sleep efficiency (p = 0.03) were associated with slower rate of cortisol decline later in the day. Women reporting daytime dysfunction had a sharper cortisol decline early in the day (p = 0.03) but a flattened decline later in the day (p = 0.01). The differences in diurnal patterns of DHEA between good versus poor sleepers, though less pronounced, were similar in direction to those of cortisol. Self-reported sleep duration, efficiency, latency and daytime dysfunction were associated with altered diurnal rhythms of cortisol and, to a lesser extent, DHEA. These findings provide support for the interplay between sleep and the HPA axis that may contribute to cardiometabolic disease.

TI  - Relationship between sleep quality and cardiovascular disease risk in Chinese post-menopausal women
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
AB  - Background: Menopause is an inevitable stage affecting every middle-aged woman. China has a large and increasing group of post-menopausal women. Most post-menopausal women suffer from increased risks for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and sleep problems. Previous studies have demonstrated the associations between sleep disorders and increased CVD risks in general population. The current study is to examine the relationship between sleep quality and CVD risks among Chinese post-menopausal women.
   Methods: This study was a sub-study nested in a cross-sectional study that investigated the sleep quality of community-dwelling adults in Xian, Shaanxi Province, China. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Framingham 10-year risk score (FRS) were used to measure sleep quality and CVD risk among 154 Chinese post-menopausal women. Multivariate regression and logistic regression were used to determine the association between sleep quality and CVD risk.
   Results: The participants (age: 63.65 +/- 4.47 years) experienced poor sleep quality (mean score of global PSQI = 8.58) and a 10-year risk of CVD of 12.54%. The CVD risk was significantly associated with sleep duration (beta = -0.18, p = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (beta = 0.33, p < 0.001). Women with good sleep quality (PSQI = 5) were less likely to be at high risk for CVD (FRS > 10%) (odds ratio = 0.51, p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Poor sleep quality might increase the CVD risk in post-menopausal women. Interventions to promote the cardiovascular health of Chinese post-menopausal women may need to include sleep promotion strategies.

TI  - Association Between Blood Pressure Lowering and Quality of Life by Treatment of Azilsartan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL HEART JOURNAL
AB  - The authors assessed the effects of switching from a conventional angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to azilsartan on blood pressure (BP) and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Key eligibility criteria were uncontrolled hypertension treated for >= 1 month with an ARB, excluding azilsartan, that did not reach the target BP. We recruited 147 patients (64 males and 83 females; mean +/- standard deviation age 73 +/- 15 years). Azilsartan reduced both systolic and diastolic BP significantly, from 151 +/- 16/82 +/- 12 to 134 +/- 17/73 +/- 12 mm Hg, 3 months after switching. Although scores on the comprehensive QOL scale, the EuroQoL 5 dimensions (EQ5D), and the simplified menopausal index (SMI) did not change, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score improved significantly, and there was a significant association between the change in the GDS score and systolic BP lowering (r = 0.2554, P = 0.030). The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) improved significantly only in the female subgroup. Besides sufficient BP lowering activity, antihypertensive treatment with azilsartan may have a favorable impact on depression in geriatric patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Photophobia and Seasonal Variation of Migraine in a Subarctic Population
T2  - HEADACHE
AB  - Objective.-To investigate associations between photophobia and seasonal variation of migraine.
   Methods.-In this cross-sectional study, migraineurs consecutively recruited were referred to a specialist center located above the Arctic Circle at 68-71 degrees North during a 2.5-year period. Data were obtained through a structured interview.
   Results.-In total, 302 migraineurs with a mean (+/- SD) age of 35.5 (+/- 12.6) years were included. Patients who reported seasonal variation of migraine (n = 90; 29.8%) also reported more often interictal photophobia than the others (61/90, 67.8% vs 92/212, 43.4%, P<.0001). Patients reported sunlight or other bright light to trigger migraine attacks in 74.4% with seasonal migraine (SM) compared with 40.6% in patients with non-seasonal migraine (NSM) (P<.0001), but there were similar frequencies of attacks reported to be triggered by sleep, menstruation, and other precipitating factors. After adjusting for migraine with aura, migraine disability, chronic migraine, interictal photophobia, and insomnia, sunlight or other bright light, photophobia was still associated with SM (OR; 3.47, CI [95%]; 1.83-6.59, P<.0001).
   Conclusions.-Migraineurs in a subarctic area reporting seasonal variation of attack frequency also report increased interictal photophobia independent of other clinical factors. Chronobiological mechanisms and/or increased activity in the visual system may be responsible for this phenomenon.

TI  - Spatial QRS-T angle in patients with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
T2  - ADVANCES IN MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the spatial QRS-T angle (QRS-TA) in a group of newly diagnosed and untreated adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and to identify potential factors affecting this parameter.
   Patients and methods: The study group (PSG-confirmed OSAS) included 62 individuals, aged 51.7 +/- 10.3 years. The control group consisted of 25 individuals, aged 46.6 +/- 16.6 years with no sleep-disordered breathing. The diagnosis of OSAS and assessment of its severity was based on unattended all-night screening polysomnography. The spatial QRS-TA was reconstructed from 12-lead ECG using Kors' regression method.
   Results: Significant differences of spatial QRS-TA values were found between patients with severe OSAS (36.9 +/- 18.9 degrees) and the controls (20.3 +/- 13.4 degrees; p < 0.01) and between patients with mild or moderate OSAS (32.3 +/- 20.1 degrees) and the controls (p = 0.01). Statistically significant correlations were found between spatial QRS-TA and polysomnographic indices (i.e. AHI, AI, RDT and RDTI).
   Conclusions: Spatial QRS-TA values are significantly higher in patients with OSAS than in controls, thus indicating increased heterogeneity of myocardial action potential. Further long-term prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of spatial QRS-TA in OSAS patients are needed. (C) 2017 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - METHOD OF DELIVERY, THE MICROBIOME AND NEURODEVELOPMENT
T2  - CURRENT ALLERGY & CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Caesarean sections, and especially elective Caesarean sections, are on the increase worldwide.
   The grey-matter volume of the foetal brain undergoes a linear increase of 1,4% per week from 29 weeks until 40 weeks of gestation. This is followed by an accelerated period of brain growth, during which 50% of the increase in cortical volume occurs, between 34 and 40 weeks of gestation. Between 37 and 40 weeks of gestation, cortical grey matter increases by 50% and myelinated white matter increases three-fold.
   According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a baby is born prematurely if it is delivered before 37 completed weeks' gestational age (GA), or before 259 days after the last normal menstrual period. As a result, the American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (ACOG) has adopted a new maturity classification that refers to babies born from 37 to 39 weeks as 'early term'. Early-term neonates are at increased risk of morbidity.
   Prematurity is associated with impaired cortical development, and ex-premature infants never achieve the same degree of cortical folding as that seen in babies born at term. Prematurity is also a major risk factor for cerebral palsy, which occurs in 35% of cases. The increased risk is directly proportional to decreasing GA. The global prevalence of cerebral palsy is 2/1 000 births. Between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation, the risk increases to 6.75/1 000 births. Importantly for the timing of elective Caesarean section, there is still an increased risk of 1.35/1 000 births even after 36 weeks of gestation. Babies who are born in the early term period (between 37 and 39 weeks GA) will later constitute 5,5% of children with special educational needs (SEN). Even those babies born at 39 weeks GA carry an elevated risk and constitute 1,7% of total SEN cases.
   Normal vaginal delivery is associated with neonatal acquisition of a maternally derived microbiome that has a rich diversity. Through bacterial peptides, the microbiome stimulates immune, endocrine and neuronal cells to release cytokines and neurotransmitters, which access the central nervous system via the blood or the vagal nerve. In this way, enteric bacteria can influence mood and behaviour, sleep-wake cycles and feeding patterns. During Caesarean section, however, the foetus is colonised instead by bacteria from the mother's skin. The microbiome that results from this has far less richness and diversity. This in turn is associated with significant risk for chronic inflammatory disorders in later life. New to our understanding of chronic inflammatory disorders that result from dysbiosis is a range of neuro-developmental problems in childhood and adults.

TI  - Gene-environment interaction study for BMI reveals interactions between genetic factors and physical activity, alcohol consumption and socioeconomic status
T2  - PLOS GENETICS
AB  - Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic loci to be associated with body mass index (BMI) and risk of obesity. Genetic effects can differ between individuals depending on lifestyle or environmental factors due to gene-environment interactions. In this study, we examine gene-environment interactions in 362,496 unrelated participants with Caucasian ancestry from the UK Biobank resource. A total of 94 BMI-associated SNPs, selected from a previous GWAS on BMI, were used to construct weighted genetic scores for BMI (GS(BMI)). Linear regression modeling was used to estimate the effect of gene-environment interactions on BMI for 131 lifestyle factors related to: dietary habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status, mental health, sleeping patterns, as well as female-specific factors such as menopause and childbirth. In total, 15 lifestyle factors were observed to interact with GSBMI, of which alcohol intake frequency, usual walking pace, and Townsend deprivation index, a measure of socioeconomic status, were all highly significant (p = 1.45*10(-29), p = 3.83*10(-26), p = 4.66*10(-11), respectively). Interestingly, the frequency of alcohol consumption, rather than the total weekly amount resulted in a significant interaction. The FTO locus was the strongest single locus interacting with any of the lifestyle factors. However, 13 significant interactions were also observed after omitting the FTO locus from the genetic score. Our analyses indicate that many lifestyle factors modify the genetic effects on BMI with some groups of individuals having more than double the effect of the genetic score. However, the underlying causal mechanisms of gene-environmental interactions are difficult to deduce from cross-sectional data alone and controlled experiments are required to fully characterise the causal factors.

TI  - A diagnostic and therapeutic approach to primary burning mouth syndrome
T2  - CLINICS IN DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is an oral mucosal disorder that is characterized by a chronic and often debilitating intraoral burning sensation for which no localized or systemic cause can be found. BMS most commonly affects postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of primary BMS is not well understood. Diagnosing BMS can prove to be challenging. BMS patients can also pose a therapeutic challenge to clinicians who are consulted to evaluate these patients. Most commonly used therapies include tricyclic antidepressants, alpha-lipoic acid, clonazepam, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Clinical judgment, patient counseling, and monitoring of pain are important. Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of serotonin and newer serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Kleine Levin syndrome; An update and mini-review
T2  - BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Since 1962, when Critchley and Hoffman coined the term Kleine Levin Syndrome (KLS) for the triad of hypersomnia, excessive eating and "often abnormal behavior" which they have observed in 11 adolescent boys, the number of patients recognized with this rare syndrome expanded, the spectrum of the clinical presentation, disease course, prognosis, gender specificity and the presence of familial cases were established. However, in spite of the progress made in neuroscience, the search for the cause, neuroanatomy, pathophysiology and drug treatment of KLS is still ongoing. In this mini-review we will describe in some detail the scientific efforts made to understand in depth the complex symptomatology of KLS and refer also to updated findings reached up till now (C) 2017 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

TI  - Early Menarche and Menstrual Problems Are Associated with Sleep Disturbance in a Large Sample of Chinese Adolescent Girls
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: Little is known about the association between menstruation and sleep disturbance in adolescent girls. This study examined sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality in relation to age at menarche and menstrual problems in a large sample of Chinese adolescent girls.
   Methods: This report represents the baseline data of an ongoing longitudinal study of the Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort in Shandong, China. A total of 5800 girls aged 12-18 years (mean age = 15.0, standard deviation = 1.4) participated in the baseline survey. A structured questionnaire was used to assess participants' age at menarche, menstrual cycle interval, menstrual flow length, period irregularity, period pain, body weight and height, and demographics. Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured by the Youth-Self Report of Child Behavioral Checklist. Sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality were assessed by the items adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
   Results: After adjusting for age, school, body mass index, internalizing and externalizing problems, and family covariates, irregular periods (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.02), period pain (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.44-2.76), and menstrual flow length >= 7 days (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.00-1.48) were significantly associated with insomnia symptoms. Irregular periods (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.30-2.27) and period pain (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.34-2.37) were significantly associated with poor sleep quality. Age at menarche <= 11 years (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.05-2.50) was significantly associated with insomnia symptoms in 12-to 14-year-old girls.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that irregular periods and period pain appear to be associated with sleep disturbance and that early menarche may have short-term impact on sleep in adolescent girls.

TI  - Associations among menopausal symptoms, sleep and fatigue in Taiwanese women with endometrial cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among menopausal symptoms, sleep quality and fatigue in women with endometrial cancer. Participants were 95 women (mean age = 57.44 +/- 10.15 years) diagnosed with endometrial cancer and who had completed their treatment before data collection. Each woman completed three structured questionnaires: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (endocrine symptom subscale), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue. Participants' worst menopausal symptom was sexual pain. In addition, menopausal symptoms were worse in women with surgical menopause than with natural menopause. The majority of women had poor sleep quality (55%), and women with fatigue reported worse sleep quality and menopausal symptoms than those without fatigue. However, higher fatigue was significantly related to shorter time since diagnosis. Together, three variables (time since diagnosis, menopausal symptoms and sleep quality) explained 39% of the variance in fatigue, with menopausal symptoms being the strongest predictor. Healthcare providers can assess menopausal symptoms and sleep quality during and after treatment of women with endometrial cancer. Such assessments would allow timely interventions to alleviate fatigue and menopausal symptoms in this population, thus improving their quality of life.

TI  - Diurnal rhythms of vitamin D binding protein and total and free vitamin D metabolites
T2  - JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB  - Vitamin D binding protein (DBP) concentration is known to influence the availability and bioactivity of vitamin D metabolites but its diurnal rhythm (DR), its inter-relationships with the DRs of vitamin D metabolites and its influence on free vitamin D metabolite concentrations are not well described.
   The DRs of plasma total 25(OH)D, total 1,25(OH)(2)D, DBP, albumin and calculated free 25(OH)D and free 1,25(OH)(2)D were measured in men and women aged 60-75 years and resident in the UK (n 30), Gambia (n 31) and China (n 30) with differences in lifestyle, dietary intake and vitamin D status. Blood samples were collected every 4 h for 24 h and DRs statistically analysed with Fourier regression.
   Gambians had significantly higher plasma concentrations of vitamin D metabolites and lower albumin concentration compared to the British and Chinese. Significant DRs were observed for all analytes and calculated free vitamin D metabolites (P < 0.01). The pattern of DRs was similar between countries. The magnitude of the DRs of free 1,25(OH)(2)D was attenuated compared to that of total 1,25(OH)(2)D whereas it was not different between total and free 25(OH)D. Relationships between the DRs were generally weak. There was no phase shift between 1,25(OH)(2)D and DBP with the strongest cross correlation at 0 h time lag (r = 0.15, P = < 0.001). In comparison, 25(OH)D correlated less well with DBP (1 h time lag, r = 0.07, P = 0.12).
   These data demonstrate a relationship between the DRs of 1,25(OH)(2)D and DBP, possibly to maintain free 1,25(OH)(2)D concentrations. In contrast, the DRs of total and free 25(OH)D appeared to be less influenced by DBP, suggesting that DBP has comparatively less effect on 25(OH)D concentration and 25(OH)D availability. This work highlights the importance of standardisation in timing of sample collection particularly for the assessment of plasma protein concentrations.

TI  - L-theanine: A potential multifaceted natural bioactive amide as health supplement
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Natural bioactive compounds from plants are of great importance in modern therapeutics, which are used to prepare antibiotics, growth supplements or some other therapeutics. L-theanine is such a bioactive amide amino acid presented in different plants and fungi, especially in tea. Theanine has influential effects on lifestyle associated diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stress relief, tumor suppression, menstruation and liver injury. This amino acid can maintain normal sleep and improve memory function and nullify effect of the neurotoxins. The rate of bioavailability and its medium of ingestion in the body is one of the great concerns for its additional antioxidant properties. Pharmacokinetics of the bioactive compound and its mode of action are described herewith. The biosynthesis and industrial synthesis are also reviewed to promote accelerated production of this bioactive compound in the pharmaceutical industries.

TI  - Predictors of distress in female breast cancer survivors: a systematic review
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Purpose Unmanaged distress has been shown to adversely affect survival and quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Fortunately, distress can be managed and even prevented with appropriate evidence-based interventions. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the published literature around predictors of distress in female breast cancer survivors to help guide targeted intervention to prevent distress.
   Methods Relevant studies were located by searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Significance and directionality of associations for commonly assessed candidate predictors (n >= 5) and predictors shown to be significant (p <= 0.05) by at least two studies were summarized descriptively. Predictors were evaluated based on the proportion of studies that showed a significant and positive association with the presence of distress.
   Results Forty-two studies met the target criteria and were included in the review. Breast cancer and treatment-related predictors were more advanced cancer at diagnosis, treatment with chemotherapy, longer primary treatment duration, more recent transition into survivorship, and breast cancer recurrence. Manageable treatment-related symptoms associated with distress included menopausal/vasomotor symptoms, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Sociodemographic characteristics that increased the risk of distress were younger age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, being unmarried, and lower socioeconomic status. Comorbidities, history of mental health problems, and perceived functioning limitations were also associated. Modifiable predictors of distress were lower physical activity, lower social support, and cigarette smoking.
   Conclusion This review established a set of evidence-based predictors that can be used to help identify women at higher risk of experiencing distress following completion of primary breast cancer treatment.

TI  - The relationship between arterial stiffness and the lifestyle habits of female athletes after retiring from competitive sports: a prospective study
T2  - CLINICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between changes in arterial stiffness and the lifestyle habits of endurance athletes after retiring from competition. The subjects were 10 female university endurance athletes. We used formPWV/ABI((R)) as an index for arterial stiffness and measured brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity (baPWV) directly before subjects retired (0Y) and at 2years after retirement (2Y). Furthermore, to investigate the relationship between arterial stiffness and lifestyle habits 2years later, Lifecorder ((R)) PLUS was used to measure physical activity levels, hours of sleep were surveyed using a questionnaire, and a food intake survey was conducted using Excel Eiyoukun Food Frequency Questionnaire Based on Food Group, FFQg Ver. 3.5. We found that baPWV increased significantly from 0Y to 2Y (P<0<bold></bold>05). Furthermore, negative correlations were observed between 2Y baPWV and step count as the physical activity index (r=-0<bold></bold>653, P<0<bold></bold>05) and moderate physical activity (r=-0<bold></bold>663, P<0<bold></bold>05). With regard to lifestyle habits that affected the amount of increase in baPWV from 0Y to 2Y (baPWV), negative correlations were noted between the step count (r=-0<bold></bold>690, P<0<bold></bold>05) and total physical activity (r=-0<bold></bold>657, P<0<bold></bold>05). However, no significant correlations were observed between 2Y baPWV and baPWV with food intake or hours of sleep. The results of this study suggested that physical activity was a lifestyle habit that inhibited an increase in arterial stiffness after retirement from competition and that having a high step count or engaging in physical activity for long periods of time in particular was useful in this regard.

TI  - An Automated Quiet Sleep Detection Approach in Preterm Infants as a Gateway to Assess Brain Maturation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Sleep state development in preterm neonates can provide crucial information regarding functional brain maturation and give insight into neurological well being. However, visual labeling of sleep stages from EEG requires expertise and is very time consuming, prompting the need for an automated procedure. We present a robust method for automated detection of preterm sleep from EEG, over a wide postmenstrual age (PMA = gestational age + postnatal age) range, focusing first on Quiet Sleep (QS) as an initial marker for sleep assessment. Our algorithm, CLuster-based Adaptive Sleep Staging (CLASS), detects QS if it remains relatively more discontinuous than non-QS over PMA. CLASS was optimized on a training set of 34 recordings aged 27-42 weeks PMA, and performance then assessed on a distinct test set of 55 recordings of the same age range. Results were compared to visual QS labeling from two independent raters (with inter-rater agreement Kappa = 0.93), using Sensitivity, Specificity, Detection Factor (DF = proportion of visual QS periods correctly detected by CLASS) and Misclassification Factor (MF = proportion of CLASS-detected QS periods that are misclassified). CLASS performance proved optimal across recordings at 31-38 weeks (median DF = 1.0, median MF 0-0.25, median Sensitivity 0.93-1.0, and median Specificity 0.80-0.91 across this age range), with minimal misclassifications at 35-36 weeks (median MF = 0). To illustrate the potential of CLASS in facilitating clinical research, normal maturational trends over PMA were derived from CLASS-estimated QS periods, visual QS estimates, and nonstate specific periods (containing QS and non-QS) in the EEG recording. CLASS QS trends agreed with those from visual QS, with both showing stronger correlations than nonstate specific trends. This highlights the benefit of automated QS detection for exploring brain maturation.

TI  - Effect of acupuncture on hot flush and menopause symptoms in breast cancer-A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Many breast cancer patients suffer from hot flush and medical menopause as side effects of treatment. Some patients undergo acupuncture, rather than hormone therapy, to relieve these symptoms, but the efficacy of acupuncture is uncertain. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture on hot flush and menopause symptoms in women with breast cancer.
   Methods
   A literature search was performed, following the PRISMA Statement and without language restrictions, of 7 databases from inception through March 2017. All selected studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of needle acupuncture on hot flush and menopause symptoms in patients with breast cancer. The methodological quality of these trials was assessed using Cochrane criteria, and meta-analysis software (RevMan 5.2) was used to analyze the data.
   Results
   We examined 844 breast cancer patients (average age: 58 years-old) from 13 RCTs. The trials had medium-to-high quality, based on the modified Jadad scale. The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture had no significant effect on the frequency and the severity of hot flush (p = 0.34; p = 0.33), but significantly ameliorated menopause symptoms (p = 0.009). None of the studies reported severe adverse events.
   Conclusions
   Acupuncture significantly alleviated menopause symptoms, but had no effect on hot flush. Breast cancer patients concerned about the adverse effects of hormone therapy should consider acupuncture. Further large-scale studies that also measure biomarkers or cytokines may help to elucidate the mechanism by which acupuncture alleviates menopause symptoms in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Understanding polycystic ovary syndrome from the patient perspective: a concept elicitation patient interview study
T2  - HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to explore the need for a new disease-specific patient reported outcome (PRO) measure for use in clinical trials of drugs designed to target the underlying causes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and in the process contribute to our understanding of the symptoms and impacts that define the patient experience with PCOS.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 20 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria who had not menstruated in the previous month. The relative importance of PCOS symptoms and impact concepts to patients was determined by analyzing the frequency of their expression in the interview transcripts. These insights were compared to clinicians' perceptions of PCOS.
   Results: Pain-and discomfort-related symptoms accounted for the highest proportion (27.6%) of the 735 patient expressions, although clinicians did not consider pain to be important to patients with PCOS. The most frequently expressed individual symptoms were cramping (70% of patients; 14.7% of concepts), irregular menstruation (95% of patients; 12.2% of concepts), facial hair growth (75% of patients; 10.6% of concepts), heavy bleeding (70% of patients; 8.8% of concepts), infertility (70% of patients; 5.4% of concepts), and bloating (60% of patients; 5.2% of concepts). Cramping, heavy bleeding, and bloating were not identified by clinicians as being important to patients with PCOS. The impacts most frequently reported by patients with PCOS related to emotional well-being (e.g. anxiety/stress) and coping behaviors (e.g. acne medication, hair removal).
   Conclusions: The only validated PCOS-specific PRO, the PCOSQ, does not capture some key PCOS symptoms and impacts expressed by patients with PCOS, most notably those related to pain and discomfort, bleeding intensity and coping behaviours. Furthermore, some key PCOS symptoms may be under-recognized in the clinic.

TI  - Effect of acupuncture and its influence on cerebral activity in perimenopausal insomniacs: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: Perimenopausal insomnia is one of the core symptoms of the menopausal transition. Acupuncture is considered to exert a positive effect on restoring the normal sleep-wake cycle. However, there is little intuitive evidence besides evaluation using clinical effectiveness scales. We therefore designed this study, aiming to use more intuitive and reliable detection techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after applying acupuncture to provide neuroimaging evidence, as well as to verify the effectiveness with other curative effect indicators.
   Methods/Design: This study is a randomized, assessor-statistician-blinded, positive medicine controlled trial involving 40 participants. A total of 40 eligible patients with perimenopausal insomnia will be randomly assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio as an intervention group using acupuncture and a control group taking estazolam. Participants in the intervention group will receive six acupuncture treatment sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks, for a total of 24 sessions during the study. Meanwhile, the medicine control group will be prescribed estazolam 1-2 mg/day to be taken 30 minutes before sleep for 4 weeks. The primary outcome is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Secondary outcomes are the micro-movement sensitive mattress-type sleep monitoring system, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. All outcomes will be evaluated before and after treatment. The safety of interventions will be assessed at every visit.
   Discussion: The results of this trial, which will be available in 2018, will investigate the impact of acupuncture treating perimenopausal insomnia from assessment of the sleep architecture, hormone level, and emotional-circuit neurological function, and will uncover the effective mechanism of acupuncture regulating the emotional center integrated effect.

TI  - Relationship between Sleep Duration and Risk Factors for Stroke
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. While various risk factors have been identified, sleep has only been considered a risk factor more recently. Various epidemiologic studies have associated stroke with sleep such as sleep duration, and laboratory and clinical studies have proposed various underlying mechanisms. The pathophysiology is multifactorial, especially considering sleep affects many common risk factors for stroke. This review aims to provide an outline of the effect of sleep duration on common stroke risk factors. Appropriate sleep duration, especially in patients who have stroke risk factors, and increasing awareness and screening for sleep quality may contribute to primary prevention of stroke.

TI  - Age-associated gene expression changes in the arcuate nucleus of male rhesus macaques
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) represents a major component of the neuroendocrine reproductive axis and plays an important role in controlling the onset of puberty as well as age-associated reproductive senescence. Although significant gene expression changes have been observed in the ARC during sexual maturation, it is unclear what changes occur during aging, especially in males. Therefore, in the present study, we profiled the expression of reproduction-related genes in the ARC of young and old male rhesus macaques, as well as old males that had received 6 months of hormone supplementation (HS) in the form of daily testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone; we also compared morning vs night ARC gene expression in the old males. Using Affymetrix gene microarrays, we found little evidence for age-associated expression changes for genes associated with the neuroendocrine reproductive axis, whereas using qRT-PCR, we detected a similar age-associated decrease in PGR (progesterone receptor) that we previously observed in postmenopausal females. We also detected a sex-steroiddependent and age-associated decrease in androgen receptor (AR) expression, with highest AR levels being expressed at night (i.e., coinciding with the natural peak in daily testosterone secretion). Finally, unlike previous observations made in females, we did not find a significant age-associated increase in KISS1 (Kisspeptin) or TAC3 (Neurokinin B) expression in the ARC of males, most likely because the attenuation of circulating sex-steroid levels in the males was much less than that in postmenopausal females. Taken together, the data highlight some similarities and differences in ARC gene expression between aged male and female nonhuman primates.

TI  - Estradiol Protects Against Cardiorespiratory Dysfunctions and Oxidative Stress in Intermittent Hypoxia
T2  - SLEEP
AB  - Study Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that estradiol (E-2) protects against cardiorespiratory disorders and oxidative stress induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) in adult female rats.
   Methods: Sprague-Dawley female rats (230-250 g) were ovariectomized and implanted with osmotic pumps delivering vehicle or E-2 (0.5 mg/kg/d). After 14 days of recovery, the rats were exposed to CIH (21%-10% O-2 : 8 h/d, 10 cycles per hour) or room air (RA). After 7 days of CIH or RA exposure, we measured arterial pressures (tail cuff), metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry), minute ventilation, the frequency of sighs and apneas at rest, and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia (whole body plethysmography). We collected the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and adrenal glands to measure the activity of NADPH and xanthine oxidase (pro-oxidant enzymes), glutathione peroxidase, and the mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide dismutase (antioxidant enzymes) and measured lipid peroxidation and advanced oxidation protein products (markers of oxidative stress).
   Results: CIH increased arterial pressure, the frequency of apnea at rest, and the hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses and reduced metabolic rate. CIH also increased oxidant enzyme activities and decreased antioxidant activity in the cortex. E-2 treatment reduced body weight and prevented the effects of CIH.
   Conclusions: E-2 prevents cardiorespiratory disorders and oxidative stress induced by CIH. These observations may help to better understand the underlying mechanisms linking menopause and occurrence of sleep apnea in women and highlight a potential advantage of hormone therapy.

TI  - Validity, cut-points, and minimally important differences for two hot flash-related daily interference scales
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: To conduct psychometric analyses to condense the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) into a shorter form termed the Hot Flash Interference (HFI) scale; evaluate cut-points for both scales; and establish minimally important differences (MIDs) for both scales.
   Methods: We analyzed baseline and postrandomization patient-reported data pooled across three randomized trials aimed at reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in 899 midlife women. Trials were conducted across five MsFLASH clinical sites between July 2009 and October 2012. We eliminated HFRDIS items based on experts' content validity ratings and confirmatory factor analysis, and evaluated cut-points and established MIDs by mapping HFRDIS and HFI to other measures.
   Results: The three-item HFI (interference with sleep, mood, and concentration) demonstrated strong internal consistency (alphas of 0.830 and 0.856), showed good fit to the unidimensional "hot flash interference factor,'' and strong convergent validity with HFRDIS scores, diary VMS, and menopausal quality of life. For both scales, cut-points of mild (0-3.9), moderate (4-6.9), and severe (7-10) interference were associated with increasing diary VMS ratings, sleep, and anxiety. The average MID was 1.66 for the HFRDIS and 2.34 for the HFI.
   Conclusions: The HFI is a brief assessment of VMS interference and will be useful in busy clinics to standardize VMS assessment or in research studies where response burden may be an issue. The scale cut-points and MIDs should prove useful in targeting those most in need of treatment, monitoring treatment response, and interpreting existing and future research findings.

TI  - Resveratrol supplementation reduces pain experience by postmenopausal women
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
AB  - Objective: Pain is a common complaint among postmenopausal women. It has been postulated that vascular dysfunction caused by estrogen decline at menopause plays a key role in the initiation and progression of degradative joint disease, namely age-related osteoarthritis. We evaluated whether supplementation with resveratrol, a phytoestrogen, could improve aspects of well-being such as chronic pain that is commonly experienced by postmenopausal women.
   Methods: A 14-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention with trans-resveratrol (75 mg, twice daily) was conducted in 80 healthy postmenopausal women. Aspects of well-being, including pain, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, mood states, and quality of life were assessed by Short form-36 at baseline and at the end of treatment. Rating scales were averaged to provide a composite score representing overall well-being. Cerebral vasodilator responsiveness to hypercapnia was also assessed as a surrogate marker for cerebrovascular function.
   Results: Compared with placebo treatment, there was a significant reduction in pain and an improvement in total well-being after resveratrol supplementation. Both benefits, including measures of quality of life, correlated with improvements in cerebrovascular function.
   Conclusions: Our preliminary findings indicate potential for resveratrol treatment to reduce chronic pain in age-related osteoarthritis. Resveratrol consumption may also boost perceptions of well-being in postmenopausal women. Further investigation to elucidate underlying mechanisms is warranted.

TI  - Effect of Thyroid-Related Symptoms on Long-Term Quality of Life in Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma: A Population-Based Study in Sweden
T2  - THYROID
AB  - Background: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has a good prognosis but a remaining risk of recurrence, and life-long follow-up as well as medication with levothyroxine may be necessary. The aim of this study was to clarify how thyroid-related symptoms affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 14-17 years after diagnosis in Swedish DTC patients.
   Methods: From the all-encompassing population-based Swedish Cancer Registry, 353 patients diagnosed with DTC during 1995-1998 were identified and invited to answer a study-specific questionnaire and the HRQoL questionnaire SF-36 14-17 years after their diagnosis. Subgroups were studied according to thyroid-related symptoms, both symptoms correlated to thyroid disease or levothyroxine treatment and side effects from surgery and radioiodine treatment.
   Results: Of the patients with DTC, 279 (79%) answered the questionnaires. In all, only 19 (7%) reported a recurrence. Patients with one single symptom (e.g., fatigue, sleeping disorders, irritability, lower stress resistance, muscle weakness, bodily restlessness, sweating, palpitations, or flushes) had significantly lower HRQoL measured with the SF-36 compared to those without that specific symptom (p < 0.001). Furthermore, those 238 patients with at least one symptom, regardless of which one, had significantly lower HRQoL in all eight SF-36 domains compared to patients that no thyroid symptom (n = 34; p < 0.001). In seven patients, the questionnaires were not complete in terms of the thyroid-related questions. The association between thyroid symptoms and lower HRQoL remained after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, education, and menopause.
   Conclusions: DTC patients reporting thyroid symptoms scored lower in HRQoL compared to those with no symptoms > 14 years after diagnosis.
