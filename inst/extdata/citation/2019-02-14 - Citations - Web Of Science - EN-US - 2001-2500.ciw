AB BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking is associated with disturbed cardiorespiratory control in the infant. Despite lacking knowledge of whether the harmful effects of smoking are caused by combustion products in tobacco smoke or by nicotine, it has been argued that nicotine-replacement therapy during pregnancy is safer than smoking.
   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate if the disturbances in cardiorespiratory control associated with maternal smoking are also seen in infants prenatally exposed to snuff. We hypothesized that prenatal nicotine exposure (via moist snuff) causes disturbances in autonomic control and thereby increases the risk of apnea in the newborn.
   METHODS: In a nationwide Swedish cohort study, we studied associations between maternal tobacco use during pregnancy and neonatal apnea. Of 609 551 live-born singleton infants, 7599 were born to snuff-using mothers, 41 391 and 16 928 were born to light (1-9 cigarettes per day) and heavy (>= 10 cigarettes per day) smokers, respectively. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios, using 95% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS: Compared with infants of nontobacco users, infants with prenatal exposure to snuff were at an increased risk of apnea even after adjustment for differences in gestational age (odds ratio: 1.96 [ 95% confidence interval: [1.30-2.96]) Smoking was associated with increased risk of apnea before, but not after, adjusting for gestational age.
   CONCLUSIONS: Snuff use during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of neonatal apnea than smoking. Maternal use of snuff or nicotine-replacement therapy cannot be regarded as an alternative to smoking during pregnancy. Pediatrics 2011; 128: 503-509

AB Colic, or excessive infant crying, occurs during the first 3 months in approximately 15 to 20% of infants and is the most common concern for which parents seek medical advice during an infant's first year. Various physiological and environmental causes have been investigated. Some researchers have proposed multifactorial causes while others have argued that it is simply the extreme end of the normal crying continuum. As the etiology of colic is not clear, definitions of colic have relied on behavioral descriptions, and the relative merits of specific behaviors in affording an accurate definition are debated. This lack of clarity has compounded difficulties in identifying effective interventions for colic. One point of agreement is that colic is extremely distressing for parents. Some have argued that the disruption to the infant-parent relationship can have long-term implications for development while others have argued that only if the crying persists beyond 3 months is there a risk of long-term implications. It is concluded that due to the incidence of colic and the immediate impact it has on family functioning, more research is required to further our understanding of colic. In addition, the identification of effective coping strategies and consoling methods to assist parents through this stressful period is required.

AB To evaluate the efficacy of melatonin implants on increasing the production of lambs, a meta-analysis was performed based on the results of 139 experiments carried out in Spain and published in 56 scientific publications or conference proceedings. To assess the effects on fertility, the relative risk (RR) was calculated and, in the case of prolificacy and fecundity, the analysis was based on raw mean difference (D) and the standardized difference between means (d) and their corresponding confidence intervals. In addition, the experiments were stratified by the productive aptitude of the flocks, breed, time of year, and age. For fertility, the mean RR was 1.29, which indicated that the treatment with melatonin increased significantly (by 29%) the probability of pregnancy. For prolificacy, overall D was 0.08 (d = 0.9089); i.e., the groups treated with melatonin increased their litter size by 0.08 lambs/lambing relative to the control groups. Ultimately, treatment with melatonin increased fecundity significantly (0.25 extra lambs/ewe treated) (d = 6.3188), and this trend was evident in all of the stratified datasets. In all cases, there was significant (p < 0.001) heterogeneity and bias. In conclusion, in Spain, melatonin implants had a significant effect on the probability that a ewe became pregnant, increased the number of lambs born per lambing, which ultimately increased the number of lambs born per treated ewe. In addition to confirm the results of previous descriptive reviews in the scientific literature, the meta-analysis made use of a statistical tool that synthesizes and estimates more precisely the effect of this hormone on sheep reproduction.

AB We employed accepted, validated symptom-based screening measures to discern attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to adverse pregnancy outcomes, taking into account potential maternal confounders. Commonly employed OSA screening measures (Berlin and Epworth scales) were performed in the second and third trimesters; maternal and neonatal outcome data were thereafter obtained. The relationship between OSA and outcomes of interest were explored in stratified and multivariate models controlling for potential confounders. The overall prevalence of OSA was 25.4%. Given a nonlinear increase by body mass index (BMI) strata (8.9%, 46%; p<0.0001), stratified multivariate analysis was subsequently performed. Among nonobese (BMI <30) gravidae, frequency of preeclampsia was significantly higher among women with OSA (adjusted odds ratio = 6.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.04, 38.51; p = 0.035). Among the obese (BMI >= 30) gravidae, infant birth weight ratio (or birth weight by gestational age) was higher with OSA + screening than OSA - (1.099 versus 1.035; p = 0.04), and this association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (p = 0.05). OSA prevalence increases significantly among obese gravidae, raising concerns for the overall validity of commonly employed screening measures in pregnancy. Nevertheless, OSA status continues to exert an independent influence, as obese and nonobese gravidae are at increased risk for a limited number of adverse perinatal outcomes in multivariate models.

AB Clock genes drive circadian rhythms in a range of physiological processes both centrally and in peripheral tissues such as the liver. The aims of this study were to determine whether the two functionally-distinct zones of the rat placenta (junctional and labyrinth) differentially express clock genes and, if so, whether these exhibit circadian patterns. Rats were sampled from d 21 of pregnancy (term = d 23) and from diestrus I of the estrous cycle. Adult liver (all animals), fetal liver, and placental zones (pregnant animals) were collected at 0800, 1400, 2000, and 0200 h. Both zones of the rat placenta expressed all seven canonical clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, and Cry2), but there were marked zonal differences and, unlike in maternal liver, circadian variation in placenta was limited. Similarly, placental expression of Vegf varied with zone but not time of day. Pregnancy also led to marked changes in hepatic clock gene expression, with peak levels of Per1, Cry1, and Cry2 all reduced, Per3 increased, and circadian variation in Clock expression lost. All clock genes were expressed in fetal liver, but there was less circadian variation than in maternal liver. Similarly, fetal corticosterone levels remained stable across the day, whereas maternal corticosterone showed clear circadian variation. In conclusion, our data show that the rat placenta expresses all canonical clock genes in a highly zone-specific manner but with relatively little circadian variation. Moreover, pregnancy alters the expression and circadian variation of clock genes in maternal liver, possibly contributing to maternal physiological adaptations. (Endocrinology 152: 3552-3560, 2011)

AB The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) utilized by pregnant women influence fetal neurobehavioral development. In this observational study we investigated developmental milestones of fetal behavior during the pregnancy of women with psychiatric disorders who took SSRIs throughout gestation (medicated group; n = 96) or who had discontinued medication early in gestation or before conception (unmedicated group; n = 37). Healthy unexposed fetuses of women without mental disorders comprised the control group (n = 130). Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior were made three times in pregnancy (T1-T3). Effects of SSRIs were studied over a wide range of dosages (low, standard, or high) and for different drug types. Fetuses exposed to standard or high SSRI dosages compared with control, unmedicated, or low-medicated fetuses showed significantly increased motor activity at the beginning (T1) and end of the second trimester (T2). They particularly exhibited disrupted emergence of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM; quiet) sleep during the third trimester, characterized by continual bodily activity and, thus, poor inhibitory motor control during this sleep state near term (T3). The SSRI effects on the fetus were dose related, but independent of SSRI type. The results demonstrate changes in fetal neurobehavioral development associated with standard and high SSRI dosages that are observable throughout gestation. A first-choice SSRI type was not apparent. Bodily activity at high rate during non-REM sleep in SSRI-exposed fetuses is an abnormal phenomenon, but its significance for postnatal development is unclear.

AB Background: During pregnancy, women are at particular risk for sleep deprivation and snoring because of the physiologic and hormonal changes of pregnancy. There is limited evidence for the association between sleep patterns in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. We examined the association of sleep duration and snoring in late pregnancy with the risk of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction.
   Methods: We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort "Rhea" study in Crete, Greece 2007-2009. The analysis included 1091 women with singleton pregnancies, providing complete data on sleeping habits at the third trimester of gestation and birth outcomes. Fetal growth restriction was based on a customized model, and multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to adjust for confounders.
   Results: Women with severe snoring were at high risk for low birth weight (relative risk = 2.6 [95% confidence interval = 1.2-5.4]), and fetal-growth-restricted neonates (2.0 [1.0-3.9]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI). Women with sleep deprivation (<= 5 hours sleep) were at high risk for preterm births (1.7 [1.1-2.8]), with the highest risk observed for medically indicated preterm births (2.4 [1.0-6.4]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, parity, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy BMI.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that women with severe snoring in late pregnancy have a higher risk for fetal-growth-restricted neonates; and women with sleep deprivation have a higher risk for preterm births. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. (Epidemiology 2011; 22: 738-744)

AB Background: Malaria remains a major public health problem in sub Saharan Africa and the extent of utilisation of malaria preventive measures may impact on the burden of malaria in pregnancy. This study sought to determine the association between malaria preventive measures utilized during pregnancy and the birth outcomes of birth weight and preterm delivery.
   Methods: This cross sectional survey involved 800 mothers who delivered at the University College Hospital, and Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Ibadan. Data obtained included obstetric information, gestational age, birth weight and self reported use of malaria prevention strategies in index pregnancy.
   Results: Most (95.6%) mothers used one or more malaria control measures. The most commonly used vector control measures were window net (84.0%), insecticide spray (71.5%) and insecticide treated bed nets (20.1%), while chemoprophylactic agents were pyrimethamine (23.5%), Intermittent Preventive Treatments with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTsp) (18.5%) and intermittent chloroquine (9.5%) and 21.7% used herbal medications. The mean +/- SD birthweight and gestational age of the babies were 3.02 kg +/- 0.56 and 37.9 weeks +/- 2.5 respectively. Preterm delivery rate was 19.4% and 9% had low birth weight. Comparing babies whose mothers had IPTsp with those who did not, mean birth weight was 3.13 kg +/- 0.52 versus 3.0 kg +/- 0.56 (p = 0.016) and mean gestational age was 38.5 weeks +/- 2.1 versus 37.8 weeks +/- 2.5 (p = 0.002). The non-use of IPTsp was associated with increased risk of having low birth weight babies (AOR: 2.27, 95% CI: 0.98; 5.28) and preterm birth (AOR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.08, 3.44). The non use of herbal preparations (AOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.85) was associated with reduced risk of preterm birth. The mean +/- SD birth weight and gestational ages of babies born to mothers who slept under ITNs were not significantly different from those who did not (p = 0.07 and 0.09 respectively).
   Conclusions: There is a need for improved utilisation of IPTsp as well as discouraging the use of herbal medications in pregnancy in order to reduce pregnancy outcome measures of low birth weight and preterm deliveries in this environment.

TI Preventing malaria in pregnancy through community-directed
   interventions: evidence from Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ONCHOCERCIASIS CONTROL; HEALTH WORKERS; BURDEN;
   UGANDA; DELIVERY; SYSTEM; AREAS
AB Background: Despite massive anti-malaria campaigns across the subcontinent, effective access to intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) among pregnant women remain low in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The slow uptake of malaria prevention products appears to reflect lack of knowledge and resistance to behavioural change, as well as poor access to resources, and limited support of programmes by local communities and authorities.
   Methods: A recent community-based programme in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, is analysed to determine the degree to which community-directed interventions can improve access to malaria prevention in pregnancy. Six local government areas in Southern Nigeria were selected for a malaria in pregnancy prevention intervention. Three of these local government areas were selected for a complementary community-directed intervention (CDI) programme. Under the CDI programme, volunteer community-directed distributors (CDDs) were appointed by each village and kindred in the treatment areas and trained to deliver ITNs and IPTp drugs as well as basic counseling services to pregnant women.
   Findings: Relative to women in the control area, an additional 7.4 percent of women slept under a net during pregnancy in the treatment areas (95% CI [0.035, 0.115], p-value < 0.01), and an additional 8.5 percent of women slept under an ITN after delivery and prior to the interview (95% CI [0.045, 0.122], p-value < 0.001). The effects of the CDI programme were largest for IPTp adherence, increasing the fraction of pregnant women taking at least two SP doses during pregnancy by 35.3 percentage points [95% CI: 0.280, 0.425], p-value < 0.001) relative to the control group. No effects on antenatal care attendance were found.
   Conclusion: The presented results suggest that the inclusion of community-based programmes can substantially increase effective access to malaria prevention, and also increase access to formal health care access in general, and antenatal care attendance in particular in combination with supply side interventions. Given the relatively modest financial commitments they require, community-directed programmes appear to be a cost-effective way to improve malaria prevention; the participatory approach underlying CDI programmes also promises to strengthen ties between the formal health sector and local communities.

AB Background: Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography, we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies.
   Methods: In this single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward. Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as a respiratory disturbance index >= 5) in the gestational hypertension and healthy groups.
   Results: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001).
   Interpretation: Women with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB than to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be determined.

TI Prevalence and Factors Associated with Neonatal Occipital Alopecia: A
   Retrospective Study
SO ANNALS OF DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Alopecia; Neonate; Pregnancy-related factor; Physiological condition
ID AREATA; HAIR
AB Background: For many years, the etiology of neonatal occipital alopecia (NOA) has been thought to be friction. It is recently clear that NOA is related to the physiological hair shedding. Objective: We sought to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with NOA. Methods: Medical records of 240 postpartum patients who had been delivered between January 2006 and June 2007 at our institution were reviewed. Phone interviews with 193 respondents were conducted to investigate the actual conditions of NOA. Results: NOA was present in 39 babies (20.2%). Univariate analysis showed that NOA was not associated with the baby's sleeping position, but was significantly associated with maternal parturition age, the delivery method, and the gestational age (p < 0.05). In multiple logistic regression analysis, the risk of NOA was higher in the group younger than 35 years at parturition (OR, 3.86; 95% Cl, 1.08 similar to 13.82), in the group not undergoing a Caesarean-section delivery (2.47; 1.09 similar to 5.60), and in the group delivered after 37 weeks of gestational age (3.36; 1.22 similar to 9.26). Conclusion: The pregnancy-related factors, such as non-elderly gravida, non-Caesarean-section delivery, and enough gestational age, were associated with NOA. These findings support the recent theory that NOA is not an acquired alopecia, but a physiological condition, resulting from synchronized shedding of telogen hairs initiated in utero.

AB Background: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained. Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values <= .05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values <= .05). Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms. Depression and Anxiety 28:676-685, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB In this study, the relationship between sleep quality and type and duration of labour has been evaluated. A total of 88 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire three times during their last 3 weeks of pregnancy at their prenatal visits and once postpartum. A mean score of >5 was considered as poor-quality sleep. Duration of labour, type of delivery and weight of the newborn at delivery was considered. Of the study population, 56.2% were categorised as the good-quality sleep group and 43.8% as the poor-quality sleep group. The reported sleeping time per day was 8.47 +/- 1.86 hours for the good-quality sleep group and 6.45 +/- 2.07 hours for the poor-quality sleep group. The poor-quality sleep women were 20% more likely to undergo caesarean section and had a longer labour duration. Gestational age at delivery and mean gravidity was respectively 38.53 +/- 1.17 weeks and 1.91 +/- 1.03 in the good-quality sleep group and 38.36 +/- 1.59 weeks and 1.86 +/- 1.07 in the poor-quality sleep group. Thus, it was found that women with sleep problems experience longer labour duration and are more likely to undergo a caesarean section.

AB Maternal treatment with synthetic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DEX) significantly reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality, but its effects on the fetal brain remain unclear. In this study we evaluated the effects of DEX on EEG activity in preterm fetal sheep. Ewes at 103 days gestation received two intramuscular injections of DEX (12 mg, n = 8) or saline vehicle (n = 7) 24 h apart. Fetal EEG activity was recorded from 6 h before until 120 h after the first injection (DEX-1). DEX-1 was associated with a marked transient rise in total EEG power, maximal at 12 h (P < 0.001), with a relative increase in delta and reduced theta, alpha and beta activity, resolving by 24 h. Continuous EEG records showed a shift to larger but less frequent transient waveforms (P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, evolving epileptiform activity, consistent with electrographic and clinical seizures, developed from 178 +/- 44 min after DEX-1. Similar but smaller changes were seen after the second injection. Following the injections, total power returned to control values, but the proportion of alpha activity progressively increased vs. controls (P < 0.001), with reduced interburst interval duration and number (P < 0.001). No histological neural injury or microglial activation was seen. In summary, exposure to maternal dexamethasone was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity on fetal cortical EEG recordings, followed by sustained changes consistent with maturation of fetal sleep architecture. We postulate that these effects may contribute to improved neonatal outcomes.

AB We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of substance P (SP) in the brainstems of 56 subjects aged from 17 gestational weeks to 10 post natal months, who died of unknown (sudden unexplained fetal deaths and SIDS) and known causes (controls). The goals of this study were: (i) to obtain basic information about the expression of SP during the first phases of human nervous system development; (ii) to evaluate whether there are alterations of this neuromodulator in victims of sudden death; and (iii) to verify any correlation with maternal cigarette smoking. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated SP immunoreactivity in the caudal trigeminal nucleus area, with a progressive increase in the density of SP-positive fibers of the corresponding tract during normal development from fetal life to the first post natal months. Delineation of the structure of the human trigeminal nucleus, little investigated so far, provided essential data on its morphologic and functional development. Instead, a negative or low SP expression was detectable in the fibers of this tract in a wide subset of SIDS victims and, conversely, a high SP-expression in a wide subset of sudden fetal deaths. We postulate, on the basis of these results, that SP has a functional importance in the early phases of central nervous system development and in the regulation of autonomic functions. In addition, the observation of a significant correlation between sudden unexplained death, altered SP staining and maternal smoking leads us to suggest a close relation between the absorption of cigarette smoke in utero and a decreased functional activity of the trigeminal nucleus, that can trigger sudden death of the fetus during pregnancy or of the infant in the first months of life.

AB Late preterm infants, born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation, have significantly higher morbidity than neonates born at full term, which may be partly related to reduced sensitivity of the arterial baroreflex. The present study assessed baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in near-term fetal sheep at 123 +/- 1 days gestation. At this age, although fetuses are not fully mature in some respects (term is 147 days), sleep-state cycling is established [between high-voltage, low-frequency (HV) and low-voltage, high-frequency (LV) sleep], and neural myelination is similar to the term human infant. Fetal sheep were instrumented to record blood pressure (BP), HR (n = 15) and RSNA (n = 5). Blood pressure was manipulated using vasoactive drugs, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. In both HV and LV sleep, phenylephrine was associated with increased arterial BP and decreased HR. In HV sleep, phenylephrine was associated with a fall in RSNA, from 124 +/- 14 to 58 +/- 11% (P < 0.05), but no significant change in RSNA in LV sleep. In contrast, the fall in BP after sodium nitroprusside was associated with a significant increase in HR during LV but not HV sleep, and there was no significant effect of hypotension on RSNA. These data demonstrate that in near-term fetal sheep baroreflex activity is only partly active and is highly modulated by sleep state. Critically, there was no RSNA response to marked hypotension; this finding has implications for the ability of the late preterm fetus to adapt to low BP.

AB The influence of circadian timekeeping systems on behavior and physiology can change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in extra-SCN oscillators and in local rhythms might coincide with the emergence of new patterns of temporal organization among various behavioral and physiological rhythms. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS and PER2 in 3 brain regions of pregnant and diestrous rats. We found that, in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BnST-ov), the peak of the PER2 rhythm occurred approximately 12 hours out of phase in pregnant and diestrous females. In contrast, the phase of the rhythm in FOS was the same, but pregnant rats expressed more FOS in the BnST-ov than diestrous ones. In the central amygdala (CEA) of diestrous females, PER2 expression was arrhythmic, but Fos expression was elevated at night. No rhythms were seen in this region of pregnant females, nor were any rhythms seen in the basolateral amygdala of either group. Overall, the patterns in the BnST-ov and the CEA were consistent with the hypothesis that differential changes in daily rhythms within some extra-SCN brain regions might mediate the changes in the temporal organization of several behavioral and endocrine functions that occur during the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state.

AB Genetic factors influence adverse pregnancy outcome in both humans and animal models. Animal research reveals that both the maternal and fetal genetic profiles are important for determining the risk of physical birth defects and prenatal mortality. Using a reciprocal-cross breeding design, we investigated whether the mother's genes may be more important than fetal genes in determining risk for ethanol teratogenesis. Examination of possible synergistic genetic effects on ethanol teratogenesis was made possible by using two mouse strains known to be susceptible to specific malformations. Inbred A/J (A) and C5713L/6J (B6) mice were mated to produce four fetal genotype groups: the true-bred A.A and B6.B6 genotypes and the genetically identical A.B6 and B6.A genotypes (the F(1) genotype). Dams were administered either 5.8 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed by laparotomy on gestation day 18, weighed, and assessed for digit, vertebral, and kidney malformations. Digit malformations in the genetically identical F(1) ethanol-exposed litters showed a pattern consistent with a maternal genetic effect (A.B6 [2%] and B6.A [30%]). In contrast, vertebral malformations were similar in all ethanol-exposed litters (A.A 26%], A.B6 [18%], B6.A [22%], and B6.B6 [33%]). The percentage of malformations did not differ between male and female fetuses, indicating sex-linked factors are not responsible for the maternal effect. Ethanol exposure decreased litter weights but did not affect litter mortality compared with maltose-exposed controls. This study supports the idea that genes influence malformation risk following in utero alcohol exposure. Specifically, maternal genes influence risk more than fetal genes for some teratogenic outcomes. No evidence supported synergistic genetic effects on ethanol teratogenesis. This research supports the conclusion that uterine environment contributes to determining risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; SALIVARY CORTISOL; TESTS;
   HYPERCORTISOLISM; SPECIFICITY; PREGNANCY; DISEASE
AB Purpose of review
   Cushing's syndrome results from prolonged and inappropriately high exposure of tissues to glucocorticoids. Biochemical tests are always needed to confirm the clinical suspicion: these include measurement of excess total endogenous cortisol secretion assessed by 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC), loss of the normal feedback of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis assessed by suppressibility after dexamethasone testing, and disturbance of the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion assessed by midnight serum or salivary cortisol. This review focuses on recent data emerging on the value of UFC as a screening test for Cushing's syndrome.
   Recent findings
   Considerable evidence has emerged regarding the utility of UFC in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome because of its long-term use in clinical practice. Despite the fact that UFC assesses the active (free) component of cortisol, the methodological difficulties in 24-h urine collection and in assay precision have rendered this screening technique increasingly unpopular. Furthermore, the increased prevalence of mild, preclinical or cyclic Cushing's syndrome along with the fact that cortisol is not uniformly secreted during the day do not support its use as a screening test, although strikingly high levels can be useful.
   Summary
   Since the sensitivity and specificity of UFC are less than ideal when compared with other diagnostic modalities, we suggest the use of other more novel tests as first-step diagnostic tests to screen for hypercortisolaemia.

AB Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by excellent response to treatment, if diagnosed correctly. Lifestyle advice is an integral part of the treatment of JME; it should include recommendations on avoidance of common triggers such as sleep deprivation and alcohol excess and emphasis on the importance of compliance with medication. The drug of first choice in the treatment of JME is sodium valproate, which has a response rate of up to 80%. Valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age because of significantly increased risks of fetal malformations and neurodevelopmental delay. Levetiracetam or lamotrigine are alternative first-line options if valproate is contraindicated. With limited data from trials to support either of these drugs, the choice should take into account comorbidity factors and patient priorities. Because of its low side effect profile, excellent tolerability, and lack of interactions with other drugs, levetiracetam is our preferred alternative first-line agent. Lamotrigine is another first-line option but may exacerbate myoclonus. The failure of valproate or failure of two first-line antiepileptic drugs suggests that combination therapy is indicated. Drug interactions and the patient's gender, age, and comorbidities need to be considered. Levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and valproate are suitable adjuncts, with a synergistic effect reported from the combination of valproate and lamotrigine. Clonazepam is a useful adjunct for myoclonus and can be used in combination with lamotrigine to avoid lamotrigine's myoclonic effects. In women of childbearing potential, valproate should be considered if levetiracetam and lamotrigine have failed to control seizures at this stage. Topiramate is a cost-effective alternative monotherapy, but because of its poor tolerability, we recommend it as add-on treatment only. Zonisamide should remain a second-line adjunct in the treatment of JME, owing to the lack of supportive data. Phenobarbital is the most cost-effective drug and can be used to control the seizures of JME when antiepileptic drugs are limited or too costly. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin can exacerbate absences and myoclonus and are therefore contraindicated, although they can improve control of tonic-clonic seizures when these are refractory to other medication. Gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are contraindicated and can worsen seizures. (Tiagabine and vigabatrin have been reported to induce absence status epilepticus.) Surgical alternatives in refractory cases are rarely contemplated but may include vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy. Deep brain stimulation is an experimental technique that may prove useful in managing refractory cases of JME.

ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; PULSE OXIMETRY; SLEEP;

AB Aim: There is uncertainty about the best method of withdrawing supplemental oxygen in babies with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD). Some authors advocate withdrawal of oxygen in the day, but continuing supplementation during sleep, based on early work suggesting that oxygen saturations are lower during sleep, which did not accord with our clinical impression. We re-examined the hypothesis that babies have lower saturations while asleep.
   Methods: We studied infants with CNLD during the day, while awake and asleep. We recorded video with simultaneous real-time capture of oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), heart rate and plethysmographic waveform from pulse oximetry. Behavioural state was scored using observation and video and classified as awake (feeding, active or quiet) or sleep.
   Results: Thirteen infants had analysable data, although one had strikingly lower SpO(2) values while awake and was excluded from analysis. The infants had a median gestation of 26 weeks and were studied at a median (range) postmenstrual age of 66 (37-130) weeks, for 229 (89-330) min. Mean SpO(2) was 97.6% during sleep and 97.0% awake (p = 0.011).
   Conclusion: Babies with CNLD have lower oxygen saturation while awake. There is no physiological justification for increasing oxygen during sleep, or withdrawing selectively during the daytime, although larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.

AB Lead (Pb) exposure alters the temporal organization of several physiological and behavioural processes in which the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus plays a fundamental role. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic early Pb exposure (CePbe) on the morphology, cellular density and relative optical density (OD) in the cells of the SCN of male rats. Female Wistar rats were exposed during gestation and lactation to a Pb solution containing 320 ppm of Pb acetate through drinking water. After weaning, the pups were maintained with the same drinking water until sacrificed at 90 days of age. Pb levels in the blood, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased in the experimental group. Chronic early Pb exposure induced a significant increase in the minor and major axes and somatic area of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and vasopressin (VP)-immunoreactive neurons. The density of VIP-, VP- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells showed a significant decrease in the experimental group. OD analysis showed a significant increase in VIP neurons of the experimental group. The results showed that CePbe induced alterations in the cells of the SCN, as evidenced by modifications in soma morphology, cellular density and OD in circadian pacemaker cells. These findings provide a morphological and cellular basis for deficits in circadian rhythms documented in Pb-exposed animals.

AB Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of vigilance and regulation of motor activity but their hyperactivity may contribute to anxiety disorders. Using a rat model, we tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE. Male rat pups received 2.625 g/kg of alcohol (AE group) intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Control pups were shamintubated (S group). On PD12-14, they received daily injections of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V) during the lights-off period. On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test. On PD17, their motor activity was monitored in a novel environment. The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest HR latency were higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE-V than in S-V rats (p = 0.0009-0.03). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE-SB and either S-SB or S-V rats. Motor activity in AE-V rats was significantly higher than in S-V (p = 0.003), S-SB (p = 0.007) or AE-SB (p = 0.02) rats, with no difference between S-SB and AE-SB group. Our findings suggest that excessive activity of ORX neurons contributes to motor hyperactivity and impaired HR acquisition following perinatal AE and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors.

   intended and alternative usage
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

   TIMOR; COMMUNITY; INTERVENTIONS; ETHIOPIA; INDIA
AB Background: The Timor-Leste Ministry of Health has recently finalized the National Malaria Control Strategy for 2010-2020. A key component of this roadmap is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in support of achieving the primary goal of reducing both morbidity and mortality from malaria by 30% in the first three years, followed by a further reduction of 20% by end of the programme cycle in 2020 [ 1]. The strategic plan calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education and communication (IEC) programme; however, there is limited prior research into household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted, effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials.
   Methods: Nine separate focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Dili, Manatuto, and Covalima districts, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, in July 2010. These focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households with at least one net. Comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source analysis software.
   Results: The primary determinants of net usage were a widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a limited number of nets within households. Both nuisance biting and disease prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while seasonality was not a significant factor. Long-term net durability and ease of hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. Very frequent washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. Finally, extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household.
   Conclusions: Emphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on malaria control efforts in Timor-Leste, as the country's programmes make progress towards universal net coverage.

AB We have designed an automated method for analyzing electrocortical (ECoG) activity in the near-term ovine fetus to process and quantitatively classify large amounts of data rapidly and objectively. Seven chronically catheterized fetal sheep were studied for 8 h each at similar to 0.9 of gestation with continuous recording of ECoG activity using a computerized data acquisition system. Multiple ECoG amplitude and frequency parameters were scored from which we established animal specific parameter cut-off values as well as population based duration cut-off values to distinguish low-voltage/high frequency (LV/HF) and high-voltage/low frequency (HV/LF) state epochs, and indeterminate voltage/frequency (IV/F) and transition period activities. We have shown that the incidence of the predominant LV/HF and HV/LF activity states at 45% and 36% of the time, respectively, is comparable to that previously reported using semi-quantitative techniques with visual analysis. However, the duration of these state epochs is considerably shorter due to the detection of brief periods of IV/F activity which would be difficult to capture using visual analysis. Importantly, our findings in the healthy ovine fetus near-term using this automated ECoG scoring methodology now provide a framework from which to study maturational events in younger animals, and under adverse pregnancy conditions.

TI Impact of Health Facility-Based Insecticide Treated Bednet Distribution
   in Malawi: Progress and Challenges towards Achieving Universal Coverage
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background: High levels of insecticide treated bednet (ITN) use reduce malaria burden in countries with intense transmission such as Malawi. Since 2007 Malawi has implemented free health facility-based ITN distribution for pregnant women and children <5 years old (under-5s). We evaluated the progress of this targeted approach toward achieving universal ITN coverage.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional household survey in eight districts in April 2009. We assessed household ITN possession, ITN use by all household members, and P. falciparum asexual parasitemia and anemia (hemoglobin <11 grams/deciliter) in under-5s.
   Results: We surveyed 7,407 households containing 29,806 persons. Fifty-nine percent of all households (95% confidence interval [ 95% CI]: 56-62), 67% (95% CI: 64-70) of eligible households (i.e., households with pregnant women or under-5s), and 40% (95% CI: 36-45) of ineligible households owned an ITN. In households with at least one ITN, 76% (95% CI: 74-78) of all household members, 88% (95% CI: 87-90) of under-5s and 90% (95% CI: 85-94) of pregnant women used an ITN the previous night. Of 6,677 ITNs, 92% (95% CI: 90-94) were used the previous night with a mean of 2.4 persons sleeping under each ITN. In multivariable models adjusting for district, socioeconomic status and indoor residual spraying use, ITN use by under-5s was associated with a significant reduction in asexual parasitemia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.79; 95% CI: 0.640.98; p-value 0.03) and anemia (aOR 0.79; 95% CI 0.62-0.99; p-value 0.04). Of potential targeted and non-targeted mass distribution strategies, a campaign distributing 1 ITN per household might increase coverage to 2.1 household members per ITN, and thus achieve near universal coverage often defined as 2 household members per ITN.
   Conclusions: Malawi has substantially increased ITN coverage using health facility-based distribution targeting pregnant women and under-5s, but needs to supplement these activities with non-targeted mass distribution campaigns to achieve universal coverage and maximum public health impact.

TI Monitoring Fetal Electrocortical Activity during Labour for Predicting

AB Background: Severe fetal acidemia during labour with arterial pH below 7.00 is associated with increased risk of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, the mainstay of intrapartum surveillance, has poor specificity for detecting fetal acidemia. We studied brain electrical activity measured with electrocorticogram (ECOG) in the near term ovine fetus subjected to repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCO) inducing FHR decelerations, as might be seen in human labour, to delineate the time-course for ECOG changes with worsening acidemia and thereby assess the potential clinical utility of fetal ECOG.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Ten chronically catheterized fetal sheep were studied through a series of mild, moderate and severe UCO until the arterial pH was below 7.00. At a pH of 7.24 +/- 0.04, 52 +/- 13 min prior to the pH dropping <7.00, spectral edge frequency (SEF) increased to 23 +/- 2 Hz from 3 +/- 1 Hz during each FHR deceleration (p<0.001) and was correlated to decreases in FHR and in fetal arterial blood pressure during each FHR deceleration (p<0.001).
   Conclusions/Significance: The UCO-related changes in ECOG occurred in advance of the pH decreasing below 7.00. These ECOG changes may be a protective mechanism suppressing non-essential energy needs when oxygen supply to the fetal brain is decreased acutely. By detecting such "adaptive brain shutdown,'' the need for delivery in high risk pregnant patients may be more accurately predicted than with FHR monitoring alone. Therefore, monitoring fetal electroencephalogram (EEG, the human equivalent of ECOG) during human labour may be a useful adjunct to FHR monitoring.

AB Functional impairment of the adult brain can from deficits in the ontogeny of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Gene defects underlying autism spectrum disorders, Rett's syndrome or some forms of epilepsy, but also a diverse set of syndromes accompanying perinatal trauma, hormonal imbalances, intake of sleep-inducing or mood-improving drugs or, quite common, alcohol intake during pregnancy can alter GABA signaling early in life. The search for therapeutically relevant endogenous molecules or exogenous compounds able to alleviate the consequences of dysfunction of GABAergic transmission in the embryonic or postnatal brain requires a clear understanding of its site- and state-dependent development. At the level of single synapses, it is necessary to discriminate between presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations, and to define parameters that can be regarded as both suitable and accessible for the quantification of developmental changes. Here we focus on the performance of GABAergic synapses in two brain structures, the hippocampus and the superior colliculus, describe some novel aspects of neurotrophin effects during the development of GABAergic synaptic transmission and examine the applicability of the following rules: (1) synaptic transmission starts with GABA, (2) nescent/immature GABAergic synapses operate in a ballistic mode (multivesicular release), (3) immature synaptic terminals release vesicles with higher probability than mature synapses, (4) immature GABAergic synapses are prone to paired pulse and tetanic depression, (5) synapse maturation is characterized by an increasing dominance of synchronous over asynchronous release, (6) in immature neurons GABA acts as a depolarizing transmitter, (7) synapse maturation implies inhibitory postsynaptic current shortening due to an increase in alpha1 subunit expression, (8) extrasynaptic (tonic) conductances can inhibit the development of synaptic (phasic) GABA actions.

AB The newborn infant is prone to motor phenomena of various physiological mechanisms and pathological significance whereas they can share close clinical patterns. A detailed clinical analysis, that should be supported by a video EEC recording, is necessary. That may help to distinguish myoclonus, jitteriness or seizures. Some rare phenomenom such as hyperekplexia or myotonia have also to be known. The pregnancy and birth history, the clinical examination and the search for association of various motor phenomena give essential clues for the diagnosis. Misdiagnosing non epileptic phenomona as seizures has to be avoided as it leads to unnecessary anticonvulsivant therapy with potential harmful effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Objective: Several lines of evidence indicate that nutrient restriction during perinatal development sensitizes the offspring to the development of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in adulthood via the programming of hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. Given the link between the circadian clock and energy metabolism, and the resetting action of food on the circadian clock, in this study, we have investigated whether perinatal undernutrition affects the circadian expression rhythms of genes regulating food intake in the hypothalamus and energy metabolism in the liver.
   Design: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ad libitum either a control (20% protein) or a low-protein (8% protein) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, pups received a standard diet and at 17 and 35 days of age, their daily patterns of gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR experiments.
   Results: 17-day-old pups exposed to perinatal undernutrition exhibited significant alterations in the circadian expression profile of the transcripts encoding diverse genes regulating food intake, the metabolic enzymes fatty acid synthase and glucokinase as well as the clock genes BMAL1 and Period1. These effects persisted after weaning, were associated with hyperphagia and mirrored the results of the behavioral analysis of feeding. Thus, perinatally undernourished rats exhibited an increased hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic peptides agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y. Conversely, the mRNA levels of the anorexigenic peptides pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine and amphetamine-related transcripts were decreased.
   Conclusion: These observations indicate that the circadian clock undergoes nutritional programming. The programming of the circadian clock may contribute to the alterations in feeding and energy metabolism associated with malnutrition in early life, which might promote the development of metabolic disorders in adulthood.

AB Aim: To determine the possible risk factors for inadequate gestational weight gain.
   Methods: A population-based cohort study was carried out in Sri Lanka from May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or before 16 weeks' gestation and followed up until delivery; the sample size was 710. Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were gathered on average at the 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. Maternal weight was measured at the first antenatal clinic visit and at delivery. Inadequate weight gain was defined as weight gain below the Institute of Medicine recommendations in 2009. Multiple logistic regression was applied and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
   Results: The risk factors for inadequate weight gain were low per-capita monthly income (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03, 2.58), multiparity (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.34, 2.87), sleeping <8 h/day during the second, third, or both second and third trimesters (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05, 2.46), standing and walking >= 5 h/day during the second trimester (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.15), and the newborn being of the male sex (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.16), controlling for the effect of body mass index and gestational age.
   Conclusions: Risk factors for inadequate gestational weight gain were low income, being multiparous, sleep deprivation, physical activity in terms of standing and walking, and the male sex of baby.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the association of short sleep duration among women in the first year postpartum with inflammation at 3 years postpartum. We studied 479 women in Project Viva, a prospective cohort. At 6 months and 1 year postpartum, women reported the number of hours they slept in a 24-hour period, from which we calculated a weighted average of daily sleep. We used multivariable median regression analyses to predict the independent effects of short sleep duration (<= 5 vs >5 h/d) on markers of inflammation, for example, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein at 3 years postpartum. Women's mean (SD) hours of daily sleep in the first year postpartum was 6.7 (0.96) hours. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, excessive gestational weight gain, and gestational age at delivery, we found that postpartum sleep <= 5 h/d was associated with elevated IL-6 (beta, 0.25 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.43) compared with >5 h/d. Although postpartum sleep <= 5 h/d appeared to also be associated with elevated C-reactive protein (beta 0.15 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, -0.08 to 0.52), these results did not reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration in the first year postpartum is associated with elevated levels of the proinflammatory marker, IL-6, at 3 years postpartum. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID INFANT SLEEP; RISK
AB Objective To determine whether the use of sidecar cribs on the postnatal ward affects breastfeeding duration.
   Design A randomised non-blinded parallel trial comparing sidecar cribs with standalone cots.
   Setting Postnatal wards of the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.
   Participants 1204 pregnant women intending to breastfeed were recruited at 20 weeks' gestation and randomised at 34 weeks to use either a sidecar crib attached to their bed (n=601) or a standalone cot adjacent to their bed (n=603).
   Main outcome measures Duration of any, and exclusive, breastfeeding up to 26 weeks obtained by telephone follow-up.
   Results 334 mothers were withdrawn or lost to follow-up from the trial; infant feeding data were therefore obtained for 870 mothers (433 intervention; 437 controls). Using an intention-to-treat Cox regression analysis, no significant difference was found between the two groups for duration of any breastfeeding (sidecar crib vs cot, hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18), or exclusive breastfeeding (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16) adjusting for maternal age, education, previous breastfeeding and delivery type. Bed sharing was not significantly more common in mothers randomised to sidecar cribs (67% vs 64%, adjusted difference 2.8%, 95% CI -3.5% to 9.0%). There were no adverse events.
   Conclusion The use of sidecar cribs for mothers and infants did not improve the duration of any or exclusive breastfeeding, or frequency of bed sharing at home.

AB The purpose of the present study was to compare neonatal morbidity between night and the rest of day and investigate potential differences of birth outcomes during the internal night.
   We conducted a retrospective study based on maternal and neonatal data of period 2004-2007, enrolling exclusively spontaneous deliveries of term (a parts per thousand yen37 weeks), singleton pregnancies with cephalic presentation that were in labor. Time of day was divided into the night-shift period, from 11.00 p.m. to 7.00 a.m. (period 1) and the rest-of-day period, from 7.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m. (period 2). The night-shift period was further sub-divided into period 1a (11.00 p.m.-3.00 a.m.) and period 1b (3.00 a.m.-7.00 a.m.). Epidemiological and obstetric characteristics as well as neonatal outcomes were initially compared between periods 1 and 2 and thereafter between sub-periods 1a and 1b.
   There were 3,055 cases with complete data meeting our inclusion criteria, of which 871 (28.5%) were delivered during period 1 and 2,184 (71.5%) during period 2. Furthermore, 51.3% of night-born infants were delivered during period 1a and the remaining 48.7% during period 1b. All examined parameters were not significantly different between periods 1 and 2. Analyzing night internally, the rate of emergent CS was significantly higher for period 1a (13.2%), compared with period 1b (4%). Furthermore, incidence of NICU admission was significantly higher for the first half of the night-shift period (2.7%) compared to the relative of the second half (0.5%).
   Neonatal morbidity was comparable between night-shift and rest-of-day periods, but the rates of emergent CS and NICU admission were significantly increased in the first half of the night-shift period (11.00 p.m.-3.00 a.m.).

AB Insomnia, defined as difficulty in falling asleep and/or staying asleep, short sleep duration, or poor quality sleep, is a common sleep disorder affecting 30-40% of adult population. We have conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test if anesthesia is therapeutically beneficial in patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. We have assessed the efficacy and safety of propofol-induced sleep in these patients. This study comprised of 103 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia (including 59 non-pregnant, non-lactating women; 28-60 years) and the participants were randomized to receive either physiological saline (placebo) (n = 39) or 3.0 g/l propofol (n = 64) in a 2-h continuous intravenous infusion for five consecutive nights. The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire was used for the subjective assessment of sleep, and polysomnography was used for the objective measurement of sleep architecture and patterns. The assessments were done prior to and at the end of the 5-day treatment and 6 months after treatment period. The adverse effects of the treatment were also recorded. A 2-h continuous intravenous infusion of 3.0 g/l propofol for five consecutive nights improved the subjective and objective assessments of sleep in 64 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. This improvement occurred immediately after the therapy and persisted for 6 months. No serious adverse events were noticed during the period of drug administration or 6 months after the treatment. Propofol therapy is an efficacious and safe choice for restoring normal sleep in patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia.

AB Background Infant regulatory problems, that is, excessive crying, feeding and/or sleeping difficulties, are precursors of adverse development. However, the aetiology of regulatory problems is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate pre-, peri-and post-natal neurophysiological and psychosocial predictors of single and multiple regulatory problems at 5 months of age.
   Methods This prospective longitudinal study included all children born at neonatal risk in a geographically defined area in southern Germany. The data of n = 5093 singleton infants (83.6%) were analysed using crude and multivariate logistic regression analyses. As outcome measures we used single and multiple regulatory problems, that is, crying, feeding and/or sleeping difficulties at 5 months of age, which were assessed via a standardized interview with the parents by study paediatricians as part of a neurodevelopmental examination.
   Results In total, 30.7% of the sample suffered from single or multiple regulatory problems at 5 months. Breastfeeding increased the odds of single sleeping problems 5.12-fold, but decreased the odds of single feeding problems [odds ratio (OR) 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.74]. Very preterm birth was predictive of single feeding (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.25-2.55) and multiple regulatory problems (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.19-3.46), and foetal abnormalities increased the odds of single feeding and multiple regulatory problems from 1.53- to 1.64-fold. Family adversity and psychosocial stress factors were associated with single crying and multiple regulatory problems.
   Conclusions Pre-, peri-and post-natal neurophysiological and psychosocial factors are predictive of single and multiple regulatory problems. The results may be useful in terms of early recognition of at risk groups for regulatory problems.

TI Changes in Body Condition of Hibernating Bats Support the Thrifty Female
   Hypothesis and Predict Consequences for Populations with White-Nose

AB White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a new disease of bats that has devastated populations in eastern North America. Infection with the fungus, Geomyces destructans, is thought to increase the time bats spend out of torpor during hibernation, leading to starvation. Little is known about hibernation in healthy, free-ranging bats and more data are needed to help predict consequences of WNS. Trade-offs presumably exist between the energetic benefits and physiological/ecological costs of torpor, leading to the prediction that the relative importance of spring energy reserves should affect an individual's use of torpor and depletion of energy reserves during winter. Myotis lucifugus mate during fall and winter but females do not become pregnant until after spring emergence. Thus, female reproductive success depends on spring fat reserves while male reproductive success does not. Consequently, females should be "thrifty" in their use of fat compared to males. We measured body condition index (BCI; mass/forearm length) of 432 M. lucifugus in Manitoba, Canada during the winter of 2009/2010. Bats were captured during the fall mating period (n = 200), early hibernation (n = 125), and late hibernation (n = 128). Adult females entered hibernation with greater fat reserves and consumed those reserves more slowly than adult males and young of the year. Consequently, adult females may be more likely than males or young of the year to survive the disruption of energy balance associated with WNS, although surviving females may not have sufficient reserves to support reproduction.

AB Objectives To determine whether snoring, sleep position, and other sleep practices in pregnant women are associated with risk of late stillbirth.
   Design Prospective population based case-control study.
   Setting Auckland, New Zealand
   Participants Cases: 155 women with a singleton late stillbirth (>= 28 weeks' gestation) without congenital abnormality born between July 2006 and June 2009 and booked to deliver in Auckland. Controls: 310 women with single ongoing pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the stillbirth occurred. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors.
   Main outcome measure Maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep position at the time of going to sleep and on waking (left side, right side, back, and other).
   Results The prevalence of late stillbirth in this study was 3.09/1000 births. No relation was found between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the previous night (before stillbirth or interview) were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who slept on their left side (adjusted odds ratio for back sleeping 2.54 (95% CI 1.04 to 6.18), and for right side sleeping 1.74 (0.98 to 3.01)). The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their left was 1.96/1000 and was 3.93/1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their left. Women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who got up more frequently (adjusted odds ratio 2.28 (1.40 to 3.71)). Women who regularly slept during the day in the previous month were also more likely to experience a late stillbirth than those who did not (2.04 (1.26 to 3.27)).
   Conclusions This is the first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for stillbirth, and these findings require urgent confirmation in further studies.

ID POSTPARTUM STRESS; INITIATION; SUPPORT
AB Purpose The purposes of this study were to explore postpartum stress and breast symptoms in postpartum breastfeeding of parturient mothers as well as to identify the factors influencing the breast symptoms in breastfeeding women after cesarean section delivery.
   Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A total of 162 breastfeeding women after cesarean section delivery were recruited from five hospitals in Taiwan. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data.
   Results The five highest postpartum stress comes from the flabby flesh of maternal belly, the baby getting sick suddenly, interrupted sleep, insufficient breast milk, and discomfort due to breast engorgement. The most two common breast symptoms in breastfeeding encountered by subjects in this study were breast engorgement and breast hardening, whereas the least common one was nipple bloody discharge. Cesarean section women with early suckling on the operating table had more breast symptoms in postpartum breastfeeding; and the higher the postpartum stress of them, the more the breast symptoms.
   Conclusions Breastfeeding in a comfortable condition is a key factor of precipitating breast milk secretion, so early suckling on the operating table may result in discomfort and stress of the woman and interfere with the secretion or production of breast milk. Additionally, it is a crucial factor of the success in breastfeeding that the nursing personnel can provide women help in maintaining breast milk production and secretion, taking care of a baby, and reminding women's families (especially their husbands) of giving their assistance, encouragement and praises to relieve women's postpartum stress.

AB Being born in the winter and spring significantly increases one's risk for developing schizophrenia. This birth seasonality may account for as many as 10% of all cases of schizophrenia. Maternal third trimester infections or vitamin D deficiencies are hypothesized to be the most likely cause and can account for many of the important features of schizophrenia, although each hypothesis has limitations. Alternatively, around the winter solstice, reduced maternal sunlight exposure during the second trimester of pregnancy may result in a reduced amplitude maternal circadian pacemaker, reduced maternal nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations, elevated maternal nocturnal core body and incubator temperatures, and elevated fetal core body and brain temperatures. Indeed, studies in humans have shown that the core body temperatures of human fetuses near birth may vary by >2.5 degrees C. Reduced melatonin concentrations and elevated temperatures have been shown to have detrimental effects on immature hippocampal neurons in animals. In addition, plasma melatonin concentrations and core body temperatures are critical determinants of the dopaminergic programming of the striatal component of the human central thermostat, which appears to be functioning by the second trimester of gestation and responsive to whatever chronobiological signals its mother correctly or incorrectly transduces from the prevailing meteorological conditions. Both hippocampal and striatal thermostat dysfunction may result in reduced striatal extracellular dopamine concentrations and a tendency towards increased phasic dopamine release-the characteristic biochemical lesion in schizophrenia. Thus, the maternal-fetal chronobiological dysfunction hypothesis could account for the birth seasonality in schizophrenia and warrants further investigation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease prevalent in population and is not easily perceived in its initial stage but may sway a patient very seriously in later stage. In accordance with the estimation of World Health Organization (WHO), there will be 370 million diabetics which are 5.4% of the global people in 2030, so it becomes more and more important to predict whether a pregnant woman has or is likely to acquire diabetes. This study is conducted with the use of the machine learning-Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS)-to assist doctors in predicting pregnant women who have premonition of type 2 diabetes. AIRS is proposed by Andrew Watkins in 2001 and it makes use of the metaphor of the vertebrate immune system to recognize antigens, select clone, and memorize cells. Additionally, AIRS includes a mechanism, limited resource, to restrain the number of memory cells from increasing uncontrollably. It has also showed positive results on problems in which it was applied. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility in using AIRS to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) subsequent DM. The dataset of diabetes has imbalanced data, but the overall classification recall could still reach 62.8%, which is better than the traditional method, logistic regression, and the technique which is thought as one of the powerful classification approaches, support vector machines (SVM).

AB In veterinary medicine, the characterization of a drug's pharmacokinetic properties is generally based upon data that are derived from studies that employ small groups of young healthy animals, often of a single breed. In Part I of the series, we focused on the potential influence of disease processes, stress, pregnancy and lactation on drug pharmacokinetics. In this Part II of the series, we consider other covariates, such as gender, heritable traits, age, body composition, and circadian rhythms. The impact of these factors with respect to predicting the relationship between dose and drug exposure characteristics within an animal population is illustrated through the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Ultimately, an appreciation of these potential influences will improve the prediction of situations when dose adjustments may be appropriate.

AB Background: Malaria remains a significant health problem in Yemen with Plasmodium falciparum being the predominant species which is responsible for 90% of the malaria cases. Despite serious concerns regarding increasing drug resistance, chloroquine is still used for the prevention and treatment of malaria in Yemen. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of choloroquine resistance (CQR) of P. falciparum isolated from Yemen based on the pfcrt T76 mutation.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 511 participants from four governorates in Yemen. Blood samples were screened using microscopic and species-specific nested PCR based on the 18S rRNA gene to detect and identify Plasmodium species. Blood samples positive for P. falciparum were used for detecting the pfcrt T76 mutation using nested-PCR.
   Results: The prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation was 81.5% (66 of 81 isolates). Coastal areas/foothills had higher prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation compared to highland areas (90.5% vs 71.8%) (p = 0.031). The pfcrt T76 mutation had a significant association with parasitaemia (p = 0.045). Univariate analysis shows a significant association of pfcrt T76 mutation with people aged > 10 years (OR = 9, 95% CI = 2.3 - 36.2, p = 0.001), low household income (OR = 5, 95% CI = 1.3 - 19.5, p = 0.027), no insecticide spray (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.16 - 11.86, p = 0.025) and not sleeping under insecticide treated nets (ITNs) (OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.38 - 16.78, p = 0.01). Logistic regression model confirmed age > 10 years and low household income as predictors of pfcrt T76 mutation in Yemen P. falciparum isolates.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation in Yemen could be a predictive marker for the prevalence of P. falciparum CQR. This finding shows the necessity for an in-vivo therapeutic efficacy test for CQ. P. falciparum CQR should be addressed in the national strategy to control malaria.

AB Objectives To determine whether reduced sleep is associated with differences in body composition and the risk of becoming overweight in young children.
   Design Longitudinal study with repeated annual measurements.
   Setting Dunedin, New Zealand.
   Participants 244 children recruited from a birth cohort and followed from age 3 to 7.
   Main outcome measures Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (kg), and fat free mass (kg) measured with bioelectrical impedance; dual energy x ray absorptiometry; physical activity and sleep duration measured with accelerometry; dietary intake (fruit and vegetables, non-core foods), television viewing, and family factors (maternal BMI and education, birth weight, smoking during pregnancy) measured with questionnaire.
   Results After adjustment for multiple confounders, each additional hour of sleep at ages 3-5 was associated with a reduction in BMI of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.96) and a reduced risk of being overweight (BMI >= 85th centile) of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) at age 7. Further adjustment for BMI at age 3 strengthened these relations. These differences in BMI were explained by differences in fat mass index (-0.43, -0.82 to -0.03) more than by differences in fat free mass index (-0.21, -0.41 to -0.00).
   Conclusions Young children who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk of becoming overweight, even after adjustment for initial weight status and multiple confounding factors. This weight gain is a result of increased fat deposition in both sexes rather than additional accumulation of fat free mass.

   Cohort Study
SO PLOS ONE

ID PREGNANCY; MALARIA; KENYA; CHILD; AREA
AB Background: To achieve a child mortality reduction according to millennium development goal 4, it is necessary to considerably reduce neonatal mortality. We report stillbirth and early neonatal mortality risks as well as determinants of perinatal mortality in Eastern Uganda.
   Methods: A community-based prospective cohort study was conducted between 2006 and 2008. A total of 835 pregnant women were followed up for pregnancy outcome and survival of their children until 7 days after delivery. Mother's residence, age, parity, bed net use and whether delivery took place at home were included in multivariable regression analyses to identify risk factors for perinatal death.
   Results: The stillbirth risk was 19 per 1,000 pregnancies and the early neonatal death risk 22 per 1,000 live births. Overall, the perinatal mortality risk was 41 [95%CI: 27, 54] per 1,000 pregnancies. Of the deaths, 47% followed complicated deliveries and 24% preterm births. Perinatal mortality was 63/1,000 pregnancies among teenage mothers, 76/1,000 pregnancies among nulliparous women and 61/1,000 pregnancies among women delivering at home who, after controlling for potential confounders, had a 3.7 (95%CI: 1.8, 7.4) times higher perinatal mortality than women who gave birth in a health facility. This association was considerably stronger among nulliparous women [RR 8.0 (95%CI: 2.9, 21.6)] than among women with a previous live birth [RR 1.8 (95%CI: 0.7, 4.5)]. All perinatal deaths occurred among women who did not sleep under a mosquito net. Women living in urban slums had a higher risk of losing their babies than those in rural areas [RR: 2.7 (95%CI: 1.4, 5.3)].
   Conclusion: Our findings strengthen arguments for ensuring that pregnant women have access to and use adequate delivery facilities and bed nets.

AB To investigate the effects of short-term sleep deprivation on the sleep pattern during pregnancy, cortical and hippocampal EEG and locomotor activity were recorded within 24-hours in a "disk-over-water" paradigm in 18 Wistar rats. Rats were adapted to experimental situation and were able to move across the rotating disk without falling in water. Then a polysomnogram was recorded for 3 sequential days in the control group 1 (n = 12) without disk rotation. On the next day non-pregnant rats (experimental group 1, n = 6) were subjected to the sleep deprivation procedure with a pre-set program of disk rotation from 11:00 to 14:00 during 3 sequential days. Other 6 rats (experimental group 2) were subjected to sleep deprivation on the 5-7th day of pregnancy. EEG and locomotor activity were also constantly recorded during the sleep deprivation procedure. In control group 2 (n = 6, without sleep deprivation), a polysomnogram was recorded on the 5-7th day of pregnancy. As compared to non-pregnant rats, sleep intensity of pregnant rats increased during the first hours after the deprivation, and a considerable rebound of REM sleep took place. Sleep pattern during the off-light 12 hours remained unchanged. The results suggest that homeostatic compensation of sleep deprivation effects in rats on the first week of pregnancy is more efficient than in control non-pregnant animals.

   Besides being models for a variety of human diseases, hamsters have been object of numerous behavioral studies about stress and agonistic behavior. Such studies usually involve hormone change monitoring. The aim of the present study was to confirm the suitability of a commercial kit for human serum testosterone analysis to quantify testosterone metabolites in the feces (MFT) of male and female Syrian hamsters. Ten males were submitted to a GnRH challenge test to stimulate testicular activity and increase circulating testosterone levels. Five females received a testosterone injection and five other females were given a saline injection. Fecal samples collected before and after the procedures, and fecal samples collected from 20 pregnant females through gestation were analyzed for MFT with a commercial radioimmunoassay. The detection of a MFT peak 12 h after GnRH administration followed by a decrease under baseline showed that, in males, changes in the levels of MFT are related to respective changes of testosterone concentrations in the blood. Again in males a circadian cycle of MFT similar to the circadian rhythm described in literature for blood concentrations was detected. The administration of exogenous testosterone caused in females a dramatic peak of MFT. However, the concentrations measured through gestation did not reflect the pattern of endogenous testosterone blood levels as described in the literature. Therefore, the use of a radioimmunoassay for human blood testosterone was validated in male Syrian hamster, but a more specific assay would be necessary for female hamsters.

AB Background: Stable circadian rhythm is important for both maternal and fetal health. This retrospective analysis of women in a semiconductor factory evaluated the effect of shift work exposure on childbearing and birth weight.
   Methods: Records of 440 female employees (initial mean age: 28.4 years) including 111 mothers who had 158 live births during the period of observation (1997-2007) were reviewed. The data analyzed included maternal age, general health condition, highest educational level, life-style and occupational factors, as well as newborn gender, birth weight, birth order and gestational age.
   Results: The childbearing rates of female workers on three different work schedules (consistent daytime work (CDW), intermittent (i-) or persistent (p-) rotating shift works (RSW)) were 32.1%, 20.0% and 25.4%, respectively (P=0.047). After controlling for potential confounding factors, childbearing rates among women with CDW exceeded those of shift workers (odds ratio (OR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-3.0). The birth weights of newborns from mothers on the three work schedules (CDW, i-RSW and p-RSW) were significantly different (3271.7 +/- 395.4, 3251.3 +/- 460.9, and 2998.5 +/- 381.2 g, respectively (P < 0.01). Newborns within the lightest birth weight quintile were significantly more likely to be born to mothers with exposure to p-RSW (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.1-16.8).
   Conclusions: Rotating shift work exposure was significantly associated with decreased childbearing and lighter birth weight in women working in this semiconductor manufacturing factory. Work schedules should be carefully planned for female employees who are pregnant or preparing for pregnancy. Prenatal evaluations for mothers with persistent day-night rotating shift work exposures are especially necessary. World J Pediatr 2011;7(2):129-135

AB Background: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence.
   Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N=56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores >= 15 and clinician interview.
   Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p<.05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (chi(2)=0.98, p=32).
   Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective and background: Snoring is common among pregnant women and early reports suggest that it may bear a risk to the fetus. Increased fetal erythropoiesis manifested by elevated circulating nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) has been found in complicated pregnancies involving fetal hypoxia. Both erythropoietin (EPO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediate elevation of circulating nRBCs. The intermittent hypoxia and systemic inflammation elicited by sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) could affect fetal erythropoiesis during pregnancy. We hypothesized that maternal snoring will result in increased levels of fetal circulating nRBCs via increased concentrations of EPO, IL-6, or both.
   Methods: Women of singleton uncomplicated full-term pregnancies were recruited during labor and completed a designated questionnaire. Umbilical cord blood was collected immediately after birth and analyzed for nRBCs, plasma EPO and plasma IL-6 concentrations. Newborn data were retrieved from medical records.
   Results: One hundred and twenty-two women were recruited. Thirty-nine percent of women reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Cord blood levels of circulating nRBCs, EPO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in habitual snorers compared with non-snorers (p = 0.03, 0.005 and 0.01; respectively). No differences in maternal characteristics or newborn crude outcomes were found.
   Conclusions: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is associated with enhanced fetal erythropoiesis manifested by increased cord blood levels of nRBCs, EPO and IL-6. This provides preliminary evidence that maternal snoring is associated with subtle alterations in markers of fetal well being. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite association with lung growth and long-term respiratory morbidity, there is a lack of normative lung function data for unsedated infants conforming to latest European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society standards.
   Lung function was measured using an ultrasonic flow meter in 342 unsedated, healthy, term-born infants at a mean +/- SD age of 5.1 +/- 0.8 weeks during natural sleep according to the latest standards. Tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL) and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) measurements were obtained from 100 regular breaths. We aimed for three acceptable measurements for multiple-breath washout and 5-10 acceptable interruption resistance (Rint) measurements.
   Acceptable measurements were obtained in <= 285 infants with high variability. Mean values were 7.48 mL.kg(-1) (95% limits of agreement 4.95-10.0 mL.kg(-1)) for tidal volume, 14.3 ppb (2.6-26.1 ppb) for eNO, 23.9 mL.kg(-1) (16.0-31.8 mL.kg(-1)) for functional residual capacity, 6.75 (5.63-7.87) for lung clearance index and 3.78 kPa.s.L-1 (1.14-6.42 kPa.s.L-1) for Rint. In males, TBFVL outcomes were associated with anthropometric parameters and in females, with maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal asthma and Caesarean section.
   This large normative data set in unsedated infants offers reference values for future research and particularly for studies where sedation may put infants at risk. Furthermore, it highlights the impact of maternal and environmental risk factors on neonatal lung function.

AB OBJECTIVES: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) is a valuable tool for the continuous evaluation of functional brain maturation in infants. The amplitudes of the upper and lower margins of aEEGs are postulated to change with maturation and correlate with postmenstrual age (PMA). In this study we aimed to establish reliable reference values of aEEG amplitudes, which provide quantitative guidelines for assessing brain maturation as indicated by aEEG results in neonates and young infants.
   METHODS: aEEGs from healthy infants (n = 274) with PMAs that ranged from 30 to 55 weeks were divided into 10 groups according to their PMAs. Two 5-minute segments were selected from each aEEG and were used to automatically calculate the upper and lower margins and bandwidths of the aEEG tracings.
   RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was achieved with an overall correlation of 0.99. The upper and lower margins of the aEEGs in both active and quiet sleep clearly rose in infants after the neonatal period. The bandwidth defined as the graphic distance decreased almost monotonically throughout the PMA range from 30 to 55 weeks. The lower margin of the aEEG was positively correlated with PMA, with a larger rank correlation coefficient during quiet sleep (r = 0.89) than during active sleep (r = 0.49).
   CONCLUSIONS: Reference values of aEEG amplitudes were obtained for infants with a wide range of PMAs and constituted the basis for the quantitative assessment of aEEG changes with maturation in neonates and young infants. The normative amplitudes of aEEG margins, especially of the lower margin in quiet sleep, are recommended as a source of reference data for the identification of potentially abnormal aEEG results.

AB BACKGROUND: The role of men in the childbearing decision process and the factors that influence men's childbearing intentions have been relatively unexplored in the literature. This study aimed to describe the factors that strongly influence the childbearing intentions of men and to describe differences in these factors according to men's age group.
   METHODS: A telephone survey (response rate 84%) was conducted with 495 men between the ages of 20 and 45 living in an urban setting who, at the time of contact, did not have biological children. Men were asked about what factors strongly influence their intention to have children. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to determine if these factors were significantly associated with age.
   RESULTS: Of those sampled, 86% of men reported that at some point in the future they planned to become a parent. The factors that men considered to be most influential in their childbearing intentions were: the need to be financially secure, their partner's interest/desire to have children, their partner's suitability to be a parent and their personal interest/desire to have children. Men who were 35-45 years old had lower odds of stating that financial security (crude OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18-0.54) and partner's interest in having children (crude OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.33-0.99) were very influential, but had higher odds of stating that their biological clock (crude OR: 4.37, 95% CI: 1.78-10.76) was very influential in their childbearing intentions than men in the 20-24 year age group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The factors that influence men's intentions about when to become a parent may change with age. Understanding what influences men to have children, and what they understand about reproductive health is important for education, program and policy development.

TI The problems with utilitarian conceptions of personhood in the abortion
   debate
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article seeks to explore utilitarian conceptions of personhood which for a long time have been employed as part of a rational moral justification for the termination of pregnancy. Michael Tooley's desires-based rights approach to personhood presented in his work Abortion and Infanticide is considered and, it is argued, is found wanting when one considers unconscious adults and their ability to desire life. This article will offer that unconscious sleeping individuals only have the potential to regain the capacity to value their own life and, as such, under Tooley's formula for personhood, temporarily lose their status as a person. Following this, John Harris's utilitarian views on the status of the sleeping adult will be considered and deconstructed to show that, like Tooley, his ascription for personhood falls down at the sleeping adult. This article illustrates that utilitarian conceptions of personhood leave the sleeping adult human devoid of the rights of a person and hence render the value of this consquentialist theory, with regard to the idea of personhood, in severe doubt. The paper argues that utilitarian conceptions of personhood do little more than obstruct the worthy debate over the morality of abortion.

ID DEATH-SYNDROME; SLEEP; RISK
AB In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2-3 months, 4-5 months, and 6-8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant (P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006-2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002-2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy.

AB The metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, including central obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia and microalbuminuria, and more recently, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and atherosclerosis. Although the concept of the MetS is subject to debate due to lack of a unifying underlying mechanism, the prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype is rapidly increasing worldwide. Moreover, it is increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents of obese mothers. Evidence from both epidemiological and experimental animal studies now demonstrates that MetS onset is increasingly likely following exposure to suboptimal nutrition during critical periods of development, as observed in maternal obesity. Thus, the developmental priming of the MetS provides a common origin for this multifactorial disorder. Consequently, the mechanisms leading to this developmental priming have recently been the subject of intensive investigation. This review discusses recent data regarding the epigenetic modifications resulting from nutrition during early development that mediate persistent changes in the expression of key metabolic genes and contribute toward an adult metabolic syndrome phenotype. In addition, this review considers the role of the endogenous molecular circadian clock system, which has the potential to act at the interface between nutrient sensing and epigenetic processing. A continued and greater understanding of these mechanisms will eventually aid in the identification of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, and help develop therapeutic interventions, in accordance with current global government strategy.

AB Aims:
   To document the effect of position on oxygen saturation and changes in oxygen requirement in convalescent preterm infants.
   Methods:
   Twelve infants born >= 24 and < 32 weeks gestation, extubated and without congenital anomaly were studied using nap polysomnography in prone and supine, twice weekly until discharge. Mean oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), minimum SpO(2), mean minimum SpO(2) and time with SpO(2) < 90% were measured in active sleep.
   Results:
   Eight male and four female infants [median gestation 28 (24-31) weeks and median birthweight 1059 (715-1840) g] had 39 studies. For 21 of 39 studies, the infant was on respiratory support. Four infants had chronic lung disease (CLD). SpO(2) varied with postmenstrual age (PMA) (p = 0.003) but not with position (p = 0.36), and PMA did not influence the effect of position on SpO(2) (p = 0.19). SpO(2) was lower for those with CLD (p < 0.0001) and those on respiratory support (p < 0.001), but there was no effect of position (p = 0.97 and p = 0.67, respectively). From 36 weeks PMA, a change to supine did not increase oxygen requirement.
   Conclusion:
   In preterm infants, PMA and residual respiratory disease have greater effects on oxygenation than position. A supine sleep position is not disadvantageous for preterm infants at discharge.

AB The aim of the present work was to investigate if insomnia in late pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology/postpartum depression (PPD). 581 women in their last trimester of pregnancy answered questions/questionnaires about lifetime history of insomnia, current sleep perception, current mood and depressive symptomatology. They were interviewed with the Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. After delivery 382 (65.7%) mothers participated again in the study. Insomnia in pregnancy was not a risk factor for PPD (DSM-IV or ICD-10) but was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Negative Affect (NA) was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Women with higher NA were 4.6 (CI95% = 1.69-12.74) and 5.3 times (CI95% = 2.26-12.58) more likely of experiencing PPD (DSM-IV/ICD-10, respectively) than women with lower NA. Lifetime Depression was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology and ICD-10/PPD (OR = 2.6; CI95% = 1.16-438). Positive Affect (PA) showed to be a protective factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology and DSM-IV/PPD (OR = 1.5; CI95% = 1.20-2.33). Controlling NA, PA and Lifetime Depression, insomnia lost its predictive role, suggesting these variables might work as mediators. Associations between insomnia, NA, PA and Lifetime Depression should be assessed in pregnancy. This might help to preventively target NA, enhance PA and reduce the likelihood of experiencing postpartum depressive symptomatology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Success of Senegal's first nationwide distribution of long-lasting
   insecticide-treated nets to children under five - contribution toward
   universal coverage
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID INTEGRATED CAMPAIGN; BED NETS; OWNERSHIP; KENYA
AB Background: In 2009, the first national long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distribution campaign in Senegal resulted in the distribution of 2.2 million LLINs in two phases to children aged 6-59 months. Door-to-door teams visited all households to administer vitamin A and mebendazole, and to give a coupon to redeem later for an LLIN.
   Methods: A nationwide community-based two-stage cluster survey was conducted, with clusters selected within regions by probability proportional to size sampling, followed by GPS-assisted mapping, simple random selection of households in each cluster, and administration of a questionnaire using personal digital assistants (PDAs). The questionnaire followed the Malaria Indicator Survey format, with rosters of household members and bed nets, and questions on campaign participation.
   Results: There were 3,280 households in 112 clusters representing 33,993 people. Most (92.1%) guardians of eligible children had heard about the campaign, the primary sources being health workers (33.7%), neighbours (26.2%), and radio (22.0%). Of eligible children, 82.4% received mebendazole, 83.8% received vitamin A, and 75.4% received LLINs. Almost all (91.4%) LLINs received during the campaign remained in the household; of those not remaining, 74.4% had been given away and none were reported sold. At least one insecticide-treated net (ITN) was present in 82.3% of all households, 89.2% of households with a child < 5 years and 57.5% of households without a child < 5 years. Just over half (52.4%) of ITNs had been received during the campaign. Considering possible indicators of universal coverage, 39.8% of households owned at least one ITN per two people, 21.6% owned at least one ITN per sleeping space and 34.7% of the general population slept under an ITN the night before the survey. In addition, 45.6% of children < 5 years, and 49.2% of pregnant women had slept under an ITN.
   Conclusions: The nationwide integrated LLIN distribution campaign allowed household ITN ownership of one or more ITNs to surpass the RBM target of 80% set for 2010, though additional distribution strategies are needed to reach populations missed by the targeted campaign and to reach the universal coverage targets of one ITN per sleeping space and 80% of the population using an ITN.

TI Reported reasons for not using a mosquito net when one is available: a
   review of the published literature
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

ID TREATED BED NETS; INSECTICIDE IMPREGNATED BEDNETS; RANDOMIZED
   CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MALARIA CONTROL; PREGNANT-WOMEN; WESTERN KENYA; GHANA;
   USAGE; OWNERSHIP; REPELLENT
AB Background: A review of the barriers to mosquito net use in malaria-endemic countries has yet to be presented in the published literature despite considerable research interest in this area. This paper partly addresses this gap by reviewing one component of the evidence base; namely, published research pertaining to self-reported reasons for not using a mosquito net among net 'owning' individuals. It was anticipated that the review findings would potentially inform an intervention or range of interventions best suited to promoting greater net use amongst this group.
   Method: Studies were sought via a search of the Medline database. The key inclusion criteria were: that study participants could be identified as owning a mosquito net or having a mosquito net available for use; that these participants on one or more occasions were identified or self-reported as not using the mosquito net; and that reasons for not using the mosquito net were reported. Studies meeting these criteria were included irrespective of mosquito net type.
   Results: A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Discomfort, primarily due to heat, and perceived (low) mosquito density were the most widely identified reason for non-use. Social factors, such as sleeping elsewhere, or not sleeping at all, were also reported across studies as were technical factors related to mosquito net use (i.e. not being able to hang a mosquito net or finding it inconvenient to hang) and the temporary unavailability of a normally available mosquito net (primarily due to someone else using it). However, confidence in the reported findings was substantially undermined by a range of methodological limitations and a dearth of dedicated research investigation.
   Conclusions: The findings of this review should be considered highly tentative until such time as greater quantities of dedicated, well-designed and reported studies are available in the published literature. The current evidence-base is not sufficient in scope or quality to reliably inform mosquito net promoting interventions or campaigns targeted at individuals who own, but do not (reliably) use, mosquito nets.

TI A Review of Adult Mortality Due to 2009 Pandemic (H1N1) Influenza A in

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID INFECTION; VACCINE; VIRUS; DEATH
AB Background: While children and young adults had the highest attack rates due to 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza A (2009 H1N1), studies of hospitalized cases noted high fatality in older adults. We analyzed California public health surveillance data to better characterize the populations at risk for dying due to 2009 H1N1.
   Methods and Findings: A case was an adult >= 20 years who died with influenza-like symptoms and laboratory results indicative of 2009 H1N1. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records using a standardized case report form. From April 3, 2009 - August 10, 2010, 541 fatal cases >= 20 years with 2009 H1N1 were reported. Influenza fatality rates per 100,000 population were highest in persons 50-59 years (3.5; annualized rate = 2.6) and 60-69 years (2.3; annualized rate = 1.7) compared to younger and older age groups (0.4-1.9; annualized rates = 0.3-1.4). Of 486 cases hospitalized prior to death, 441 (91%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. ICU admission rates per 100,000 population were highest in adults 50-59 years (8.6). ICU case-fatality ratios among adults ranged from 24-42%, with the highest ratios in persons 70-79 years. A total of 425 (80%) cases had co-morbid conditions associated with severe seasonal influenza. The prevalence of most co-morbid conditions increased with increasing age, but obesity, pregnancy and obstructive sleep apnea decreased with age. Rapid testing was positive in 97 (35%) of 276 tested. Of 482 cases with available data, 384 (80%) received antiviral treatment, including 49 (15%) of 328 within 48 hours of symptom onset.
   Conclusions: Adults aged 50-59 years had the highest fatality due to 2009 H1N1; older adults may have been spared due to pre-existing immunity. However, once infected and hospitalized in intensive care, case-fatality ratios were high for all adults, especially in those over 60 years. Vaccination of adults older than 50 years should be encouraged.

   OXIDATIVE STRESS; PRETERM; CHILDREN; ROAD; PARTICLES; BLOOD
AB Background: Pregnant women exposed to traffic pollution have an increased risk of negative birth outcomes. We aimed to investigate the size of this risk using a prospective cohort of 970 mothers and newborns in Logan, Queensland.
   Methods: We examined two measures of traffic: distance to nearest road and number of roads around the home. To examine the effect of distance we used the number of roads around the home in radii from 50 to 500 metres. We examined three road types: freeways, highways and main roads.
   Results: There were no associations with distance to road. A greater number of freeways and main roads around the home were associated with a shorter gestation time. There were no negative impacts on birth weight, birth length or head circumference after adjusting for gestation. The negative effects on gestation were largely due to main roads within 400 metres of the home. For every 10 extra main roads within 400 metres of the home, gestation time was reduced by 1.1% (95% CI: -1.7, -0.5; p-value = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Our results add weight to the association between exposure to traffic and reduced gestation time. This effect may be due to the chemical toxins in traffic pollutants, or because of disturbed sleep due to traffic noise.

   PATTERNS
AB Background: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during the perinatal period. Changes in sleep and sleep quality are typical throughout pregnancy and early postpartum. However, little is known about relationships between insomnia symptoms and psychiatric symptoms in perinatal women. The objective of the present study is to characterize the burden of insomnia symptoms in perinatal women seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment and to examine relationships between insomnia and symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   Methods: Data from 257 pregnant or postpartum women who sought outpatient psychiatric treatment at a university hospital-affiliated clinic were extracted from an existing clinical management database. Data included validated self-report measures assessing insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), and generalized anxiety (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ]).
   Results: Fifty-two percent of women reported symptoms of insomnia, 75% reported symptoms of depression, and 61% reported symptoms of generalized anxiety. After controlling for PSWQ, the partial correlation between EPDS and ISI was 0.15 and 0.37 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. After controlling for EPDS, the partial correlation between PSWQ and ISI was 0.20 and 0.12 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. Women with clinically significant ISI scores had significantly higher odds for reporting symptoms consistent with depression (odds ratio [OR] 7.7) and generalized anxiety (OR 2.55) compared to women with lower ISI scores.
   Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affected a significant proportion of the perinatal women in this sample. These symptoms are linked to symptoms of depression and anxiety in treatment-seeking pregnant and postpartum women. Perinatal women seen in psychiatric treatment settings should be routinely screened for sleep problems.

AB Background: Although the literature pertaining to the cosmetology occupation and specific health effects, such as asthma, dermatitis, and reproductive function, has grown substantially, little information is available about whether cosmetologists are at increased risk of other symptoms compared to women working in other occupations. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if cosmetologists of reproductive age are at increased risk of self-reported symptoms compared to women of the same age working in other occupations.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from 450 cosmetologists and 511 women in other occupations, aged 21-55 years, in the Baltimore metropolitan region who responded to a mailed survey that ascertained detailed data on symptoms as well as usual work tasks.
   Results: The data showed that cosmetologists were at increased risk of memory and sleep disturbances, muscle weakness, throat irritation, and hot flashes compared to women of the same age working in other occupations after adjustment for confounders, including cigarette smoking. Among the cosmetologists, handling cleaning supplies; hair bleaching; use of straighteners, texturizers, or permanent chemicals; and several nail care work tasks were associated with one or more of the queried symptoms.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that, compared to noncosmetologists, cosmetologists are at increased risk for a number of symptoms reported to be associated with decreased quality of life. These symptoms may also reflect chronic exposure to chemicals that have been shown to be related to more severe long-term health outcomes.

   Aims: This study is the first to explore whether (1) maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy are associated with excessive infant crying, and (2) whether and how maternal psychological well-being during pregnancy affects these associations.
   Study design: Women were approached around the 12th pregnancy week to complete a questionnaire (n = 8266) and to donate a blood sample (n = 4389); vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations were determined in serum. Infant crying behavior was measured through a postpartum questionnaire (+/- 3 months; n = 5218).
   Subjects: Pregnant women living in Amsterdam and their newborn child.
   Outcome measures: Excessive infant crying, defined as crying >= 3 h/day on average in the past week.
   Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for 2921 (vitamin B-12) and 2622 (folate) women. Vitamin B-12 concentration (categorized into quintiles) was associated with excessive infant crying after adjustment for maternal age, parity, ethnicity, education, maternal smoking and psychological problems (OR [95%CI]: Q1 = 3.31[1.48-7.41]: Q2 = 2.50[1.08-5.77]; Q3 = 2.59[1.12-6.00]; Q4 = 2.77[1.20-6.40]; Q5 = reference). Stratified analysis suggested a stronger association among women with high levels of psychological problems during pregnancy. Folate concentration was not associated with excessive infant crying.
   Conclusions: First evidence is provided for an early nutritional origin in excessive infant crying. A low maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy could, in theory, affect infant crying behavior through two potential mechanisms: the methionine-homocysteine metabolism and/or the maturation of the sleep-wake rhythm.

AB The effect of pinealectomy (PIN-X) and PIN-X+ melatonin treatment during pregnancy (PIN-X+ MEL) 100 mu g/100 g body weight on Substance P (SP) in the striatum was investigated in offspring female rats. Female offspring were divided into control and PIN-X at the neonatal period, and studied at days 31 and 60. PIN-X mother/control offspring showed a positive influence on striatal SP values in winter, at both ages and in spring at day 31. However, this effect of maternal PIN-X was not observed in summer or fall. The effect of PIN-X on the offspring showed a positive effect in spring at day 31 and summer at the two ages studied. This effect was not observed in fall or winter. Two generations, PIN-X mother/PIN-X offspring, altered the effect of mother or offspring PIN-X and decreased the SP values in winter, spring and summer. Only striatal SP at day 60 in fall was increased. In two generations PIN-X, the striatal SP values were similar to those observed in control mother/control offspring. The effect of PIN-X+ MEL treatment on mothers during pregnancy was inhibitory for the intact offspring and stimulatory for PIN-X offspring. In conclusion, the results indicate that maternal and offspring PIN-X seem to exert a rotative and positive seasonal influence from winter to spring to summer. Two generations PIN-X disrupted this rotative circuit and in fall a compensatory discharge of SP was observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and objectives
   Blood donation can contribute to iron deficiency. The possibly resulting anaemia importantly affects donor return rate. The determination of serum ferritin levels revealed iron deficiency in many non-anaemic premenopausal female blood donors at our Institution. We started an iron substitution programme targeting this donor group to prevent anaemia and enhance donor retain.
   Materials and methods
   Women aged < 50 with haemoglobin levels adequate for donation and serum ferritin < 10 ng/ml were offered iron supplementation. Substitution lasted 16 weeks and the donation interval was extended. History collection including iron deficiency-related symptoms, whole blood count and serum ferritin determination was performed at baseline and after 2 and 6 months. Data were recorded prospectively and compared with those of 108 female controls with iron deficiency not receiving iron substitution (retrospective data).
   Results
   Of the 116 participating subjects, 60% completed the programme. Significant results were serum ferritin increase (from a mean value of 7 center dot 12 to 25 center dot 2 ng/ml), resolution of prostration, fatigue, sleep disturbances, tension in the neck, hair loss and nail breakage. No case of anaemia occurred. Sixty per cent of the women completed the programme and donated blood again.
   Conclusions
   Targeted iron substitution prevents the development of anaemia and enhances donation return in premenopausal female blood donors with iron deficiency.

   OBESITY; RETENTION; GAIN; REPRODUCIBILITY; ASSOCIATION; CHOLESTEROL;
   CHILDBIRTH
AB Background: Postpartum weight retention affects many women and increases the risk of becoming overweight. The research objective was to study modifiable factors contributing to weight change at one year postpartum.
   Methods: In this prospective cohort, postpartum behavior, such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, and intake of total energy, total fat and saturated fatty acids of 118 Dutch women were assessed in 2003/2004 by self-report at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months postpartum. Mean postpartum scores were computed for the behavioral measures. In linear regression models it was determined which factors were associated with average weight change from before pregnancy to one year postpartum. Furthermore, factors associated with substantial postpartum weight retention (>= 5 kg) were also studied in logistic regression models.
   Results: At one year postpartum, the average weight of participants had increased by 0.9 kg (SD 4.4). Moreover, 20% of the women retained >= 5 kg. Women who perceived themselves more physically active than others were almost ten times less likely to retain >= 5 kg than women who perceived themselves equally active (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.66). Exceeding the guideline for saturated fatty acid intake (OR = 3.40, 95% CI: 1.04 - 11.11), total gestational weight gain (OR = 1.14/kg, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.27), and not having completed post high school education (OR = 5.13, 95% CI: 1.66 - 15.90) increased the odds of retaining >= 5 kg.
   Conclusions: Since one in five women had substantial weight retention postpartum, effective interventions for the prevention of weight retention are much needed. Future studies should evaluate whether interventions focusing on the identified modifiable postpartum factors are successful in reducing weight retention after childbirth.

   POSITION; COT DEATH; DECLINE; EUROPE
AB Objective: To describe the epidemiological profile, risk factors and best strategies for diagnosing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in a developing country.
   Methods: Population-based, case-control study with children born between January 1st, 2001, and December 31st, 2003, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, who were allocated into three groups: SIDS cases (33), explained death controls (192), and living controls (192). Children in the latter two groups were age- and sex-paired with SIDS cases. Families in which an infant had died at home within the first year of life were identified, and the information available on death certificates and autopsy reports was compared to confirm the diagnosis of SIDS. Explained death controls consisted of infants who had died at city hospitals, and living controls were selected in the same neighborhood as SIDS cases. All parents were interviewed to obtain information on children's health and sleep habits. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors in the study population.
   Results: The incidence of SIDS in the population assessed was 0.55/1,000 live births. The analysis revealed the following risk factors: ethnicity (characterized by self-reported black skin color), prematurity, low birth weight, adolescent mother, smoking during pregnancy, and family income of less than one minimum wage. Ninety-four percent of SIDS cases were misdiagnosed in the death certificate.
   Conclusions: Although SIDS was misdiagnosed in official death certificates, the epidemiological profile is similar to the literature, as well as risk factors, which could be reduced with preventive campaigns. Investigating SIDS in developing countries requires special strategies to avoid misdiagnosis.

AB Objective. To identify predictors as free-text markers for mental ill-health from an electronic perinatal record (EMR) system and the association with emergency cesarean section (CS) in nulliparous women. Material and methods. This was a population-based study using an EMR system, set in the catchment area of Malmo University Hospital in Sweden. Of 10 662 nulliparous women presenting with a singleton cephalic baby for vaginal delivery between 2001 and 2006, 6 467 women with complete EMRs were selected. A free-text search of markers for mental ill-health was carried out, and results were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Eleven markers for mental ill-health were tested with Cohen's kappa for agreement and used as exposure variables. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for emergency CS, and adjusted for maternal age, diabetes, epidural anesthesia and gestational weeks <37 and >41 by a multivariate logistic regression model with vaginal delivery as the reference. Results. Three markers identified from the EMR system reached statistically significant associations with an increased risk for emergency CS in nulliparous women: stress, adjusted OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.34-2.06); sleep, adjusted OR 1.57(95% CI 1.14-2.16); and worry, adjusted OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.10-1.79). Conclusion. Free-text words in medical records that indicated stress, sleep disturbances or worry predicted increased adjusted OR for emergency CS in first-time mothers. Recognizing pregnant women's reporting of their mental health status could have a predictive bearing on delivery outcomes.

AB Converging evidence indicates that pregnant women report experiencing problems with memory, but the results of studies using objective measures are ambiguous. The present study investigated potential reason(s) for the discrepancy between findings of subjective and objective memory deficits, as well as potential source(s) of pregnant women's problems with memory. Sixty-one pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women completed a series of memory tests which included field and laboratory measures of prospective memory. Three standardized questionnaires were used to assess subjective aspects of memory. The influence of cortisol, depressed mood, anxiety, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on pregnancy-related deficits was also examined. The findings revealed objective pregnancy-related deficits on two of the field measures of prospective memory. Pregnancy-related subjective deficits were also detected on all of the questionnaires. In contrast, no objective pregnancy-related deficits were found on the laboratory measures of memory. Increased physical symptoms accounted for one of the objective deficits in memory, while depressed mood and physical symptoms accounted for two of the subjective memory deficits. Collectively, these findings suggest that pregnant women experience everyday life problems with memory that are not readily detected in the laboratory environment. The predominant use of laboratory tests may explain the myriad of previous failures to detect objective deficits in pregnant women's memory.

The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the effect of prenatal depression on newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables.
   Method: We screened 205 pregnant women from April 2004 to November 2006 for depressive symptoms. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group (n = 34) was based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group (n = 79) by routine screening at 2 and 6 months. Newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, respectively.
   Results: Despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (eg, at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery), prenatal depression highly correlated with anxiety and stress scores. Male newborns of mothers with prenatal depression had lower scores than controls on the motor skills and regulation of states NBAS clusters (P=.03 and P=.026, respectively). At 1 year, infants of prenatally depressed mothers presented higher scores on generalized anxiety (P=.002), particularly in males (P=.009); activity/impulsivity (P=.042); and sleep problems (P=.023) than controls.
   Conclusions: As in animal studies, depression during pregnancy may affect infant development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress, and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to understanding the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders.

AB BACKGROUND: This study examines whether social age deadlines exist for childbearing in women and men, how they vary across countries, whether they are lower than actual biological deadlines and whether they are associated with childbearing at later ages and the availability of assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs).
   METHODS: This study is based on the European Social Survey, Round 3 (2006-2007), which covers 25 countries. Data were gathered on social age deadlines for childbearing in women (21 909 cases) and men (21 239 cases) from samples of representative community-dwelling populations aged 15 and older.
   RESULTS: Social age deadlines for childbearing were perceived more frequently for women than men. These deadlines are often lower than actual biological limits, and for women and men alike: 57.2% of respondents perceived a maternal social age deadline <= 40 years of age; 46.2% of the respondents perceived a paternal social age deadline <= 45 years of age. There is also considerable variability in deadlines across countries, as well as within them. At the country level, the presence of social age deadlines for the childbearing of women was negatively associated with birth rates at advanced ages and the prevalence of ART, and later deadlines were positively associated with these factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is important to understand the factors that increase and limit late fertility. While biological factors condition fertility, so do social expectations. These findings provide widespread evidence across Europe that social limits exist alongside biological ones, though both sets of factors are more binding for women.

AB Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are more common in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women. It is likely that physiology of pregnancy predisposes to the development or worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, but some physiologic changes may also be protective against the development of this disease. Clinical presentation may be less predictive of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy than in the non-pregnant population; nonetheless, snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Treatment strategies are similar to the nonpregnant population, however, pregnancy-specific scenarios may arise and these subtleties are addressed in this review.

AB Adult neurogenesis occurs in two privileged microenvironments, the hippocampal subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) along the lateral ventricle. This review focuses on accumulating evidence suggesting that the activity of specific brain regions or bodily states influences SVZ cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin have been shown to have long-range effects through neuronal projections into the SVZ. Local gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have demonstrated effects on SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, but an extra-niche source of these neurotransmitters remains to be explored and options will be discussed. There is also accumulating evidence that diseases and bodily states such as Alzheimer's disease, seizures, sleep and pregnancy influence SVZ cell proliferation. With such complex behavior and environmentally-driven factors that control subregion-specific activity, it will become necessary to account for overlapping roles of multiple neurotransmitter systems on neurogenesis when developing cell therapies or drug treatments.

AB Aim: A survey was carried out to assess awareness, possession and use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) by mothers in preventing malaria among children under 5 years old.
   Methods: Pretested questionnaires were administered by trained research assistants to women that have had a child in the last 59 months, irrespective of place of child delivery.
   Results: Malaria was considered dangerous by almost all respondents (98.5%); the level of awareness of ITN as a malaria preventive tool was 75.1% while possession was 45%. Awareness and possession of ITN were positively and significantly influenced by high educational qualification of mothers and attendance of a public hospital for antenatal care. Hospitals were identified as the major source of awareness among respondents; women that delivered their babies in traditional birth home displayed least awareness (38.6%) and recorded low possession (10%). There was no significant relationship between ITN usage, birth order and age of child. Heat experienced while sleeping under ITN and problem of how to hang the net were major limitations identified in the use of ITN.
   Conclusion: The need to involve women receiving antenatal care outside the hospital in malaria control intervention is hereby recommended. Methods of bridging ITN possession and use needs to de developed.

AB This study investigated the effect of body position on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and autonomic nervous modulation, and the relationship between them using spectral analysis of EEG and heart rate variability (HRV). All healthy volunteers recruited had their electrocardiogram and EEG recorded for power spectral analysis. We found that when changing position from supine to upright, the EEG spectral components below the a band, such as delta and theta bands, were significantly decreased while the EEG spectral components above the a band, such as beta, gamma and omega bands, were significantly increased in both scalps. Correlation analysis showed that the theta rhythm of both scalps might be associated with the control of HR, the alpha and beta rhythms of right scalp might be associated with vagal modulation, and the gamma rhythm of left scalp might be associated with sympathetic modulation of the subject. Thus, some EEG components might be associated with the autonomic nervous modulation of the subject during positional change. There might be a mechanism located in the brain-stem which jointly controls both autonomic influences on heart rate and EEG activation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Human hearing develops progressively during the last trimester of gestation. Near-term fetuses can discriminate acoustic features, such as frequencies and spectra, and process complex auditory streams. Fetal and neonatal studies show that they can remember frequently recurring sounds. However, existing data can only show retention intervals up to several days after birth.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that auditory memories can last at least six weeks. Experimental fetuses were given precisely controlled exposure to a descending piano melody twice daily during the 35(th), 36(th), and 37(th) weeks of gestation. Six weeks later we assessed the cardiac responses of 25 exposed infants and 25 naive control infants, while in quiet sleep, to the descending melody and to an ascending control piano melody. The melodies had precisely inverse contours, but similar spectra, identical duration, tempo and rhythm, thus, almost identical amplitude envelopes. All infants displayed a significant heart rate change. In exposed infants, the descending melody evoked a cardiac deceleration that was twice larger than the decelerations elicited by the ascending melody and by both melodies in control infants.
   Conclusions/Significance: Thus, 3-weeks of prenatal exposure to a specific melodic contour affects infants 'auditory processing' or perception, i.e., impacts the autonomic nervous system at least six weeks later, when infants are 1-month old. Our results extend the retention interval over which a prenatally acquired memory of a specific sound stream can be observed from 3-4 days to six weeks. The long-term memory for the descending melody is interpreted in terms of enduring neurophysiological tuning and its significance for the developmental psychobiology of attention and perception, including early speech perception, is discussed.

AB Hormonal and physical changes during pregnancy are associated with some sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) such as snoring and sleep apnea, and SRBD are associated with recurrent episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation and increased sympathic activity. We aimed to search the incidence of self-reported snoring and witnessed apnea in the third trimester of pregnancy and to analyze their influence on fetal outcome and gestational hypertension (GH).
   Two hundred pregnant women (group 1) during their stay for labor and 200 age-matched control women (group 2) were included in the study. All patients were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire that covers demographic features. We measured neck circumference and performed Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) to determine excessive daytime sleepiness in all patients.
   The mean age was 27.4 +/- A 6.7 and 26.3 +/- A 5.8 for group 1 and 2, respectively. Habitual snoring was detected only in group 1 in 5 patients; 36 pregnant women and 7 control patients reported occasional snoring. Both habitual and occasional snoring was significantly observed to be increased in pregnancy. Witnessed sleep apnea was been observed only in 1 patient in group 1. The mean neck circumference was 37.4 +/- A 3.2, 35.1 +/- A 2.1 cm and ESS was 6.7 +/- A 3.01, 5.1 +/- A 2.1 for group 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between snoring and GH. There was no significant relationship between all investigated parameters and fetal outcome. We found that excessive weight gain during pregnancy is significantly associated with snoring.
   We concluded that, although pregnant women, especially who gain excessive weight during their pregnancy, significantly snore more than nonpregnant women, this did not affect fetal outcome.

AB Atypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research.

AB Background:
   Anecdotal reports of sleep disturbance during pregnancy are abundant; however, objective measurement of sleep changes has so far produced conflicting results.
   Aims:
   To objectively measure sleep architecture and investigate subjective sleep quality in the first and third trimester of pregnancy, when compared to the nonpregnant state.
   Methods:
   Twenty-seven women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 21 women in the first trimester of pregnancy and 24 nonpregnant control women underwent overnight polysomnography and completed questionnaires regarding sleep quality and mood.
   Results:
   Women in the third trimester of pregnancy had poorer sleep efficiency, more awakenings, less stage 4 sleep, more stage 1 sleep and fewer minutes in rapid eye movement sleep when compared to the control group. Cortical arousals were seen more often during pregnancy, particularly in response to respiratory events and limb movements. Sleep during the first trimester was affected to a lesser extent, with more wake time after sleep onset and less stage 4 sleep when compared to the controls.
   Conclusions:
   Sleep during pregnancy is compromised by higher amounts of wake and cortical arousals leading to sleep fragmentation, with greater amounts of light sleep and less deep sleep. Mood state did not have an effect on sleep. Given the impact of sleep on well-being, this study increases our understanding of the characteristics of sleep during pregnancy, to help recognise when severe sleep disruption may warrant referral to a specialist for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

AB Background: Stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the course of pregnancy and on fetal development. There are few studies investigating the outcome of stress reduction interventions on maternal well-being and obstetric outcome.
   Aims: This study aims (1) to obtain fetal behavioral states (quiet/active sleep, quiet/active wakefulness), (2) to investigate the effects of maternal relaxation on fetal behavior as well as on uterine activity, and (3) to investigate maternal physiological and endocrine parameters as potential underlying mechanisms for maternal-fetal relaxation-transferral.
   Study design: The behavior of 33 fetuses was analyzed during laboratou relaxation/quiet rest (control group, CG) and controlled for baseline fetal behavior. Potential associations between relaxation/quiet rest and fetal behavior (fetal heart rate (FHR), FHR variation. FHR acceleration, and body movements) and uterine activity were studied, using a computerized cardiotocogram (CTG) system. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and norepinephrine were measured.
   Results: Intervention (progressive muscle relaxation, PMR, and guided imagery. GI) showed changes in fetal behavior. The intervention groups had higher long-term variation during and after relaxation compared to the CG (p = .039). CG fetuses had more FHR acceleration, especially during and after quiet rest (p = .027). Women in the PMR group had significantly more uterine activity than women in the Cl group (p = .011) and than CG women. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones were not associated with fetal behavior.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that the fetus might participate in maternal relaxation and suggests that Cl is superior to PMR. This could especially be true for women who tend to direct their attention to body sensations such as abdominal activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) has two main properties, the presence of co-ordinated bursts of activity, indicative of many nerve fibres firing at a similar time, and entrainment of the bursts to the cardiac cycle, due to inhibitory input from baroreceptors to a network of cell groups within the CNS. Although this patterning is used as a 'gold standard' for the identification of successful nerve recordings, the maturation of these basic features of SNA from fetal life to adulthood has not been investigated. Using a telemetry-based nerve amplifier, renal SNA (RSNA) was recorded in preterm (99 +/- 1 days gestation; term 147 days) and near-term fetal sheep (119 +/- 0 days gestation), without anaesthesia or paralysis, and contrasted with RSNA recorded in adult sheep. All three age groups showed a classic bursting pattern of RSNA and co-ordination of bursts with the cardiac cycle. However, the delay between diastole and the next peak in RSNA was longest in preterm fetuses (319 +/- 1 ms), compared with near-term fetuses (250 +/- 13 ms), and shortest in the adult sheep (174 +/- 38 ms). This was independent of the maturational decrease in heart rate. The near-term fetuses showed a marked but sleep-state-dependent increase in resting RSNA compared with preterm fetuses. Although entrainment with the pressure pulse suggests that the intricate circuitry within the CNS is developed in the preterm fetus, the decrease in the length of the delay suggests continuing maturation of this key feature of RSNA in the last third of gestation and after birth.

DE diagnosis of postpartum depression; etiology of postpartum depression;
   treatment of postpartum depression
ID PREGNANCY; SYMPTOMS; DISEASE
AB Postpartum depression (PPD) is a cross-cultural form of major depressive disorder that affects some 13% of women and can have serious health consequences for both the mother and her child. Easy-to-use, reliable, self-administered screening tools are available. PPD may have a variety of etiologies, which include changing plasma levels of estrogen and progesterone, postpartum hypothyroidism, sleep deprivation, or difficult life circumstances. Standard treatments for PPD include psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, treatment of a thyroid condition or insomnia, or even regular exercise or massage may also be beneficial. PPD is underdiagnosed, therefore more screening is needed. Obstetricians and pediatricians have a unique opportunity to test women for PPD, but general practitioners may encounter patients with undiagnosed PPD, too. These physicians could positively impact the lives of depressed mothers and their children by identifying them, then treating or providing referrals for care as appropriate.

AB C57BL/6J (B6) mice are susceptible to in utero growth retardation and a number of morphological malformations following prenatal alcohol exposure, while DBA/2J (D2) mice are relatively resistant. We have previously shown that genomic imprinting may play a role in differential sensitivity between B6 and D2. The best-characterized mechanism mediating genomic imprinting is differential DNA methylation. In the present study we examined DNA methylation and gene expression, in both embryonic and placental tissue, at the mouse Igf2 locus following in utero ethanol exposure. We also examined the effects of a methyl-supplemented diet on methylation and ethanol teratogenesis. In embryos from susceptible B6 mice, we found small decreases in DNA methylation at four CpG sites in one of the differentially methylated regions of the Igf2 locus; only one of the four sites showed a statistically significant decrease. We observed no significant decreases in methylation in placentae. All Igf2 transcripts showed approximately 1.5-fold decreases following intrauterine alcohol exposure. Placing dams on a methyl-supplemented diet before pregnancy and throughout gestation brought methylation back up to control levels. Methyl supplementation also resulted in lower prenatal mortality, greater prenatal growth, and decreased digit malformations; it dramatically reduced vertebral malformations. Thus, although prenatal alcohol had only small effects on DNA methylation at the Igf2 locus, placing dams on a methyl-supplemented diet partially ameliorated ethanol teratogenesis.

   INFANT TEMPERAMENT
AB This review of recent research on prenatal depression suggests that it is a strong predictor of postpartum depression and is more common than postpartum depression. Prenatal depression has been associated with excessive activity and growth delays in the fetus as well as prematurity, low birthweight, disorganized sleep and less responsiveness to stimulation in the neonate. Infants of depressed mothers have difficult temperament, and later in development attentional, emotional and behavioral problems have been noted during childhood and adolescence, as well as chronic illnesses in adulthood. Several variables have confounded the effects of prenatal depression including comorbid anxiety and anger as well as stressful life events. Potential mediating variables are low prenatal maternal dopamine and serotonin levels and elevated cortisol and norepinephrine. The associated intrauterine artery resistance may limit blood flow, oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Some studies also suggest the heritability of developmental problems for the children of prenatally depressed mothers, including ADHD and antisocial behavior. Multivariate, longitudinal research is needed to disentangle these confounding and mediating variables. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring and asthma are known comorbid conditions in men and non-pregnant women. This comorbidity has not been evaluated among pregnant women. We assessed the habitual snoring-asthma relationship among pregnant women. Methods. A cohort of women (N = 1335) were interviewed during pregnancy, and we ascertained participants' asthma status and collected information about habitual snoring, before and during pregnancy. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. Compared with non-asthmatics, the adjusted OR among asthmatics for snoring before pregnancy was 2.13 (95% CI 1.10-4.12). The odds of snoring during early pregnancy was 1.79-fold (OR = 1.79; 95% C; 1.07-3.01). Associations were more pronounced among overweight (>= 25 kg/m(2)) asthmatics (OR = 5.39; 95% CI 2.27-12.75). Conclusions. We report a cross-sectional association of habitual snoring and asthma among pregnant women. If confirmed, pregnant asthmatics may benefit from more vigilant screening and management of OSA or habitual snoring during pregnancy.

AB Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n = 118 and 122) were randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample 1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with few resources. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 34:7-19, 2011

   PLASMA; SLEEP
AB Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) reduces maternal-infant interaction quality, stresses infants and mothers, and is linked to adverse child social-emotional and cognitive developmental outcomes. Objectives: A hypothesised mechanism for these observed relationships is the stress-related over-activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and resultant altered cortisol patterns. While cortisol levels of mothers and infants are strongly correlated, environmental, maternal, infant and maternal-infant interactive factors may also contribute to altered cortisol patterns. Thus, the objective of this study is to use Barnard's Child Health Assessment Model to explore the influences on maternal and infant diurnal cortisol patterns for matched pairs of mothers and infants affected by postpartum depression. Method: Secondary analyses were conducted on data collected from mothers and their infants affected by symptoms of PPD (n = 53). Multiple regression models were undertaken to study mothers' and infants' diurnal cortisol patterns using area under the curve analysis. Results: Having a preterm child predicted both an increase in overall cortisol levels (p = .01) and a reduction in the daily decline (p = .02) in cortisol patterns for mothers. Difficult life circumstances (p = .04) also predicted a reduction in mothers' expected daily decline in cortisol. For infants, maternal-infant interaction qualities including cognitive growth-fostering (p = .03) and socioemotional growth fostering (p = .02) reduced overall cortisol levels and increased the daily decline in cortisol, respectively. Conclusion: For mothers, preterm birth was the most robust predictor of elevated cortisol levels. For infants, more optimal maternal-infant interactions predicted lower levels of infant cortisol. Future research should examine interactions among infant temperament, maternal responsiveness and infant cortisol patterns.

ID PREGNANCY LOSS
AB Background: The grieving process due to a fetal loss has several features which should be considered in the clinical care of patients going through a miscarriage experience. Bereaved patients present greater demands for medical assistance, number of hospitalizations and are more vulnerable to psychosomatic problems than the general population. Objective: This paper aims to present a case report of miscarriage grief treated with a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol. Method: The therapy was composed by 12 sessions and the protocol involves the development of strategies to deal with the main somatic complaints, learning of new abilities, approach to cognitive and emotional alterations and training to handle behavioral problems. Results were evaluated by Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GGHQ). Results: Patient presented reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Hopelessness also decreased. All the GGHQ factors presented reduction, with a marked decline in "desire of death" and "psychosomatic disorders". It was also noted an improvement in sleep quality. Discussion: The treatment showed itself effective in relation to the factors presented, apart from collaborating for a better quality of life and facilitating the social reinsertion of the patient.

AB Data from our research are reviewed showing limited attentiveness and responsivity to animate stimuli in newborns of depressed mothers. These include face-voice stimuli of mothers and strangers, newborn cry sounds and instrumental and vocal music. Newborns of depressed mothers are also noted to be less attentive and responsive when presented with inanimate stimuli, including different texture nipples, different temperature nipples and different weight tubes. Potential underlying mechanisms are suggested by research showing negative effects of prenatal depression, elevated prenatal cortisol and lower prenatal dopamine and serotonin on the newborns of depressed mothers. Additional risk factors are explored, including sleep disturbances and other prenatal stressors. Early interventions, including pregnancy massage, massage therapy for infants and demonstration of the Brazelton Assessment, have been noted to enhance the neonates' attentiveness and responsivity to animate and inanimate stimuli. Limitations of these studies are discussed, including the sample being limited to lower SES women who have many other problems that potentially affect newborns. More controlled studies are needed to assess potential mediating factors for the inferior performance of these newborns on perceptual tasks such as limited attentiveness and/or greater arousal as well as longitudinal follow-up studies to determine whether these limited perceptual abilities continue into infancy.

AB As one of the most common neurological disorders, restless legs syndrome (RLS) is generally underdiagnosed and undertreated. Considering the lack of knowledge regarding the world-wide epidemiology of this common neurological disorder, we carried out a study to estimate the distribution of RLS in Isfahan, a city in the center of Iran. During the one-month period from 8 August 2007 to 8 September 2007, patients older than 18 years referred to eight neurology clinics were asked to fill out two questionnaires. The first questionnaire was derived from the diagnostic criteria for RLS outlined by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG). The second covered sociodemographic conditions and some other parameters concerning the clinical characteristics of RLS. Of the 2099 responding patients, 168 (8.00%) fulfilled all four IRLSSG diagnostic criteria for RLS. Their mean age was 43.4 +/- 16.63 SD and the prevalence in women (69.64%) was higher than in men (30.36%), with a female-to-male ratio of 1.75. We estimated the RLS prevalence to be 8% in the population of patients referred to the neurology clinics. Moreover, the sex-specific prevalence was 9.06% in females and 5.75% in males, results identical to previous observations in western countries.

AB The purpose of this study was to characterize the different features of body movements for females before and after parturition. Body movement signal was measured by a piezoelectric sensor board which was deployed on the abdominal position beneath a mattress during sleep to monitor pressure changes around abdominal area. Body movement epochs were detected by an innovative algorithm based on Hilbert transform. Data were collected from two healthy pregnant females during sleep for 7 weeks before parturition and 6 weeks after parturition. The pressure signal was used to determine the duration and time interval of maternal movements. Characteristics of the detected body movements before and after parturition were investigated through their proportion. The results showed that before and after parturition, the body movement which features as 0 similar to 1 min in interval and 0 similar to 6 sec in duration has significant difference statistically. It is considered that these differences are highly correlated with the prenatal activities.

AB Objective: Entrainment to the day-night cycle is critical for infant sleep and social development. Synchronization of infant circadian systems with the social 24-hr day may require maternal activity signals as an entraining cue. This descriptive and exploratory research examines the activity level and circadian pattern in mothers and infants. Method: Twenty-two healthy mothers and their infants (postnatal age 49.8 +/- 17.1 days) wore actigraph monitors for seven days. Daytime (06:00-21:59) and nighttime (22:00-05:59) activity levels and circadian parameters of rest-activity patterns (i.e., mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and 24-hr cosinor fit) were calculated. Results: Mothers and infants were significantly more active during the day than at night. The goodness-of-fit index for the model (R2) indicates that circadian rhythm accounted for a mean of 29 +/- 10% and 12 +/- 8% of the variability in maternal and infant activity, respectively. Acrophase of activity occurred at 15:46 +/- 1:07 for the mothers and 15:20 +/- 1:21 for the infants. The mean within-dyad correlation of activity counts was r = .46 +/- .11, and the within-dyad correlation was associated with the amplitude (r = .66, p < .01) and 24-hr cosinor fit of infant activity (r = .67, p < .01). Conclusions: Our findings suggest maternal rhythms as a possible exogenous influence on shaping an infant's emerging rhythms and synchronizing them with the external light-dark cycle. Strong pattern synchrony between maternal and infant activity may support infant circadian entrainment and enhance a regular 24-hr sleep-wake schedule during the early postnatal weeks.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder with a prevalence in Europe ranging from 5% to 10%. The disease is characterized by an imperative urge to move the legs associated with an unpleasant sensation in the lower limbs, typically occurring at rest in the evening and during the night. RLS can lead to disturbances of sleep and an impaired quality of life. It is diagnosed clinically by means of four internationally recognized criteria that summarize the main characteristics of the disorder. The disease exists in forms classified as idiopathic and secondary. Iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy are well established secondary causes of RLS. Several neurological disorders are also associated with RLS. Iron and dopamine play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease RLS is a complex genetic disorder, although no disease-causing gene has yet been identified. Dopaminergic therapy is currently the most effective treatment for this disease.

AB Circadian rhythms are modulated in a variety of peripheral tissues, including in the uterus where endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) undergo proliferation and differentiation (decidualization) during gestation. Here the authors focused on circadian rhythms in UESCs during implantation and decidualization in rodents. As revealed by analyses of cultured UESCs from pregnant Per2 promoter-dLuc transgenic rats, Per2 oscillation of similar to 24 h was observed in response to dexamethasone. Per2 oscillation was enhanced in UESCs during implantation, whereas they were attenuated during decidualization. In vivo studies showed that PER2 protein in the uteri displayed a peak at zeitberger time 4 (ZT 4) (day 4.50 of gestation) and a trough at ZT 12 (day 4.83), indicating its circadian rhythmicity. Conversely, no significant circadian rhythm of the PER2 protein was observed during decidualization. Fluorescent immunohistochemical studies also supported circadian rhythmicity of the PER2 protein in its intracellular distribution. In accordance with Per2 mRNA expression, a circadian rhythm of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) gene expression, having several E-box or E-box-like sites at the upstream of the transcription start site, was observed during implantation, showing a peak at ZT 0 and a trough at ZT 12. In contrast, Vegf mRNA expression displayed no circadian rhythm during decidualization. Collectively, the present results prove that Per2 oscillation is down-regulated in UESCs during decidualization. It is strongly suggested that cellular differentiation in UESCs interferes with circadian clockwork. (Author correspondence: mhattori@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp)

AB Study Objectives: To evaluate the success rate of adding continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (EFM) during full night polysomnography (PSG), in women with both gestational hypertension (OH) with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. Method: As part of a larger study evaluating for the presence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in women with OH compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies, continuous EFM was added to usual polysomnography. Results: Forty-eight EFM studies (26 with GH and 22 with uncomplicated pregnancies) were evaluated. EFM studies were categorized by the percentage of time that interpretable tracings were obtained: < 25% of the time; 25-50% of the time; or > 50% of the time. We deemed > 50% of the time to be ideal, but under the test conditions 25-50% of the time to be acceptable. For women with OH, 71% of women had ideal or acceptable overnight EFM tracings compared to 82% for women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Of those women who were diagnosed with SDB, 77% had an acceptable or ideal EFM tracing. Conclusions: Adding EFM to conventional polysomnography is feasible and safe. It may prove an important adjunct as interest in sleep disorders of pregnancy continues to expand.

AB The purpose of this pilot study is to asses the effects of multiple pregnancies on the maturation of the developing brain using the polysomnographic EEG recordings. Data from prospectively recorded 10 twin sets, born prematurely (mean 36 gestational week; range 33 - 38 GW) in the Split University Hospital Center, were analysed. We compared sleep architecture parameters in the twins at 37(th) and 44(th) postmenstrual age (PMA) with parameters that were expected at that PMA. The same parameters were compared within each twin pair using the Man Whitne test. At first measurement indeterminate sleep (IS) proportion was greater in the first twin than in the second one. The IS sleep proportion was 1.6 fold greater in the first twin (p=0.028), and 1,8 fold less percentage of quite sleep (QS) than the second twin (p=0.054). The length of sleep stages among the twins was similar at the second measurement. Measures of sleep architecture were not significantly different within the twins in second recording. The results of this study obtained on a relatively small number of twins (longer IS and shorter QS in the first twin at the 38(th) week recordings), showed that the maturational differences among twins exist in utero and shortly after birth, and then disappear until the end of the first month of the postnatal life.

AB Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in neonatal period may cause neurological impairment, epilepsy, and lead to stroke It is caused primarily by coagulopathy of numerous reasons, occasionally pen natal asphyxia, traumatic delivery and hyperhomocysteinemia. Dandy-Walker malformation is characterized by agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. Dandy-Walker malformation, variant, and mega cisterna magna represent a spectrum of developmental anomalies. Insults to developing cerebellar hemispheres and the fourth ventricle are believed to be the cause of malformation. Our patient was born from noncomplicated pregnancy, noncomplicated nontraumatic vaginal delivery at term, excellent Apgar scores, without peculiarities in clinical status. She was brest-fed by the 42(nd) hour of life when she had rightsided seizures during sleep that repeated for five times in next 24 hours. Brain Ultrasound (US) revealed clot in left lateral ventricle, slight dilatation of left ventricle, both sided pen ventricular echodensity, ischemia, slight enlargement of forth ventricle and a bit smaller cerebellum. There was no visible flow through left transverse, superior sagittal and straight sinus. Magnetic Resonance (MRI) confirmed the finding and showed thrombosis of left and right transverse venous sinuses and confluence of sinuses. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed leftsided focal changes. The newborn was treated with phenobarbiton for 8 days and had no convulsions during that period. All coagulation parameters, homocistein, lipoproteins (a) and D-dimers were normal. There were no mutations on FV R506Q, PT 20210A, MTHFR 677C/T. No antiphospholipides were found. Heart US showed no structural anomalies. No other patology or risk factors were present at the time. Before discharge, US showed hydrocephalus. Flow in affected sinuses was visible with color Doppler. MRI showed recanalization of affected sinuses, also hydrocephalus and presentation of Dandy Walker. On EEG there was borderline finding. Due to progression of hydrocephalus ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed. In age of 1 year EEG was slower for age but without focus. Neurological development was normal for age. The question is whether this child had intrauterine insult and inception of Dandy Walker with further postnatal progress of thrombosis and evolution to full picture of Dandy Walker with hydrocephalus OR thrombosis that led to development of hydrocephalus and Dandy Walker malformation in this child were accidental coexistance.

AB All adult mammals examined thus far exhibit sleep bout durations that follow an exponential distribution and wake bout durations that follow a power-law distribution. In altricial rodents such as rats and mice, exponential distributions of sleep bouts are found soon after birth, but the power-law distribution of wake bouts does not emerge until the third postnatal week. Also, both sleep and bouts consolidate across the early postnatal period. It is not known whether similar developmental processes occur in precocial species during the prenatal period. Here we characterize sleep-wake development in a precocial species, the domestic sheep (Ovis aries), from 114 to 148 days gestational age (DGA). Sleep and wake bout durations exhibited exponential distributions throughout the fetal period with some evidence of an emerging exponential-to-power- law transition for wake bouts toward the end of gestation. Both sleep and wake bouts consolidated in an orderly fashion across development and there was little evidence of circadian variation, even in the oldest subjects. These results indicate that similar patterns of sleep-wake organization are found prenatally in a precocial species as are found postnatally in altricial species. Data from more species are needed to fully realize the benefits of a developmental comparative approach for understanding the forces that have shaped the ontogeny and phylogeny of mammalian sleep.

In overweight/obese (OW/OB; n = 132) mothers, greater % kcal from sweets early inpregnancy was the strongest, independent predictor of higher weight for age (WFA) (beta = 0.19; P = 0.004), higher odds ofmacrosomia (OR = 1.1 (1.0-1.2); P = 0.004) andWFA >90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.1-1.3); P = 0.002) and higher WFA at 6 months (beta = 0.30; P = 0.002). In normal weight (n = 153) mothers, higher intake of soft drinks was the strongest predictor of higher offspring WFA at birth (beta = 0.16; P = 0.04) but not at 6 months. Prenatal physical activity, depressive symptoms, and sleep-related variables did not significantly predict offspring weight outcomes. Mothers' eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in OW/OB mothers, may have a lasting effect on child weight.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of postpartum depression in a regular clinical setting among Chilean women. The Postpartum Depression Screening Scale, Spanish Version was used to assess symptoms of depression. Chilean women (45%) reported depressive symptoms including suicidal thoughts, sleeping/eating disturbances, and emotional stability. Factors that predicted the probability of PPD included attitudes concerning pregnancy, social support, and tobacco use. Routine screening for PPD could make a difference in prevention, prompt diagnosis, and management of postpartum depression in developing countries.

AB Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene and review of the clinical history. SIDS is one of the leading causes of infant mortality and occurs from the first month, until the first year of life for newborns and infants.
   The aim of this review was to identify and examine risk factors responsible for causing the sudden infant death and to propose certain measures in order to protect newborns and infants from sudden death.
   The potential factors that contribute to the occurrence of SIDS include inadequate prenatal care, low birth weight (<2499gr), premature infants, intrauterine growth delay, short interval between pregnancies and maternal substance use (tobacco, alcohol, opiates). Moreover, factors related to infant's sleep environment such as the prone or side sleeping position and thick coverlet increase the risk of sudden death in infants. Also, the combination of risk factors such as that of prone sleeping position and soft bed mattress are linked to a 20-fold increased risk of death. Finally, polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), viral respiratory infections, long Q-T (responsible for the presence of fatal arrhythmia) are related to the SIDS.
   Literature review indicates that each individual risk factor contributes to the appearance of SIDS and the establishment of certain protective measures for parents and health professionals has reduced its prevalence. But the precise identification of the SIDS causes and how these contribute to the occurrence of sudden death in neonates and infants, remains a challenge for health professionals.

AB Circadian clock controls several physiological processes such as cell proliferation. Extravillous trophoblast proliferation is a tightly regulated function playing a fundamental role in maternal vessel remodeling. We recently demonstrated that clock genes Per2 and Dec1 as well as the clock-controlled genes Dbp and Vegf are rhythmically expressed in human extravillous trophoblast-derived HTR-8/SVneo cells. Analyzing the time course of HTR-8/SVneo cell proliferation, a circadian variation in cell number was found. Moreover, we showed a rhythmic expression of mRNAs for Wee1 and stathmin, two genes involved in cell cycle progression. We suggest that circadian clockwork may orchestrate the functionality of the several factors involved in the control of human trophoblast functions that are fundamental for a successfully pregnancy outcome.

AB Background: Labor results in the release of sensitizing substances such as progesterone, prostaglandins, cytokines and cortisol, some of which have been observed to participate in sleep regulation. We hypothesized that these substances could affect sleep regulation and therefore the amount of volatile agent required to provide general anesthesia for cesarean delivery.
   Methods: A total of 50 patients were enrolled, of whom 25 had uterine activity less than 30 Montevideo units (Prelabor group) and 25 had uterine activity greater than 80 Montevideo units (Labor group). Anesthesia was maintained with 50% oxygen in nitrous oxide with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to sustain a constant Bispectral Index (BIS) value of 40-55. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels were evaluated immediately before cesarean delivery.
   Results: End-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane in the Prelabor group were higher than in the Labor group with similar Bispectral Index values. No significant differences were found in prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Anesthetic requirements for sevoflurane, as measured by Bispectral Index, decrease in laboring versus non-laboring parturients undergoing cesarean delivery. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol do not appear to be responsible for this observation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Pregnancy is associated with alteration in sleep patterns and quality. We wished to investigate whether pregnant women have a higher likelihood of a positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women.
   Methods: Pregnant women ages 18-45 years (n = 4074) presenting for delivery, and non-pregnant women ages 18-45 years (n = 490) presenting for outpatient surgery provided demographic information and completed the Berlin Questionnaire evaluating self-reported snoring and daytime sleepiness. For the pregnant patients, the infant's birth weight and Apgar scores were also recorded.
   Results: Of the 1439 patients with a positive Berlin Questionnaire, 96 were in the non-pregnant control population versus 1343 in the pregnant population (20% vs. 33%, respectively, P < 0.001; odds ratio 2.0 [95% CI: 1.6-2.5]). There was a positive correlation between infant weight and a positive Berlin Questionnaire. The incidence of preeclampsia was greater (odds ratio 3.9) in the pregnant patients with a positive Berlin Questionnaire as compared with the parturients with a negative Berlin Questionnaire (odds ratio 1.1).
   Conclusion: Parturients are more likely to have a positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women. This may indicate an increased likelihood of sleep disordered breathing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up during July and August 2004.
   Results: The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women. In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company, compared to those in the first and second trimesters.
   Conclusion: The lifestyle factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible system is needed for working women that adapts to the physical changes that occur during pregnancy.

TI Gerardo: Asthma and Cultural Beliefs in a Latino Family
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB CASE: Gerardo is an 8-year-old Latino boy who saw his primary care pediatrician with a second asthma exacerbation this year. His frustration with his illness was immediately apparent when he said, "I hate having to go to the nurse's office to take my albuterol!" His mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused to take his prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother hesitated and then admitted that she discontinued the controller medication because she is afraid to "poison his body with so many chemicals." She consistently gave her son the inhaled steroid for 12 months, until care by the allergy specialist was unexpectedly transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the new doctor is "cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician."
   Gerardo is a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the United States to Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of asthma, although his mother fears that she may have contributed to Gerardo's condition. She explained that during pregnancy, she worked cleaning houses where she was exposed to many toxic household cleaners. She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes during pregnancy, she induced her son's asthma.
   Gerardo presented with his first episode of reactive airway disease at 9 months of age. His mother vividly recalled his high temperature, rapid breathing, and their ambulance ride to the hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since. Allergy testing revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a nonallergenic pillow and bed cover.
   Gerardo's mother explained that 3 days before his current exacerbation, he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on a hot day. Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother reported that he was soaked in water and stated, "He knows that he will get sick with asthma if he gets wet!" She recalled that 3 years ago at a friend's birthday party, Gerardo abstained from running through the sprinklers with the other children without instruction from his parents. Since that event, she has trusted Gerardo to care for his "weak lungs." She is frustrated now with his regression in self-care. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 32: 75-77, 2011)

ID YOUNG-ADULTS; DURATION; ASSOCIATION
AB The purpose of this study was to profile sleep patterns during pregnancy according to body mass index (BMI) and to correlate labour outcomes with both BMI and hours sleep. Data were collected from 200 postpartum women detailing sleep characteristics before and during pregnancy. A validated sleep questionnaire was employed, which comprised of questions about sleep apnoea, snoring, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. Descriptive analyses were used. With advancing gestation, the mean (SD) number of hours sleep per night declined: pre-pregnancy 8.1 (SD 1.4); 1st trimester 8.3 (SD 1.8); 2nd trimester 7.7 (SD 1.7) and 3rd trimester 6.7 (SD 2.2). In the 18.5-24.9 BMI group, there was a marked difference in hours sleep per night from pre-pregnancy to 1st (8.6 h, p = 0.007), 2nd (7.9 h, p = 0.023) and 3rd (6.4 h, p = 0.000) trimesters in primiparous women. In the 25-29.9 BMI group, there was a difference from pre-pregnancy to 3rd trimester (p = 0.000). These changes were not reflected in a clinically significant difference in birth weight or mode of delivery.

AB Objectives The goals of this study were to assess: (a) the involvement of fathers and mothers in overall and nighttime infant caregiving; (b) the links between paternal involvement in infant care and infant sleep patterns during the first 6 months. Methods Fifty-six couples recruited during their first pregnancy, participated in the study. After delivery (1 and 6 months), both parents completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. Infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Results Mothers were significantly more involved than fathers in daytime and nighttime caregiving. A higher involvement of fathers in overall infant care predicted and was associated with fewer infant night-wakings and with shorter total sleep time after controlling for breastfeeding. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental sleep research. Future studies should explore mechanisms underlying the relations between paternal involvement and infant sleep.

AB Restless legs syndrome, primary or secondary, is one of the most common movement disorders. The most frequent causes of secondary restless legs syndrome are uremia, anemia, pregnancy, etc. A case is presented of a 77-year-old male with very pronounced restlessness in the legs at night and positive heredity for restless legs syndrome, resulting in continuous insomnia, poor quality of life and depression with suicidal impulses. Examinations ordered by a neurologist verified distinct sideropenic anemia. Upon consultation with a hematologist, substitution therapy with intravenous iron preparation was introduced along with clonazepam, which resulted in complete regression of restless legs syndrome, with significant improvement in sleep quality and thus in the patient's quality of life. Although occurring at a high incidence, this syndrome often remains unrecognized and untreated. Continuous education about the features of this syndrome, its timely recognition, appropriate work-up algorithm and therapeutic guidelines are extremely important to improve the quality of life of patients with restless legs syndrome.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the association of short sleep duration among women in the first year postpartum with adiposity and cardiometabolic status at 3 years postpartum. We studied 586 women in Project Viva, a prospective cohort. At 6 months and 1 year postpartum, women reported the number of hours they slept in a 24-h period, from which we calculated a weighted average of daily sleep. We used multivariable regression analyses to predict the independent effects of short sleep duration (<= 5 h/day vs. >5 h/day) on adiposity, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and adipokines at 3 years postpartum. Women's mean (s.d.) hours of daily sleep in the first year postpartum was 6.7 (0.97) h. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, prepregnancy BMI, and excessive gestational weight gain, we found that postpartum sleep <= 5 h/day was associated with higher postpartum weight retention (beta 1.50 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02, 2.86), higher subscapular + triceps skinfold thickness (beta 3.94 mm; 95% CI: 1.27, 6.60) and higher waist circumference (beta 3.10 cm; 95% CI: 1.25, 4.94) at 3 years postpartum. We did not observe associations of short sleep duration with measures of cardiometabolic status at 3 years postpartum. In conclusion, short sleep duration in the first year postpartum is associated with higher adiposity at 3 years postpartum.

DE Preeclampsia; Obesity; Assymetric dimethylarginine arginine;

AB The incidence of obesity is increasing at an alarming rate. There is compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of preeclampsia about three-fold, and in developed countries is the leading attributable risk for the disorder. In this presentation we explore this relationship and propose targets for future studies guided by the much more extensively studied relationship of obesity to cardiovascular disease. We further address the hypothesis that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, may be one convergence point for the mechanism by which obesity increases the risk of preeclampsia. We conclude with consideration of the clinical implications of this information. (C) 2010 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI ADDICTION AND PREGNANCY: DISPLACEMENT OF THE OBJECT OF ADDICTION TOWARD
   THE NEW-BORN CHILD
SO PSYCHIATRIE DE L ENFANT
LA French
DT Article
DE Addiction; Pregnancy; Proprioception; Dream; Foetus
AB Addictions and pregnancy play the role of operators of transformation in psychic life. Each one offers preliminary adjustments for the movement of regression toward a new mother/child dependance. The study of pregnancy in addicted women poses the problem of a qualitative modification of their dependance. The dependence at play in addiction encounters another dependence which tends to establish itself with the child-to-be. The orientation of psychic work in the direction of objectal dependance is accompanied by a modification of perceptive investment. Addiction is characterized by an absolute dependence on the object of the addiction and by an overinvestment in perception, turned outward. During pregnancy, the wakening of cenesthesic sensations displaces sensorial investment from external sources to internal ones. This displacement could be the source of psychic readjustments activated by the pregnancy. We propose to study this process on the basis of the singular experience of a pregnant woman who is principally dependant on heroin and sleeping pills.

AB Background: Studies have shown that cigarette smoking is associated with sleep disorders in the general population. But studies examining the association between smokeless tobacco use, second-hand smoke exposure and insufficient rest/sleep are limited.
   Methods: We examined the association between smoking, smokeless tobacco use (n = 83,072), second-hand smoke exposure (n = 28,557) and insufficient rest/sleep among adults aged >= 20 years in the state-based 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Exposure to second-hand smoke was defined as >1 day of exposure to cigarette smoking either at home or in the workplace in the preceding 7 days. Insufficient rest/sleep was defined as not getting enough rest/sleep everyday in the preceding 30 days.
   Results: Compared to never smokeless tobacco users, the odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) of insufficient rest/sleep was 1.16 (1.00-1.36) and 1.74 (1.37-2.22) among former and current users. Compared to non-smokers/non-smokeless tobacco users, the OR (95% Cl) of insufficient rest/sleep for those who were both current smokers and current smokeless tobacco users was 2.21 (1.66-2.94). Regarding second-hand smoke exposure among non-smokers, those with second-hand smoke exposure had higher odds for insufficient rest/sleep than those without. In contrast, the odds of insufficient rest/sleep were similar among current smokers with or without second-hand smoke exposure.
   Conclusions: In a multiethnic sample of US adults, compared to non-smokers/non-smokeless tobacco users, those who were both current smokers and current smokeless tobacco users had twice the odds of insufficient sleep. Second-hand smoke exposure was associated with insufficient rest/sleep among non-smokers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Allopregnanolone and related steroids are potent gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-A receptor agonistic allosteric modulators that suppress central nervous system (CNS) activity; in some species, these neurosteroids regulate normal CNS activity before birth. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of suppressing allopregnanolone production on behavioral responses to transient asphyxia in late gestation fetal sheep using the 5 alpha-reductase (R)-2 inhibitor, finasteride. Specificity of the effects of finasteride was assessed by co-infusion of alfaxalone, a synthetic analog of allopregnanolone. Fetal catheters and electrodes for measurement of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) and nuchal electromyogram were implanted at 125 days of gestation, and an inflatable occluder was placed to allow umbilical cord occlusion (UCO). At, similar to 130days of gestation, fetuses received carotid arterial infusion of vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin; 40% w/vol), finasteride (40 mg/kg/h), alfaxalone (5 mg/kg/h), or finasteride + alfaxalone. A further three groups of fetuses were subjected to 5 min UCO at 30 min after the start of each infusion regime. Finasteride treatment alone increased the incidence of arousal-like activity; this was reduced by co-infusion of alfaxalone. After UCO, finasteride treatment caused a prolongation of sub-low voltage (LV) ECoG activity and increase in aberrant ECoG spike activity when compared to vehicle-treated UCO fetuses. After UCO, alfaxalone treatment reduced the incidence of sub-LV, reduced the number of aberrant EEG spikes, and restored ECoG activity to the pattern observed after UCO in vehicle-treated fetuses. These results confirm that neurosteroids significantly modulate normal CNS activity in the late gestation fetus, modify, and limit the effects of asphyxia on the brain.

AB Women are subject to depression during pregnancy in the childbearing age, which is associated with serious complications for the mother, fetus, infant and the family. Its cause is not known. Recently, sleep disorder has been on the focus as causing depression. This study was conducted to determine the relation between sleep disorder and depression during pregnancy. This prospective describe-analytical study was conducted on the population of women admitted hospital of Tamin Ejtemaee in city of Hamedan in west of Iran in 2010. The study sample included161 normal (non depressed confirmed by the beck test) pregnant woman who were selected by convenient non-probability methods. With a gestational age of 28-30 weeks, they were divided into two groups of sleep disorder and normal sleep by The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire. They were homogenized as for the confounders. On 38-40 weeks, sleep disorder was measured again and they completed the beck Questionnaire. 11.4 % of women with normal sleep and 56.2 % of women with sleep disorder (measured on the 28-30 weeks) were found depressed on 38-40 weeks and sleep disorder had increased the chances of depression by 9 times.(p < 0/001) 14.6 % of women with normal sleep and 56.9 % of women with sleep disorder (measured on the 38-40 weeks) were found depressed and sleep disorder had increased the chances of depression by 7 times.(p < 0/001) our findings indicated that sleep quality at early third trimester and late third trimester in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is described by the triad: micro-retrognathia, glossoptosis and upper airway obstruction, associated with U/V-shaped cleft palate. PRS can be shown isolated or aggravated by other syndrome. Prenatal diagnosis is possible from 20th weeks of gestation by ultrasonography and MRI, for parents counseling about possible respiratory distress, feeding problems. A multidisciplinary team approach is mandatory for the treatment of these patients. Several options have been provided, but nowadays no international guidelines exist. Our protocol is based on: low dose CT scan to evaluate micrognathia and upper airway narrowing, polisomnography to register any sleep apnea episodes. Parents are taught to feed children with fractionated meal and to place child in prone position to improve airways space. In severe cases we perform mandibular distraction osteogenesis in order to lengthen mandible. Lastly, patients undergo palatoplasty when they are about 9 months.

AB Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and their child's sleep 4-7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores >= 20 reported more sleep problems in their child, and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring.

DT Article
ID IN-UTERO EXPOSURE; DEPRESSION
AB Objective: This study compared mothers' report of symptoms of discontinuation syndrome in infants exposed to antidepressants both in utero and during lactation to infants who were exposed only during lactation.
   Study Design: This is a convenience sample of 930 women breastfeeding women who answered an online questionnaire about antidepressant use while pregnant and breastfeeding. All 930 women had taken antidepressants while breastfeeding, and 527 had also taken antidepressants during pregnancy. There were no participants in the present study who had taken antidepressants only during pregnancy. The questionnaire was posted on the first author's Medications and Breastfeeding Forum. There was no advertising of this study, nor were efforts made to recruit women into this study beyond posting a notice on the website. The questionnaire included a list of symptoms that mothers may have observed in their infants during the newborn period, as well as demographic questions, and questions about antidepressant use during pregnancy and lactation.
   Results: The majority of women reported that their infants never experienced the symptoms of discontinuation syndrome. Twenty-five percent reported infant irritability. A smaller percentage reported inconsolable crying (17%), low body temperature (14%), and significant problems with eating and sleeping (15%). Logistic regression revealed that mothers who took antidepressants while pregnant and then during breastfeeding were two to eight times more likely to report symptoms of discontinuation syndrome than women who took them only while breastfeeding. Discontinuation symptoms were more likely to occur in infants whose mothers took medications with shorter half-lives.
   Conclusions: Discontinuation syndrome does occur in a small percentage of infants exposed to antidepressants in utero. Mothers reported a higher frequency of discontinuation syndrome after in utero exposure followed by breastfeeding than when infants were exposed to antidepressants only during lactation.

TI Between Sleep and Dreams: Perceptions of "Dreaming Sex with Demons" and
   Female Sexual Frustration in Pre-modern Chinese Medicine
SO BULLETIN OF THE INSTITUTE OF HISTORY AND PHILOLOGY ACADEMIA SINICA
LA Chinese
DT Article
DE pre-modern Chinese medicine; dreaming sex with demons; sexual
   frustration; emotions; physician-patient relationship
AB This article is an attempt to survey the relationship between women's sexual dreams and their erotic thoughts in pre-modern China. It focuses on "dreaming sex with demons" (meng yu gui jiao), an illness represented throughout the history of imperial China. Early Chinese physicians and writers on medicine tended to regard dreams as indicators of attacks upon the body by "(pathogenic) qi." In accordance with this view, dream images were interpreted as metaphors for the functioning of specific qi at certain parts of the body. For example, "dreaming of sex" was read as the result of "deficient qi lodged in the genital organs." However, these naturalistic interpretations of dreams / sexual dreams changed over time, and other explanatory modes, ranging from "depletion and consumption" and "demonic invasion" to "emotional pollution," served to complicate medical theories about dreams in medieval China. As these developments were taking place, Chinese physicians began to focus their attention on nuns, widows, and unmarried women-groups said to suffer from various maladies likely due to sexual frustration and erotic thoughts. The above conceptions of "sexual dreams (with demons)" and female sexual frustration were not combined until the late imperial period, when emotions became increasingly significant to the etiology of medical disorders. In certain cases, "dreaming sex with demons" was even pathologized as the cause of female infertility or false pregnancy-as demonstrated by the concept of "demonic fetuses" (guitai). By examining numerous historical sources and medical cases, the author hopes that this article will shed new light on the subjects of dreams, sex, and female madness in pre-modern Chinese medicine. In addition, the survey conducted in the article suggests that interactions between medical discourses and social values can help to explain why some medical and literary works shared similar attitudes towards cases of "dreaming sex with demons," particularly in late imperial China.

AB Results Hispanic women were overall less educated, less acculturated (p < 0.001 for both) and reported more depressive symptoms, cynicism, perceived stress, and less mistreatment/discrimination than NHCs. Along with D women, PR women reported worse sleep than Cu women (p < 0.01) and more trait anxiety than SA and Cu women (p < 0.01). Yet, PR women were most acculturated (21.4% highly acculturated vs. CA (0.0%), D (4.8%), SA (4.8%) and Cu (2.3%) women; p < 0.001). In regression models, PR women reported depressive symptoms more frequently than D, Cu, or SA women, and reported trait anxiety more frequently than Cu or SA women. Greater acculturation was associated with more favorable psychosocial status, but PR ethnicity was negatively related to psychosocial status.
   Conclusion Psychosocial symptomatology among Hispanic women differs by country of origin and the relatively adverse profile of Puerto Rican women is not explained by acculturation.

AB In many modern societies, the proportion of women who delay childbearing beyond the age of 35 years has increased greatly in recent decades. They are falsely reassured by popular beliefs that advances in new reproductive technologies can compensate for the age-realted decline in fertility, but science cannot beat the biological clock. Age is the single most important determinant of male and female fertility, either natural or treated. The consequences of advancing maternal age are not only for the risk of natural and assisted conception, but also for the outcome of pregnancy. Female fertility has a 'best-before date' of 35, and for men, it is probably before age 45-50.

AB Depressive symptoms in adolescent mothers have been associated with a variety of negative outcomes for both the adolescent mother and her child. The purpose of this article is to describe the dimensions of the Beck Depression Inventory (R)-II and to provide a discussion of how depression may appear in adolescent mothers. This descriptive study involved 45 adolescent mothers in a high school-based parent support program. The average score on the depression inventory for the adolescent mothers was 12.27 (SD = 8.57). One third (n = 15) of the adolescent mothers displayed depressive symptoms. All of the adolescent mothers reported experiencing increased symptoms related to loss of energy, changes in sleep patterns, changes in appetite, and tiredness/fatigue. It is important for nurses working with adolescent mothers to understand that what may be perceived as a normal adaptation to motherhood may in fact be a deeper emotional issue such as depression.

AB The modern living standard has imposed upon society a situation of chronic sleep deprivation. This chronic loss of sleep affects women more than it does men. As a result, the postponement of pregnancy has become a common choice due to the priority given to social and domestic activities. For women, pregnancy represents a condition of intense physical and physiological changes that subject the pregnant woman to a number of potentially stressful situations, ultimately interfering with their quality of sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation, along with the changes imposed on women through pregnancy, can lead to several harmful consequences for the pregnant woman and the child, and can potentially undermine the mother-infant relationship. This article discusses circumstances under which sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality during pregnancy could result in damage to the mother-infant relationship, specifically through maternal fatigue, postpartum depression and changes in pregnancy-related hormonal secretions and activity.

AB Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change as female mammals transition from one reproductive state to another The mechanisms responsible for this plasticity are poorly understood The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contains the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals, and a large portion of its efferent projections terminate in the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPZ) which also plays important roles in rhythm regulation To determine whether these regions might mediate changes in overt rhythms during early pregnancy, we first compared rhythms in Fos and Per2 protein expression in the SCN and vSPZ of diestrous and early pregnant rats main tamed in a 12 12 h light/dark (LD) cycle No differences in the Fos rhythm were seen in the SCN core, but in the SCN shell elevated Fos expression was maintained throughout the light phase in pregnant, but not diestrous, rats In the vSPZ, the Fos rhythm was bimodal in diestrous rats but this rhythm was lost in pregnant Nits Peak Per2 expression was phase-advanced by 4 h in the SCN of pregnant rats, and some differences in Per2 expression were found in the vSPZ as well To determine whether differences in Fos expression were due to altered responsivity to light, we next characterized light induced Fos expression in the SCN and vSPZ of pregnant and diestrous rats in the mid subjective day and night We found that the SCN core of the two groups responded in the same way at each time of day, whereas the rhythm of Fos respondivity in the SCN shell and vSPZ differed between diestrous and pregnant rats These results indicate that the SCN and vSPZ are functionally re organized during early pregnancy, particularly in how they respond to the photic environment These changes may contribute to changes in overt behavioral and physiological rhythms that occur at this time (C) 2010 IBRO Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Background: Children with human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) present with a range of generally non-specific symptoms. Late diagnosis is frequent with often tragic outcomes. Trypanosomes can infect the foetus by crossing the placenta. Unequivocal cases of congenital infection that have been reported include newborn babies of infected mothers who were diagnosed with HAT in the first 5 days of life and children of infected mothers who had never entered an endemic country themselves.
   Methods: This review systematically summarizes the literature on the vertical transmission of HAT, to our knowledge for the first time. To approach the broader aspects of the subject, articles considering the epidemiology of childhood HAT and HAT in pregnancy were also included. The HAT guidelines and technical reports of the World Health Organisation, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, and of one endemic country were reviewed.
   Results: Publications describing congenital HAT are very limited and consist only of single case reports and small case series. Generally it is assumed to be a rare event, but it has never been systematically investigated. In two publications, it is hypothesized that congenital HAT occurs more often than suspected. Not all guidelines and not all HAT literature mention this transmission route.
   Conclusions: The risk of vertical transmission is unknown. Awareness of congenital HAT is insufficient, and as a result opportunities for an early diagnosis in newborns may be missed. All HAT guidelines and local HAT protocols should stress that in endemic areas pregnant women should be systematically checked for HAT and that newborns of HAT infected mothers should be assessed for the disease as soon as possible. Studies on the impact of HAT on fertility and pregnancy and studies on congenital HAT are long overdue.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Brazilian women, with individual diagnostic clinical interviews during the trimesters of pregnancy, and to determine the severity.
   Methods: It was a cross-sectional study. We interviewed 524 pregnant women (18-45 years old) who came to the prenatal outpatient clinic to consult an obstetrician. We used a RLS clinical-diagnostic interview and the International RLS Study Group rating scale (IRLS).
   Results: The prevalence of RLS during pregnancy was 13.5% in our sample, among which 90.1% of the cases started with their symptoms during pregnancy. More than half of the patients (53.5%) presented severe or very severe symptoms and the largest proportion of them (15.2%) were in their third trimester. We did not observe any demographic differences among the trimesters for RLS prevalence and RLS severity.
   Conclusion: RLS during pregnancy is more frequent than in the general population, such that more than half of the pregnant women with RLS present it severely or very severely. It occurs especially in the third trimester. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The functions of the resting state networks (RSNs) revealed by functional MRI remain unclear, but it has seemed possible that networks emerge in parallel with the development of related cognitive functions. We tested the alternative hypothesis: that the full repertoire of resting state dynamics emerges during the period of rapid neural growth before the normal time of birth at term (around 40 wk of gestation). We used a series of independent analytical techniques to map in detail the development of different networks in 70 infants born between 29 and 43 wk of postmenstrual age (PMA). We characterized and charted the development of RSNs from recognizable but often fragmentary elements at 30 wk of PMA to full facsimiles of adult patterns at term. Visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor, default mode, frontoparietal, and executive control networks developed at different rates; however, by term, complete networks were present, several of which were integrated with thalamic activity. These results place the emergence of RSNs largely during the period of rapid neural growth in the third trimester of gestation, suggesting that they are formed before the acquisition of cognitive competencies in later childhood.

AB Background: Migraine has been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints among pregnant migraineurs.
   Methods: A cohort of 1,334 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. At the time of interview we ascertained participants' migraine diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration before and during early pregnancy, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during early pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress associated with a history of migraine.
   Results: Approximately 19.4% of the cohort (n = 259) reported having a medical diagnosis of migraine prior to the study pregnancy. Compared with women without migraine, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CI) among migraineurs for short sleep duration before and during early pregnancy were 1.51 (1.09-2.09), and 1.57 (1.11-2.23), respectively. The corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration before and during pregnancy were 1.33 (0.77-2.31) and 1.31 (0.94-1.83), respectively. A modest and statistically insignificant association between migraine history and excessive daytime sleepiness in early pregnancy was noted (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.94-2.26). Migraineurs had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.52-2.76) and elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.06-2.31). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight migraineurs.
   Conclusions: These data support earlier research documenting increased risks of sleep disorders among migraineurs; and extends the literature to include pregnant women. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent migraine-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the normative course of maternal sleep during the first 4 months postpartum.
   STUDY DESIGN: Sleep was objectively measured using continuous wrist actigraphy. This was a longitudinal, field-based assessment of nocturnal sleep during postpartum weeks 2 through 16. Fifty mothers participated during postpartum weeks 2 through 13; 24 participated during postpartum weeks 9 through 16.
   RESULTS: Maternal nocturnal sleep time was 7.2 (SD +/- 0.95) hours and did not change significantly across postpartum weeks 2 through 16. Maternal sleep efficiency did improve across weeks 2 (79.7%; SD +/- 5.5) through 16 (90.2%; SD +/- 3.5) as a function of decreased sleep fragmentation across weeks 2 (21.7; SD +/- 5.2) through 16 (12.8; SD +/- 3.3).
   CONCLUSION: Though postpartum mothers' total sleep time was higher than expected during the initial postpartum months, this sleep was highly fragmented (similar to fragmenting sleep disorders) and inefficient. This profile of disturbed sleep should be considered in intervention designs and family leave policies.

TI Bed Sharing Among Black Infants and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome:

ID SLEEP POSITION; UNITED-STATES; RACIAL DISPARITY; ENVIRONMENT;
   POPULATION; LIFE; MORTALITY; PARENTS
AB OBJECTIVE: Bed sharing has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and may contribute to the racial disparity seen in infant mortality. It is unclear how bed sharing interacts with other factors to impact SIDS risk. We aimed to measure the effects of bed sharing on risk of SIDS in blacks and to determine whether the risk is modified by other characteristics of the sleep environment.
   METHODS: Characteristics of 195 black infants who died of SIDS were compared with matched controls. The moderating influence of known SIDS risk factors on the effect of bed sharing on risk of SIDS was examined using logistic regression.
   RESULTS: Almost half (47.4%) of the study population bed shared during the last/reference sleep (58% cases and 37% controls). Bed sharing was associated with 2 times greater risk of SIDS compared with not bed sharing. The deleterious effect of bed sharing was more pronounced with a soft sleep surface, pillow use, maternal smoking, and younger infant age. However, bed sharing was still associated with an increased risk of SIDS, even when the infant was not using a pillow or sleeping on a firm surface. The strongest predictors of SIDS among bed-sharing infants were soft sleep surface, nonuse of a pacifier, and maternal smoking during pregnancy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bed sharing is a common practice among black infants. It is associated with a clear and strong increased risk of SIDS, which is even greater when combined with other known risk factors for SIDS. This practice likely contributes to the excess incidence of SIDS among blacks, and culturally competent education methods must be developed to target this high-risk group.

AB Purpose of review
   This article reviews current data on pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy may cause harm, and explores biological pathways for associated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, especially pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes.
   Recent findings
   Accumulating data indicate that snoring and sleep apnea during pregnancy are likely to increase the risk for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Several new studies have observed that sleep-disordered breathing and short sleep duration also increase the risk of gestational diabetes, similar to observations in the general population. There are varying levels of emerging evidence for potential mechanisms, including oxidative stress, increased sympathetic activity and inflammation, adipokine levels and insulin resistance, linking sleep-disordered breathing events during pregnancy to adverse outcomes.
   Summary
   Sleep-disordered breathing and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes share a number of mechanistic pathways, and growing data in pregnant women indicate that snoring and sleep apnea increase the risk of these and other complications for both the mother and the fetus. Nevertheless, direct evidence of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy exerts negative effects remains sparse.

AB Little is known about the effect on the human foetus of long-term and acute exposure to caffeine. We studied the organisation of foetal sleep-wake states in 13 healthy near-term foetuses over a wide range of maternal plasma caffeine concentrations (0-13 mu g/mL) reflecting normal lifestyle conditions (day 0) and again following intake of two cups of regular coffee (similar to 300 mg of caffeine) intermitted by 50 h of abstinence (day 2; acute effects). On either day, 2 h simultaneous recordings were made of foetal heart rate, general- , eye- , and breathing-movements. The recordings were analysed for the presence of each of four foetal behavioural states: quiet-and active-sleep, quiet-and active-wakefulness. There was a linear relationship between maternal caffeine content and the incidence of foetal general movements during active sleep on day 0 (R = 0.74; P < 0.02). After coffee loading on day 2, foetuses of non-or low-caffeine consumers showed increases in active wakefulness (P < 0.001), general movements (P < 0.05) and heart rate variation (P < 0.01) but lower basal heart rate (P < 0.01) compared with their day 0 values. The changes in foetal heart rate (variation) and behaviour occurred between 90 and 180 min post-consumption. In contrast, foetuses of habitual caffeine consumers remained unaffected suggestive of foetal tolerance to caffeine. The results indicate differential performance between foetuses regularly exposed to caffeine and those caffeine-naive, both under normal maternal lifestyle conditions and in response to maternal coffee ingestion.

   We aimed to analyse infant (birth characteristics, feeding type, faecal enzyme activities) and environmental (maternal smoking, nutrition and psychological status, mother-child bonding, family structure, support for the mother, familial atopy) risk factors for infant colic and to follow infants with respect to physical growth, sleeping status up to 8 months of age in a nested case-control study. 660 mothers who delivered at Dr Zekai Tahir Burak Maternity Hospital, were enrolled within 3-72 h post delivery. Each infant with inconsolable persistent crying and four matched infants with no crying episodes were invited by phone to Hacettepe University Ihsan Doramaci Children's Hospital at 30-45 days post partum. At 40-55 days, we examined the infants and gave mothers a questionnaire, including crying characteristics of the infants; 47 infants were diagnosed with colic and 142 as non-colic. When the infants were 7-8 months old, another interview was done. The colic group had higher proportions of less-educated (< 8 years) and smoking mothers, extended family and families with domestic violence than the non-colic group. The colic group of mothers had significantly higher rates of 'impaired bonding' in the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire, higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, higher scores for hostility subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory and a more irregular sleep pattern than the non-colic group. No differences were revealed for faecal enzyme activities. At 7-8 months, the colic group was shorter than the non-colic group. Colic was associated with various perinatal factors (maternal education, smoking habits, cheese consumption, hostility scores and domestic violence) and having colic in infancy negatively affected the sleeping pattern and the height of the infant.

AB Background: Nutrient deficiency during perinatal development is associated with an increased risk to develop obesity, diabetes and hypertension in the adulthood. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental programming of the metabolic syndrome remain largely unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Given the essential role of the hypothalamus in the integration of nutritional, endocrine and neuronal cues, here we have analyzed the profile of the hypothalamus transcriptome in 180 days-old rats born to dams fed either a control (200 g/kg) or a low-protein (80 g/kg) diet through pregnancy and lactation. From a total of 26 209 examined genes, 688 were up-regulated and 309 down-regulated (P<0.003) by early protein restriction. Further bioinformatic analysis of the data revealed that perinatal protein restriction permanently alters the expression of two gene clusters regulating common cellular processes. The first one includes several gate keeper genes regulating insulin signaling and nutrient sensing. The second cluster encompasses a functional network of nuclear receptors and co-regulators of transcription involved in the detection and use of lipid nutrients as fuel which, in addition, link temporal and nutritional cues to metabolism through their tight interaction with the circadian clock.
   Conclusions/Significance: Collectively, these results indicate that the programming of the hypothalamic circuits regulating energy homeostasis is a key step in the development of obesity associated with malnutrition in early life and provide a valuable resource for further investigating the role of the hypothalamus in the programming of the metabolic syndrome.

AB Background: Habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is an important indicator for a number of health problems in children. Compared to adults, large epidemiological studies on childhood habitual snoring and associated predisposing factors are extremely scarce. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of habitual snoring among Chinese school-aged children.
   Methods: A random sample of 20,152 children aged 5.08 to 11.99 years old participated in a cross-sectional survey, which was conducted in eight cities of China. Parent-administrated questionnaires were used to collect information on children's snoring frequency and the possible correlates.
   Results: The prevalence of habitual snoring was 12.0% (14.5% for boys vs. 9.5% for girls) in our sampled children. Following factors were associated with an increased risk for habitual snoring: lower family income (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.46), lower father's education (OR = 1.38 and 1.14 for middle school or under and high school of educational level, respectively), breastfeeding duration < 6 months (OR = 1.17), pregnancy maternal smoking (OR = 1.51), obesity (OR = 1.50), overweight (OR = 1.35), several respiratory problems associated with atopy and infection, such as chronic/allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.94), asthma (OR = 1.43), adenotonsillar hypertrophy (OR = 2.17), and chronic otitis media (OR = 1.31), and family history of habitual snoring (OR = 1.70).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of habitual snoring in Chinese children was similar to that observed in other countries. The potential predisposing factors covered socioeconomic characteristics, environmental exposures, chronic health problems, and family susceptibility. Compared to socioeconomic status and family susceptibility, environmental exposures and chronic health problems had greater impact, indicating childhood habitual snoring could be partly prevented by health promotion and environmental intervention.

AB Study Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in fibromyalgia (FM) and determine the presence and amount of sleep disruption in FM patients with RLS. RLS and FM have been associated in uncontrolled studies using a variety of RLS definitions. We explored this relationship using a cross-sectional study design.
   Methods: FM cases that met the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria were recruited through an academic referral clinic and advertising. Pain- and fatigue-free controls were recruited from the Seattle metropolitan area. We enrolled 172 FM patients (mean age 50 years, 93% female) and 63 pain- and fatigue-free controls (mean age 41 years, 56% female). RLS was ascertained by a self-administered validated diagnostic interview.
   Results: The age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of RLS was higher in the FM group than the control group (33.0%; 95% CI: 25.9, 40.1 vs. 3.1%; 95% Cl: 0.0, 7.4; p = 0.001). Likewise, the FM group was more likely to report RLS (OR = 11.7; 95% Cl: 2.6, 53.0), even after adjusting for age and gender. The mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was higher among FM patients with RLS than those without (11.8 vs. 9.9; p = 0.01) but subjective limb pain measures did not differ between these 2 groups.
   Conclusions: There is a higher prevalence and odds of RLS in those with FM compared to controls. Clinicians should routinely query FM patients regarding RLS symptoms because treatment of RLS can potentially improve sleep and quality of life in these patients.

TI Pitfalls in Chronobiology: A Suggested Analysis Using Intrathecal
   Bupivacaine Analgesia as an Example
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
LA English
DT Article
ID LABOR ANALGESIA; CIRCADIAN CHANGES; DURATION; ROPIVACAINE; SUFENTANIL;
   FENTANYL
AB BACKGROUND: The duration of analgesia from epidural administration of local anesthetics to parturients has been shown to follow a rhythmic pattern according to the time of drug administration. We studied whether there was a similar pattern after intrathecal administration of bupivacaine in parturients. In the course of the analysis, we came to believe that some data points coincident with provider shift changes were influenced by nonbiological, health care system factors, thus incorrectly suggesting a periodic signal in duration of labor analgesia. We developed graphical and analytical tools to help assess the influence of individual points on the chronobiological analysis.
   METHODS: Women with singleton term pregnancies in vertex presentation, cervical dilation 3 to 5 cm, pain score >50 mm (of 100 mm), and requesting labor analgesia were enrolled in this study. Patients received 2.5 mg of intrathecal bupivacaine in 2 mL using a combined spinal-epidural technique. Analgesia duration was the time from intrathecal injection until the first request for additional analgesia. The duration of analgesia was analyzed by visual inspection of the data, application of smoothing functions (Supersmoother; LOWESS and LOESS [locally weighted scatterplot smoothing functions]), analysis of variance, Cosinor (Chronos-Fit), Excel, and NONMEM (nonlinear mixed effect modeling). Confidence intervals (CIs) were determined by bootstrap analysis (1000 replications with replacement) using PLT Tools.
   RESULTS: Eighty-two women were included in the study. Examination of the raw data using 3 smoothing functions revealed a bimodal pattern, with a peak at approximately 0630 and a subsequent peak in the afternoon or evening, depending on the smoother. Analysis of variance did not identify any statistically significant difference between the duration of analgesia when intrathecal injection was given from midnight to 0600 compared with the duration of analgesia after intrathecal injection at other times. Chronos-Fit, Excel, and NONMEM produced identical results, with a mean duration of analgesia of 38.4 minutes (95% CI: 35.4-41.6 minutes), an 8-hour periodic waveform with an amplitude of 5.8 minutes (95% CI: 2.1-10.7 minutes), and a phase offset of 6.5 hours (95% CI: 5.4-8.0 hours) relative to midnight. The 8-hour periodic model did not reach statistical significance in 40% of bootstrap analyses, implying that statistical significance of the 8-hour periodic model was dependent on a subset of the data. Two data points before the change of shift at 0700 contributed most strongly to the statistical significance of the periodic waveform. Without these data points, there was no evidence of an 8-hour periodic waveform for intrathecal bupivacaine analgesia.
   CONCLUSION: Chronobiology includes the influence of external daily rhythms in the environment (e. g., nursing shifts) as well as human biological rhythms. We were able to distinguish the influence of an external rhythm by combining several novel analyses: (1) graphical presentation superimposing the raw data, external rhythms (e. g., nursing and anesthesia provider shifts), and smoothing functions; (2) graphical display of the contribution of each data point to the statistical significance; and (3) bootstrap analysis to identify whether the statistical significance was highly dependent on a data subset. These approaches suggested that 2 data points were likely artifacts of the change in nursing and anesthesia shifts. When these points were removed, there was no suggestion of biological rhythm in the duration of intrathecal bupivacaine analgesia. (Anesth Analg 2010;111:980-5)

AB Objective: This exploratory study examines the role of psychosocial-behavioral variables as predictors of elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) at 14-20 weeks of gestation. Method: One hundred and twenty women were enrolled into the study. Blood samples were collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH. Participants completed questionnaires that included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES) Depression Scale, the Pregnancy-Specific Anxiety (PAS) Scale, the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test, the Brief COPE scale, and questions regarding violence/abuse, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns. Results: Pregnant women with high CRH levels (15 pcg/ml and above) perceived their income to be inadequate, slept more hours at night, stood more hours during the day, and used the coping styles of disengagement or religion but not humor. Logistic regression identified three predictors for high CRH (accounting for 42.2% of the variance): perceived inadequacy of income and the use of ''religion'' and ''disengagement'' to cope with stress. Conclusions: These results are the first known to identify coping style and perceived income inadequacy as predictors of high CRH. Women with perceived inadequacy of income had almost three times the odds for high CRH. Women who used religion or disengagement to cope with stress had 14 times and 7 times the odds for high CRH levels, respectively. Higher CRH levels are associated with preterm birth (PTB). Thus, it may be important to include maternal coping style and perceptions of income inadequacy in future investigations of CRH levels and PTB.

AB The physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose females to develop sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or protect against it. Studies evaluating outcomes of SDB symptoms in pregnancy are scarce. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SDB symptoms in pregnancy and their relationship with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
   A cross-sectional survey of randomly selected immediate postpartum females was performed using the multivariable apnoea prediction index. Record review, including demographics and medical history, was performed. Main outcome measures included pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
   1,000 subjects were recruited. Mean +/- SD age was 29.1 +/- 6.1 yrs. Factors used in the regression analysis included age, body mass index, diabetes, chronic hypertension, multifetal gestations, smoking and renal disease. Snoring was present in 35.1% of subjects. Symptoms of SDB were associated with a higher likelihood of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-4.0), gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4) and unplanned Caesarean deliveries (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2) after multivariable regression analysis. Gasping may have been associated with a higher likelihood of preterm delivery, after adjusting for age and multifetal pregnancies (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) but this association appeared to be mediated by pre-eclampsia.
   Symptoms of SDB are common in pregnancy and associated with a higher likelihood of gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and unplanned Caesarean deliveries.

AB The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops gradually during the prenatal and early postnatal period. In the rat, this period lasts from around the 15th day of gestation until the 10th day of postnatal development. The circadian system of fetuses and newborn pups is entrained mostly by nonphotic maternal cues during prenatal and early postnatal development. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether exposure of pregnant rats to a restricted feeding (RF) regime was able to entrain the circadian clock in the SCN of their fetuses during the prenatal period. The potency of RF as an entraining cue was tested under conditions when pregnant rats were entrained to an external light/dark (LD) cycle as well as under conditions when the external timing signal was lacking, i.e., under constant light (LL). The control groups were fed ad libitum and the experimental groups had restricted access to food for 6 h during their resting time throughout pregnancy. Daily profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression were examined by in situ hybridization in the SCN of 1-day-old pups. The data demonstrated that RF in pregnant rats kept under LD cycle did not notably affect the daily rhythms of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of pups. The SCN profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression did not exhibit circadian rhythms in pups born to mothers maintained in LL and fed ad libitum, likely due to desynchrony among the pups within a litter. However, RF in the pregnant rats kept under LL restored the circadian rhythmicity of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of their newborn pups. The results suggest that the fetal SCN clock is dominantly entrained by rhythmic signals from the maternal SCN. However, under conditions when the rhythmic signaling might be lacking, such as LL, regular food intake of the mothers may also play an important role in synchronization of the fetal SCN clock during prenatal ontogenesis.

AB A host of animal studies have been used to model the effects of exposure to a low protein diet in utero on adult blood pressure. Collection of systolic blood pressure data by the indirect tail-cuff plethysmography method consistently shows increased pressures in low protein exposed rodent offspring compared to controls, but this technique has been criticised as the associated stress artefacts may confound the observed effects. Conversely, radiotelemetry systems allow unrestrained and continuous monitoring of blood pressure through the awake and sleep phases of the diurnal cycle. In this novel study, we directly compared blood pressure parameters in male offspring from low protein and control-fed dams measured simultaneously using tail-cuff and radiotelemetry systems. Control rats showed a good correlation between tail-cuff and radiotelemetry derived blood pressure data. Conversely, low protein males were relatively hypertensive at 8 weeks of age when measured by tail-cuff, but had significantly lower blood pressure than controls at 12 weeks of age when measured by telemetry. Heart rate and length of systole did not differ between the two groups. Individual stress protocols mimicking those imposed by tail-cuff plethysmography (novel environment, heat, restraint, inflation), caused similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate in control and low protein animals, ruling out an effect of enhanced pressor response to stress following prenatal protein restriction. Instead, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance in these animals is considered possible. Such a disparity between central and peripheral blood pressure measurements could have important clinical implications regarding cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment.

AB Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the pathway leading to obesity among women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to examine predictors of moderate (1-10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months postpartum in this population was 9.4 lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7 lb (s.d. = 13.2), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race, employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology.

AB Study Objectives: Because the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring.
   Design: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number of glomeruli per mm(3) were evaluated.
   Measurements and Results: Offspring from SR had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced number of glomeruli per mm3 of renal tissue.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

AB Study Objectives: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Clinic-based study.
   Participants: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women.
   Measurements and Results: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1(st) and 2(nd) trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (<= 6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3(rd) trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3(rd) trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting <= 6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3(rd) trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (>= 10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (< 5 h) and long (>= 10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE.
   Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short and long sleep duration.

AB OBJECTIVES This study aimed to collect data on thermal care practices in rural Ghana to inform the design of a community newborn intervention.
   METHODS All 635 women who delivered in six districts in Ghana in the first 2 weeks of December 2006 were interviewed about immediate newborn care. Qualitative data on thermal care practices and barriers and facilitators to behaviour change were collected from recently delivered/pregnant women, birth attendants/grandmothers, and husband through birth narratives, in-depth interviews and focus group discussion.
   RESULTS Respondents knew that keeping the baby warm was essential for health but 71% of babies born at home had delayed drying, 79% delayed wrapping, 93% early bathing and 10% were placed skin-to-skin. Birth attendants were usually in charge of mother and baby immediately after birth. Delays in drying/wrapping were linked to leaving the baby unattended until the placenta was delivered. Early bathing was linked to reducing body odour in later life, shaping the baby's head, and helping the baby sleep and feel clean. Respondents thought that changing bathing behaviours would be difficult, especially as babies are bathed early in facilities. The concept of skin-to-skin care was easily understood and most women said they would try it if it was good for the baby.
   CONCLUSION Thermal care is a key component of community newborn interventions, the design of which should be based on an understanding of current behaviours and beliefs. Formative research can help select focus behaviours, decide who to include in interventions, ensure consistent messages and determine what messages and approaches are needed to overcome behaviour change barriers.

AB Background: The use of insecticidal bed nets is found to be an effective public health tool for control of malaria, especially for under-five children and pregnant women. BRAC, an indigenous Bangladeshi non-governmental development organization, started working in the East African state of Uganda in June 2006. As part of its efforts to improve the health and well-being of its participants, BRAC Uganda has been distributing long lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLIN) at a subsidized price through health volunteers since February 2008. This study was conducted in March-April 2009 to examine how equitable the programme had been in consistence with BRAC Uganda's pro-poor policy.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Information on possession of LLINs and relevant knowledge on its proper use and maintenance was collected from households either with an under-five child and/or a pregnant woman. The sample included three villages from each of the 10 branch offices where BRAC Uganda's community-based health programme was operating. Data were collected by trained enumerators through face-to-face interviews using a hand-held personal digital assistant (PDA). Findings reveal that the study population had superficial knowledge on malaria and its transmission, including the use and maintenance of LLINs. The households' rate of possession of bed nets (41-59%), and the proportion of under-five children (17-19%) and pregnant women (25-27%) who reported sleeping under an LLIN were not encouraging. Inequity was observed in the number of LLINs possessed by the households, in the knowledge on its use and maintenance, and between the two programme areas.
   Conclusions/Significance: The BRAC Uganda's LLINs distribution at a subsidized price appeared to be inadequate and inequitable, and BRAC's knowledge dissemination is insufficient for initiating preventive actions such as proper use of LLINs to interrupt malaria transmission. Findings contribute to the on-going debate on LLINs distribution in Africa and make a strong case for its free distribution.

TI Does Early Mismatched Nutrition Predispose to Hypertension and

AB Background: A link between early mismatched nutritional environment and development of components of the metabolic syndrome later in life has been shown in epidemiological and animal data. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an early mismatched nutrition produced by catch-up growth after fetal protein restriction could induce the appearance of hypertension and/or atherosclerosis in adult male mice.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Wild-type C57BL6/J or LDLr-/- dams were fed a low protein (LP) or a control (C) diet during gestation. Catch-up growth was induced in LP offspring by feeding dams with a control diet and by culling the litter to 4 pups against 8 in controls. At weaning, male mice were fed either standard chow or an obesogenic diet (OB), leading to 4 experimental groups. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed in conscious unrestrained wild-type mice by telemetry. Atherosclerosis plaque area was measured in aortic root sections of LDLr-/- mice. We found that: (1) postnatal OB diet increased significantly BP (P<0.0001) and HR (P<0.008) in 3-month old OB-C and OB-LP offspring, respectively; (2) that maternal LP diet induced a significant higher BP (P<0.009) and HR (P<0.004) and (3) an altered circadian rhythm in addition to higher plasma corticosterone concentration in 9 months-old LP offspring; (4) that, although LP offspring showed higher plasma total cholesterol than control offspring, atherosclerosis assessed in aortic roots of 6-mo old mice featured increased plaque area due to OB feeding but not due to early mismatched nutrition.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate a long-term effect of early mismatched nutrition on the appearance of hypertension independently of obesity, while no effect on atherosclerosis was noticed at this age.

TI Perioperative Seizures in Patients with a History of a Seizure Disorder
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
LA English
DT Article
ID SERUM-LEVELS; EPILEPSY; RECURRENCE; ROCHESTER; FREQUENCY; MINNESOTA;
   REMISSION
AB BACKGROUND: The occurrence of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder is unclear. There are several factors unique to the perioperative period that may increase a patient's risk of perioperative seizures, including medications administered, timing of medication administration, missed doses of antiepileptic medications, and sleep deprivation. We designed this retrospective chart review to evaluate the frequency of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with a documented history of a seizure disorder who received an anesthetic between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2007. Patients excluded from this study include those who had an outpatient procedure or intracranial procedure, ASA classification of V, pregnant women, and patients younger than 2 years of age. The first hospital admission of at least 24 hours during which an anesthetic was provided was identified for each patient. Patient demographics, character of the seizure disorder, details of the surgical procedure, and clinically apparent seizure activity in the perioperative period (within 3 days after the anesthetic) were recorded.
   RESULTS: During the 6-year study period, 641 patients with a documented seizure disorder were admitted for at least 24 hours after an anesthetic. Twenty-two patients experienced perioperative seizure activity for an overall frequency of 3.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%-5.2%). The frequency of preoperative seizures (P < 0.001) and the timing of the most recent seizure (P < 0.001) were both found to be significantly related to the likelihood of experiencing a perioperative seizure. As the number of antiepileptic medications increased, so did the frequency of perioperative seizures (P < 0.001). Neither the type of surgery nor the type of anesthetic (general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care) affected the frequency of perioperative seizures in this patient population.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the majority of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder are likely related to the patient's underlying condition. The frequency of seizures is not influenced by the type of anesthesia or procedure. Because patients with frequent seizures at baseline are likely to experience a seizure in the perioperative period, it is essential to be prepared to treat seizure activity regardless of the surgical procedure or anesthetic technique.

AB We studied the effects of adverse conditions such as constant light (LL) on the circadian rhythm of malate (MDH, EC 1.1.1.37) and lactate (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) dehydrogenase activities of the testes of male Wistar rats on postnatal day 28 (PN28), anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus-maze test) at PN60 and sexual behavior at PN120. The rats were assigned to mother groups on day 10 of pregnancy: control (12-h light/dark), LL (light from day 10 to 21 of pregnancy), and LL+Mel (LL and sc injection to the mothers of a daily dose of melatonin, 1 mg/kg body weight at circadian time 12, from day 17 to 21 of pregnancy). LL offspring did not show circadian rhythms of MDH (N = 62) and LDH (N = 63) activities (cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher). They presented a 44.7% decrease in open-arm entries and a 67.9% decrease in time (plus-maze test, N = 15, P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test), an increase in mounting (94.4%), intromission (94.5%) and ejaculation (56.6%) latencies (N = 12, P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test) and lower numbers of these events (61, 59 and 73%, respectively; P < 0.01, N = 12) compared to controls. The offspring of the LL+Mel group presented MDH and LDH circadian rhythms (P < 0.05, N = 50, cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher), anxiety-like and sexual behaviors similar to control. These findings supported the importance of the melatonin signal and provide evidence for the protective effects of hormones on maternal programming during gestation. This protective action of melatonin is probably related to its entrainment capacity, favoring internal coupling of the fetal multioscillatory system.

AB This nationwide population-based study was carried out in Taiwan with the aim of comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women who received zolpidem treatment for insomnia during pregnancy with that in women who did not. The adverse outcomes identified and assessed were delivery of low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, preterm deliveries, delivery of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants, delivery of infants with congenital anomalies, and cesarean delivery. The incidences of these were compared between the groups after adjusting for other characteristics of the mothers and infants. The study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Dataset (NHIRD) and birth-certificate registry. In total, the data from 2,497 mothers who received zolpidem treatment during pregnancy and those from 12,485 randomly selected mothers who did not receive the drug were included in the analysis. The results show that the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for adverse pregnancy outcomes-LBW infants, preterm deliveries, SGA infants, and cesarean delivery-were all higher in mothers who received zolpidem treatment during pregnancy, relative to the randomly selected controls (1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-1.64), 1.49 (95% CI = 1.28-1.74), 1.34 (95% CI = 1.20-1.49), and 1.74 (95% CI = 1.59-1.90), respectively). In conclusion, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was higher in women who received zolpidem during pregnancy than in those who did not.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent in perinatal than general samples of women (6-8% vs. 4-5%). To explore potential causes, we examined the symptom profiles of women belonging to two separate samples: a perinatal clinic sample (n = 1581) and a subsample of women in a similar age range from the U. S. National Women's Study (NWS) (n = 2000). Within the perinatal sample, risk ratios were higher for all 17 PTSD symptoms among women with current PTSD compared with unaffected women, suggesting that higher rates are not likely due to measurement error. The younger age and greater social disadvantage in the perinatal clinic sample contributed only a small proportion of variance in symptom levels compared with extent of trauma exposure and pre-existing PTSD. Compared with the national study sample's symptom profile, the perinatal sample had higher rates of occurrence of five symptoms: detachment, loss of interest, anger and irritability, trouble sleeping, and nightmares. This analysis confirms that PTSD rates are higher in perinatal samples, which is likely due to exacerbation of pre-existing PTSD among women of a younger age and greater social disadvantage. Further elucidation is warranted, including identifying triggers and determining if there are needs for pregnancy-specific interventions.

AB Bariatric surgery is intended for subjects with BMI >= 40 kg/m(2) or >= 35 kg/m(2) with comorbidities. In any case, the indication con only be envisaged in patients who have had access to specialized medical core, and agree with a prolonged medical follow-up.
   After 60 years old, physiological age and comorbidities need to be highly considered.
   In genetic obesity and craniopharyngioma, surgery is exceptional.
   Main contraindications consist in severe disorders in feeding be non-stabilized psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug addiction, inability to participate in prolonged medical follow-up.
   Surgical process includes many important stages: preparation and information by a multidisciplinary team (identify contraindication, give optimal information, look for and treat comorbidities [as sleep apneoas syndrome, diabetes, cardiopulmonary disease], assess nutritional and psychological status and feeding behaviour); the decision of intervention during a concerted analysis by a multidisciplinary team; follow-up (for life) led to screen for nutritional deficiencies and surgical complications, to reinforce diet and physical activity counselling, to adopt to new situations (as pregnancy), and advise psychological care if necessary.

Healthy nulliparous women with a normal pregnancy, spontaneous onset of active labor at term, and a cervical dilatation of 4 cm or more on admission to the delivery ward (n = 2,072). Methods. The women were asked to answer questions concerning their food and fluid intake, amount of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours and to assess their labor pain, sense of security and expectations of the childbirth on a visual analog scale (VAS). Duration and intervals of contractions, cervical dilatation, and position of the fetal head were noted by the midwife. A multiple regression analysis was performed with active labor duration as the outcome variable. Main outcome measure. Predictive factors of active labor duration. Results. Normal food intake during the preceding 24 hours was associated with short labor duration. A long latent phase, low levels of assessed labor pain and few hours of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours were significant independent predictors of extended active labor duration, when high birth weight, long contraction intervals, slight cervical dilatation, intact membranes within 2 hours of admission, high maternal age and malposition of the fetal head were controlled for. Conclusion. New findings are that latent phase duration as well as food intake and the amount of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours are independent predictors of labor duration.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the impact of short sleep duration (SSD) and frequent snoring (FS) on glucose metabolism during pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of healthy nulliparas who participated in a sleep survey study. SSD was defined as <7 hours of sleep per night and FS, as snoring >= 3 nights per week. Outcomes included 1-hour oral glucose tolerance results and the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 189 women participated; 48% reported an SSD and 18.5% reported FS. SSD and FS were associated with higher oral glucose tolerance values: SSD (116 +/- 31 vs 105 +/- 23; P=.008) and FS (118 +/- 34 vs 108 +/- 25; P=.04). Both SSD (10.2% vs 1.1%; P=.008) and FS (14.3% vs 3.3%; P=.009) were associated with a higher incidence of GDM. Even after controlling for potential confounders, SSD and FS remained associated with GDM.
   CONCLUSION: SSD and FS are associated with glucose intolerance in pregnancy.

AB Aims:
   To determine risk factors for miscarriage.
   Methods:
   A case control study was carried out at the gynaecological wards and antenatal clinics of the De Soysa Maternity Hospital in Sri Lanka. A case was defined as that of mothers with a confirmed diagnosis of partial or full expulsion of the fetus during the first 28 weeks of gestation. Controls comprised ante-natal clinic attendees whose period of gestation was < 28 weeks and carrying a viable fetus. Two hundred and thirty cases and 504 controls were selected. A pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire and modified life events inventory were used to gather data. Multivariate logistic regression was applied separately for first and second trimester miscarriages and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and as 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
   Results:
   Sleeping < 8 h/day (OR:3.80, 95%CI:1.01-14.3) was found to be a risk factor for first trimester miscarriage controlling for the effect of period of gestation. Sleeping < 8 h/day (OR:2.04, 95%CI:1.24-3.37), standing < 3 h/day (OR:1.83, 95%CI:1.08-3.10), exposure to cooking smoke (OR:3.83, 95%CI:1.50-9.90) and physical trauma during the pregnancy (OR:43.2, 95%CI:4.55-411.4) were found to be risk factors for second trimester miscarriage controlling for the effect of period of gestation.
   Conclusions:
   Sleep deprivation, a sedentary lifestyle, exposure to cooking smoke and physical trauma during pregnancy were risk factors for miscarriage. Most of the risk factors are therefore modifiable.

   DEPRESSION; MOOD
AB Objectives:
   Psychotic disorders have a high rate of relapse in the postpartum period for reasons that are unclear, but may be related to changes in sleep patterns that occur during pregnancy and after birth. Understanding of the influence of sleep on postpartum psychosis presentation is limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in sleep/wake activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with a history of psychosis.
   Methods:
   Women with a history of bipolar disorder and/or postpartum psychosis (HxW) were recruited (n = 23) together with a control population (CtW) (n = 15). Data on demographic and psychosocial factors, mental health status, and sleep/wake activity were collected at seven timepoints-the last week of each trimester of pregnancy and four times during the postpartum (weeks 1, 4, and 8, and at month 6). Longitudinal data were analysed using an HLM version 6 repeated-measures multilevel model.
   Results:
   No significant differences were noted in sleep/wake activity between HxW and CtW. None of the HxW who were taking a mood stabilizer during their pregnancy, including at delivery, relapsed during the study. Of those taking an antidepressant or antipsychotic, or no medication, 3 relapsed within the first six months and 2 within the first two months. HxW were more likely to report a poor partner relationship than CtW.
   Conclusion:
   Results suggest that during the perinatal period, there is no difference in sleep/wake activity in women with a history of a psychotic disorder. Use of mood stabilizer during pregnancy and at delivery appears important in preventing psychotic relapse in the postpartum.

AB Objective
   To determine the functional development of children born after treatment of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension with labetalol versus methyldopa, and no antihypertensive treatment.
   Design
   Historical cohort study.
   Setting
   Twelve Dutch hospital departments of obstetrics.
   Population
   Live-born children born in these hospitals and prenatally exposed to labetalol, methyldopa, or bed rest because of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension.
   Methods
   Central nervous system development was measured with standard tests at 4-10 years of age. Linear regression techniques and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to compare the groups with regard to the outcome measures.
   Main outcome measures
   Intelligence quotient (IQ), concentration, motor development, and behaviour at primary school age.
   Results
   A total of 202 children were included in the analyses. More children exposed to labetalol had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than those exposed to methyldopa (OR 2.3; 95% CI 0.7-7.3), or those born to women who had been admitted for bed rest (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.2-13.9). Sleeping problems seemed to be reported more frequently after prenatal methyldopa exposure than after exposure to labetalol (OR 3.2; 95% CI 0.6-16.7) or bed rest (OR 4.5; 95% CI 0.9-23.2), although the differences were not statistically significant. Test scores on other aspects of functional development did not differ between the three groups.
   Conclusions
   In this hypothesis-generating study, labetalol exposure in utero seemed to increase the risk of ADHD among children of primary school age, whereas prenatal methyldopa exposure might influence sleep. Further studies with appropriate sample sizes are warranted to determine the long-term effects of antihypertensive medications.

AB Objective To develop and validate a prediction model for psychosocial problems in preadolescence using data on early developmental factors from routine Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH).
   Study design The data come from the 1692 participants who take part in the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal study. Information on early developmental factors (ages 0 to 4 years) was collected from the PCH file. Parents complete the Child Behavior Checklist when their child is age 11. To examine the predictive value of PCH-registered developmental factors on preadolescent problems, several multiple logistic regression analysis were performed, in a derivation sample (n = 1058). The predictive performance of the models was then assessed with area under the curve (AUC) in a validation sample (n = 643) to evaluate the validity of these models.
   Results PCH-registered behavioral problems, attention/hyperactivity problems, enuresis, education level of the father, and being male were found to significantly predict externalizing problems (odds ratios [OR] between 1.4 and 3.7). Internalizing problems were predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, sleep problems, and being male (ORs between 1.7 and 3.0). The model for externalizing problems had a modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.72). However, for internalizing problems the AUC was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.60), indicating poor discriminatory power.
   Conclusions Findings on early development as registered by PCH are modestly predictive for externalizing problems in preadolescents, but only slightly for internalizing problems. (J Pediatr 2010;157:316-21).

AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension ((IIH) is characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure of unknown cause. It is predominantly a disease of women in the childbearing years. Although the cause of IIH remains obscure, it has become clear that loss of visual function is common and patients may progress to blindness if untreated. Diagnosis should adhere to the modified Dandy criteria and other causes of intracranial hypertension sought IIH patient management should include serial perimetry and optic disc grading or photography The proper therapy can then be selected and visual loss prevented or reversed Although there are no evidence-based data to guide therapy, there is an ongoing randomized double-blind controlled treatment trial of IIH investigating diet and medical therapy.

AB Maternal circadian information has been reported to play an important role in fetal physiology and development. Hormones and nutrition have been mainly investigated as circadian cues from mother to fetus. However, the influences of circadian properties of the pregnant reproductive organs on fetuses have not been fully investigated. To gain an insight on the circadian functions of the reproductive organs, we examined molecular clocks in the pregnant rat uterus and placenta. By using a Period1-luciferase (Per1-luc) rat, whose tissues express luciferase corresponding to activation of Period1, a "key clock gene", we examined the uterus clock during non-pregnancy, on embryonic day 12 (E12), and on E22 (the end of pregnancy) in a light-dark (LD) cycle and constant darkness (DD). By in situ hybridization we further explored Pen l mRNA rhythms in the placenta on E12 and E22. The uterus in vitro showed clear circadian Per1-luc rhythms both in and out of pregnancy, having peaks at around the time corresponding to dusk in LD. Likewise, in DD, the uterus in vitro had the same Per1-luc rhythms. The decidua in LD showed circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms, peaking during night 6 h after dusk, while the decidua in DD showed the same Per1 mRNA rhythms only on E22. In contrast, the labyrinth showed no circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms in LD or DD during pregnancy. These results suggest that the uterus and decidua, a maternally-originated tissue of the placenta, but not the labyrinth, a fetus-originated tissue of the placenta, can provide the fetus with circadian information.

   ANXIETY; BIRTH
AB Background: Universal interventions to prevent postnatal mental disorders in women have had limited success, perhaps because they were insufficiently theorised, not gender-informed and overlooked relevant risk factors. This study aimed to determine whether an innovative brief psycho-educational program for mothers, fathers and first newborns, which addressed salient learning needs about infant behaviour management and adjustment tasks in the intimate partner relationship, prevented postpartum mental health problems in primiparous women.
   Methods: A before and after controlled study was conducted in primary care in seven local government areas in Victoria, Australia. English-speaking couples with one-week old infants were invited consecutively to participate by the maternal and child health nurse at the universal first home visit. Two groups were recruited and followed sequentially: both completed telephone interviews at four weeks and six months postpartum and received standard health care. Intervention group participants were also invited to attend a half-day program with up to five couples and one month old infants, facilitated by trained, supervised nurses. The main outcome was any Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) diagnosis of Depression or Anxiety or Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, Anxiety, or Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood in the first six months postpartum. Factors associated with the outcome were established by logistic regression controlling for potential confounders and analysis was by intention to treat.
   Results: In total 399/646 (62%) women were recruited; 210 received only standard care and 189 were also offered the intervention; 364 (91%) were retained at follow up six months postpartum. In women without a psychiatric history (232/364; 64%), 36/125 (29%) were diagnosed with Depression or Anxiety or Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, Anxiety, or Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood in the control group, compared with 16/107 (15%) in the intervention group. In those without a psychiatric history, the adjusted odds ratio for diagnosis of a common postpartum mental disorder was 0.43 (95% CI 0.21, 0.89) in the intervention group compared to the control group.
   Conclusions: A universal, brief psycho-educational group program for English-speaking first time parents and babies in primary care reduces de novo postpartum mental disorders in women. A universal approach supplemented by an additional program may improve effectiveness for women with a psychiatric history.

   PREGNANCY
AB Background: Household ownership of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) is increasing, and coverage targets have been revised to address universal coverage with ITNs. However, many households do not have enough nets to cover everyone, and the nets available vary in physical condition and insecticide treatment status. Since 2004, the Government of Tanzania has been implementing the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme (TNVS), which distributes vouchers for ITNs through antenatal clinics to target pregnant women and their infants. This analysis aimed to determine the following: (1) coverage patterns of bed nets within households according to physical condition and treatment status; (2) who might be at risk if mosquitoes were diverted from occupants of untreated nets to those not using nets? (3) the degree to which those at highest risk of malaria use the most protective nets.
   Methods: Data from the 2006 TNVS household survey were analysed to assess within-household distribution of net use. The associations between net characteristics and net user were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis was applied to the relationship between the number of holes per net and user characteristics while adjusting for confounders.
   Results: In households with a net: person ratio better than 1: 4 (one net for every four household members), more than 80% of the people in such households reported using a net the previous night. ITNs were most likely to be used by infants, young children (1-4 y), and women of childbearing age; they were least likely to be used by older women (>= 50 y), older children (5-14 y), and adult men. The nets used by infants and women of childbearing age were in better-than-average physical condition; the nets used by older women and older children were in worse-than-average condition; while young children and adult men used nets in intermediate (average) condition. When adjusted for confounders, the nets used by young and older children had more holes than nets used by infants.
   Conclusions: Infants and other vulnerable groups were most likely to sleep under the most protective nets. Nevertheless, more communication efforts are needed to increase use of intact ITNs within households for children. Further research is necessary to fully understand motivations influencing within-household net distribution.

   MATER-UNIVERSITY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; PREGNANCY; PARENT; LIFE
AB Background: Little research has examined the associations between early sleep problems and attention problems over several developmental periods.
   Aims: To examine whether sleep problems in infancy and early childhood are independently related to attention difficulty at Sand 14 years, and to the continuity of attention difficulties from 5 to 14 years.
   Study design: The study was a prospective, population-based birth cohort study.
   Subjects: 7223 women who delivered a live, singleton child between 1981 and 1983 were recruited at the first antenatal visit. Of these, 4204 had complete information on all key measures.
   Outcome measures: Attention problems were assessed with items from the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and were classified as adolescent onset (i.e. problems at 14 but not at 5): early remitter (problems at 5, no problem at 14); and persistent (i.e. at both 5 and 14).
   Results: At 6 months, sleep problems 'sometimes' were associated with the early remitter group in boys. For sleep problems between 2 and 4 years of age, findings were generally similar for boys and girls with strong associations with adolescent attention. Sleep problems 'often' were independently associated with early remitter and persistent attention problems, and 'sometimes' with early remitter and adolescent onset attention problems.
   Conclusions: Sleep problems in early childhood are an indicator of subsequent attention problems that may persist into adolescence. Whether these associations are causal requires further research, however their presence provides an opportunity for early intervention and monitoring.

AB Objectives.-
   To provide a guide to the use and limitations of continuous opioid therapy (COT, or daily scheduled opioids) for refractory daily headache, based on the best available evidence and expert clinical experience.
   Background.-
   There has been a dramatic increase in opioid administration over the past 25 years, with limited evidence of efficacy for either pain reduction or increased function, and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including headache chronification. To date, there has been no consensus on headache-specific guidelines for selecting patients for COT, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring.
   Methods.-
   A multidisciplinary committee of physicians and allied health professionals with extensive experience and expertise in the administration of opioids to headache patients, undertook a review of the available evidence from the research and clinical literature (using the PubMed database for articles through December 2009) to develop headache-specific treatment recommendations. This guide reflects the opinions of its authors and is not an official document of the American Headache Society.
   Results.-
   The guide identifies factors that would qualify or disqualify the use of COT, including, determination of intractability prior to initiating COT, requisite experience of the prescriber, and requirements for a formal monitoring system to assess appropriate use, safety, efficacy, and functional impact. An appendix reviews the available evidence for efficacy of COT in chronic headache and noncancer pain, paradoxical effects (opioid-induced hyperalgesia, medication overuse headache, opioid-related reduction in triptan and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy), other adverse effects (nausea and constipation, insomnia and sleep apnea, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death, reductions in sex hormones, issues during pregnancy, neurocognitive functioning), and issues related to comorbid psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions.-
   Only a select and very limited group (estimate of 10-20%) of refractory headache patients who meet criteria for COT respond with convincing headache reduction and functional improvement over the long-term. Conservative and empirically based guidelines will help identify those patients for whom a COT trial may be appropriate, while protecting their welfare and safety.

AB Purpose: Mandibular retrognathia may cause upper airway obstruction in the pediatric patient due to tongue collapse and physical obstruction in the hypopharyngeal region. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management.
   Patients and Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis.
   Results: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis.
   Conclusion: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth. (C) 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons J Oral Maxillofac Surg 68:1512-1523, 2010

AB Britain has a unique experience of national longitudinal birth cohorts, but the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children differed in two major respects it was based in one area rather than being a national sample, and it started in pregnancy rather than at birth or later in the first year. This paper outlines a personal selection of 10 topics, highlighting results from some of the 400+ papers that have already been published from this study. It indicates in particular how many childcare and domestic fashions were neither of benefit to the children (or their parents), the importance of pregnancy in regard to childhood conditions and the likely dangers of some common chemicals, whether in medications or domestic products.

AB Background: Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) are important means of malaria prevention. Although there is consensus regarding their importance, there is uncertainty as to which delivery strategies are optimal for dispensing these life saving interventions. A targeted mass distribution of free LLINs to children under five and pregnant women was implemented in Zanzibar between August 2005 and January 2006. The outcomes of this distribution among children under five were evaluated, four to nine months after implementation.
   Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in May 2006 in two districts of Zanzibar: Micheweni (MI) on Pemba Island and North A (NA) on Unguja Island. Household interviews were conducted with 509 caretakers of under-five children, who were surveyed for socio-economic status, the net distribution process, perceptions and use of bed nets. Each step in the distribution process was assessed in all children one to five years of age for unconditional and conditional proportion of success. System effectiveness (the accumulated proportion of success) and equity effectiveness were calculated, and predictors for LLIN use were identified.
   Results: The overall proportion of children under five sleeping under any type of treated net was 83.7% (318/380) in MI and 91.8% (357/389) in NA. The LLIN usage was 56.8% (216/380) in MI and 86.9% (338/389) in NA. Overall system effectiveness was 49% in MI and 87% in NA, and equity was found in the distribution scale-up in NA. In both districts, the predicting factor of a child sleeping under an LLIN was caretakers thinking that LLINs are better than conventional nets (OR = 2.8, p = 0.005 in MI and 2.5, p = 0.041 in NA), in addition to receiving an LLIN (OR = 4.9, p < 0.001 in MI and in OR = 30.1, p = 0.001 in NA).
   Conclusions: Targeted free mass distribution of LLINs can result in high and equitable bed net coverage among children under five. However, in order to sustain high effective coverage, there is need for complimentary distribution strategies between mass distribution campaigns. Considering the community's preferences prior to a mass distribution and addressing the communities concerns through information, education and communication, may improve the LLIN usage.

AB Study Objectives: Recent evidence has suggested that low socioeconomic status (SES), race, prematurity, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are associated with childhood sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We investigated (1) the association of SDB with a wide range of risk factors, including prenatal and perinatal complications; (2) the association of these complications with SES and race; and (3) the association of SDB with developmental milestones.
   Methods: Six hundred thirteen school-aged children (105 clinically referred and 508 community control subjects) underwent overnight polysomnography and had a complete history and physical examination. A comprehensive child development questionnaire was completed by a parent. We compared clinically referred children with SDB to population-based control children without SDB from The Penn State Children's Cohort.
   Results: Maternal smoking during pregnancy; maternal age and weight gain during pregnancy; prenatal complications, such as maternal high blood pressure and gestational diabetes; perinatal complications related to prematurity; delayed motor milestones; race and SES were significantly associated with the presence of childhood SDB. Most of the risk factors became nonsignificant when analyses controlled for race and SES. Delayed motor milestones remained significantly associated with SDB after controlling for race and SES.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that there is a significant association between children who experience prenatal or perinatal distress and the development of moderate to severe childhood SDB. SES and race may be mediating the impact on SDB through increased prenatal and perinatal risks. The significant delay in motor milestones suggests that prenatal and perinatal distress may result in neurologic insult, which could influence the development of SOB in later childhood.

AB OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves episodic nocturnal apneas. Using polysomnography, we examined the predictive capacity of screening questionnaires (Berlin) in pregnancy. Incorporating simultaneous fetal heart rate monitoring (FHM), we examined the association of maternal apnea with FHM abnormalities.
   STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 100 pregnant women at 26-39 weeks of gestation with OSA screening and baseline data ascertainment who underwent polysomnography and FHM for >= 3 hours. The relationship between maternal characteristics, OSA, and FHM was explored with multivariate analyses that were controlled for potential confounders.
   RESULTS: When compared with polysomnography, sensitivity and specificity by Berlin screening was 35% and 63.8%, respectively; the snoring component of the Berlin correlated better with oxygen desaturation <95% (P = .003). Body mass index was a significant confounder (r(s) = 0.44; P < .0001). No association was observed between FHM abnormalities and OSA parameters.
   CONCLUSION: In pregnancy, the Berlin questionnaire poorly predicts OSA. It is unclear whether fetal compromise during maternal apnea is a mechanism in OSA that is related to pregnancy outcome.

AB The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women (n = 245) completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester. Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed.

AB Changes in circadian rhythms of dROMs, Oxy-ads and SHp during reproductive stages were studied in Comisana ewes. Twelve ewes were divided in two equal groups. The experimental group consisted of ewes undergoing gestation and lactation following artificial insemination and the control group consisted of non-pregnant ewes. Blood samples were collected every 3 h over a 24 h period, 20 days before insemination, on days 100 and 140 of pregnancy, on days 10, 30 and 200 post-partum and during the dry period. In the control group, blood samples were collected on the same days and with the same procedures as those used for the experimental group. A significant effect of time on all parameters studied was observed in the experimental group. Daily rhythms of the parameters studied were observed in the control group in all experimental conditions, and in the experimental group during pre-pregnancy and dry periods. We conclude that the reproductive status of sheep affects oxidative stress markers in blood and their circadian rhythms.

AB Introduction. - This article is a review of literature data concerning the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed pregnant women.
   Literature findings. - The adverse effects for the foetus, the newborn and the child were evaluated. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy is of around 10 to 20% of the population of childbearing women. Depression is often misdiagnosed and underestimated in pregnant women. Starting a pharmacological treatment for depression in these women is not easy because data concerning the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy are still unclear. The non-treated pathology is associated with higher risk of maternal morbidity, including arterial hypertension, which could lead to preeclampsia or eclampsia, ideation and suicide attempts, and postpartum depression. Foetal development is also affected and adverse outcomes such as prematurity, tow birth weight, irritability, and sleep disorders are frequent. Pharmacological therapy is necessary when non-pharmacological treatment is insufficient. Suicide attempts and relapse of depression have been described when depressive women stopped their pharmacological treatment during pregnancy. Pregnant women diagnosed with depression must be treated. Selective SSRIs are now largely used in this pathology and have replaced tricyclic antidepressants because of fewer side effects. In general, drugs have a low teratogenic potential, only 4 to 5% of malformations are iatrogenic. Teratogenic risk is high between conception until the end of the second month of gestation. Safety of SSRIs treatment during pregnancy and potential risk for the foetus and newborn were unquestioned before publication, in the late 2005, of some alarming data concerning a possible teratogenic effect. Studies showed an increased risk for all congenital malformations with SSRIs and particularly with paroxetin. A few studies after 2005 have also found an association between prenatal exposure to SSRIs (especially paroxetin) and congenital malformations. However, other studies failed to demonstrate this association and the risk for cardiovascular malformations also does not seem to be significantly increased. Numerous studies in pregnant women have shown that SSRI treatments are associated with a significant increase of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy has been associated with a three-fold increased risk of neonatal behavioural syndrome, including signs of withdrawal or serotonin impregnation. Restlessness, poor tone, respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia were the most frequent signs. These symptoms occur during the first days of life and are usually brief and not serious. Recent studies have also documented an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and cases of cerebral haemorrhage have been described. Data concerning a possible effect on motor and cognitive development at school age in children prenatally exposed to SSRIs are limited.
   Discussion. - Although a number of studies revealed that SSRIs are not teratogenic, some of them showed congenital malformations associated with use of these antidepressants; in particular an increased risk of cardiac defects with paroxetin. In practice, the potential risk implies that the decision to treat a pregnant woman with SSRIs (notably paroxetin) should be taken carefully; this means double-checking the diagnosis, the potential benefits, adverse effects and possible alternatives. Neonatal toxicity seems to be relatively frequent when SSRIs are prescribed during late pregnancy. For all depressed pregnant women, the severity of the depression must be taken into consideration before introducing a pharmacological treatment. When depressive women are already treated, studies have shown that antidepressants must be maintained during pregnancy to prevent relapse and suicide attempts. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2009.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between pregnancy physical discomforts experienced during the second trimester and late pregnancy depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effect of sleep quality on antenatal depressive symptomatology. Healthy pregnant women (N=257) completed the Physical Symptoms Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Inventory at early-mid second trimester, and then again at late third trimester. Physical symptoms and sleep quality at the first time point were both correlated moderately with depressive symptoms at late pregnancy. Discomfort associated with physical symptoms was a better predictor of depressive symptoms than Frequency of symptoms, although a score combining Frequency, Discomfort and Effect of symptoms on life was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses of the mediation model indicated that physical symptoms at early-mid second trimester predicted depressive symptoms in the last trimester both directly, and via poor sleep quality (prospectively), which mediated the relationship. The clinical implications of these findings for antenatal care are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: to explore the strategies used by women to manage fatigue in the first six months following child birth.
   Design: a qualitative study using an exploratory descriptive design. Data were collected using open-ended questions contained in surveys posted to participants six, 12 and 24 weeks after birth.
   Setting: Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.
   Participants: 59 well women, 27 primipara and 32 multipara, aged 20-40 years, who gave birth in the Australian Capital Territory.
   Findings: three themes emerged from the analysis: 'Looking after me' or self-care practices; 'Managing the load' or balancing the work to bed one with the aim of managing the woman's fatigue; and 'How it worked', describing how useful the strategies had been in managing fatigue. From six weeks to six months, the women used self-care strategies (sleep/rest, relaxing, conserving energy) more often than strategies designed to manage the load (getting help, planning, lowering expectations). Most multiparas (24/32) conserved energy to manage fatigue, in contrast to primiparas (13/27). Women experiencing high fatigue conserved energy more often than women who were experiencing less fatigue. No differences in strategy choice were found between women who experienced a vaginal birth and those who had experienced a caesarean birth, or between those women who scored >= 13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as opposed to those who scored <13. Overall, women rated their chosen strategies as very useful or useful. Womens' comments also indicated that getting help from partners and family was sometimes difficult, reducing the usefulness of this strategy.
   Implications for practice: preparing women and their partners to manage postnatal fatigue more effectively is essential. Midwives should encourage women to identify sources of help and what particular help that individual could provide. Scenarios should be used in parenting classes to encourage women and their partners to negotiate issues surrounding the sharing of responsibilities after birth. After birth, ongoing assessment of fatigue and the strategies used to manage it is essential beyond the first six weeks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Migrainous women note a significant improvement in their headaches during pregnancy. However, persistent or residual attacks need to be treated, keeping in mind that many drugs have potential dangerous effects on embryo and foetus. It is evident, therefore, that hygiene and behaviour measures capable of ensuring the best possible well-being (regular meals and balanced diet, restriction of alcohol and smoking, regular sleeping pattern, moderate physical exercise and relaxation) are advisable during pregnancy. Among non-pharmacological migraine prophylaxis only relaxation techniques, in particular biofeedback, and acupuncture have accumulated sufficient evidence in support of their efficacy and safety. Some vitamins and dietary supplements have been proposed: the prophylactic properties of magnesium, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 are probably low, but their lack of severe adverse effects makes them good treatment options.

   PARADOX
AB Using data from the national linked birth/infant death cohort files, we examined race/ethnicity/nativity disparities and changes in infant mortality due to the five leading causes of infant death between 1989 and 2001. Our results indicate substantial decreases in infant mortality from three causes (congenital anomalies, sudden infant death syndrome, and respiratory distress syndrome) for which specific perinatal health innovations emerged or were expanded. However, for these three causes, the relative disparities in infant mortality between infants born to U.S.-born black women as compared to infants of U.S.-born white women increased following the introduction (or expansion) of beneficial interventions. Among infants of U.S.-born Mexican American mothers, the findings differed. In the static comparisons, our results show the often-reported similarity in the risk of death of these babies compared to those born to non-Hispanic white mothers. However, when changes over time were modeled, there was an erosion of the relatively favorable survival chances of Mexican American infants. Our models show little change in the relative risk of death for infants of immigrant women. Regarding the other two causes (disorders relating to short gestation and unspecified low birth weight and maternal complications) for which no efficacious innovations occurred, either little change or actual increases in risks were observed. Future studies and health policy efforts should be geared toward further understanding and aggressively working to close infant mortality gaps, especially for infants of U.S.-born black mothers-an effort that will be facilitated by research focused on cause-specific infant mortality.

AB Obesity carries a unique disease burden on women and is influenced by a variety of biological, hormonal, environmental, and cultural factors. Reproductive transitions, such as pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk for obesity. Psychologically, obese women experience greater weight-related stigma and discrimination and are at increased risk for depression than obese men. Women are also particularly susceptible to psychological stress, sleep debt, and lack of physical activity, all of which are risk factors for the development of excess weight. Obesity risk is increased among women with psychiatric disorders and those who use certain psychotropic medications. Obesity treatment should take into consideration degree of obesity, health risks, past weight loss attempts, and individual differences in motivation and readiness for treatment.

AB Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and social behavior deficits in adolescents and adults that have experienced prenatal exposure to adverse conditions. This study investigated whether sleep deprivation during the preimplantation stage of development alters the physiological, behavioral and oxidative metabolic processes in adult male mouse offspring. One group of dams was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for 6 h on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3). After sleep deprivation, homocysteine, cysteine, corticosterone, estrogen and progesterone concentrations were measured from the experimental mothers and time-matched controls. The sizes and weights of the male pups were measured at various stages throughout the experiment. At PND 90, behavioral (Activity Box and Elevated Plus Maze) and biochemical parameters were assessed. The dams' plasma progesterone concentrations decreased in the PSD 72 group, and the levels of plasma estradiol increased in GH 2. Corticosterone levels were found to increase after all sleep-deprivation procedures. Homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 but decreased in the PSD 72 group. The offspring of GH 1 mothers exhibited decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Exposure to sleep deprivation had a long-lasting impact on tissue weight; in particular, there was a decrease in hemilateral epididymal fat weight in mature animals from the PSD 72 group. Although some of the alterations observed in the mothers (elevated estrogen and corticosterone levels and decreased progesterone) might have played a role in the permanent alterations in the adult offspring, they were not the main cause. The homocysteine changes detected in the sleep-deprived dams may contribute to redox changes, controlling gene expression and shaping epigenetic development. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The light/dark cycle and suprachiasmatic nucleus rhythmicity are known to have important influences on reproductive function of rodents. We studied reproductive function in female heterozygous and homozygous brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (Bmal1, also known as Arntl) null mice, which lack central and peripheral cellular rhythms. Heterozygous Bmal1 mice developed normally and were fertile, with apparent normal pregnancy progression and litter size, although postnatal mortality up to weaning was high (1.1-1.3/litter). The genotype distribution was skewed with both heterozygous and null genotypes underrepresented (1.0:1.7:0.7; P<0.05), suggesting loss of a single Bmal1 allele may impact on postnatal survival. Homozygous Bmal1 null mice were 30% lighter at weaning, and while they grew at a similar rate to the wild-type mice, they never achieved a comparable body weight. They had delayed vaginal opening (4 days), disrupted estrus cyclicity, and reduced ovarian weight (30%). Bmal1 null mice had a 40% reduction in ductal length and a 43% reduction in ductal branches in the mammary gland. Surprisingly, the Bmal1 mice ovulated, but progesterone synthesis was reduced in conjunction with altered corpora lutea formation. Pregnancy failed prior to implantation presumably due to poor embryo development. While Bmal1 null ovaries responded to pregnant mare serum gonadotropin/human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation, ovulation rate was reduced, and the fertilized oocytes progressed poorly to blastocysts and failed to implant. The loss of Bmal1 gene expression resulted in a loss of rhythmicity of many genes in the ovary and downregulation of Star. In conclusion, it is clear that the profound infertility of Bmal1 null mice is multifactorial. Reproduction (2010) 139 1077-1090

AB Clinical observations in chronic inflammatory diseases have demonstrated the significant influence of neuroendocrine mechanisms on the immune system: (1) Amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy; (2) preponderance of women versus men with respect to autoimmune diseases; (3) negative effects of ovulation-inducing therapy, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy; (4) protective effect of hemiplegia; (5) influence of psychological stress on inflammation; and (6) influence of circadian rhythms on inflammatory symptoms.
   The effects of different hormones and neurotransmitters on the immune system are influenced by: (1) the immune stimulus (foreign antigens or autoantigens) and subsequent antigen-specific immune responses, (2) the cell types involved during different phases of the disease, (3) the target organ with its specific microenvironment, (4) the timing of hormone or neurotransmitter increase in relation to the disease course, (5) the concentration of hormones and neurotransmitters, (6) the variability in expression of receptors depending on the microenvironment and the cell type, and (7) the intra-and extracellular peripheral metabolism of hormones and neurotransmitters leading to important biologically active metabolites with quite different anti-and proinflammatory functions.
   The circadian rhythm of disease-related symptoms with a peak in the early morning hours confirms that the neuroendocrine system has a strong influence on these chronic immune/inflammatory diseases. The influence is transmitted by the circadian fluctuation in the activity of hormonal and neuronal pathways linking the brain to immune cell activation.
   These considerations could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for rheumatic diseases in the future.

AB Background: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are becoming increasingly available to vulnerable populations at risk for malaria. Their appropriate and consistent use is essential to preventing malaria, but ITN use often lags behind ITN ownership. In order to increase ITN use, it is necessary to devise strategies that accurately identify, differentiate, and target the reasons and types of non-use.
   Methods: A simple method based on the end-user as the denominator was employed to classify each individual into one of four ITN use categories: 1) living in households not owning an ITN; 2) living in households owning, but not hanging an ITN; 3) living in households owning and hanging an ITN, but who are not sleeping under one; and 4) sleeping under an ITN. This framework was applied to survey data designed to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) distributions following integrated campaigns in five countries: Togo, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, Kenya and Niger.
   Results: The percentage of children < 5 years of age sleeping under an ITN ranged from 51.5% in Kenya to 81.1% in Madagascar. Among the three categories of non-use, children living in households without an ITN make up largest group (range: 9.4%-30.0%), despite the efforts of the integrated child health campaigns. The percentage of children who live in households that own but do not hang an ITN ranged from 5.1% to 16.1%. The percentage of children living in households where an ITN was suspended, but who were not sleeping under it ranged from 4.3% to 16.4%. Use by all household members in Sierra Leone (39.9%) and Madagascar (60.4%) indicate that integrated campaigns reach beyond their desired target populations.
   Conclusions: The framework outlined in this paper provides a helpful tool to examine the deficiencies in ITN use. Monitoring and evaluation strategies designed to assess ITN ownership and use can easily incorporate this approach using existing data collection instruments that measure the standard indicators.

DT Article
DE restless legs syndrome; celiac disease; sleep disorders
AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological condition, frequently idiopathic, sometimes associated with specific disorders such as iron deficiency. We investigated RLS prevalence in celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease characterized by several features such as malabsorption-related iron deficiency anemia and peripheral neuropathy. We screened a population of 100 adult CD patients for CD features, iron metabolism, clinical and neurological conditions, and enrolled 100 age- and sex-matched controls in the general population. RLS was ascertained in CD patients and controls by both the presence of the four essential International RLS Study Group diagnostic criteria and neurological examination. The International RLS Study Group rating scale was used to measure RLS severity. We found a 31% prevalence of RLS in the CD population that was significantly higher than the prevalence in the control population (4%; P < 0.001). The average severity of RLS in CD population was moderate (17 +/- 6.5). In the CD population, no significant correlation was found between RLS and either gluten-free diet or iron metabolism, despite hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in CD patients with RLS than without RLS (P = 0.003). We found no correlation between RLS and other possible causes of secondary RLS, including signs of peripheral neuropathy, pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, and pharmacological treatments. Our study broadens the spectrum of neurological disorders associated with CD and indicates that RLS should be sought for in all patients with CD. (C) 2010 Movement Disorder Society

TI Crying babies, tired mothers - challenges of the postnatal hospital
   stay: an interpretive phenomenological study
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; CARE; FATIGUE; SLEEP; CHILDBIRTH; DURATION;
   HEALTH; VIEWS
AB Background: According to an old Swiss proverb, "a new mother lazing in childbed is a blessing to her family". Today mothers rarely enjoy restful days after birth, but enter directly into the challenge of combining baby-and self-care. They often face a combination of infant crying and personal tiredness. Yet, routine postnatal care often lacks effective strategies to alleviate these challenges which can adversely affect family health. We explored how new mothers experience and handle postnatal infant crying and their own tiredness in the context of changing hospital care practices in Switzerland.
   Methods: Purposeful sampling was used to enroll 15 mothers of diverse parity and educational backgrounds, all of who had given birth to a full term healthy neonate. Using interpretive phenomenology, we analyzed interview and participant observation data collected during the postnatal hospital stay and at 6 and 12 weeks post birth. This paper reports on the postnatal hospital experience.
   Results: Women's personal beliefs about beneficial childcare practices shaped how they cared for their newborn's and their own needs during the early postnatal period in the hospital. These beliefs ranged from an infant-centered approach focused on the infant's development of a basic sense of trust to an approach that balanced the infants' demands with the mother's personal needs. Getting adequate rest was particularly difficult for mothers striving to provide infant-centered care for an unsettled neonate. These mothers suffered from sleep deprivation and severe tiredness unless they were able to leave the baby with health professionals for several hours during the night.
   Conclusion: New mothers often need permission to attend to their own needs, as well as practical support with childcare to recover from birth especially when neonates are fussy. To strengthen family health from the earliest stage, postnatal care should establish conditions which enable new mothers to balance the care of their infant with their own needs.

AB Restless legs syndrome is a distressing condition, with negative effects on sleep and daytime activities that affect personal, family and occupational life. The overall impact of restless legs syndrome on quality of life is comparable to that of chronic and frustrating conditions such as depression and diabetes. Misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment may increase patients' suffering in terms of uncertainty, overuse or misuse of care services and lack of trust. Presenting a synthesis of the main topics in the literature on restless legs syndrome facilitates for a better understanding and its management in primary care settings.

AB Objective.-Insufficient sleep in children is associated with adverse health effects. We examined the associations of early life risk factors with infant sleep duration.
   Methods.-We studied 1676 mother-infant pairs in a prebirth cohort study. Main outcomes were mothers' report of their infants' average 24-hour sleep duration at ages 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.
   Results.-Infants slept mean standard deviation [SD] durations of 12.2 (2.0) hours/day at age 6 months, 12.8 (1.6) hours/day at age 1 year, and 11.9 (1.3) hours/day at age 2 years. In multivariable regression models, maternal antenatal depression, introduction of solids at age <4 months, and infant TV/video viewing were associated with shorter sleep durations at both 1 and 2 years of age. Estimates were 0.36 fewer hours/day of sleep for maternal antenatal depression, 0.39 fewer hours/day of sleep if infant was introduced to solids at age <4 months, and 0.11 fewer hours/day of sleep for each 1 hour of TV viewed per week. Attendance at child care outside the home was associated with 0.18 fewer hours/day of sleep at age 2 years. At age 2 years, black, Hispanic, and Asian infants slept 0.40, 0.82, and 0.95, respectively, fewer hours per day than white infants.
   Conclusions.-Maternal depression during pregnancy, early introduction of solid foods, infant TV viewing, and attendance of child care were associated with shorter infant sleep duration. Racial/ethnic minority children slept fewer hours in the first 2 years of life than white children. Our results suggest that various risk factors, some potentially modifiable, are worthy of clinical consideration when addressing infant sleep duration.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF.
   STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization.
   RESULTS: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P<.05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<.05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P>.05).
   CONCLUSION: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS.

ID PREGNANT MARES; EQUUS-CABALLUS; EXERCISE; WELFARE; SLEEP; PONY
AB Housing conditions for horses impose various levels of confinement, which may compromise welfare. Lying behaviour and activity can be used as welfare indicators for domestic animals and rebound behaviour suggests a build-up of motivation resulting from deprivation. The objective of this study was to determine if activity and lying behaviour of horses are affected by housing conditions and to investigate the occurrence of rebound behaviour after release from confinement. Eight horses were subjected, in pairs, to each of four experimental treatments; paddock (P), fully stabled (FS), partly stabled (PS) and yard (Y). Each horse received 6 days acclimatisation prior to the 24h recording period. Time spent in lying and activity were electronically recorded using a tilt switch and motion sensor connected to a data logger worn on the horse's left foreleg. Time spent active during the first 5 min of release from stable to paddock in the PS treatment (days 1 and 5) and at the same time of day in the P treatment was used as a measure of rebound behaviour. Effect of housing conditions on total time spent active was highly significant (FS = 123 s, PS = 158 s, Y = 377s, P = 779s, P < 0.001). Housing conditions did not significantly affect total time spent lying (P = 0.646). Horses were significantly more active, compared with baseline paddock behaviour; on release from stabling on both days 1 (P = 0.006) and 5 (P = 0.025) of PS treatment. These results suggest that activity patterns of horses, but not lying behaviour, are affected by the housing conditions tested and that rebound activity occurs in horses after a period of confinement.

AB Britain has a unique experience of national longitudinal birth cohorts, but the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children differed in two major respects-it was based in one area rather than being a national sample, and it started in pregnancy rather than at birth or later in the first year. This paper outlines a personal selection of 10 topics, highlighting results from some of the 400+ papers that have already been published from this study. It indicates in particular how many childcare and domestic fashions were neither of benefit to the children (or their parents), the importance of pregnancy in regard to childhood conditions and the likely dangers of some common chemicals, whether in medications or domestic products.

AB Objectives: To fully ascertain the familial aggregation of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and to characterize the clinical features of familial RLS (fRLS) cases.
   Design: A case series survey with a high response rate.
   Setting: Academic research center.
   Participants: Consecutive RLS probands (n=249) were followed up in a specialized sleep center for 15 years. A total of 671 cases of fRLS met the current standard diagnostic criteria, including 192 probands characterized using multidimensional clinical assessments and 479 affected family members assessed by their responses to a structured questionnaire telephone diagnostic interview.
   Main Outcome Measures: Sibling and offspring relative risk ratio and clinical and genetic features of patients with fRLS and families.
   Results: Our data showed that RLS aggregates in families with a familial rate of 77%, a sibling relative risk of 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-4.4), and an offspring relative risk of 1.8 (1.0-2.7). Familial RLS is a chronic disorder with amean (SD) disease duration of 24(16) years and a wide range of age of onset (mean [SD], 28[15] years), with most family members having early-onset disease but mild to moderate RLS symptoms. Our clinical data also indicated that fRLS is more prominent among women who also had increased incidence of anemia/ iron deficiency, arthritis, and number of pregnancies. Pregnancy-related RLS seems to be a characteristic feature of fRLS, and afflicted women tend to have a much younger age of onset.
   Conclusions: Restless legs syndrome significantly aggregated in families with variable phenotypic expressivity, and the siblings of severely affected individuals have an increased risk of developing the disease.

AB Objective: To examine the associations between sleep problems and prenatal exposure to cocaine, opiates, marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine in children aged 1 month to 12 years.
   Design: Sleep data were collected by maternal report in a prospective longitudinal follow-up of children participating in the Maternal Lifestyle multisite study.
   Setting: Hospital-based research centers in Providence, Rhode Island; Miami, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and Memphis, Tennessee.
   Participants: There were 808 participants, 374 exposed to cocaine and/or opiates, and 434 comparison subjects.
   Main Exposure: Prenatal cocaine, opiate, marijuana, alcohol, and/or nicotine exposure.
   Outcome Measure: Sleep problems in early, middle, or late childhood, assessed as composites of maternal report items.
   Results: Of the 5 substances, prenatal nicotine exposure was the only unique predictor of sleep problems (B = 0.074, R(2) change = 0.008, P = .01), with adjustment for covariates, including socioeconomic status, marital status, physical abuse, prenatal medical care, and postnatal cigarette smoke exposure.
   Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to nicotine was positively associated with children's sleep problems persisting throughout the first 12 years of life. Targeting of this group of children for educational and behavioral efforts to prevent and treat sleep problems is merited given that good sleep may serve as a protective factor for other developmental outcomes.

AB Data collected from medical literature indicate that dopaminergic agonists alleviate Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms while dopaminergic agonists antagonists aggravate them. Dopaminergic agonists is a physiological regulator of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Dopaminergic agonists infusion diminishes the levels of thyroid hormones, which have the ability to provoke restlessness, hyperkinetic states, tremors, and insomnia. Conditions associated with higher levels of thyroid hormones, such as pregnancy or hyperthyroidism, have a higher prevalence of Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms. Low iron levels can cause secondary Restless Legs Syndrome or aggravate symptoms of primary disease as well as diminish enzymatic activities that are involved in dopaminergic agonists production and the degradation of thyroid hormones. Moreover, as a result of low iron levels, dopaminergic agonists diminishes and thyroid hormones increase. Iron therapy improves Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms in iron deprived patients. Medical hypothesis. To discuss the theory that thyroid hormones, when not counterbalanced by dopaminergic agonists, may precipitate the signs and symptoms underpinning Restless Legs Syndrome. The main cause of Restless Legs Syndrome might be an imbalance between the dopaminergic agonists system and thyroid hormones.

AB Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) provides us with a method of assessing brain activity in critically ill neonates. In extremely premature neonates, the aEEG trace is predominantly discontinuous, making it difficult to distinguish between a "normal" and "abnormal" trace. We measured aEEG activity in the first 48 h of life in neonates born before 29-wk gestation and used both visual and quantitative analysis of the aEEG data to assess differences in neonates with poor short-term outcome [death or peri/intraventricular hemorrhage (P/IVH)] compared with those who survived without P/IVH to identify features of an abnormal aEEG. On quantitative analysis, EEG continuity <80% at 10-mu V level was a sensitive and specific marker of poor short-term outcome. By using this marker, we identified 83% of neonates who died or developed grade 3 or 4 IVH and 60% of neonates who developed grades 1 or 2 IVH, with a positive predictive value for death or any IVH of 73% and a negative predictive value of 86%. Absence of sleep-wake cycling with baseline variability <2 mu V was the strongest predictor of outcome using visual analysis alone. (Pediatr Res 67: 538-544,2010)

   METAANALYSIS
AB The first step in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to identify, and if possible to treat any condition which might cause or worsen RLS, such as iron deficiency or some drug treatments.
   The patients suffering from RLS should be prompted to keep a healthy sleep schedule.
   Drug treatment should be restricted to patients with a clear clinical diagnosis, decided on on individual basis, when the clinical impact is serious.
   Four drug classes are central to the treatment of RLS: dopaminergic agents, some antiepileptics, opioids, and benzodiazepines.
   Dopaminergic agonists are the treatment of choice, especially when daily treatment is indicated, or if the symptoms are severe. Two dopaminergic agonists are licensed in France for the treatment of RLS: ropinirole (Adartrel (R)) and pramipexole (Sifrol (R)).
   After initiation of treatment, the patients should benefit from a regular follow-up in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to identify possible side-effects. Special care should be given to the detection of augmentation, a phenomenon characterized by a paradoxical worsening of the symptoms with treatment. Some particular conditions, such as RLS comorbid with renal insufficiency, during pregnancy, and in the child are discussed.

AB Background: Circadian clocks guide the metabolic, cell-division, sleep-wake, circadian and seasonal cycles. Abnormalities in these clocks may be a health hazard. Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30 and over, living in Finland.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511 individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2 rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296 had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype experienced less seasonal variation of energy level.
   Conclusions/Significance: ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in humans.

AB Objectives:
   To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry) newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born to abstainers (n = 14) or light (< 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers (controls).
   Methods:
   Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least 1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale.
   Results:
   There were no between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group.
   Conclusions:
   Both cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress reactivity measures suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns. This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this experimental pilot study was to measure the effects of a mindfulness-based yoga intervention on sleep in pregnant women. Methods: Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. Results: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention. Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. Conclusions: Mindful yoga shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future.

AB PURPOSE: To use radiation exposure rate measurements to determine patient-specific radiation safety instructions with the aim of reducing unnecessary precaution times and to evaluate potential doses to members of the public.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation exposure rate measurements were obtained from 1279 patients with Stage T1-2 prostate cancer who underwent transperineal (125)I or (103)Pd seed implantation from January 1995 through July 2008. An algorithm was developed from these measurements to determine the required precaution times to maintain public effective doses below 50% of the limits for specific exposure situations.
   RESULTS: The median air kerma rates at 30 cm from the anterior skin surface were 4.9 mu Gy/h (range: 0.1-31.5) for (125)I and 1.5 mu Gy/h (range: 0.02-14.9) for (103)Pd. The derived algorithms depended primarily on the half-life T(p), the measured exposure rate at 30 cm, and specific exposure situation factors. For the typical (103)Pd patient, no radiation safety precautions are required. For the typical (125)I patient, no precautions are required for coworkers, nonpregnant adults who do not sleep with the patient, or nonpregnant adults who sleep with the patient. Typical (125)I patients should only avoid sleeping in the "spoon" position (i.e., in contact) with pregnant adults and avoid holding a child for long periods of time in the lap for about 2 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The large number of cases available for this study permitted the development of an algorithm to simply determine patient-specific radiation safety instructions. The resulting precaution times are significantly less restrictive than those generally prescribed currently. (C) 2010 American Brachytherapy Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB P>Background
   The rising global prevalence of asthma and other allergic conditions has been linked to potential aetiological factors influencing the developing immune system.
   Objective
   To investigate the prevalence and associated risk factors for wheeze and eczema in 1-year-old children in a birth cohort from Butajira, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   In 2005/6, a population-based cohort of 1065 pregnant women was established. At 1 year of age, data on wheeze and eczema in the children were collected from the mother via an interview-administered questionnaire, along with numerous demographic and lifestyle factors. A stool sample was also obtained from the child for geohelminth analysis.
   Results
   The prevalence of wheeze was 11.5% (103/899) and eczema 8.6% (77/899). Independent predictors of wheeze were maternal allergic history [adjusted OR (AOR)=3.00, 95% CI 1.23-7.36], paternal allergic history (AOR=2.59, 95% CI 1.08-6.25), increasing household size (P for trend=0.023; AOR=3.54, 95% CI 1.31-9.56 for 7+ vs. 1-3 individuals) and paracetamol use by the child (overall P < 0.001; AOR 11.04, 95% CI 4.30-28.31 for 4+ tablets in past month vs. never). Factors independently associated with eczema were maternal allergic history (AOR=3.68, 95% CI 1.54-8.77), household size (overall P=0.035; AOR=0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.87 for 4-6 individuals relative to 1-3) and place of sleeping (overall P < 0.001; AOR=0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.82 for floor vs. bed/platform).
   Conclusion
   These findings support the hypothesis that eczema in early life in these children is a manifestation of allergy, while wheezing is probably due to infection as well as allergy.

AB Background: Perinatal anxiety and depression constitute one of the long term major public health issues in Australia and for too long they has been bundled under the over-arching term of 'postnatal depression'. However, the generation, finding, and implementation of the National Pen natal Depression Plan (NPDP) (Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, 20(18), across all Australian States and Territories, are proving to be wide-reaching and influential. Not only does the NDPD move from the umbrella term of postnatal depression' to establish the reality of perinatal anxiety and depression which women can experience from conception to the first year of the infant's life but also all States and Territories have made Individual Investment Plans for the implementation of the NPDP. Implementation: In these Investment Plans, each State and Territory will address the following three major goals of the NPDP differently and mainly within a primary health care setting: (I) Psychosocial assessment in addition to screening of women antenatally and postnatally; (2) Education of health professionals about the complexity of perinatal depression and the need for early assessment and intervention; (3) Development of quality pathways of care for follow-up support and care of women who are depressed and who are assessed as being at the risk for depression. Implications for nurses and midwives: General nurses, maternal child health nurses, midwives, and mental health nurses are spread throughout primary health care settings. Three essential aspects of the NPDP are pertinent to their practice: (I) the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); the 2008 beyondblue National Action Ran for Perinatal Mental Health (NAP); and the Draft beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines for depression and related disorders anxiety, bipolar disorder, and puerperal psychosis - in the perinatal period (March 2010). The author addresses these three aspects of the NPDP by citing two personal accounts by women who have experienced perinatal anxiety and depression; these accounts are available in the public domain.

AB Cluster headache (CH) is a neurovascular headache syndrome characterized by headache attacks that occur with a circadian and circannual periodicity. The calculated prevalence of CH in reproductive-aged women is 7.5 of 100,000 women. Although data suggest that CH during pregnancy is a relatively rare condition, when it does occur, attacks remain unchanged in character and severity in the majority of patients. Thus, treatment of CH in pregnant and lactating women may remain a significant therapeutic challenge. This manuscript briefly reviews the epidemiology of CH in women, and then focuses on treatment options for both acute and preventative management of CH in pregnant and lactating women.

AB The mechanisms linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with adulthood obesity and diabetes are unclear. These studies investigated energy homeostasis in 8- and 20-wk-old male and female mice subjected to protein deficiency in utero. Pregnant C57BL/6J female mice were fed a protein-deficient diet (6% protein). Undernourished offspring (UO) and controls (CO) were cross-fostered to lactating dams fed a 20% control diet. The 24-h profiles of energy expenditure, feeding behavior, physical activity, and whole-body substrate preference was assessed using 8-wk UO and CO weaned onto control diet. Blood chemistries, glucose tolerance, and expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism were analyzed in 8- and 20-wk-old CO and UO fed control or a high-fat diet. UO exhibited IUGR with catch-up growth at 8 wk of age and increased severity of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by 20 wk of age. Therefore, fetal malnutrition in the C57BL/6J mouse increases sensitivity to diet-induced obesity. Abnormal daily rhythms in food intake and metabolism, increased lipogenesis, and inflammation preceded obesity in the UO group. Arrhythmic expression of circadian oscillator genes was evident in brain, liver, and muscle of UO at 8 and 20 wk of age. Expression of the clock-associated nuclear receptor and transcription repressor Rev-erb alpha was reduced in liver and muscle of UO. Altered circadian physiology may be symptomatic of the metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR, and altered feeding behavior and substrate metabolism may contribute to the obese phenotype.

   CHILDREN; ANXIETY; TRIAL
AB CASE: Sonia's mother was concerned about her 9-year old daughter's aggression, defiant behavior, and distractibility. When she was 4-years, she kicked her bother and he lost a tooth as a result of the trauma. At this time, her pediatrician was concerned about hyperactivity, impulsivity, and defiance of authority and recommended a psychological evaluation. Sonia's father refused an evaluation and responded by physically abusing his wife while demanding a transfer to a new physician. Sonia's mother left her husband at this time and moved away with Sonia. Spousal abuse occurred frequently before the separation, and Sonia may have been physically abused as well.
   Currently, Sonia is in third grade where she is underperforming in many areas. She enjoys drawing and reading, but struggles to sit quietly and stay on task. Her teacher reports frequent vocal and physical disruptions. Homework takes an inordinate amount of time to complete. She does not have a sustained friendship; her mother feels that this is because other kids do not like being bossed by Sonia. Her mother is concerned about Sonia's behavior especially the unremorseful disruptive behavior toward her younger brother and grandmother.
   Sonia was born after an uneventful full-term pregnancy without evidence of maternal smoking, drugs, alcohol, or medications. Motor and social developmental milestones were achieved at the appropriate time. Language milestones were achieved early; her mother recalls that Sonia learned to read at the age of 3 years.
   Sonia's medical history is significant for obesity, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and delayed sleep onset with prolonged awakenings associated with nightmares. Her mother reports that Sonia "worries about everything," including thoughts that her brother will turn into a monster. When an argument occurs at home, she "gets scared," bites her nails, and cries. Sonia currently lives with her mother, 2 younger brothers, step-father, and grandparents. Family history is significant for drug abuse by her father and mental illness in the father's family.
   While conducting an interview with her mother, Sonia was asked to draw a picture of her family. Instead, she illustrated a book detailing her past experience in words accompanying each drawing. She described how she watched her father physically abuse her mother and her persistent fear of danger when conflict occurred at home. Although spelling was poor, her vocabulary, sequencing, and illustrations demonstrated above age-level skills for written expression and drawing. Examples of the writing that accompanied the drawings include: "I hate when my parents fight. I get scared and feel sick to my tummy like I want to throw up. I just hate that feeling!" "My mom told me she had a 'boyfriend.' These words were the most horrible I ever heard. Soon a nightmare began. Nightmares make me very, very scared."

TI Inconsolable Night-Time Awakening: Beyond Night Terrors
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID VULNERABLE CHILD SYNDROME; SLEEP
AB CASE: Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her parents who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother indicated that she has frequent (>6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by screaming and crying lasting up to 1 hour since her birth. These episodes increased in intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her brother. With a bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a wash cloth and touching mother's nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however, within 1 hour she awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and unable to be comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions, including a sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep pattern. Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking, hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes. Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal hyper-bilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks, daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in the first year. Occupational therapy was of " no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking and a paternal history of sleeping walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily schedule. Sleep deprivation, differences parent child-rearing practices, social isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30 minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment, she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician.

AB Aim:
   To determine the effect of physical activity and psychosocial stress on low birthweight (LBW).
   Methods:
   A prospective study was carried out in a district of Sri Lanka between May 2001 and April 2002. A total of 885 pregnant mothers were recruited at < 16 weeks of gestation and followed up until partus. Trimester-specific exposure statuses along with potential confounding factors were gathered on average at the 12th, 28th, and 36th weeks of gestation. Physical activities were assessed by inquiring about the duration of specific postures adopted per day by housewives during each trimester at home and both at home and during working hours for those who were engaged in paid employment. Psychosocial stress was assessed using the Modified Life Events Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire 30. LBW was defined as a birthweight of less than 2500 g. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied for controlling confounders and the results were expressed as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
   Results:
   Standing > 2.5 h/day (OR 2.26; 95%CI 1.10, 4.69) during the second trimester and sleeping 8 h or less/day (OR 2.84; 95%CI 1.49, 5.40) either during the second, third or both trimesters together, an increase in maternal age in years (OR 0.92; 95%CI 0.87, 0.98), and body mass index < 19.8 kg/m2 (OR 2.2; 95%CI 1.17, 4.22) had a statistically significant association with LBW. Psychosocial stress was not associated with LBW.
   Conclusions:
   Standing > 2.5 h/day and sleeping < 8 h/day were risk factors for LBW, whereas psychosocial stress was not.

AB OBJECTIVE: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity.
   METHODS: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic mother-child pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother's reported child's race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity.
   RESULTS: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life. Pediatrics 2010;125:686-695

AB The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of similar to 50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.

AB Study Objectives: This study investigated whether there was a relationship between disrupted sleep and postpartum mood disturbances in women during the week after delivery.
   Design: Sleep and mood were measured during the third trimester (Time-1) and one week postpartum (Time-2) in a 2-stage longitudinal design.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from an antenatal clinic in a regional Melbourne hospital.
   Participants: Forty-four healthy women at low risk for postpartum depression.
   Interventions: N/A
   Measurements and Results: Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy and subjective sleep by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; mood was assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Sleep and mood questionnaires were administered at Time-1 and Time-2. Wrist actigraphy was collected for one week at both times. After delivery, both objective and subjective nighttime sleep significantly worsened with decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, while daytime napping behavior significantly increased. On average, mood improved across all scales after delivery, although 45.95% of the sample experienced deterioration of mood. Regression analyses showed little relationship between Time-1 and Time-2 objective nighttime sleep, and postpartum mood. Variables that related to both Time-1 and Time-2 subjective perception of sleep, including subjective nighttime sleep, sleep-related daytime dysfunction, and daytime napping behavior, were significant predictors of postpartum mood.
   Conclusions: The perception of poor sleep, and the conscious awareness of its impact during wake-time, might share a stronger relationship with the occurrence of immediate postpartum mood disturbances than actual sleep quality and quantity.

AB The prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is low in the general population in Turkey. To assess the prevalence of RLS in pregnancy, a hospital-based survey assessing symptoms of RLS and other sleep problems was performed through face-to-face interviews and physical examination on 983 pregnant women from 11 hospitals in the two urban and four suburban areas of Kayseri, Turkey, at the time of delivery and 6 months after delivery. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International RLS Study Group. A total of 103 women reported the occurrence of RLS symptoms during pregnancy, giving an RLS prevalence rate of 10.48%, with presence of symptoms more than three times per month, which decreased to 2.9% after 6 months. A significant relationship was observed between RLS and the number of previous pregnancies: women who had one child were compared with women who had 2-3 children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.441, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.894-2.324), and women who had >= 4 children (OR = 2.530, 95% CI, 1.377-4.650). Patients with and without the RLS syndrome were similar in respect to distributions of age, income level, career, iron and folate therapy, sleep habits, and sleep problems. The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women is low, like the low prevalence in the general population in Eastern European and/or Asian populations.

AB Sleep duration in the Population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing Most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women's daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal Outcomes.
   We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) runs a malaria control project in Bo and Pujehun districts (population 158 000) that includes the mass distribution, routine delivery and demonstration of correct use of free, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). In 2006/2007, around 65 000 LLINs were distributed. The aim of this follow-up study was to measure LLIN usage and ownership in the project area.
   METHODS Heads of 900 randomly selected households in 30 clusters were interviewed, using a standardized questionnaire, about household use of LLINs. The condition of any LLIN was physically assessed.
   RESULTS Of the 900 households reported, 83.4% owning at least one LLIN. Of the 16.6% without an LLIN, 91.9% had not participated in the MSF mass distribution. In 94.1% of the households reporting LLINs, the nets were observed hanging correctly over the beds. Of the 1135 hanging LLINs, 75.2% had no holes or 10 or fewer finger-size holes. The most common source of LLINs was MSF (75.2%). Of the 4997 household members, 67.2% reported sleeping under an LLIN the night before the study, including 76.8% of children under 5 years and 73.0% of pregnant women.
   CONCLUSION Our results show that MSF achieved good usage with freely distributed LLINs. It is one of the few areas where results almost achieve the new targets set in 2005 by Roll Back Malaria to have at least 80% of pregnant women and children under 5 years using LLINs by 2010.

AB This study describes and models maternal nest-building and parturition behaviour in cage-bred wild rabbits (Otyctolagus cuniculus), and its influence on the kits' pre-weaning mortality. In a total of 91 litters, perinatal mortality was 33%; mortality during the nursing period was 16.05%, and therefore the accumulated mortality up to weaning was 43.94%. These mortality rates, higher than those described in the literature among domestic breeds, were linked to failures in maternal behaviour. Such failures included the non-introduction of straw into the nest box (41.8% of births), a lack of hair lining in the nest (28.6%), births in which one or all of the kits were born outside the nest box (18.7%), and births in which one or all of the kits were cannibalised by the doe (13.2%). Maternal behaviour in relation to the kits' viability was modelled by performing multiple correspondence and cluster analyses with two dimensions and a 67.2% total inertia. The first dimension (inertia: 0.400) was represented by the presence of hair in the nest box; the place where the kits were born (inside or outside the nest box), and the doe's previous experience (primiparous or multiparous), while the total number of kits born represents the second dimension (inertia: 0.272). Three maternal behaviour types were identified: types 1 and 3 representing births in which the failure of maternal behaviour at kindling led to high kit mortality. Maternal behaviour type 1 corresponds to primiparous does of parity orders 1 and 2 with a high number of total kits born and of stillborn kits. Type 3 births were characterised by all of the kits died during peripartum, with a high incidence of cannibalism. Type 2 included births of experienced does showing successful development of maternal behaviour, as well as high kits' survival rates during the peripartum and nursing periods. Although wild rabbits are subject to the same modulating factors in the development of the maternal repertoire as domestic does, showed a lower preweaning viability due to the failure to display maternal behaviour during peripartum.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to estimate the maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: Women delivering between 2000-2008 with confirmed OSA in an academic center were included. Normal-weight and obese controls were randomly selected at a 2: 1 ratio. Maternal and neonatal morbidities were compared between the groups. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate maternal morbidity and preterm birth (PTB).
   RESULTS: The analysis included 57 pregnancies complicated by OSA. Compared with normal-weight (n = 114) controls, OSA patients had more preeclampsia (PET) (19.3% vs 7.0%; P = .02) and PTB (29.8% vs 12.3%; P = .007). Controlling for comorbid conditions, OSA was associated with an increased risk of PTB (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-6.6), mostly secondary to PET (63%). Cesarean delivery (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.9-22.1) and OSA were associated with maternal morbidity (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-13.7).
   CONCLUSION: Pregnancies complicated by OSA are at increased risk for preeclampsia, medical complications, and indicated PTB.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the relation between recommended levels of physical activity during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes.
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an observational study with energy expenditure, aerobic fitness, and sleeping heart rate measured in 44 healthy women in late pregnancy. Medical records were examined for pregnancy outcome.
   RESULTS: Active women, who engaged in >= 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day, had significantly better fitness and lower sleeping heart rate compared to the inactive. Duration of second stage of labor was 88 and 146 minutes in the active vs inactive women, respectively (P = .05). Crude odds ratio of operative delivery in the inactive vs the active was 3.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-16.08). Birth-weight, maternal weight gain, and parity adjusted odds ratio was 7.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-45.8). Neonatal condition and other obstetric outcomes were similar between groups.
   CONCLUSION: Active women have better aerobic fitness as compared to inactive women. The risk for operative delivery is lower in active women compared to inactive, when controlled for birthweight, maternal weight gain, and parity. Further studies with larger sample size are required to confirm the association between physical activity and pregnancy outcomes.

AB To study the normal ranges of sleep-wake cycles in normal fetuses.
   A total of 600 fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings were studied from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at a gestational age between 30 and 40 weeks with a 1-h recording. Two obstetricians interpreted all the FHR recordings independently.
   The mean baseline FHR was 141.6 (7.6) beats/min. The median relative percentage time spent in a quiet state was 26% (0-88.6). The median duration of time spent in a quiet state was 15.7 min (0-53.2) within a 1-h recording. Both quiet and active states were established in 84% of cases. The number of FHR accelerations per hour in an active state increased with advancing gestational age, whereas the baseline FHR gradually decreased.
   Normal ranges of fetal sleep-wake cycles were established. Fetuses between 30 and 40 weeks had wide variations in the percentage of time spent in sleep-wake states.

AB Studies have shown that asthma in children is caused by environmental and genetic factors. In adult asthma, risk factors were less well recognized. Likewise, in Thailand, data in adult asthma is limited. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors, determine skin reactivities to allergens, and assess concomitant allergy among adult asthma in Phitsanulok, a major city in the lower northern Thailand. Five hundred and thirteen Naresuan University staff members and students completed 2 sets of questionnaires and underwent allergy skin prick tests. The first set of questionnaires was standardized Thai version of ISAAC questionnaire for identifying asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema. The second set was modified from ISAAC phase II questionnaire to identify asthma risk factors. Fifty-eight subjects (11.6%) were identified as having physician's diagnosed asthma and 89 subjects (17.7%) wheezed in the past 12 months. Among 89 subjects, 14.4% wheezed more than once a month, 45.6% had wheezes interfering with sleep. Concomitant allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema among these asthma subjects were 82.5%, 67.9%, and 14.9%, respectively. Eighty seven point nine percent of asthmatic subjects had positive skin reactivities to at least one allergen. Two of the most common allergens were house dust mites and cockroaches. Maternal smoking during pregnancy, smoking among family members, and family history of allergy were statistically significant risks for developing asthma, while having a rice field around the residence represented a significant protective factor. In conclusion, high prevalence of asthma presented in Phitsanulok and many asthmatic subjects were partly controlled or uncontrolled. The environment such as a rice field could protect against asthma, however atopy and smoking exposure were significant risks for asthma development

   ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR; CHILD PSYCHOLOGY; PSYCHOLOGY, EDUCATIONAL; SCHOOLS
AB In the ongoing effort to improve public health in France, schools have become a priority in recent years, after it emerged that France is the EU country where behavior-related mortality is highest (accidents, risk-taking, suicide, alcohol, smoking, lack of exercise). These harmful behaviors begin during adolescence but are conditioned by mental construction during early childhood. The current situation of health education in schools is worrying, for two reasons. First, there is no coherent doctrine. The concepts on which it is based have greatly evolved since 1975 (especially with the introduction of the Ottawa Charter for health promotion in 1986). We have simply accumulated different approaches rather than redefining our goals and adapting the available means accordingly. Second, the impact of health programs is not sufficiently evaluated. Circulars and guidelines have been written, studies have been conducted, but we have learned next to nothing from our failures and successes. In 2010, at a time when teacher training is being reconsidered - and thus also the school curriculum - it is crucial to clarify our objectives and to seek how to adapt to the current situation "on the ground". A series of French and international studies, including the OECD report (2009), are highly critical of the situation in France and show that further efforts are needed. While France devotes substantial resources to adolescent programs, those set aside for early childhood are totally inadequate. Yet sociological research, and advances in neuroscience, show that while physical and mental development is a continuous process from the womb to adulthood, the early years of life are critical. Intellectual stimulation during infancy used to be a role assumed by the family. Unfortunately, in contemporary France, many parents are unaware of their necessary contribution to their children's education, or are simply confused. Furthermore, France has become a heteroge-neous country. The insecurity and marginalization of certain families can undermine the parents' mental health and thus that of their children. Differences in culture and lifestyle introduce specific health problems and make it difficult to develop a comprehensive strategy A considerable effort is needed. We must educate and inform parents, starting from pregnancy, for example through obligatory antenatal courses to teach expectant mothers, and possibly their partners, that they must provide intellectual stimulation for their children, starting in the first weeks of life. The OECD report shows that French parents are among those who spend the least time with their children. There are multiple reasons for this alarming situation, which must be analyzed and remedied, notably by strengthening the partnership between parents and the directors of kindergartens and nurseries. Resistance must be overcome and the necessary structures created. The place of health during early childhood has considerably evolved. It used to be considered that, for small children, the main issue was physical health (vision, hearing, mobility, etc.). Today the accent is increasingly placed on their psychosocial well-being. Nursery and kindergarten staff and teachers are best-placed to identify children with psychological problems, such as those who find it difficult to establish relationships with other children and to find playmates. Interventions are all the more effective the earlier they begin.
   Psychosomatic evaluation of children thus identified, by a pediatrician and child psychiatrist (or psychologist), must include an assesment of living conditions and individual needs. International comparisons show that French young people are among those most pessimistic about their future, those most likely to feel they are not integrated into society, and those who feel they have little way of influencing their future, thinking it depends above all on other people; they feel that society is frozen, leaving them little opportunity for advancement. It is tempting to think that these attitudes are shaped by informy and early childhood experiences. The school curriculum must be appropriate for age, with the main objective of giving small children confidence in themselves and in their capacity to improve their own well-being. It must focus on the simplest functions and activities, such as sleep, diet, and physical education (among the countries included in the OECD survey, France is the country where physical education and sport are the least developed). Education must help young people to acquire social skills, to become aware of their emotions and those of other people, with all their differences. Role-play exercises in schools may be one way of developing this awareness. Teaching experience must be taken into account, through voluntary participation by schools and teachers (as successfully implemented in the "Hands-on" (Main a la Pate ") program); these studies must be backed up by the necessary means, and their results must be monitored and analyzed. Teacher education has a key role to play, in two respects: 0 initial training in universities should include a Masters module in health education, whose contents should be harmonized; and ii) continuous training, which has a major impact and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. These two training courses must be coherent with each other, and the available resources must be compatible with the objectives. It should be recalled, as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, that the goals of health education, and of education in general, should apply to all. This implies a need to bring both flexibility and rigor to teaching methods and the school curriculum. It will require a partnership between parents and teachers, mother-child health structures, and pediatricians. Rational division of responsibilities for infants and young children between the State, local authorities, health facilities, medicosocial structures, and health professionals, including school physicians and nurses, should be able to provide the coordination necessary to deal with the more difficult situations.

AB Back-ground: The article was designed to estimate the effect of active and passive household cigarette smoke exposure on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with asthma.
   Methods: We used a secondary observational analysis of pregnant women with mild and moderate-severe asthma enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study of asthma in pregnancy and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing inhaled beclomethasone and oral theophylline. A baseline questionnaire detailing smoking history and passive household smoke exposure was given to each patient. Smoking status was confirmed in the RCT using cotinine levels. Data on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected and analyzed with respect to self-reported tobacco smoke exposure. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson chi(2) statistics were used to test for significance.
   Results: A total of 2,210 women were enrolled: 1,812 in the observational study and 398 in the RCT. Four hundred and eight (18%) women reported current active smoking. Of the nonsmokers, 790 (36%) women reported passive household smoke exposure. Active smoking was associated with more total symptomatic days (P<.001) and nights of sleep disturbance (P<.001). Among the newborns of active smokers, there was a greater risk of small for gestational age < 10th percentile (P<.001), and a lower mean birth weight (P<.001). There were no differences in symptom exacerbation or outcome between nonsmokers with and without passive household cigarette smoke exposure.
   Conclusions: Among Pregnant women with asthma, active but not passive smoking is associated with increased asthma symptoms and fetal growth abnormalities. CHEST 2010; 137(3):601-608

AB Newborn infants of smokers show symptoms of cardiovascular stress hyperreactivity. Persistent hyperreactivity could increase the risk of short- and/or long-term complications, such as hypertension. Here we determined whether incipient dysfunction in a smoker's infant persists or worsens with age, by comparing cardiovascular reflex function of control and tobacco-exposed infants longitudinally from birth to 1 year. We compared infants born at term to nonsmoking couples (controls; n=19) and mothers who smoked moderately (average consumption=15 cigarettes per day; n=17). All were tested at 1 to 3 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year during sleep. We recorded blood pressure and heart rate noninvasively during passive repositioning (60 head-up tilt). Tilting control infants raised blood pressure slightly above baseline at 1 week (+2%) and much more at 1 year (+10%). This trend was reversed in the tobacco-exposed cohort (+10% at 1 week but only +4% at 1 year). At 3 months and 1 year, the heart rate response of tobacco-exposed infants to tilt was also abnormal (highly exaggerated). Our study reveals that maternal smoking leads to long-lasting "reprogramming" of infant blood pressure control mechanisms. The underlying dysfunction in a smoker's infant could plausibly be a precursor or early marker of long-term susceptibility to complications, such as raised blood pressure.

AB Background: Previous studies indicate that children may experience disrupted cortisol secretion in child care. The extent to which this is a transient or long-term disruption is not known, as most studies have relied on cross-sectional designs, and age-heterogeneous small sample sizes. This study aims to (a) compare cortisol secretion measured at home and in child care at 2 and 3 years of age, (b) investigate cortisol changes from 2 to 3 years of age, (c) examine whether age at initiation of child care is associated with cortisol secretion, and (d) investigate whether cortisol secretion in child care is linked to behavioural problems. Methods: Saliva samples were collected in a cohort of children recruited at 2 years of age from a larger population sample composed of women seen for the first time during pregnancy. Saliva was sampled twice a day (morning and afternoon) over two consecutive days at home and in child care at 2 (n = 155) and 3 years of age (n = 116). Interviews regarding the familial socioeconomic background and child care history were conducted with the mothers. Results: At 2 years of age, children showed a flat diurnal cortisol pattern in child care and a decreasing pattern at home. At age 3 years, children showed decreasing patterns both at home and in child care. Also at 3 years, children with less child care experience (i.e., entry after 16 months) had higher cortisol levels in child care and lower levels at home. In contrast, those with more experience (i.e., entry prior to 8 months) had lower cortisol in child care and higher cortisol at home. Conclusion: The different patterns of diurnal secretion observed in child care as compared to home is transient for most children, diminishing as they get older, whereas home and child care overall levels later on may be influenced by the cumulated experience with child care.

AB Introduction: Sleep disorders in the United States are pervasive and have been linked to increased risk of injury, morbidity, and mortality. Smoking is a known risk factor for sleep disorders; the association between secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and sleep disorders is less clear. We sought to examine the relationship between SHS exposure and sleep disorders among a representative sample of U. S. adults (n = 4,123).
   Methods: Data were from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between both smoking and SHS exposure with two measures of sleep disorder (i.e., self-reported health care provider diagnosis and self-report of two or more sleep symptoms). SHS exposure status was based on a combination of self-report and serum cotinine levels.
   Results: Relative to nonsmokers without SHS exposure, smokers were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with a sleep disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 1.73 [95% CI = 1.16-2.60]) and more likely to report at least two sleep disorder symptoms (OR = 1.42 [95% CI = 1.09-1.84]). SHS-exposed nonsmokers were not significantly more likely to report a sleep disorder or sleep symptoms (OR = 1.43 [95% CI = 0.79-2.57] and OR = 1.03 [95% CI = 0.83-1.27]), respectively.
   Discussion: Although smoking appears to play an important role in the prevalence of sleep disorders in the U. S. adult population, the role of SHS exposure is inconclusive and warrants further investigation.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the involvement of peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity in the ventilatory pattern during sleep in preterm neonates exposed in utero to maternal smoking.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral chemoreceptor activity was measured at thermoneutrality in neonates (postmenstrual age: 36.1 +/- 1.2 weeks) born to nonsmoking (n = 21) or smoking (n = 16) mothers by performing a 30-second hyperoxic test during active and quiet sleep. Blood oxygen saturation, baseline ventilatory parameters, and central apnea were monitored.
   RESULTS: Prenatal smoking exposure did not modify baseline ventilation. It was interesting to note that prenatal smoking exposure decreased the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity during active sleep and increased the response time during quiet sleep. These changes could explain the increase in the time spent in apnea (both with and without blood oxygen desaturation) and in the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation found in neonates exposed to smoking in utero. The involvement of a change in the chemoreceptor function is supported by the fact that the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity was negatively correlated with the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation in the control group only.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that prenatal smoking exposure does not directly modify baseline ventilatory parameters in the neonate but has a negative impact on peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity. These alterations may increase the risk of sleep respiratory disorders, especially via apnea with desaturation. Pediatrics 2010;125:e592-e599

AB Background: Children who were born prematurely are at higher risk for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) compared to their same-age peers who were born fullterm.
   Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of SDB symptoms and effects on growth among preterm infants while they are still infants, with a goal of identifying risk factors to facilitate prevention and early intervention.
   Methods: The Louisville pediatric SDB risk survey was administered to the primary caretakers of prematurely born infants attending the Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic at West Virginia University Children's Hospital.
   Results: Participation was 100% among 173 consecutive patients invited to participate in the study. At 9.13 months corrected age, 8.1% of infants born at a mean of 31.6 weeks gestation were reported to snore >= 3 days/week, a rate consistent with diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing among older children. A composite of nine parent-reported symptoms was created based on factor analysis. Birth weight and size for gestational age at birth did not differ between snoring groups or correlate with the composite score. But a significant negative correlation between the composite risk for SOB score and current weight for adjusted age percentile score indicate that infants with higher SDB symptom profiles have lower weight for age (r = -.18, p = .028).
   Conclusions: SDB symptoms are detectable among infants born preterm, while they are still infants. Because of their preferential risk for SDB and its somatic consequences, a primary research goal should be description of the natural history of SDB and identification of modifiable risk factors and treatment options.

AB Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the associated risk of RLS with pregnancy in relation to the family history and the age of symptom onset of RLS.
   Methods and subjects: Data from a prior RLS family history study in which 1019 subjects (527 males, 492 females) were interviewed, provided a diagnosis and characterization of RLS and determination of pregnancy status on which the current study analysis was undertaken.
   Results: In the family members of RLS probands, the prevalence of RLS was significantly higher for parous women than for nulliparous women (49.5% vs. 33.7%, OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.16-3.19) or for men (49.5% vs. 30.0%, OR 2.29, 1.69-3.10), but no different for nulliparous women compared to men (33.7% vs. 30.0%, OR 1.19, 0.72-1.96). When only those whose RLS started at or after age 30 were considered, similar differences occurred. These differences were not observed among family members of control probands.
   Conclusions: These data indicate pregnancy has a major impact on the risk of developing RLS for those with a family history of RLS. This pregnancy effect appears to account for most of the gender differences often reported in overall RLS prevalence data. (C) 2009 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

CA Ethiopia Malaria Indicator Survey
TI Malaria indicator survey 2007, Ethiopia: coverage and use of major
   malaria prevention and control interventions

AB Background: In 2005, a nationwide survey estimated that 6.5% of households in Ethiopia owned an insecticide-treated net (ITN), 17% of households had been sprayed with insecticide, and 4% of children under five years of age with a fever were taking an anti-malarial drug. Similar to other sub-Saharan African countries scaling-up malaria interventions, the Government of Ethiopia set an ambitious national goal in 2005 to (i) provide 100% ITN coverage in malarious areas, with a mean of two ITNs per household; (ii) to scale-up indoor residual spraying of households with insecticide (IRS) to cover 30% of households targeted for IRS; and (iii) scale-up the provision of case management with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), particularly at the peripheral level.
   Methods: A nationally representative malaria indicator survey (MIS) was conducted in Ethiopia between September and December 2007 to determine parasite and anaemia prevalence in the population at risk and to assess coverage, use and access to scaled-up malaria prevention and control interventions. The survey used a two-stage random cluster sample of 7,621 households in 319 census enumeration areas. A total of 32,380 people participated in the survey. Data was collected using standardized Roll Back Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group MIS household and women's questionnaires, which were adapted to the local context.
   Results: Data presented is for households in malarious areas, which according to the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health are defined as being located <2,000 m altitude. Of 5,083 surveyed households, 3,282 (65.6%) owned at least one ITN. In ITN-owning households, 53.2% of all persons had slept under an ITN the prior night, including 1,564/2,496 (60.1%) children <5 years of age, 1,891/3,009 (60.9%) of women 15 - 49 years of age, and 166/266 (65.7%) of pregnant women. Overall, 906 (20.0%) households reported to have had IRS in the past 12 months. Of 747 children with reported fever in the two weeks preceding the survey, 131 (16.3%) sought medical attention within 24 hours. Of those with fever, 86 (11.9%) took an anti-malarial drug and 41 (4.7%) took it within 24 hours of fever onset. Among 7,167 surveyed individuals of all ages, parasitaemia as estimated by microscopy was 1.0% (95% CI 0.5 - 1.5), with 0.7% and 0.3% due to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, respectively. Moderate-severe anaemia (haemoglobin <8 g/dl) was observed in 239/3,366 (6.6%, 95% CI 4.9-8.3) children <5 years of age.
   Conclusions: Since mid-2005, the Ethiopian National Malaria Control Programme has considerably scaled-up its malaria prevention and control interventions, demonstrating the impact of strong political will and a committed partnership. The MIS showed, however, that besides sustaining and expanding malaria intervention coverage, efforts will have to be made to increase intervention access and use. With ongoing efforts to sustain and expand malaria intervention coverage, to increase intervention access and use, and with strong involvement of the community, Ethiopia expects to achieve its targets in terms of coverage and uptake of interventions in the coming years and move towards eliminating malaria.

AB Excessive gestational weight gain has been shown to relate to high-postpartum weight retention and the development of overweight and obesity later in life. Because many women are concerned about the health of their babies during pregnancy and are in frequent contact with their healthcare providers, pregnancy may be an especially powerful "teachable moment" for the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity behaviors among women. Initial research suggests that helping women gain the recommended amount during pregnancy through healthy eating and physical activity could make a major contribution to the prevention of postpartum weight retention. However, more randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to identify the most effective and disseminable intervention. Providers have the potential to prevent high postpartum weight retention and future obesity by monitoring weight gain during pregnancy and giving appropriate advice about recommended amounts of gestational weight gain.

AB Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects 11 per cent of pre-menopausal women though it often remains undetected. Women may present differently than men, and the classic findings of snoring, witnessed apnoeas and sleepiness may not be observed. Factors which predispose to OSA include polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, retromicrognathia, and hypothyroidism. OSA may contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction, depression, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Emerging evidence indicates that snoring and OSA increase during pregnancy. For normal women with normotensive, low-risk pregnancies the prevalence of OSA is very low. Among normotensive pregnant women with high risk pregnancies, the prevalence of OSA is high and is even higher among those with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia during pregnancy. Incident snoring, which is a marker for OSA, is associated with an increased risk of developing gestational hypertension. Recent studies indicate that OSA per se is an independent risk factor for gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and may contribute to other poor obstetrical outcomes. The diagnostic test of choice for OSA is a polysomnography with electroencephalogram. Milder degree of disease than what is usually considered clinically significant among men or non-pregnant women appears to be relevant for foetomaternal outcomes. There seems to be benefit for blood pressure control to treating even milder degrees of OSA with CPAP, both acutely and over the 9 months of pregnancy. Chronic hypertensive women should be strongly considered for diagnosis and treatment of OSA prior to or beginning as early as possible in pregnancy to help maintain blood pressure control. Increasing awareness of OSA among maternal health care providers is important given the potential benefits for pregnancy and other health-related outcomes associated with identification and treatment of OSA.

AB The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone.

AB Objective: Evidence on the validity of parental recall of early childhood behavior is lacking. Our aim was to examine the validity of parental recall at child age 10-12 years for maternal lifestyle during pregnancy, the birth characteristics, and early childhood behavior.
   Study Design and Setting: The study population comprised 2,230 children and their parents. Children aged 10-12 years were recruited from elementary schools (response: 76.0%). Parents were asked to recall lifestyle during pregnancy, birth characteristics, and childhood behavior at age 4-6 years. Recalled data were compared with information registered by Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH) from birth onwards.
   Results: For birth weight and gestational age, we found no systematic difference between recalled and PCH-registered data; 95% limits of agreement were +/- 1.2 pounds (600 g) and +/- 2.4 weeks, respectively. For maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and early childhood behavior problems, Cohen's kappas were low (0.03-0.11). Compared with PCH registration, parents tended to overreport at age 10-12 years. In contrast, kappa was high for maternal smoking during pregnancy (0.77).
   Conclusion: Retrospectively collected information on lifestyle during pregnancy, birth, and early childhood behavior is sometimes biased, which limits its value in estimating the contribution of early-life adversity to health in later life. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim:
   To report the stability of parent-perceived child irregular eating from 6 months to 14 years of age and to investigate a predictive model inclusive of child and parent factors.
   Methods:
   Of the 7223 singleton children in a birth cohort, 5122 children were re-interviewed at 5 years and 4554 for the 14-year analysis. Information was obtained from structured interviews including questions answered by parents of the child at birth, 6 months, 5 years and 14 years; and by teenagers at age 14 years and from physical measures of the child. The mother's perception that the child was an irregular eater at age 14 years was the major outcome variable of interest.
   Results:
   Approximately 40% of irregular eaters at age 5 will still be irregular eaters at age 14 years. This was not related to maternal education or socio-economic class. Significant at multivariate analysis were infant feeding problems and the children's ability to regulate their sleep and mood. Significant maternal factors were greater age, not feeling positive about the baby and persistent maternal anxiety during the child's early years.
   Conclusion:
   Irregular eating behaviour displays considerable continuity from childhood to mid-adolescence. Independent contributions to this behavioural phenotype include child biological and psychological factors and maternal anxiety during the child's early years.

AB Background:
   Following the change from prone to supine in preferred sleeping position, the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in Sweden fell from 1.1 per 1000 live births in 1992 to 0.41 in 1995. After a further small decline, we have been experiencing a plateau at around 0.25 since 2000.
   Aim:
   To identify the changes that have occurred in the epidemiology of SIDS since the end of the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study in 1995.
   Methods:
   Data from the Medical Birth Register of Sweden, covering the years 1995-2005, were used. Sleeping position is not included in the register.
   Results:
   The incidence of SIDS has remained low in Sweden. Independent risk factors were smoking during early pregnancy, parents not living together, low maternal age, high parity and short gestational age. The odds ratio for smoking has continued to increase and the median age of death has continued to decrease since the previous study. We found no signs of seasonality in the current material.
   Conclusions:
   Age at death continued to decrease. The high incidence during weekends persisted. Seasonality was not significant. There was no evidence of a changing effect from risk factors in the studied period.

TI Quality of life evaluation of children with sleep bruxism
SO BMC ORAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The study of potential factors associated with sleep bruxism (SB) may help in determining the etiology of such parafunction. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of children with SB by means of a generic scale, in addition to the association of sociodemographic characteristics and other parafunctional habits.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included healthy children of both genders, aged 7.18 +/- 0.59 years, with (n = 25) and without (n = 69) signs and symptoms of SB. Data were collected in caries-free children from public schools by applying a translated and validated version of the Autoquestionnaire Qualite de Vie Enfant Image (AUQUEI), clinical examination and interview with the parents. The psychometric properties evaluated for the scale referred to internal consistency (ceiling and floor effects, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, Items Correlation Matrix, and corrected Item-Total Correlation) and the discriminant validity (t-test). By means of logistic regression with stepwise backward elimination, associations were evaluated between SB and age, gender, body mass index, maternal use of alcohol/tobacco/medicine during pregnancy, maternal age at birth, parent's schooling, presence of sucking habit, nail biting, enuresis, number of children, child's order (first born), occurrence of divorce/parent's death, and AUQUEI scores.
   Results: The results of the AUQUEI psychometric analysis showed homogeneity of items and a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.65; no negative correlations between the items were found. The mean AUQUEI scores for children with SB did not differ significantly from those of children without the parafunction. Only the independent variable "maternal age at birth" showed a significant negative association with SB.
   Conclusions: In the studied sample, children with SB presented scores of QoL that were similar to those without the parafunction, and children from the youngest mothers were more likely to present SB.

   HEART-DISEASE; APNEA; WOMEN; POPULATION; MEN; DISTURBANCES; HYPERTENSION
AB Background: Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, considered endemic in modern society, are associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.
   Methods: A cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records. Generalized linear models were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively.
   Results: After adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women sleeping <= 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR = 5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69). The corresponding RR for lean women (<25 kg/m(2)) was 3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (>= 25 kg/m(2)). Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94). The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who snored. Compared with lean women who did not snore, those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI 2.87-16.6).
   Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM. Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise estimates of observed associations.

   BODY CONDITION; PONY MARES; LONG-TERM; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS
AB Equidae are born in the spring. This is due to the fact that mares go through a period of anovulation from October to the end of April. For breeders, bringing forward the first ovulation presents an enormous advantage, as it increases the number of usable cycles in the mare and increases the actual age of the offspring at the time of sports performance or slaughter. In mares under our latitudes, the first ovulation can be moved to its earliest by using 14.5 h of daily light for 35 days, beginning around the winter solstice. This treatment is robust, as repeated accidents do not affect its outcome.
   The administration of melatonin to pony mares during winter ovarian inactivity, either daily in the evening or with a subcutaneous implant, suppresses the photostimulating effect of long days (LD). On the other hand, the use of this implant around the summer solstice brings forward the first ovulation, as in photostimulated mares, thereby confirming the existence of an annual endogenous rhythm. These implants inserted under the same conditions in non-pregnant mares do not induced ovarian inactivity. Therefore, the role of melatonin seems limited to the timing of winter inactivity.
   In thin but healthy mares subjected to the natural photoperiod, winter inactivity is systematic and long lasting. This inhibition, induced by the feed restriction, masks the effect of the photostimulation. On the other hand, 60% of fat mares have cycles all year long, and in the remaining 40%, the period of inactivity is very short, missing only one or two cycles. Increasing the feed in thin mares in autumn or winter seems to have no effect on the date of the first annual ovulation. Nutrition is the main cause of ovarian inactivity in winter, but it does not play a role in the resumption of activity in the spring. The mechanism inhibiting the cycles in autumn results from an interaction between short days and a negative energy balance. This nutrition-photoperiod interaction seems to be applicable to numerous species in temperate areas.

AB The objectives were to describe the association between body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), body composition and risk factors to metabolic diseases; observe the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and list the characteristics of overweight and obese women. Voluntaries (n=50; BMI=31 +/- 6; age=36 +/- 11 years old), were evaluated regarding clinical examination, anthropometrics measurements, samples of blood and urine, resting energy expenditure and food register. Phases in which they become obese in descending order: adulthood, pregnancy, adolescence, over 40 years old and after marriage. The odds to have one or more obese family members were 316%. They were anxious (60%), depressives (12%), compulsives (34%) and had sleep disturbance (32%). The odds to dyslipidemia was 28%, to hypertension was 25% and to glucose over 100 mg/dL 35%. They were in caloric deficit, but, nitrogen balance was positive. The metabolic syndrome was present in 25% of these women and was positively correlated with body fat indicators and age. The obesity of these women seems to be multifactorial with a family influence that could be caused by genetics and environment contributions. The emotional/physical balance should be influenced on this process.

AB Background
   Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for their newborns during this time.
   Objectives
   The primary objective was to assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered by an educator to an individual or group on infant general health and parent-infant relationships.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to July 2009), ERIC (1966 to July 2009), HealthSTAR (1966 to July 2009), PsycINFO (1806 to July 2009), Sociological Abstracts (1974 to July 2009), ClinicalTrials.gov (August 2009), Current Controlled Trials (August 2009), and Trialscentral.org (August 2009).
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided by an educator to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post birth related to the care of an infant or parent-infant relationships. We excluded studies of educational interventions for parents of infants in neonatal intensive care units.
   Data collection and analysis
   Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports.
   Main results
   Of the 25 trials (3689 mothers and 793 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2868 mothers and 613 fathers) reported useable data. Educational interventions included: four on infant sleep enhancement, 13 on infant behaviour, two on general post-birth health, two on infant care, three on infant safety, and one on father involvement/skills with infants. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only six were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these six meta-analyses, only two were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education on sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. Education on infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91).
   Authors' conclusions
   The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education on sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep and education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm this.

AB This paper is looking at the effect of maternal smoking on 10 year intrauterine growth restricted compared to normal children. Lomb periodogram and Poincare plots were used for this assessment.
   It is found that during waking, the LF/HF ratio showed IUGR children whose mothers did or did not smoke during pregnancy have elevated levels (2.66, 2.89) respectively, compared to the normal groups (2.23, 2.18). During sleep, the LF/HF ratio was (0.69, 0.79) for IUGR children, and (0.52, 0.52) for normal children.
   The Poincare analysis of long-term variability suggested that IUGR children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy have less long term HRV during sleep (SD2=148.53ms) than their healthy counterparts whose mothers smoked (SD2=182.87ms), p=0.02, and significantly lower short-term variability value was found for IUGR asthmatic children whose mothers smoked.

AB Nocturnal leg cramps are a frequent cause of sleep disturbance among the general population, especially among the elderly. These painful episodes can delay sleep onset and awaken the patient from sleep, as well as delay subsequent return to sleep. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Although most cases of leg cramps are idiopathic, multiple secondary causes of sleep-related leg cramps have been identified as well. In this article, we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and risk factors and discuss the salient features of the diagnosis and workup. Finally, we review the wide array of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments that have been studied for nocturnal leg cramps.

AB Introduction: Malaria causes an overwhelmingly large number of cases and deaths round the globe every year. Insecticide treated nets (ITNs) have become important tools that provide a simple, but effective means of preventing malaria in highly endemic areas.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design was used to investigate possession, utilization, and factors affecting possession and utilization of ITNs in Arbaminch Town and the malarious villages of Arbaminch Zuria District, southern Ethiopia from 22(nd) January to 1(st) February 2007 on a sample of 454 households. Data were collected using structured, pretested, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data entry and analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 for windows. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out.
   Results: The coverage for any net and ITN was 75.1% and 58.8% respectively; the utilization rate for any net and ITN by any member of the household the night prior to the study was 71% and 73% respectively. Both coverage and utilization were higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The proportion of pregnant women and children under five years who slept under ITNs the night preceding the study was 35% and 40.3% respectively. Education and income of head of households, place of residence of households and presence of high risk groups in the household were found to be predictors of net possession. Sex and income of head of households, and presence of radio in the households were predictors of utilization of nets by any household member. Education of head of households and place of residence of households were predictors of utilization of nets by high risk groups.
   Conclusion: A wide gap exists between coverage and utilization of ITNs. Use of ITNs by high risk groups is far below the Abuja target. Appropriate BCC interventions are required to narrow the gap between coverage and utilization of ITNs and to escalate use of ITNs by high-risk groups. [Ethiop. J. Health Dev. 2009; 24(1):15-24]

AB Objectives: Our objective in this study was to investigate the effects of gestational diabetes (GDM) on women's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after delivery. This study investigates the differences between a GDM group and a control group.
   Study Design: Using random sampling, 100 women who had had GDM were selected from a birth register. Glucose tolerance tests administered to these participants during pregnancy had yielded I or 2 abnormal values. The control group (n = 100) consisted of women who had normal glucose tolerance test during pregnancy. The informants were invited to a personal meeting, where their weight and height were measured and where they also answered the 15D questionnaire. Data were analysed with chi(2)-test, Mann-Whitney-test, independent samples t-test and regression analysis.
   Results: The results for investigating the HRQoL indicated no significant differences on the 15D dimensions between the GDM group and the control group. The HRQoL for both groups was weakest on the dimensions of sleeping, discomfort and symptoms. Furthermore, the control group had a lower vitality score than the GDM group did. Analysis of the influence of background factors on HRQoL showed that women in a relationship experienced higher quality of life than single women.
   Conclusion: This study showed no indication that women's lowered HRQoL, as measured by the 15D instrument, could be partly explained by GDM. Women's HRQoL was insignificantly decreased on the dimension of vitality only, so finding motivation for lifestyle changes and diabetes self-care may become challenging.

AB The magnitude of the detrimental effects following in utero alcohol exposure, including fetal alcohol syndrome and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), is globally underestimated. The effects include irreversible cognitive and behavioral disabilities as a result of abnormal brain development, pre- and postnatal growth retardation and facial dysmorphism. Parental alcohol exposure and its effect on offspring has been recognized for centuries, but only recently have we begun to gain molecular insight into the mechanisms involved in alcohol teratogenesis. Genetic attributes (susceptibility and protective alleles) of the mother and the fetus contribute to the risk of developing FASD and specific additional environmental conditions, including malnutrition, have an important role. The severity of FASD depends on the level of alcohol exposure, the developmental stage at which exposure occurs and the nature of the exposure (chronic or acute), and although the most vulnerable period is during the first trimester, damage can occur throughout gestation. Preconception alcohol exposure can also have a detrimental effect on the offspring. Several developmental pathways are affected in FASD, including nervous system development, growth and remodeling of tissues, as well as metabolic pathways that regulate glucocorticoid signaling and balanced levels of retinol, insulin and nitric oxide. A body of knowledge has accumulated to support the role of environmentally induced epigenetic remodeling during gametogenesis and after conception as a key mechanism for the teratogenic effects of FASD that persist into adulthood. Transgenerational effects are likely to contribute to the global burden of alcohol-related disease. FASD results in lifelong disability and preventative programs should include both maternal alcohol abstention and preconception alcohol avoidance.

AB Objective: To evaluate maximal respiratory pressures, pulmonary volumes and capacities and exercise functional capacity in pregnant women with preeclampsia. Method: Primigravid women with preeclampsia and healthy primigravid women were evaluated by means of manovacuometry, spirometry and the 6-minute walk test. Results: The group with preeclampsia showed higher minute ventilation and lower forced vital capacity and exercise tolerance. The presence of preeclampsia and forced vital capacity were predictors in the six-minute walk test. Conclusion: Preeclampsia showed significant alterations in the respiratory system and was associated with lower exercise tolerance; however, it did not affect respiratory muscle functions.

AB Parents experiencing early parenting difficulties often seek support through parenting programs. Characteristics of mothers seeking parenting support and information at an early parenting center in Victoria, Australia and the relationships between these factors and parenting behavior were explored using an observational measure of parent-child interaction. Participants were 43 mothers and children attending a 5-day residential parenting program at the Queen Elizabeth Centre. Maternal and sociodemo-graphic data as well as an observational mother-child interaction task from the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Parent Child Interaction Teaching scale were completed and scored on the first day of the program. Certain maternal factors and experiences were associated with observed parenting behavior. Poorer maternal sleeping quality, unplanned pregnancy and preterm birth were all associated with less optimal parenting behavior in certain domains. Findings are discussed with reference to the impact of past experiences around pregnancy and birth as well as the Current context and well-being of mothers attending early parenting centers.

AB Circadian rhythms and "clock gene" expression are involved in successful reproductive cycles, mating, and pregnancy. Alterations or disruptions of biological rhythms, as commonly occurs in shift work, jet lag, sleep deprivation, or clock gene knock out models, are linked to significant disruptions in reproductive function. These impairments include altered hormonal secretion patterns, reduced conception rates, increased miscarriage rates and an increased risk of breast cancer. Female health may be particularly susceptible to the impact of desynchronizing work schedules as perturbed hormonal rhythms can further influence the expression patterns of clock genes. Estrogen modifies clock gene expression in the uterus, ovaries, and suprachiasmatic nucleus, the site of the primary circadian clock mechanism. Further work investigating clock genes, light exposure, ovarian hormones, and reproductive function will be critical for indentifying how these factors interact to impact health and susceptibility to disease.

AB The current study compared the performances of pregnant women with education- and age-matched controls on a variety of measures that assessed perceptual speed, short-term and working memory capacity, subjective memory complaints, sleep quality, level of fatigue, executive functioning, episodic and prospective memory, and crystallized and fluid intelligence. A primary purpose was to test the hypothesis of Henry and Rendell (2007) that pregnancy-related declines in cognitive functioning would be especially evident in tasks that place a high demand on executive processes. We also investigated a parallel hypothesis: that the pregnant women would experience a broad-based reduction in cognitive capability. Very limited support was found for the executive functioning hypothesis. Pregnant women scored lower only on the measure of verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, COWAT) but not on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task or on any working memory measures. Furthermore, group differences in COWAT performance disappeared after controlling for verbal IQ (Shipley vocabulary). In addition, there was no support for the general decline hypothesis. We conclude that pregnancy-associated differences in performance observed in the current study were relatively mild and rarely reached either clinical or practical significance.

AB Purpose: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in Taiwan.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 third-trimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale.
   Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score > 5) was 60.0% for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0% for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3% to 36.0%) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women.
   Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression.
   Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.

AB We examined background information and course of labour from a cohort of 2,810 low-risk nulliparas to identify possible lifestyle and anthropometrical risk indicators for dystocia. Criteria for dystocia: cervical dilatation <2 cm over 4 h during labour's active phase, or no descent during 2 h (3 h with epidural) in the descending phase, or no progress for 1 h during the expulsive phase. After adjustments, athletics or heavy gardening >= 4 h per week appeared protective for dystocia (OR 0.63, CI 0.45-0.89), contrary to a non-significant finding of intensive physical training (OR 1.57, CI 0.84-2.93). Caffeine intake of 200-299 mg/day was associated with dystocia (OR 1.37, CI 1.04-1.80); also high maternal age (OR 2.25, CI 1.58-3.22), small stature (OR 2.18, CI 1.51-3.15) and pre-pregnancy overweight (OR 1.28, CI 1.02-1.61). No association was found between dystocia and alcohol intake, smoking, night sleep and options for resting during the day.

AB The current study explored the relationship between maternal subjective sleep quality and two factors that have been independently linked to maternal sleep: infant caretaking at night and maternal depressive symptom severity. Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD=4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD=1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD=33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman's sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period.

AB Fatigue is a commonly reported problem for new parents. Considering that maternal fatigue is a risk factor for depression in the post-partum period, and that post-partum depression is associated with parent and child outcomes, it is important to investigate the relationship between fatigue, parenting, and child development. Further, given that research in areas other than parenting suggests that fatigue has a negative impact on performance via executive functioning, it is argued that parenting, being reliant on executive functioning, is likely to be disturbed by fatigue. Despite this, there is limited research investigating the relationship between fatigue, parenting, and child development. This paper applies the Optimal Parenting Development model to these constructs to propose a model for investigating the relationships between fatigue, parenting, child outcomes, and factors that may mediate these relationships.

AB Malfunction of the circadian clock has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. We show that mice lacking the core clock components Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and Cryptochrome-2 (Cry2) (Cry-null mice) show salt-sensitive hypertension due to abnormally high synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone by the adrenal gland. An extensive search for the underlying cause led us to identify type VI 3 beta-hydroxyl-steroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b6) as a new hypertension risk factor in mice. Hsd3b6 is expressed exclusively in aldosterone-producing cells and is under transcriptional control of the circadian clock. In Cry-null mice, Hsd3b6 messenger RNA and protein levels are constitutively high, leading to a marked increase in 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase (3 beta-HSD) enzymatic activity and, as a consequence, enhanced aldosterone production. These data place Hsd3b6 in a pivotal position through which circadian clock malfunction is coupled to the development of hypertension. Translation of these findings to humans will require clinical examination of human HSD3B1 gene, which we found to be functionally similar to mouse Hsd3b6.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances during pregnancy among healthy nulliparous women.
   METHODS: This was a prospective, cohort study of healthy nulliparous women, recruited between 6 and 20 weeks of gestation, who completed a baseline sleep survey at enrollment with follow-up in the third trimester. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: Berlin Questionnaire for Sleep Disordered Breathing, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, National Institutes of Health/international Restless Legs Syndrome Question Set, Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Differences in sleep characteristics between the baseline and third trimester were compared using the paired t test or McNemar test for continuous or categorical data, respectively.
   RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine women completed both baseline and follow-up sleep surveys. The mean gestational age was 13.8 (+/- 3.8) and 30.0 (+/- 2.2) weeks at the first and second surveys, respectively. Compared with the baseline assessment, mean sleep duration was significantly shorter (7.4 [+/- 1.21 hours compared with 7.0 [+/- 1.3] hours, P<.001), and the proportion of patients who reported frequent snoring (at least three nights per week) was significantly greater (11% compared with 16.4%, P=.03) in the third trimester. The percentage of patients who met diagnostic criteria for restless leg syndrome increased from 17.5% at recruitment to 31.2% in the third trimester (P=.001). Overall poor sleep quality, as defined by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score greater than 5, became significantly more common as pregnancy progressed (39.0% compared with 53.50%, P=.001).
   CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are prevalent among healthy nulliparous women and increase significantly during pregnancy. (Obstet Gynecol 2070,115:77-83)

   Sleep disturbances are common among pregnant women and safe treatments to improve sleep are needed. Generally, physical activity improves sleep, but studies are lacking on the associations of physical activity with sleep among pregnant women. Our aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association of various modes of physical activity and activity clusters with sleep quality and duration among 1259 pregnant women. Participants were recruited into the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study from prenatal clinics at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. Women self-reported sleep quality and duration and physical activity in the past week. We used cluster analysis to create seven physical activity profiles and multivariable logistic regression analysis, with adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, parity, self-rated general health, anxiety and depressive symptoms.
   Women with higher levels of occupational physical activity were more likely to report either short or normal sleep duration than longer duration. Women with higher levels of indoor household physical activity were less likely to report normal sleep duration than shorter duration. Women in the recreational-indoor household activity cluster were less likely than women in the inactivity cluster to report normal sleep duration as compared with longer duration. Our data suggest weak associations of physical activity with sleep duration and quality in late pregnancy. Physical activity is recommended to pregnant women for health benefits, yet more research is needed to understand if physical activity should be recommended for improving sleep.

AB Evidence in humans and rodents suggests the importance of circadian rhythmicity in parturition. A molecular clock underlies the generation of circadian rhythmicity. While this molecular clock has been identified in numerous tissues, the expression and regulation of clock genes in tissues relevant to parturition is largely undefined. Here, the expression and regulation of the clock genes Bmal1, Clock, cryptochrome (Cry1/2) and period (Per1/2) was examined in the murine gravid uterus, placenta and fetal membranes during late gestation. All clock genes examined were expressed in the tissues of interest throughout the last third of gestation. Upregulation of a subset of these clock genes was observed in each of these tissues in the final two days of gestation. Oscillating expression of mRNA for a subset of the examined clock genes was detected in the gravid uterus, placenta and fetal membranes. Furthermore, bioluminescence recording on explants from gravid Per2::luciferase mice indicated rhythmic expression of PER2 protein in these tissues. These data demonstrate expression and rhythmicity of clock genes in tissues relevant to parturition indicating a potential contribution of peripheral molecular clocks to this process.

AB Background and Methods: Malaria in Africa is most severe in young children and pregnant women, particularly in rural and poor households. In many countries, malaria intervention coverage rates have increased as a result of scale up; but this may mask limited coverage in these highest-risk populations. Reports were reviewed from nationally representative surveys in African malaria-endemic countries from 2006 through 2008 to understand how reported intervention coverage rates reflect access by the most at-risk populations.
   Results: Reports were available from 27 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICSs), and Malaria Indicator Surveys (MISs) during this interval with data on household intervention coverage by urban or rural setting, wealth quintile, and sex. Household ownership of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) varied from 5% to greater than 60%, and was equitable by urban/rural and wealth quintile status among 13 (52%) of 25 countries. Malaria treatment rates for febrile children under five years of age varied from less than 10% to greater than 70%, and while equitable coverage was achieved in 8 (30%) of 27 countries, rates were generally higher in urban and richest quintile households. Use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women varied from 2% to more than 60%, and again tended to be higher in urban and richest quintile households. Across all countries, there were no significant male/female inequalities seen for children sleeping under ITNs or receiving antimalarial treatment for febrile illness. Parasitemia and anemia rates from eight national surveys showed predominance in poor and rural populations.
   Conclusions/Significance: Recent efforts to scale up malaria intervention coverage have achieved equity in some countries (especially with ITNs), but delivery methods in other countries are not addressing the most at-risk populations. As countries seek universal malaria intervention coverage, their delivery systems must reach the rural and poor populations; this is not a small task, but it has been achieved in some countries.

AB A suite of changes in circadian rhythms have been described in nocturnal rodents as females go through pregnancy and lactation, but there is no information on such patterns in diurnal species. As the challenges faced by these two groups of animals are somewhat different, we characterized changes in activity and core body temperature (T-b) in female diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as they went through a series of reproductive states: virgin, pregnant, pregnant and lactating, lactating only, and post-weaning. The phase of neither rhythm varied, but the amplitude did. Females increased their overall levels of daily activity from early to late pregnancy. regardless of whether they were also lactating. The pattern of activity was less rhythmic during early than mid-lactation, in both non-pregnant and pregnant females. as a consequence of a decrease in daytime relative to nighttime activity. The T-b rhythm amplitude dropped from mid-pregnancy through mid-lactation, and there were rises in T-b troughs during the mid-light and mid-dark phases of the day, though pregnancy and lactation affected T-b at these times in somewhat different ways. This study demonstrates that rhythms in diurnal grass rats change during pregnancy and lactation in different ways than those of nocturnal species that have been studied to date and that the effects of pregnancy and lactation are not additive in any simple way.

   labour; Women's symptoms of labour onset; Midwives' assessment
ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ACTIVE LABOR; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM
AB Aim The study aimed to assess the time of labour onset and its symptoms as perceived by women in labour and midwives, and the relationship between these and first stage duration.
   Methods A longitudinal cohort study of women with a singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation was performed in 41 maternity units. The sample comprised 1,170 women, 611 nulliparae (np) and 559 multiparae (mp), who answered two standardized questions on the onset of labour and selected the applicable symptoms of labour onset from a list of eight. A multivariate Cox regression model was computed covering further perinatal factors.
   Results The median durations of the first stage of labour as assessed by the women themselves were 11 (np) and 6.5 h (mp), and as assessed by the midwives 7 (np) and 4 h (mp). Median time intervals between the start of labour onset symptoms as perceived by the women concerned and the midwives' diagnoses varied greatly: the shortest related to watery fluid loss (np = 1.5 h, mp = 0.0 h), the longest to alterations in sleep patterns (np = 11.5 h, mp = 4.5 h). Irregular pain, watery fluid loss and the time between self-diagnosed and professionally diagnosed onset of labour were just as closely associated with the duration of the first stage of labour as perinatal factors. Significant perinatal factors were induction with oxytocin, herbal remedies and PROM.
   Conclusions The perceptions of women in labour are as important as perinatal factors in determining the duration of the first stage of labour and should be taken into account in intrapartum care.

AB Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%) reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525 (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.

AB This study prospectively examined the separate and combined influences of maternal prenatal anxiety disorder and postnatal caregiving sensitivity, on infants' salivary cortisol responses to the still-face procedure. Effects were assessed by measuring infant salivary cortisol upon arrival at the laboratory, and at 15-, 25-, and 40-min following the still-face procedure. Maternal symptoms of anxiety during the last 6 months of pregnancy were assessed using clinical diagnostic interview Data analyses using linear mixed models were based on 88 women and their 7-month-old infants. Prenatal anxiety and maternal sensitivity emerged as independent, additive moderators of infant cortisol reactivity, F (3, 180) = 3.29, p = .02, F (3, 179) = 2.68, p = .05 respectively. Results were independent of maternal prenatal depression symptoms, and postnatal symptoms of anxiety and depression. hifants' stress-induced cortisol secretion patterns appear to relate not only to exposure to maternal prenatal anxiety, but also to maternal caregiving sensitivity,, irrespective of prenatal psychological state.

AB Background: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation.
   Aim: This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age.
   Participants: A national infant cohort (N=35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N=36) of low-risk infants born in the same period. Outcome measures: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups.
   Results: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics.
   Conclusions: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness patterns. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability is promising for assessing fetal condition. Before using spectral analysis for fetal monitoring it has to be determined whether there should be a correction for gestational age or behavioural state.
   Aims: Compare spectral values of heart rate variability between near term and post term fetuses during active and quiet sleep.
   Study design: Case-control. Cases had a gestational age of >= 42 weeks; controls were 36 to 37 weeks. Fetuses were matched for birth weight percentile.
   Subjects: STAN (R) registrations from healthy fetuses. For each fetus one 5-minute segment was selected during active and one during quiet sleep.
   Outcome measures: Absolute and normalized low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency power (0.4-1.5 Hz) of heart rate variability.
   Results: Twenty fetuses were included. No significant differences were found between cases and controls in absolute (481 and 429 respectively, P=0.88) or normalized low (0.78 and 0.80 respectively, P=0.50) or absolute (41 and 21 respectively, P=0.23) or normalized high frequency power (0.08 and 0.07 respectively, P=0.20) during active state. During rest, normalized low frequency power was lower (0.58 and 0.69 respectively. P=0.03) and absolute (16 and 10 respectively. P=0.04) and normalized high frequency power were higher (0.21 and 0.14 respectively, P=0.01) in cases compared to controls. Absolute and normalized low frequency power were higher during active state compared to rest in both groups (all P values <0.05).
   Conclusions: We found sympathetic predominance during active state in fetuses around term. Post term parasympathetic modulation during rest was increased compared to near term. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the impact of urinary incontinence in quality of life, epidemiological data, symptoms, findings of gynecological/neurological examination and urodynamic of HTLV-I seropositive women compared with HTLV-I negative women.
   Study design: 43 incontinent women were divided in two groups: 24 serropositives and 19 seronegatives for HTLV-I. We used King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), standardized recorded data and urodynamics. Data were compared using Mann-Whitney test or Chi-squared test.
   Results: Quality of life was significantly worse in seropositive incontinent women in the following parameters: general perception of health, impact of incontinence, limitation of daily life activities, social relations, sleep and disposition. Also, the following gynecological/neurological symptoms were more prevalent in seropositives: pain on vesical filling, dyspareunia, parestesis in inferior members, increased perineal sensitivity, pain in vaginal palpation, increased vaginal tonus, gait alteration, increased patellar reflex, Babinski reflex positive and increased tonus in inferior members.
   Conclusion: Poor quality of life and physical abnormalities were identified in incontinent HTLV-I seropositive women when compared with incontinent HTLV-I seronegative women. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary sustained and often painful muscle contraction, usually producing repetitive movements or abnormal positions of the mouth, jaw and/or tongue. We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a 1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible relationship between OMD and hormonal factors.

   PREGNANCY; COLD; MEN; ASSOCIATION; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN
AB This article will suggest that moderate sleep apnea may have an adaptive benefit, the reduction of nocturnal, respiratory heat loss, that may have caused it to be selected for despite the associated disadvantages. Sleep apnea is caused by the collapse of the throat, specifically the pharyngeal airway, during sleep and can result in discomfort and hypoxia. The large size of the fleshy structures in the pharynx and hypotonicity of the pharyngeal musculature are what cause humans, and many other species of mammals, to be susceptible to apnea. There are many functional and anatomical parallels between sleep apnea and a well known, thermoregulatory response that minimizes respiratory cooling in the lower airways known as reflex bronchoconstriction. Bronchoconstriction involves the constriction of the inner airways, the bronchioles, in response to cold air, a reaction that acts to warm inspired air before it makes contact with the more sensitive lower airways and alveoli. Because air is colder at night and body temperature drops severely during sleep, sleep apnea may represent a similar protective, thermoregulatory adaptation. When the pharynx is collapsed, the diameter of the pharyngeal airway decreases, allowing increased intermolecular collisions between inspired air and the epithelial walls of the upper airway. An increase in the number of collisions facilitates the transference of both warmth and humidity to inspired air before it reaches the more sensitive lower airway resulting in the maintenance of internal, core temperature and alveolar heat retention. In fact, sleep apnea can be conceptualized as a functional reversal of the thermoregulatory process of panting, where the pharynx is highly dilated instead of collapsed. Given the disorder associated with sleep apnea, the absence of a disease state secondary to surgical correction, the fact that the disorder is exclusive to warm-blooded animals, the high proclivity for collapse documented in pregnant mothers, and the functional similarities between collapse and reflex bronchoconstriction, it appears that the phenomenon may represent an evolutionary trade-off that helped to minimize respiratory cooling.

AB Postpartum maternal well being across cultures has received limited research attention. We examined relationships among stress, social support, and health in 152 Chinese mothers <1 year postpartum in the United States. These mothers did not perceive high levels of stress, although they did not receive as much support as they indicated they needed; 23.7% of mothers scored high for depressive symptoms. About half of the mothers experienced interrupted sleep, decrease in memory, and lack of sexual desire. All health measures were inter-correlated. Social support moderated the effects of stress on depressive symptoms. Culturally relevant care that is perceived as supportive may promote Postpartum maternal health.

AB Steeping arrangements under tong-lasting impregnated nets (LLIN) were recorded in 2467 households during the low malaria transmission season (May-June 2007) and the same families were followed up during the high malaria transmission season (December 2007-January 2008) in two malaria-endemic areas of Sri Lanka. Approximately 800 households each from the three main ethnic groups were studied. The number of families lost to follow-up was 68. A significant increase was seen in the proportion of households using LLINs the previous night during the high transmission season (96%) compared with the low transmission season (90%) (P <= 0.001 for all three ethnic groups). When sleeping arrangements of the entire population were considered, priority to steep under the LLIN was given to children under 5 years during both seasons. The percentage of children under five who slept under a LLIN increased from 75% during the low transmission season to 90% during the high transmission season. Utilisation of LLINs by pregnant women was tow; only approximately 45% of pregnant women reported sleeping under a LLIN during both seasons. The study suggests the possible need for re-focusing of health education messages regarding the importance of LLIN use among pregnant women. (C) 2008 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB A community randomized pre-test/post-test design was used to compare the knowledge and behaviors of microfinance clients receiving malaria education (n = 213) to those receiving diarrhea education (n = 223) and to non-client controls (n = 268). Comparisons assessed differences at follow-up as well as within-group changes over time. At follow-up, malaria clients had significantly better malaria knowledge than comparison groups: 48.4% of malaria clients were able to identify groups most vulnerable to malaria compared with 39.2% of diarrhea clients (P=0.044) and 37.7% of non-clients (P=0.024). Malaria clients were more likely than diarrhea clients (P=0.024) (P<0.001) and non-clients (P=0.028) (P=0.004) to report that insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) provide the best protection against malaria, and to agree that pregnant women should use ITNs, respectively. Between baseline and follow-up, malaria clients were most likely to: improve in knowledge of malaria complications during pregnancy; to own at least one bed net; and to report at least one child or woman of reproductive age sleeping under a bed net. Malaria clients also experienced the greatest increases in ITN ownership/use (9% vs. 2.9% and 6.7% among diarrhea clients and non-clients). Results indicate that, although significant barriers to malaria control remain, a malaria education program provided by microfinance institutions can effectively contribute to community and national malaria initiatives.

DT Article
AB Since she was eight, the 42-year-old woman had had type I diabetes that she had been managing with intensified conventional insulin therapy (ICT). She presented in our clinic in 1994 with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (status post laser coagulation and vitrectomy of both eyes), secondary glaucoma, macroalbuminuria with normal renal function, hypercholesterolaemia, and an inactive necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum on both pretibial regions of the lower legs. HbA(1c) was 8.5%, untreated hypertension showed systolic pressure of 140-160 mmHg and diastolic pressure of 105-110 mmHg. She had had two episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, the last of which occured in 1983. She started on insulin pump therapy in 1995. In 2005, at 38, she sought diabetological advice on the intent of becoming pregnant. After ceasing contraception, she conceived twice, both times ending in early miscarriages. During the preparatory phase of each pregnancy she suffered several times from sudden loss of consciousness with occasional grand mal seizures, tongue biting, and subsequent days of disorientation. After a preconceptional HbA(1c) of 7.2% she became pregnant again in 08/2007 She suffered two hypoglycaemic episodes in early pregnancy and another at 25 weeks, two of which occurred during sleep. At 38 weeks, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Twenty-three days later she once again experienced severe hypoglycaemia during an afternoon nap.

AB Testosterone (T) plays a key role in the increase and maintenance of muscle mass and bone density in adult men. Life history theory predicts that environmental stress may prompt a reallocation of such investments to those functions critical to survival. We tested this hypothesis in two studies of rural Bolivian adult men by comparing free T levels and circadian rhythms during late winter, which is especially severe, to those in less arduous seasons. For each pair of salivary T-AM/T-PM samples (collected in a similar to 12-h period), circadian rhythm was considered classic (C-CLASSIC) if T-AM > 110%T-PM, reverse (C-REVERSE) if T-PM > 110%T-AM, and flat (C-FLAT) otherwise. We tested the hypotheses that mean T-AM > mean T-PM and that mean T-LW < mean T-OTHER (LW = late winter, OTHER = other seasons). In Study A, of 115 T-PM-T-AM pairs, 51% = C-CLASSIC, 39% = C-REVERSE, 10% = C-FLAT; in Study B, of 184 T-AM-T-PM pairs, 55% = C-CLASSIC, 33% = C-REVERSE, 12% = C-FLAT. Based on fitting linear mixed models, in both studies TOTHER-AM > TOTHER-PM (A: P = 0.035, B: P = 0.0005) and TOTHER-AM > TLW-AM (A: P = 0.054, B: P = 0.007); T-PM did not vary seasonally, and T diurnality was not significant during late winter. T diurnality varied substantially between days within an individual, between individuals and between seasons, but neither T levels nor diurnality varied with age. These patterns may reflect the seasonally varying but unscheduled, life-long, strenuous physical labor that typifies many non-industrialized economies. These results also suggest that single morning samples may substantially underestimate peak circulating T for an individual and, most importantly, that exogenous signals may moderate diurnality and the trajectory of age-related change in the male gonadal axis.

AB Objective
   To explore relationships between impaired sleep and well-being in mothers with low-birth-weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.
   Design
   Cross-sectional descriptive exploratory design.
   Setting
   Neonatal intensive care unit in metropolitan Atlanta, GA.
   Participants
   Twenty second-week postpartum, first-time mothers who had a low-birth-weight infant hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit.
   Methods
   Self-report data were collected for sleep, fatigue, depression, and well-being. Total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, circadian activity rhythms, and light exposure were measured using a wrist actigraph.
   Results
   Mothers reported clinically significant sleep disturbance and fatigue severity. Actigraphy showed the average nighttime total sleep time was less than 7 hours with 19%+/- 2.2% wake after sleep onset, and the total daytime sleep was more than an hour. Mothers also experienced moderate depressive symptoms. Maternal well-being as measured by the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36, version 2 was approximately 1 SD below the mean scores of age-matched women in the general U.S. population.
   Conclusion
   Mothers of hospitalized low-birth-weight infants are vulnerable. The presence of sleep disturbances and negative physical and mental health indicators warrants further study. Intervention is needed to promote sleep for new mothers during postpartum recovery, especially mothers who are dealing with a medically ill infant.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensory-motor disorder that is characterized by intense restlessness and unpleasant creeping sensations deep inside the lower legs. Symptoms appear when the legs are at rest and are worst in the evening and at night. They force patients to keep moving their legs, and often to get out of bed and wander about. Periodic limb movements (PLMS) are also common during sleep amongst those suffering from RLS, and sleep efficiency is severely reduced. There are idiopathic as well as symptomatic forms of RLS, the latter being associated with e.g. pregnancy, iron deficiency and chronic renal failure. A family history of RLS is very common and pedigrees in these cases suggest an autosomal-dominant transmission with high penetrance. Genetic investigations have been performed in order to identify genes associated with RLS. Several loci have been found (on chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, 20p and 16p). Pathophysiology of RLS remains incompletely understood. However, advanced brain imaging studies and positive results of dopaminergic treatment suggest that RLS may be generated by dopamine dysfunction locally within the central nervous system. At present, there is a wide range of treatment options including levodopa, dopamine agonists, opioids, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and iron supplements.

AB OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to investigate the developmental trajectories of nighttime sleep duration and hyperactivity over the preschool years and to identify the risk factors associated with short nighttime sleep duration and high hyperactivity scores.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nighttime sleep duration and hyperactivity were measured yearly by questionnaires administered to mothers of 2057 children from age 1.5 to 5 years. Developmental trajectories of nighttime sleep duration and hyperactivity throughout early childhood were analyzed to determine interassociations. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to determine which factors among selected child, maternal, and family characteristics and parental practices surrounding sleep periods in early childhood were associated with short nighttime sleep duration and high hyperactivity scores.
   RESULTS: The trajectories of nighttime sleep duration and hyperactivity were significantly associated. The odds ratio ( OR) of reporting short nighttime sleep duration was 5.1 for highly hyperactive children ( confidence interval [CI]: 3.2-7.9), whereas the OR of reporting high hyperactivity scores was 4.2 for persistently short sleepers ( CI: 2.7-6.6). The risk factors for reporting short nighttime sleep duration and high hyperactivity scores were ( 1) being a boy, ( 2) having insufficient household income, ( 3) having a mother with a low education, and ( 4) being comforted outside the bed after a nocturnal awakening at 1.5 years of age.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of short nighttime sleep duration in highly hyperactive children is greater than the risk of high hyperactivity scores in short sleepers. Preventive interventions that target boys living in adverse familial conditions could be used to address these concomitant behavioral problems. Pediatrics 2009; 124: e985-e993

AB Objectives To investigate the factors associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) from birth to age 2 years, whether recent advice has been followed, whether any new risk factors have emerged, and the specific circumstances in which SIDS occurs while cosleeping (infant sharing the same bed or sofa with an adult or child).
   Design Four year population based case-control study. Parents were interviewed shortly after the death or after the reference sleep (within 24 hours) of the two control groups.
   Setting South west region of England (population 4.9 million, 184 800 births).
   Participants 80 SIDS infants and two control groups weighted for age and time of reference sleep: 87 randomly selected controls and 82 controls at high risk of SIDS (young, socially deprived, multiparous mothers who smoked).
   Results The median age at death (66 days) was more than three weeks less than in a study in the same region a decade earlier. Of the SIDS infants, 54% died while cosleeping compared with 20% among both control groups. Much of this excess may be explained by a significant multivariable interaction between cosleeping and recent parental use of alcohol or drugs (31% v 3% random controls) and the increased proportion of SIDS infants who had coslept on a sofa (17% v 1%). One fifth of SIDS infants used a pillow for the last sleep (21% v 3%) and one quarter were swaddled (24% v 6%). More mothers of SIDS infants than random control infants smoked during pregnancy (60% v 14%), whereas one quarter of the SIDS infants were preterm (26% v 5%) or were in fair or poor health for the last sleep (28% v 6%). All of these differences were significant in the multivariable analysis regardless of which control group was used for comparison. The significance of covering the infant's head, postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, dummy use, and sleeping in the side position has diminished although a significant proportion of SIDS infants were still found prone (29% v 10%).
   Conclusions Many of the SIDS infants had coslept in a hazardous environment. The major influences on risk, regardless of markers for socioeconomic deprivation, are amenable to change and specific advice needs to be given, particularly on use of alcohol or drugs before cosleeping and cosleeping on a sofa.

AB Genes associated with lactation evolved more slowly than other genes in the mammalian genome. Higher conservation of milk and mammary genes suggest that species variation in milk composition is due in part to the environment and that we must look deeper into the genome for regulation of lactation. At the onset of lactation, metabolic changes are coordinated among multiple tissues through the endocrine system to accommodate the increased demand for nutrients and energy while allowing the animal to remain in homeostasis. This process is known as homeorhesis. Homeorhetic adaptation to lactation has been extensively described; however how these adaptations are orchestrated among multiple tissues remains elusive. To develop a clearer picture of how gene expression is coordinated across multiple tissues during the pregnancy to lactation transition, total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissues collected from rat dams (n = 5) on day 20 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation, and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two types of gene expression analysis were performed. Genes that were differentially expressed between days within a tissue were identified with linear regression, and univariate regression was used to identify genes commonly up-regulated and down-regulated across all tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis showed genes commonly up regulated among the three tissues enriched gene ontologies primary metabolic processes, macromolecular complex assembly and negative regulation of apoptosis ontologies. Genes enriched in transcription regulator activity showed the common up regulation of 2 core molecular clock genes, ARNTL and CLOCK. Commonly down regulated genes enriched Rhythmic process and included: NR1D1, DBP, BHLHB2, OPN4, and HTR7, which regulate intracellular circadian rhythms. Changes in mammary, liver and adipose transcriptomes at the onset of lactation illustrate the complexity of homeorhetic adaptations and suggest that these changes are coordinated through molecular clocks.

AB Background: Malaria has traditionally been a major endemic disease in Equatorial Guinea. Although parasitaemia prevalence on the insular region has been substantially reduced by vector control in the past few years, the prevalence in the mainland remains over 50% in children younger than five years. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors for parasitaemia and treatment seeking behaviour for febrile illness at country level, in order to provide evidence that will reinforce the EG National Malaria Control Programme.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional survey of children 0 to 5 years old, using a multistaged, stratified, cluster-selected sample at the national level. It included a socio-demographic, health and dietary questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, and thick and thin blood smears to determine the Plasmodium infection. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine risk factors for parasitaemia, taking into account the cluster design.
   Results: The overall prevalence of parasitemia was 50.9%; it was higher in rural (58.8%) compared to urban areas (44.0%, p = 0.06). Age was positively associated with parasitemia (p < 0.0001). In rural areas, risk factors included longer distance to health facilities (p = 0.01) and a low proportion of households with access to protected water in the community (p = 0.02). Having had an episode of cough in the 15 days prior to the survey was inversely related to parasitemia ( p = 0.04). In urban areas, the risk factors were stunting (p = 0.005), not having taken colostrum (p = 0.01), and that someone in the household slept under a bed net (p = 0.002); maternal antimalarial medication intake during pregnancy (p = 0.003) and the household socio-economic status (p = 0.0002) were negatively associated with parasitemia. Only 55% of children with fever were taken outside their homes for care, and treatment seeking behaviour differed substantially between rural and urban populations.
   Conclusion; Results suggest that a national programme to fight malaria in Equatorial Guinea should take into account the differences between rural and urban communities in relation to risk factors for parasitaemia and treatment seeking behaviour, integrate nutrition programmes, incorporate campaigns on the importance of early treatment, and target appropriately for bed nets to reach the under-fives

AB Spectral analysis of heart rate variability using short or long time series is a common method in the assessment of autonomic nervous activity. Nonlinear method such as detrended fluctuation analysis was proposed and proved to be useful for the possible non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics in the time series of heart period. In this study, we investigated the detrended fluctuation analysis and conventional heart rate variability measures in 16 late pregnant women before and 3 months after delivery and in 16 healthy controls. Global and discrete, short-term (<= 11 beats, alpha 1) and long-term (> 11 beats, alpha 2), scaling exponent were calculated in detrended fluctuation analysis. We found that the late pregnant women have elevated global scaling exponent, elevated short-term scaling exponent and lower heart rate variability measures in the low and high frequency ranges than those of the healthy controls and 3 months after delivery. The deranged measures recovered 3 months after delivery. In addition, the detrended fluctuation scaling exponent did not correlate with most conventional time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability. Our study suggested that the global and short-term detrended fluctuation scaling exponents might be new and independent measures of heart rate variability in late pregnancy, in addition to those conventional time and frequency domain measures.

First published July 29, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.90979.2008.-The efferent mechanisms mediating the well-known diurnal cardiovascular rhythms in the late-gestation fetus are only partially understood. In the present study, we evaluated the contribution of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems (SNS) to these rhythms. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at a mean (SE) of 122 (1) days gestation (term is 147 days) underwent either chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine the day after surgery (n = 8), vagotomy at surgery (n = 8), or were sham controls (n = 8). Fetal heart rate (HR), fetal HR variability (HRV), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), carotid blood flow (CaBF), electrocorticogram (ECoG) activity, and nuchal activity were measured continuously for 24 h. Changes between sleep states were determined in a 6-h interval. Control fetal sheep showed consistent diurnal rhythms in fetal HR, HRV, MAP, and CaBF, with maximal activity in the evening, but not in nuchal activity. Sympathectomy was associated with a significant reduction of both fetal HR and HRV, while vagotomy was associated with a fall in fetal HRV (P < 0.05) but no change in HR. Despite this, most animals in the two intervention groups still showed diurnal rhythms for fetal HR, HRV, MAP, and CaBF, although peak HR may have been delayed in the sympathectomy group (mean 02: 22 vs. 23: 54 h in controls, P = 0.06). There was no effect of either intervention on sleep state cycling, although state-related cardiovascular rhythms were significantly modulated. These data indicate that, neither the SNS nor vagal activity, in isolation at least, is essential for generating cardiovascular diurnal rhythms in the late-gestation fetus.

Partial correlations revealed stability of depressive and anxiety symptoms across time. Depressive symptoms did not predict anxiety at any time point. Anxiety predicted increases in depressive symptoms from late pregnancy to early postpartum, but not from early postpartum to mid postpartum. Anxiety predicted depressive symptoms from mid postpartum to late postpartum, however, not when social support in late pregnancy was controlled for.

AB In hospitals, women of reproductive age do a range of work tasks, some of which are known to carry potential risks. Tasks such as working with radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents, as well as performing heavy lifting or tasks requiring erratic sleep patterns have been reported to increase the risk of reproductive failures. Our aim was to study pregnancy outcomes in female hospital workers in Denmark. We performed a cohort study of 5976 female hospital workers and used as a reference group 60,890 women employed outside of hospitals. The reproductive health of hospital workers working during pregnancy is comparable to those of non-hospital workers for the majority of reproductive failures Studied. However, an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities was noted in some subgroups of hospital workers, which may indicate that some hospital work still entails fetotoxic hazards.

AB CASE: Sonia's mother was concerned about her 9-year old daughter's aggression, defiant behavior, and distractibility. When she was 4-years, she kicked her bother and he lost a tooth as a result of the trauma. At this time, her pediatrician was concerned about hyperactivity, impulsivity, and defiance of authority and recommended a psychological evaluation. Sonia's father refused an evaluation and responded by physically abusing his wife while demanding a transfer to a new physician. Sonia's mother left her husband at this time and moved away with Sonia. Spousal abuse occurred frequently before the separation, and Sonia may have been physically abused as well.
   Currently, Sonia is in third grade where she is underperforming in many areas. She enjoys drawing and reading, but struggles to sit quietly and stay on task. Her teacher reports frequent vocal and physical disruptions. Homework takes an inordinate amount of time to complete. She does not have a sustained friendship; her mother feels that this is because other kids do not like being bossed by Sonia. Her mother is concerned about Sonia's behavior especially the unremorseful disruptive behavior toward her younger brother and grandmother.
   Sonia was born after an uneventful full-term pregnancy without evidence of maternal smoking, drugs, alcohol, or medications. Motor and social developmental milestones were achieved at the appropriate time. Language milestones were achieved early; her mother recalls that Sonia learned to read at the age of 3 years.
   Sonia's medical history is significant for obesity, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and delayed sleep onset with prolonged awakenings associated with nightmares. Her mother reports that Sonia "worries about everything," including thoughts that her brother will turn into a monster. When an argument occurs at home, she "gets scared," bites her nails, and cries. Sonia currently lives with her mother, 2 younger brothers, step-father, and grandparents. Family history is significant for drug abuse by her father and mental illness in the father's family.
   While conducting an interview with her mother, Sonia was asked to draw a picture of her family. instead, she illustrated a book detailing her past experience in words accompanying each drawing. She described how she watched her father physically abuse her mother and her persistent fear of danger when conflict occurred at home. Although spelling was poor, her vocabulary, sequencing, and illustrations demonstrated above age-level skills for written expression and drawing. Examples of the writing that accompanied the drawings include: "I hate when my parents fight. I get scared and feel sick to my tummy like I want to throw up. I just hate that feeling!" "My mom told me she had a 'boyfriend.' These words were the most horrible I ever heard. Soon a nightmare began. Nightmares make me very, very scared."

   EXERCISE; WOMEN; RETENTION; REPRODUCIBILITY; QUESTIONNAIRE; ASSOCIATION
AB Objective: Factors associated with weight gain during pregnancy that may be linked to maternal overweight and obesity were examined.
   Methods: In this observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation. Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended by the Institute of Medicine).
   Results: Women gained 14.4 (+/- 5.0) kg during pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4 kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight, judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 - 19.32; OR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.551, 10.15; and OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36, respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for excessive weight gain (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93, respectively).
   Conclusions: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain. Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus on the identified factors.

AB Introduction. There is a strong link between female sex hormones and sleep. This implies the existence of sex differences both in the structure of sleep as in the incidence of various sleep disorders. Aim. To review the changes in the pattern of sleep experienced by women along different stages of their life cycle (fertile period, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause and postmenopause), as well as the most frequent sleeping pathologies in which there exist more gender differences (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome and narcolepsy). Development. About normal sleeping has been reported a higher quality of it, in women compared with men (increased sleeping time, reduced sleep onset latency, and a greater efficiency of sleeping), but they frequently complain of sleep problems. Moreover, different stages in the life of women are associated with significant physiological and hormonal changes that favour the disruption of normal sleep pattern and by this way, possibly, increase risk to suffer sleep disorders. Conclusions. The reasons that underlie in gender differences in sleeping disorders are attributed to differences in normal sleep pattern, in the clinical manifestations and risk factors for sleep disorders, and in the results and optimal dose of treatments.

AB Assessment of fetal motility is an approach to evaluate the development and function of the nervous system before birth. Reference values for the time of first occurrence and the incidence of normal fetal movements are indispensable for studies in which prenatal motor activity is applied as a model to study the central and peripheral nervous systems. Studies on fetal motility have been performed in a few species, particularly in the human. The aim of the present study is to describe the ontogeny of fetal motility in the guinea pig, a precocious polytocous species.
   After a pilot study to establish procedures for repeated ultasonographic scanning of guinea pigs, 10 domesticated animals were scanned (5.0 or 7.5 MHz convex transducer) at 2-4 day intervals between day 24 and 63 of gestation (term age 68 days). Per animal two selected fetuses were each scanned for 15 min. Images were stored on videotape and analyzed off-line for the first onset, presence and quality of fetal movement patterns, and quantity of sideway bendings, general movements. breathing movements and periods of fetal rest. Twenty-five different movement patterns could be characterized, 6 emerging at the onset of motor activity were performed only temporarily. The very first fetal movement was observed on day 24 gestational age, and subsequently most other movements developed during a period of only 5 days. Interfietal difference in onset of the frequently occurring sideway bendings, general movements, and front and hind limb movements was only 2 days. Sideway bendings and general movements co-existed during days 29 to 43. There were developmental trends in the course of pregnancy. Sideway bendings increased rapidly between 24 and 30 days and declined hereafter. General movements and fetal breathing increased during midpregnancy and declined towards parturition. Conversely, fetal rest was observed for approximately 60% of time at midgestation and a marked increase was found towards parturition. There were no significant differences in developmental trend of the various movement patterns between individual fetuses.
   Fetal motility in the guinea pig followed a specific temporal pattern, like in the human, but ata different time scale. The present quantitative data will enable functional investigations into the role of the neuromuscular system. They may also facilitate studies on the effect of environmental influences, such as stress. drugs, toxic substances, and food conditions, on fetal neurobehavioural development in this species.

AB Assessment of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS) in the ovine fetus provides insight into autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Currently, assessment of BRS relies on vasoactive drugs, but this approach is limited by feasibility issues and by the nonphysiologic nature of the stimulus. Thus we aimed to validate the method of spontaneous BRS assessment against the reference method of using vasoactive drugs in preterm (0.76 gestation, n = 16) and near-term (0.86 gestation, n = 16) chronically instrumented ovine fetuses. The BRS measures derived from the spontaneous and reference methods correlated at both gestational ages (R = 0.67 +/- 0.03). The sequence method of spontaneous BRS measures also correlated both to the root mean square of standard deviations (RMSSD), which is a measure of fetal heart rate variability reflecting vagal modulation (R = 0.69 +/- 0.03), and to fetal body weight (R = 0.65 +/- 0.03), which is a surrogate for growth trajectory of each fetus. The methodology presented may aid in developing new models to study BRS and cardiovascular control in ovine fetus in the last trimester of pregnancy.

AB Objective: To explore women's levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of pregnancy.
   Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample.
   Participants: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated pregnancies.
   Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell's Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire.
   Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women.
   Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women's fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women's emotional experiences during pregnancy.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal was to evaluate pictures in magazines widely read by women of childbearing age, for adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for safe infant sleep practices.
   METHODS: Magazines were included in this study if they had an average female readership of > 5 million, circulation of > 900 000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines. Pictures of infant sleep environments and sleeping infants in articles and advertisements in issues of these 28 magazines were analyzed for adherence to AAP guidelines for decreasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
   RESULTS: A total of 391 unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57 pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP.
   CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.

AB Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexpected death of an infant less than 12 months of age that occurs during sleep and remains unexplained after a complete autopsy, death scene investigation, and review of the clinical history. It is the leading cause of postneonatal mortality in the developed world. The cause of SIDS is unknown, but is postulated to involve impairment of brainstem-mediated homeostatic control. Extensive evidence from animal studies indicates that serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the medulla oblongata play a role in the regulation of multiple aspects of respiratory and autonomic function. A subset of SIDS infants have several abnormalities in medullary markers of 5-HT function and genetic polymorphisms impacting the 5-HT system, informing the hypothesis that SIDS results from a defect in 5-HT brainstem-mediated control of respiratory (and autonomic) regulation. Here we review the evidence from postmortem human studies and animal studies to support this hypothesis and discuss how the pathogenesis of SIDS is likely to originate in utero during fetal development.

TI Ambulatory Blood Pressure Control With Bedtime Aspirin Administration in
   Subjects With Prehypertension

AB BACKGROUND
   Aspirin has been found to prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension and to induce nitric oxide (NO) release from vascular endothelium. Low-dose aspirin has also been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) when administered at bedtime, as opposed to upon awakening, in untreated hypertensive patients and high-risk pregnant women. Accordingly, we investigated the effects on ambulatory BP of aspirin administered at different times of the day in prehypertension.
   METHODS
   We studied 244 subjects with prehypertension, 43.0 +/- 13.0 years of age, randomly divided in three groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary recommendations; the same recommendations and aspirin (100 mg/day) on awakening; or the same recommendations and aspirin at bedtime. BP was measured for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention.
   RESULTS
   Ambulatory BP was unchanged in subjects randomized to either nonpharmacological intervention or aspirin on awakening. A significant ambulatory BP reduction was, however, observed in the subjects who received aspirin at bedtime (decrease of 6/3 mm Hg in the 24-h mean of systolic (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP), respectively; P < 0.001), without changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline. BP was homogenously controlled along the 24 h after bedtime aspirin administration (6/4 mm Hg reduction in activity mean of SBP/DBP; 6/3 mm Hg reduction in sleep-time mean, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS
   This prospective trial documents a significant effect on BP of low-dose aspirin only when ingested at bedtime by prehypertensive subjects. The timed administration of low-dose aspirin could thus provide a valuable and cost-effective approach for BP control in subjects at elevated risk of developing hypertension.

DT Review
DE Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS); Quintero staging system; laser

ID SURGERY; COAGULATION
AB Severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is classified in five stages according to Quintero staging. However, the efficacy of such staging was recently debated. We reviewed the efficacy of Quintero staging to predict survival rate in TTTS treated with laser therapy. Articles reporting survival rate for each stage in TTTS treated with laser therapy were reviewed. Number of twins alive per pregnancy (NAP) was compared between early (I + II) and advanced (III + IV) stages and within stages. Meta-analysis was performed according to Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Heterogeneity was tested with chi-square for heterogeneity at a significance level of p < 0.10, and random or fixed models were generated as appropriate. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NAP was similar between early (zero survivors: 34/228, 15%; one survivor: 49/228, 21%; two survivors: 145/228, 63%) and advanced stages (zero survivors: 38/214, 18%; one survivor: 64/214, 30%; two survivors: 112/214, 52%; p > 0.05) except for one survivor (p < 0.05). A trend for increased NAP was observed in all stages. Because clinically relevant differences were not observed, laser therapy is the optimal treatment for all stages. As Quintero staging does not provide information about prognosis, a new staging system is proposed.

AB Duetting is defined as an interactively organized pair display in which one pair partner coordinates its vocalizations in time with those of the other. It is widespread among tropical birds and cohesive pair-living primates, in which it is suggested to strengthen pair bonds. We know very little about the presence and function of duetting in dispersed pair-living mammals. We studied duetting behavior in a solitary foraging, but pair-sleeping, primate, the Milne Edwards' sportive lemur, in a dry deciduous forest of north-western Madagascar. We radio-tracked six pairs throughout 1 year and recorded their sleeping sites and associations, home-range use, and vocal and behavioral interactions. Three different periods were covered (mating, pregnancy, and offspring care). Sleeping partners form long-term pair bonds, indicated by an almost exclusive pair-specific usage of sleeping sites and home-ranges across periods. We explored three functional hypothesis of duetting: mate reunion, pair reunion, and joint-territorial defense. Pairs regularly engaged in duet calling. Duetting increased significantly during the offspring care period. Duetting occurred significantly more often at feeding sites than at sleeping sites. Pair partners synchronized behavioral activities after duetting. The activity most often synchronized was locomotion. Pair partners played an equal role in duetting with no difference between sexes in starting or terminating duetting. Altogether, our results provide support for the hypothesis that in dispersed pair-living primates, duetting evolved as a mechanism to coordinate activities between pair partners dispersed in space, to strengthen pair bonds, and, perhaps, to limit infanticide and nutritional stress in lactating females.

AB To determine the contribution of infant temperament to the relationship between maternal sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms. Utilizing a repeated measures design, 112 couples recruited from childbirth education classes were assessed in third trimester and postpartum. Instruments included Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, General Sleep Disturbance Scale, wrist actigraphy, and an investigator-developed tool to assess infant temperament completed by mothers and fathers. Regardless of infant temperament, mothers who slept < 4 h between midnight and 6 am and mothers who napped < 60 min during the day were at increased risk for depression at three months postpartum. Infant temperament was associated with maternal sleep but was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms after controlling for other contextual factors. Postpartum clinical visits should include questions about maternal sleep so interventions can be directed toward sufficient sleep to minimize risk of postpartum depression.

AB Aims: To determine trimester-specific risk factors for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants.
   Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in Sri Lanka from May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or before 16 weeks of gestation and followed up until delivery. The sample size was 690. Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were gathered on average at 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. SGA was assessed using customised birth centile charts. Multiple logistic regression was applied, and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
   Results: The risk factors for SGA less than 5th centile were shift work and exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters (OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.10-16.0), sleeping for less than or equal to 8 h during 2nd or 3rd or both trimesters (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.08-4.59), walking for less than or equal to 2.5 h per day (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.12-6.31) and alcohol consumption during the 3rd trimester (OR 14.5, 95% CI 2.23-94.7). Poor weekly gestational weight gain was significantly associated with both SGA < 10th and < 5th centiles. None of the other factors became significant for SGA < 10th centile.
   Conclusions: Risk factors for SGA less than 5th centile were sleep deprivation and shift work and exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters, less walking hours and alcohol consumption during 3rd trimester. Poor weekly gestational weight gain may be considered as a predictor of delivering an SGA infant.

AB Background: Most antidepressant medications in current use have several disadvantages: a delayed therapeutic effect, side effects, stigmatization and concerns about safety for the developing fetus during pregnancy. Several chronobiologic techniques which are free of these disadvantages were proposed as an alternative. The Current article reports the design and the initial Outcome results of a new chronobiologic multistage intervention (CMI) that is comprised of the following techniques: (i) partial sleep deprivation during the second half of the night (wake therapy - WT), (ii) medium (green) wavelength light in combination with dawn simulation (DS), (iii) bright light therapy (BLT), and (iv) sleep phase advance (SPA).
   Methods: The study was conducted as a set of 12 single-case designs with moderate-to-severe depressive Volunteering patients. Depression, anxiety and tension measurements were taken on a daily basis beginning with a baseline measurement (TO), followed by a set Of four consecutive morning measurements during the therapeutic intervention (T1-T4),and with a final measurement carried out at the end of 4 weeks of follow-up (T5).
   Results: A clinically significant rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms was demonstrated and maintained for at least 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. No dropouts or compliance difficulties were observed. Patient satisfaction was high, and other than having to sleep for four nights at the Research and Development Unit, participants were not inconvenienced by the nature of the therapeutic design. Sleepiness in the late afternoon hours was reported by several of the participants, but did not reach a level that interfered with their ability to function. Levels of tension did not show a consistent improvement along the intervention procedure and were not maintained in follow-up. There was some unexpected improvement in the level of anxiety that persisted at follow-up. This latter finding requires further validation by additional studies.
   Conclusions: These initial findings showed the procedure to be effective and well tolerated. It affords many advantages, Such as the achievement of a rapid response, no extinction of the therapeutic effect after 4 weeks of follow-up, safety, high patient compliance and cost effectiveness. These encouraging results warrant validation in further randomized controlled clinical trials. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Ilio-caval stenting now represents the first line treatment for disabling obstructive ilio-caval lesions. Most patients are voting women of child-bearing age. We herein report our experience of pregnancy in women who have a history of ilio-caval stenting.
   Materials and Methods: From November 1995 to April 2008, 119 patients had ilio-caval stenting for obstructive venous disease in our department. Of these, 62 women were able to become pregnant. When pregnancy occurred, they received preventive treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) from the 3rd month of pregnancy to I month after delivery and had to wear elastic stockings. Patients also had to sleep on their right side if possible. The), were followed during the pregnancy by duplex scanning at 3, 6, and 8 months, and then I month after delivery.
   Results: Eight pregnancies occurred in 6 patients (mean age 26.5 years) who had a patent self-expanding stent (1 patient had 3 pregnancies). They had stenting for May-Thurner disease ill 3 patients, for post-deep venous thrombosis (DVT) left common iliac vein occlusion in I patient, and during venous thrombectomy in 2 patients. All stents were self-expanding metallic stents located oil the left common iliac vein. One patient had unrelated spontaneous abortion after 2 months of pregnancy. No DVT or symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred during pregnancy, delivery, or during the postpartum period. Four patients needed cesarean delivery and none had hemorrhagic complications. None of the patients had adverse effects from the treatment. Duplex scan showed compression of the stent(s) at 8 months in 4 patients with inflow obstruction in 3 patients. Postpartum duplex-scan showed no remaining stenosis in all patients. No stents had structural damage.
   Conclusion: Ilio-caval stent compression call occur during pregnancy but does not lead to structural damage to the self-expanding stents. Despite this, no cases of DVT occurred with preventive LMWH treatment. (J Vase Surg 2009;50: 355-9.)

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder that remains underdiagnosed in adult females. The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying people at risk for OSAS. The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAS in women and to estimate the risk for OSAS among females in the United States.
   Methods: This is an analysis of data from the 2007 Sleep in America Poll of the National Sleep Foundation. The NSF Poll is an annual telephone survey of a representative sample of U. S. adults. The 2007 NSF Poll included 1254 women in the United States, with an oversample of pregnant and postpartum women. We used the Berlin Questionnaire to estimate the risk for OSAS among the U. S. female population. This instrument includes questions about self-reported snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and obesity. Also included were questions about sleep habits, sleep problems, menstrual cycle status, and other medical disorders.
   Results: Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for OSAS. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of OSAS as habitual snoring (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently reported. The risk increased with age (p<0.05), obesity (p<0.001), and menopause (p<0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more frequently reported among women at high risk.
   Conclusions: One in four women in America is at high risk of having OSAS. Awareness by the primary care medical community of this disorder in females should thus be increased.

AB High blood pressure is an important component of pre-eclampsia. The underlying mechanism of development of hypertension in pre-eclampsia is complicated and still remains obscure. Several theories have been advanced including endothelial dysfunction, uteroplacental insufficiency leading to generalized vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output, and sympathetic hyperactivity. Increased blood flow and pressure are thought to lead to capillary dilatation, which damages end-organ sites, leading to hypertension, proteinuria and edema. Additional theories have been put forward based on epidemiological research, implicating immunological and genetic factors. None of these theories have been substantiated. Based on a review of literature this paper postulates that the initiating event for the development of preeclampsia is intermittent hypoxia associated with irregular breathing during sleep, hypoapnea, apnea, inadequate respiratory excursions during the waking hours and inadequate cardiopulmonary synchronization (abnormal sympatho-vagal balance).

AB BACKGROUND: The majority of infants in the United States are in nonparental child care, yet little is known about the effect of child care on development of obesity.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between child care attendance from birth to 6 months and adiposity at 1 and 3 years of age.
   METHODS: We studied 1138 children from a prospective cohort of pregnant women and their offspring. The main exposure was time in child care from birth to 6 months of age, overall and by type of care: (1) child care center; (2) someone else's home; and (3) child's own home by nonparent. The main outcomes were weight-for-length (WFL) z score at 1 year and BMI z score at 3 years of age.
   RESULTS: A total of 649 (57%) infants attended child care; 17% were cared for in a center, 27% in someone else's home, and 21% in their own home by a nonparent. After adjustment for confounders, overall time in child care was associated with an increased WFL z score at 1 year and BMI z score at 3 years of age but not skinfold thicknesses. Center and own home care were not associated with the outcomes, but care in someone else's home was associated with an increase in both the 1- and 3-year outcomes.
   CONCLUSION: Child care in the first 6 months of life, especially in someone else's home, was associated with an increased WFL z score at 1 year and BMI z score at 3 years of age. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 555-562

AB Introduction. - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sensorimotor disorder where patients complain of an almost irresistible urge to move their legs. This urge can often be accompanied by pain or other unpleasant sensations, it either occurs or worsens with rest particularly at night, and improves with activity. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group has established four essential criteria for clinical diagnosis of RLS.
   State of art. - Affecting an estimated 7.2 to 11.5% of the adult population, the symptoms of RLS may be associated with significant sleep disturbance and may have a negative impact on quality of life. The prevalence of RLS increases with age, and women are more frequently affected than men. In France, the estimated prevalence is 8.5%. Among sufferers, 4.4% complain of very severe symptoms. Although RLS is mainly idiopathic, several clinical conditions have been associated with it, especially iron deficiency with or without anemia, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. These conditions may share a common pathophysiological mechanism involving a disorder of iron metabolism. By contrast, controversy persists as to whether polyneuropathy, particularly when associated with diabetes, is to be considered as an important cause of secondary RLS. This association is difficult to demonstrate as conventional electromyography is not adequate to detect small fiber neuropathy often associated with diabetes.
   Conclusion and perspectives. - RLS is often underdiagnosed and few subjects receive recommended RLS drug treatment. There is a clear need for complementary education to improve the accurate diagnosis of RLS. Indeed, better knowledge of this syndrome is a prerequisite to prompt an appropriate therapeutic management. (c) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Study Objectives: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in children.
   Design: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term.
   Measurements and results: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency ( <= 10(th) percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions: Poor sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size at birth.

AB Background:
   Previous studies have demonstrated individual differences in susceptibility to the detrimental effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Many factors, including genetic differences, have been shown to play a role in susceptibility and resistance, but few studies have investigated the range of genetic variation in rodent models.
   Methods:
   We examined ethanol teratogenesis in 5 inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6J (B6), Inbred Short-Sleep, C3H/Ibg, A/Ibg, and 129S6/SvEvTac (129). Pregnant dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD) on day 9 of pregnancy. Dams were sacrificed on day 18 and fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for gross morphological malformations. Every other fetus within a litter was then either placed in Bouin's fixative for subsequent soft-tissue analyses or eviscerated and placed in ethanol for subsequent skeletal analyses.
   Results:
   B6 mice exposed to ethanol in utero had fetal weight deficits and digit, kidney, brain ventricle, and vertebral malformations. In contrast, 129 mice showed no teratogenesis. The remaining strains showed varying degrees of teratogenesis.
   Conclusions:
   Differences among inbred strains demonstrate genetic variation in the teratogenic effects of ethanol. Identifying susceptible and resistant strains allows future studies to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying prenatal alcohol phenotypes.

AB Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences oil developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Among FASD. cases that exhibit all of three criterion, 1) central nervous system dysfunction. 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure during brain development oil brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing 2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol consumption by these darns was 11.53 +/- 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, ectopias oil the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing system of circadian rhythms, in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breast feeding of babies, Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence front alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

DE Infant; Maternal-child nursing; Methods; Mothers; Sleep
ID BEHAVIOR
AB Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern.
   Study Design and Methods: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data.
   Results: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r >= 0.80) when 3 days of data were used.
   Clinical Implications: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

AB Objective. The Alaska Division of Public Health has stated that infants may safely share a bed for sleeping if this occurs with a nonsmoking, unimpaired caregiver on a standard, adult, non-water mattress. Because this policy is contrary to recent national recommendations that discourage any bed sharing, we examined 13 years of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred while bed sharing to assess the contribution of known risk factors.
   Methods. We examined vital records, medical records, autopsy reports, and first responder reports for 93% of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred between 1992 and 2004. We examined deaths while bed sharing for risk factors including sleeping with a non-caregiver, prone position, maternal tobacco use, impairment of a bed-sharing partner, and an unsafe sleep surface. We used Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data to describe bed-sharing practices among all live births in Alaska during 1996-2003.
   Results. Thirteen percent (n=126) of deaths occurred while bed sharing; 99% of these had at least one associated risk factor, including maternal tobacco use (75%) and sleeping with an impaired person (43%). Frequent bed sharing was reported for 38% of Alaskan infants. Among these, 60% of mothers reported no risk factors; the remaining 40% reported substance use, smoking, high levels of alcohol use, or most often placing their infant prone for sleeping.
   Conclusions. Almost all bed-sharing deaths occurred in association with other risk factors despite the finding that most women reporting frequent bed sharing had no risk factors; this suggests that bed sharing alone does not increase the risk of infant death.

AB Study Objectives: (1) To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for postpartum maternal sleep problems and depressive symptoms simultaneously, (2) identify factors independently associated with either condition, and (3) explore associations between specific postpartum sleep components and depression.
   Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based.
   Participants: All women (n = 4191) who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September 2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was 68% (n = 2830).
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and results: Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression, defined as EPIDS >= 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly associated with depression.
   Conclusions: Poor sleep was associated with depression independently of other risk factors. Poor sleep may increase the risk of depression in some women, but as previously known risk factors were also associated, mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression are not merely reporting symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.

AB Widespread use of mobile phones which are a major source of electromagnetic fields might affect living organisms. However, there has been no investigation concerning prenatal exposure to electromagnetic fields or their roles in the development of the pyramidal cells of the cornu ammonis in postnatal life. Two groups of pregnant rats, a control group and an experimental group, that were exposed to an electromagnetic field were used. For obtaining electromagnetic field offspring, the pregnant rats were exposed to 900 megahertz electromagnetic fields during the 1-19th gestation days. There were no actions performed on the control group during the same period. The offspring rats were spontaneously delivered-control group (n = 6) and electromagnetic field group ( n = 6). Offspring were sacrificed for stereological analyses at the end of the 4th week. Pyramidal cell number in rat cornu ammonis was estimated using the optical fractionator technique. It was found that 900 megahertz of electromagnetic field significantly reduced the total pyramidal cell number in the cornu ammonis of the electromagnetic field group (P < 0.001). Therefore, although its exact mechanism is not clear, it is suggested that pyramidal cell loss in the cornu ammonis could be due to the 900 megahertz electromagnetic field exposure in the prenatal period.

AB Objectives: This study was undertaken to describe under real-life conditions the effects of acupuncture on symptomatic dyspepsia during pregnancy and to compare this with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone.
   Methods: A total of 42 conventionally treated pregnant women were allocated by chance into two groups to be treated, or not, by acupuncture. They reported the severity of symptoms and the disability these were causing in daily aspects of life such as sleeping and eating, using a numerical rating scale. The study also observed the use of medications.
   Results: Six women dropped out (one in the acupuncture group and five in the control group). Significant improvements in symptoms were found in the study group. This group also used less medication and had a greater improvement in their disabilities when compared with the control group.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that acupuncture may alleviate dyspepsia during pregnancy.

AB The goals of epilepsy therapy are to achieve seizure freedom while minimizing adverse effects of treatment. However, producing seizure-freedom is often overemphasized, at the expense of inducing adverse effects of treatment. All antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have the potential to cause dose-related, "neurotoxic" adverse effects (i.e., drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, blurry vision, and incoordination). Such adverse effects are common, especially when initiating AED therapy and with polytherapy. Dose-related adverse effects may be obviated in most patients by dose reduction of monotherapy, reduction or elimination of polytherapy, or substituting for a better tolerated AED. Additionally, all older and several newer AEDs have idiosyncratic adverse effects which usually require withdrawal in an affected patient, including serious rash (i.e., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hematologic dyscrasias, hepatotoxicity, teratogenesis in women of child bearing potential, bone density loss, neuropathy, and severe gingival hyperplasia. Unfortunately, occurrence of idiosyncratic AED adverse effects cannot be predicted or, in most cases, prevented in susceptible patients. This article reviews a practical approach for the definition and identification of adverse effects of epilepsy therapies, and reviews the literature demonstrating that adverse effects result in detrimental quality of life in epilepsy patients. Strategies for minimizing AED adverse effects by reduction or elimination of AED polytherapy, appropriately employing drug-sparing therapies, and optimally administering AEDs are outlined, including tenets of AED selection, titration, therapeutic AED laboratory monitoring, and avoidance of chronic idiosyncratic adverse effects.

SO CURRENT NEUROPHARMACOLOGY

DT Article
DE Epilepsy; antiepileptic drugs; blood levels; monitoring
ID EPILEPSY
AB Despite advances in epilepsy therapeutics, some physicians feel uncomfortable with newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) due to difficulty in promptly obtaining blood levels to guide medication adjustment, and even when levels for newer AEDs are obtained, many practitioners feel they are not very useful. Lacking confidence in AEDs whose levels that cannot readily or expeditiously be measured, many clinicians share uncertainty about proper use of the newer AEDs and monitoring AED administration. Similarly, some epilepsy patients inflate the importance of AED blood level monitoring, feeling that blood levels falling within traditionally therapeutic ranges are a fail-safe for seizure control, regardless of their compliance or personal behavior aggravating seizure burden, such as poor sleep or use of illicit substances. This review examines the elusive concept of therapeutic AED blood levels and potential uses and abuses of blood level monitoring, reinforcing appropriate uses for blood levels to ensure compliance and adjust for altered AED pharmacokinetics in the context of aging and disease states, pregnancy, or drug interactions.

   FRAMEWORK
AB The objectives of this prospective study were to identify birth-related fatigue trajectories in expectant fathers with the progress of labour and the physiological, psychological and situational factors related to specific trajectory patterns.
   An increasing number of fathers participate in their partner's labour; however, their fatigue experience remains unclear. Previous studies have focused on overall groups without considering the possibility of between-subject heterogeneity. With an advanced data-analytic strategy, it is feasible to identify subgroup variation within the population over time.
   A prospective, repeated measures design was used.
   A convenience sample of 108 Taiwanese expectant fathers was followed throughout the labour process. Data were collected by visual analogue scales and self-administered questionnaires. The repeated measures of fatigue were analysed by using semi-parametric, group-based modelling.
   Two distinct groups of individual trajectories among the expectant fathers were identified; the persistent low-fatigue group (49.2%) and the persistent high-fatigue group (50.8%). After birth, a moderate level of fatigue persisted in the high-fatigue group. The fastest period of increasing level in the persistent high-fatigue group was in the latent phase. The persistent high-fatigue group also experienced significantly more sleep difficulties prior to labour and more anxiety than the persistent low-fatigue group.
   Identifying and characterising meaningful clusters of trajectories could provide a better understanding of the birth-related fatigue experience of fathers and contributes to recognising the target client and timing for early intervention.
   There are points in time at which professional caregiver actions may have an effect on the birth-related fatigue of fathers. Caregivers should prevent high levels of fatigue, which could accumulate as fathers accompany the women entering the labour phase. Fathers who present with high fatigue at onset of labour should receive early intervention, especially in the rapid-increasing fatigue period.

AB Sleep duration is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors, depression, automobile and workplace accidents, and prospective mortality. Little is known, however, about sleep patterns in the US population. The 2004-2007 National Health Interview Survey-Sample Adult Files provide nationally representative data for 110,441 noninstitutionalized US adults aged 18 years or older, and multinomial logistic regression examines whether variables in 5 domains-025EFdemographic, family structure, socioeconomic, health behavior, and health status-025EFare associated with long or short sleep duration. Being older, non-Hispanic black, or a current or former smoker; having low levels of education, income, or few income sources; consuming few or numerous drinks in a week; or reporting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, underweight, or activity limitations is associated with increased odds of both long and short sleep duration. Other variables are associated with shorter (e.g., living with young children, being unmarried, working long hours, more frequent binge drinking) or longer (e.g., being younger, Mexican American, pregnant, or having low levels of physical activity) sleep hours. The authors identify numerous risk factors for long and short sleep; many of those variables are potential confounders of the relation between sleep hours and other health outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Down syndrome (DS) affects 1/800 infants. Prenatal NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) (NAP + SAL) prevent developmental delay in Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of DS. We investigated whether this finding involves N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits.
   STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant Ts65Dn mice were treated with placebo or NAP + SAL on gestational days 8-12. After developmental delay prevention was shown, 4 trisomic (Ts), 4 control, and 3 Ts + NAP + SAL adult offspring brains (from 3 litters) were collected. Calibrator-normalized real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subunits NR2A and NR2B, and for GABA subunits GABA(A)alpha 5 and GABA(A)beta 3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase stan-dardization. Statistics included analysis of variance and Fisher PLSD with P < .05 as significant.
   RESULTS: NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta 3 levels were decreased in Ts vs control (all P < .05). Prenatal NAP + SAL increased NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta 3 to levels similar to control (all P < .05). A significant difference in GABA(A)alpha 5 levels was not found.
   CONCLUSION: Prenatal NAP + SAL increases NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta 3 expression in adult DS mice to levels similar to controls. This may explain how NAP + SAL improve developmental milestone achievement.

TI Aspergillosis of a dog genital tract-Case report
SO ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Dog semen; Aspergillosis
AB The information about aspergillosis locations in the reproductive organ is scarce. This short paper deals with aspergillosis in the dog genital tract with hyphae present in semen. There are two therapy schemes used in visceral mycoses, non-invasive treatment and surgical intervention. Considering the future reproductive career of the dog, we decided on antifungal drugs administration. Based on the microbiological results, we administered amoxycillin with clavulonate (Synulox(R) 500 mg, twice daily) orally. Itraconazole was used as an antimycological agent (Orungal(R), 100 mg, twice daily) every other week. In 8th week of therapy no Aspergillus spp. growth was noted, yet slight Penicillitum growth was observed. After 12 weeks of treatment, no fungus growth was present. Neither spores or hyphae were seen in the microscopic examination. Three months after the termination of the therapy, the dog mated with two females. In one case, unifetal pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasound examination on day 42 after mating. Due to purulent discharge on day 45 after mating, the owner decided to terminate the pregnancy. In the other case, severe pyometra appeared 12 days after the second mating and the owner decided to put the female to sleep. The pathogen eradication from the ejaculates may be treated as a serious success, yet the lack of litters after mating calls for an explanation and consequences of Aspergillus spp. infection need to be considered.

AB Background
   Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common, but frequently undiagnosed, chronic, sensorimotor disorder. In western countries, it is seen in approximately 10% of the general population, with a higher prevalence in women and the elderly (10-20%).
   Objective
   This article outlines the epidemiology, aetiology, diagnosis and management of RLS. Information that is most relevant to general practice is presented, with an emphasis on practical management.
   Discussion
   Restless legs syndrome is divided into primary and secondary forms, There is a strong genetic influence in primary RLS. Secondary forms are associated with iron deficiency, pregnancy, and renal failure. Diagnosis is essentially by clinical history using simple diagnostic criteria. Management depends on severity, and ranges from nonpharmacologic to pharmacologic measures. Recent research has provided insights into the pathophysiology of RLS and provided an evidence base for some of the newer treatments.

AB Infant sleep is a major source of concern for many parents. The aims of this longitudinal study were to assess: (a) the development of sleep patterns among infants, (b) the development of maternal cognitions regarding infant sleep, and (c) the relations between these domains during the 1st year of life. Eighty-five mothers were recruited during pregnancy and completed a questionnaire aimed at assessing maternal sleep-related cognitions. After delivery (at 1, 6, and 12 months) sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep logs, and maternal cognitions were reassessed. The findings demonstrated significant predictive and concomitant links between maternal cognitions and infant sleep. Maternal soothing behaviors mediated the relations between these domains.

AB Sleep disturbance during pregnancy can result in excessive daytime sleepiness, diminished daytime performance, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the potential for an increased length of labor and increased risk of operative birth. Sleep disturbance may be the result of a sleep disorder, such as leg cramps, a common yet benign disorder, or restless legs syndrome, a sensorimotor disorder. Both disrupt sleep, are distressing to the pregnant woman, and mimic one another and other serious disorders. During pregnancy, up to 30% of women can be affected by leg cramps, and up to 26% can be affected by restless legs syndrome.

AB Most of the adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy on the fetus are usually as a consequence of placental malaria (PM). This study was conducted with the objective of determining the prevalence, risk factors and pregnancy outcome of A cross-sectional study of 437 pregnant women who delivered at the UMTH, Maiduguri was conducted between 24 July 2007 and 12 January 2008. Placental histology was done for the malaria parasite. Maternal packed cell volume was done and thick blood films were studied for the malaria parasite in maternal peripheral blood and the cord blood/heel prick of their babies. The prevalence of PM was 33.9% (148/437). It is associated with non-usage of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPT) and maternal HIV infection. PM in turn predisposes to low birth weight and cord parasitaemia. Only 2.8%, of the women were sleeping under insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). The high prevalence of PM calls for renewed efforts for preventive measures, particularly the routine use of IPT and ITN during the antenatal period.

AB Nephropathy of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (NAPS) is an increasingly well-recognized aspect of antiphospholipid syndrome. The most characteristic histopathology is that of thrombotic microangiopathy, and thrombosis occurring in the renal vasculature is thought to be the initiating event. Other less common pathologies have been reported, and the mechanisms of these are unclear. Therapy has been largely empiric. We report a case of NAPS in a patient with atypical pathology, who has declined therapy with immunosuppressive agents and anticoagulants and who has maintained normal renal function in 20 years of follow-up.

AB Introduction. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic neurological disorder that has a negtive influence on sleep. We describe clinical spectrum, polysomnogram and impact on sleep of patients' series with RLS.
   Methods. We studied 49 patients with RLS. We analyse socio-demographic information, clinical features, therapy and impact on sleep. We realized differents questionnaire: Index of Severity of Sleep, Epworth Scale. Index-RLS, Questionnaire Quality of Life-RLS and Questionnaire from limitation of laboral productivity.
   Results. Mean age is 60.33 +/- 14.27 with similar distribution enter gender. They presented a positive family history in 36,73% with predominant in early onset of symptoms. Secondary causes more frequent associated were rheumatoid arthritis, iron-deficiency, uremia, pregnancy and polineuropathy. Significative prevalence of Insomnia (73,430,16) and periodic limb movement disorder (51,02%), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (22,45%) and hipersomnia (22,45%). Pharmacological Treatment more used were dopaminergic drugs. We didn't find significant stadistic differences enter clinical feature and therapy, so tendency to better quality of life with dopaminergic drugs.
   Conclusions. It's an neurological disorder With important delay in diagnosis. Early detection is needed because important impact on sleep efficiency and quality of life, and improvement with therapy, solely dopaminergic drugs.

TI High retention and appropriate use of insecticide-treated nets
   distributed to HIV-affected households in Rakai, Uganda: results from

ID PROSPECTIVE COHORT; MALARIA; OWNERSHIP; SENEGAL; NIGERIA; ADULTS; ZAMBIA
AB Background: Distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) has recently been incorporated into comprehensive care strategies for HIV-positive people in malaria-endemic areas. WHO now recommends free or low-cost distribution of ITNs to all persons in malaria-endemic areas, regardless of age, pregnancy and HIV status. Knowledge about and appropriate use of ITNs among HIV-positive ITN recipients and their household members has not been well characterized.
   Methods: 142 randomly selected adults were interviewed in July-August 2006 to assess knowledge, retention, and appropriate use of ITNs they had received through a PEPFAR-funded comprehensive HIV care programme in rural Uganda.
   Results: Among all participants, 102 (72%, CI: 65%-79%) reported they had no ITNs except those provided by the programme. Of 131 participants who stated they were given >= 1 ITN, 128 (98%, CI: 96%-100%) stated they still possessed at least one programme-provided ITN. Reported programme-ITN (pITN) use by participants was high: 119 participants (91%, CI: 86%-96%) reported having slept under pITN the night prior to the survey and 115 (88%, CI: 82%-94%) reported sleeping under pITN seven days per week. Being away from home and heat were the most common reasons given for not sleeping under an ITN. A sub-study of thirteen random home visits demonstrated concordance between participants' survey reports and actual use of ITNs in homes.
   Conclusion: There was excellent self-reported retention and appropriate use of ITNs distributed as a part of a community-based outpatient HIV care programme. Participants perceived ITNs as useful and were unlikely to have received ITNs from other sources.

AB Background: Obesity and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are both associated with hypofunction of dopamine in the CNS. We therefore examined whether individuals who are obese have an increased risk of RLS in two ongoing US cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study II and the Health Professional Follow-up Study.
   Methods: We included 65,554 women and 23,119 men free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy in the current analyses. Information on RLS was assessed using a set of standardized questions. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met four RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International RLS Study Group and had restless legs >= 5 times/month. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using logistic regression models adjusting for age, smoking, use of antidepressant, phobic anxiety score, and other covariates. Log ORs from the two cohorts were pooled by a fixed-effects model.
   Results: There were 6.4% of women and 4.1% of men who were considered to have RLS. Multivariate adjusted ORs for RLS were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.3, 1.6; p trend < 0.0001) for participants with body mass index (BMI) > 30 vs < 23 kg/m(2) and 1.60 (95% CI: 1.5, 1.8; p trend < 0.0001) for highest vs lowest waist circumference quintiles. Greater BMI in early adulthood ( age 18-21 years) and weight gain were also associated with a higher prevalence of RLS (p trend < 0.01 for both).
   Conclusions: Both overall and abdominal adiposity are associated with increased likelihoods of having restless legs syndrome ( RLS). Further prospective studies are warranted to clarify causative association between obesity and risk of developing RLS. Neurology(R) 2009; 72: 1255-1261

AB Urinary testosterone concentrations in males and urinary progesterone and oestradiol concentrations in females were measured in the Cape mole-rat (Georychus capensis) and compared for the summer and winter periods. The Cape mole-rat breeds seasonally, with sexual activity and subsequent pregnancy recorded during the winter months in the southern hemisphere. Despite the fact that it has a distinct breeding season, seasonal differences in urinary hormone concentrations of both male and female Cape mole-rats were not statistically significant. This finding supports the notion the Cape mole-rat may have the opportunity to operate as an opportunistic breeder if fortuitous environmental conditions arise, such as unseasonal rainfall, occurring at these normally non-favourable times of the year.

AB Mrs. A, a 34-year-old married mother who lived with her husband and their 5-year-old daughter, strangled her infant son to death 3 weeks after birth. She had a planned, healthy pregnancy with some depression at 28 weeks' gestation. She had a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery, giving birth to a healthy boy, "B." She began breastfeeding immediately. From postpartum days 2 through 11, her depression worsened. She was unable to sleep but could not get out of bed or attend to her hygiene. She was suspicious that her husband would harm B. On postpartum day 2, she began having obsessional, ego-dystonic images of throwing B out the window. She believed, despite the pediatrician's reassurances, that she was harming B with her breast milk and that he was losing weight. She was unable to give him a bath, believing that he had "gas" or "something bad" inside and could not be moved.
   On day 12, while alone in the car with B, she thought of killing herself and the baby, although "at the time I don't think I had any idea why." On day 13, she attempted suicide by overdose. She slept through the night and did not report the suicide attempt to anyone. She abruptly weaned B and then became disorganized and confused, unsure of what formula and size and types of bottles and nipples to use. She was agitated, calling friends day and night for opinions. On day 15 she attempted to smother B with a towel. "I don't believe it was a thought," she said. " It was 'autopilot.'" Her husband came upstairs, and Mrs. A believes that his presence shook her out of the "state" she was in. " I did not have the compulsion to hurt him any more after that evening. I just thought something was wrong, and I wasn't thinking straight." Her husband knew that she was not herself, but he did not understand that she was depressed and psychotic. Mrs. A did not receive treatment for her illness.
   On postpartum day 20, Mrs. A awoke at 6: 30 a. m. to feed B when he cried. Her husband and daughter kissed her goodbye, and Mr. A walked their daughter to school before going to work. She soon felt as if she was "taken over." She describes a dazed, trance-like state with confusion: "Something internal like a force. it was not a voice. but I did not have control. It was an instant. I don't recall thinking anything. I had no feelings. It was happening but I wasn't there.. At the time, nothing came into my head saying, 'No, do not do this.'. My inside was gone and it was something else." She briefly placed a towel over B's nose and mouth, but stopped. The "force" then became intense. She placed a washcloth in B's mouth and then strangled him with a telephone cord. She felt she was not connected to her own hands. When B was dead, she washed him with a cloth, removed the remnants of his umbilical cord, changed his diaper, and left the room. She went into the bathroom, where she made an unsuccessful attempt to cut her wrists.
   Mrs. A was charged with homicide and was incarcerated. She described her psychiatric history as "moody" with cycling states, every 3 days, of jocularity, creativity, and high energy alternating with an irritable, withdrawn mood and tearfulness. She had two previous episodes of major depression, including a postpartum depression after the birth of her daughter that was associated with ego-dystonic images of throwing her daughter against a wall or hitting her with a hammer. She denied psychotic thoughts. The depression resolved in 6 months without treatment. She was a successful "supermom" with her daughter and was an energetic worker in her job.
   Mrs. A's mother has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, which worsened after the birth her second child. She had multiple psychiatric hospitalizations for psychotic episodes with chronic paranoia and grandiose, volatile moods.

AB Evidence in humans and rodents suggests that normal circadian rhythmicity is important for supporting reproductive function. A molecular clock underlies circadian rhythmicity. Impaired fertility is observed in some genetically altered mice with deficiencies in genes of the molecular clock, suggesting a critical role for these genes in reproduction. Here we systematically characterize the reproductive phenotype of females deficient in the clock gene Bmal1. Bmal1(-/-) females are infertile. They exhibit progression through the estrous cycle, although these cycles are prolonged. Normal follicular development occurs in Bmal1(-/-) females, and healthy embryos of the expected developmental stage are found in the reproductive tract of Bmal1(-/-)females 3.5 d after mating to wild-type males. However, serum progesterone levels are significantly lower in Bmal1(-/-) vs. Bmal1(-/-) females on d 3.5 of gestation. Low progesterone levels in Bmal1(-/-) females are accompanied by decreased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in corpora lutea of Bmal1(-/-) vs. Bmal1(-/-)females. Whereas implantation of embryos is not observed in untreated or vehicle-treated Bmal1(-/-) females, exogenous administration of progesterone to Bmal1(-/-) females is able to reinstitute implantation. These data suggest that implantation failure due to impaired steroidogenesis causes infertility of Bmal1(-/-) females. (Endocrinology 150: 1879-1885, 2009)

AB To investigate the incidence of ambulatory care visits among female nursing staff in Taiwan.
   Literature frequently indicates increased risks of needlestick injury and musculoskeletal disorders among practicing nurses. With increased workload in the healthcare system, nursing staff could also be vulnerable to other diseases.
   A retrospective cohort study design including 27,624 female nursing staff with a contract with Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) programme between 2001-2004.
   Information on ambulatory care visits was retrieved from the NHI claim data. Comparison groups included other female medical personnel and active non-medical working women. Incidence rates of ambulatory care visits were calculated using person-year approach. Rate ratio adjusted for potential confounders was estimated from the Poisson regression model.
   The nurse cohort developed a total of 781,352 ambulatory care visits, representing an incidence rate of 85,285/10(4) person-years. Compared with the other female medical personnel, female nurses had significantly elevated incidence of genitourinary [adjusted rate ratio (ARR) = 1.20], circulatory (ARR = 1.14), mental (ARR = 1.12), infectious/parasitic diseases (ARR = 1.11) and pregnancy/birth complications (ARR = 1.07). Significantly increased incidence sustained for both infectious/parasitic diseases and pregnancy/birth complications as the nurse cohort was compared with the active non-medical working women. The nurses, on the contrary, had significantly lower ARRs than the comparison groups of neoplasm, injury, metabolic, respiratory, digestive and musculoskeletal diseases.
   Female nurses had increased incidences of certain types of systemic illness when compared with other medical personnel and with women working outside of the health industry. Whether the findings found in this study were region specific or could be applicable to other nations, requires further investigations.
   Policy makers and hospital administrators must not overlook nurses' potentially unseen health problems. A mandatory periodical physical examination for nursing staff must be considered.

AB The circadian oscillator is generated within the suprachiasmatic nuclei and synchronizes circadian clocks in numerous peripheral tissues. The molecular basis is composed of a number of genes and proteins that form transcriptional and translational feedback loops. Such molecular oscillators are also operative in peripheral tissues, including in the uterus. Although ovarian steroids regulate the function of uterine endometrial stromal cells, the modulation of ovarian steroids on the circadian rhythms remains unknown. Here we investigate the possibility that estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) modulate the circadian oscillator of the stromal cells. The study using transgenic rats constructed with Period 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase (Per2-dLuc) gene, with the real-time monitoring system of Per2-dLuc oscillation. The stromal cells displayed constant Per2-dLuc oscillation after treatment with dexamethasone, suggesting that the circadian oscillator is operative. However, the circadian oscillator was disrupted by in vivo administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) following equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), although it was altered into a rhythmic pattern 4 days later following hCG. Chronic treatment with P4 induced constant Per2-dLuc oscillation in the stromal cells from eCG-treated immature and pregnant rats, whereas E2 did not promote such a rhythmic Per2-dLuc oscillation. Collectively, P4 synchronizes the circadian oscillator of the uterus endometrial stromal cells through transcriptional and translational feedback loops of the clockwork system.

AB Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with significant maternal and infant morbidity are on the rise in Western society despite advances of medical technology. Current risk factors are insufficient to identify women at greatest risk of developing an adverse outcome. An attempt to identify novel contributors to increased risk is warranted. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, yet are often dismissed as irrelevant. Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. Disturbed sleep is also linked with an increased inflammatory response. Increased inflammation is proposed as a key biological pathway through which chronic disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes develop. In this paper, we propose a model and a testable hypothesis of how disturbed sleep in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth via increased inflammation.

AB OBJECTIVE. Studies among patients have shown accelerated weight gain after (adeno) tonsillectomy.* Whether (adeno) tonsillectomy is also a risk factor for the development of overweight is unknown. We investigated the association between (adeno) tonsillectomy and the subsequent development of overweight in the general population.
   METHODS. The study population consisted of 3963 children participating in the Dutch Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy birth cohort. Data on weight and height, adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy, and covariates (gender, birth weight, maternal education, maternal overweight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and smoking in the home) were obtained from annual questionnaires completed by the parents. In addition to the questionnaire data, weight and height were measured by the investigators when the children were 8 years old.
   RESULTS. (Adeno) tonsillectomy between 0 and 7 years of age was significantly associated with overweight and obesity at age 8. Overweight at the age of 2 years was not associated with increased risk of (adeno) tonsillectomy in later years, indicating that the association between (adeno) tonsillectomy and overweight was not explained by preexisting overweight. Longitudinal data on weight and height in the years before and after surgery suggest that (adeno) tonsillectomy forms a turning point between a period of growth faltering and a period of catch-up growth, which might explain the increased risk to develop overweight after the operation.
   CONCLUSION. Children who undergo (adeno) tonsillectomy are at increased risk to develop overweight in the years after surgery. Pediatrics 2009; 123: 1095-1101

AB Objective: Impairment of the arousal process from sleep is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We hypothesized that a greater propensity for cortical arousal in the prone position may, in a normal infant, be a protective mechanism to promote complete arousal in a vulnerable sleeping position, a protection that is absent in SIDS victims. We aimed to examine the arousal process in a group of infants exposed to maternal smoking, who are thus at higher risk for SIDS.
   Design: Twelve healthy, full-term infants born to smoking mothers were studied using daytime polysomnography at 2 to 4 weeks, 2 to 3 months and 5 to 6 months postnatal age. Data were compared with 13 healthy infants born to nonsmoking mothers. Arousal was induced by pulsatile air-jet stimulation to the nostrils during active and quiet sleep, in both supine and prone positions. For each stimulus, physiologic and electroencephalogram changes were visually assessed and arousal responses were classified as sub-cortical activation or cortical arousal.
   Results: In smoke-exposed infants, the progression from sub-cortical activation to cortical arousal was depressed at 2 to 4 weeks and 5 to 6 months. There was no effect of maternal smoking observed at 2 to 3 months; however, a significant dose-dependent relationship between cortical activation proportions and urinary cotinine levels was present in both supine and prone positions.
   Conclusion: We have shown that maternal smoking is associated with impaired arousal processes to trigeminal stimulation that may increase the risk for SIDS. This further highlights the importance of public education of the risks of maternal smoking.

TI Infant Sleep Disturbance Is Associated with Preconceptional
   Psychological Distress: Findings from the Southampton Women's Survey
SO SLEEP
LA English
DT Article
ID VALIDATION; BIRTH; MOOD
AB Study Objective: To determine whether preconceptional psychological distress is associated with infant sleep disturbance.
   Design: Prospective cohort study
   Setting: Southampton, UK.
   Participants: A cohort of women from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant pairs were involved in the study.
   Measurements and Results: Preconceptional psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46).
   Conclusions: Women with preconceptional psychological distress are more likely to have babies with sleep disturbance during infancy, independent of whether they suffered from postnatal depression.

TI Diabetes Is an Independent Risk Factor for Severe Nocturnal Hypoxemia in
   Obese Patients. A Case-Control Study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity have become two of the main threats to public health in the Western world. In addition, obesity is the most important determinant of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a condition that adversely affects glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown whether patients with diabetes have more severe SAHS than non-diabetic subjects. The aim of this cross-sectional case-control study was to evaluate whether obese patients with T2DM are more prone to severe SAHS than obese non-diabetic subjects.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and smoking status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a university hospital. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, smoking habit, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examinations included a non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary function testing, and an awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures included the percentage of time spent at saturations below 90% (CT90). A high prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM: 80%, nondiabetic: 78.3%). No differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events between diabetic and non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in diabetic patients, a significantly increase in the CT90 was detected (20.2 +/- 30.2% vs. 6.8 +/- 13,5%; p = 0.027). In addition, residual volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM (percentage of predicted: 79.7 +/- 18.1 vs. 100.1 +/- 22.8; p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with CT90.
   Conclusions/Significance: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in obese patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, the screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory.

AB The aim of this paper is to present the life-span model of motivation comprising four key processes or the four C's - channelling, choice, co-agency or co-regulation and compensation - in the context of several longitudinal data sets focusing on people's personal goals during critical life transitions. The life-span model of motivation posits that the challenges, demands, and opportunities people encounters at a particular stage of their lives channel the kinds of personal goals they construct [Little, B., Salmela-Aro, K., & Phillips, S. (2007). Personal project pursuit: Goals, action and human flourishing. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers]; that personal goals play an important role in the ways in which people make choices and direct their own development [Baltes, P. B. (1997). On the incomplete architecture of human ontogeny: Selection, optimization and compensation as foundation of developmental theory. American Psychologist, 52, 366-380]; that people regulate their development by co-agency [Edwards, A.(2006). Relational agency: Learning to be a resourceful practitioner. International Journal of Educational Research, 43, 168-182]; and that people compensate for failure experiences by adjusting their personal goals on the basis of previous developmental transitions and life events [Brandtstadter, J. (1989). Personal self-regulation of development: Cross-sequential analyses of development-related control beliefs and emotions. Developmental Psychology, 25,96-108], and that such compensation and adjustment has consequences for their wellbeing [Heckhausen, J., Wrosch, C. & Fleeson, W. (2001).

First published December 17, 2008; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.90474.2008.-Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is commonly used although clinical studies questioned its diagnostic value. Sophisticated FHR variability (fHRV) measures such as fHRV complexity may improve the sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring. A more detailed understanding of the physiology underlying fHRV complexity is essential to harness its use for monitoring fetal health. To examine the specific effects of vagal and sympathetic modulations on fHRV complexity, we blocked vagal activity with atropine and sympathetic activity with propranolol in near-term fetal sheep (n = 7, 0.85 gestation). Under these conditions, we analyzed the linear and nonlinear parts of fHRV complexity from autonomic information flow. Overall fHRV complexity decreased with both drugs compared with nonrapid eye movement sleep baseline (P < 0.05). With atropine, this was because of a decrease of the linear part of fHRV complexity on the long-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that vagal modulation of fHRV is adequately described by linear fHRV measures. With propranolol, the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity decreased on the short-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that sympathetic influences on fHRV can be detected by the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity. Thus the complex interplay of vagal and sympathetic modulations of fHRV is reflected differently and specifically in the linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV complexity, and on different time scales. Analysis of linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV may improve sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring.

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 296: R722-R727, 2009. First published December 17, 2008; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.90865.2008. This study examined the role of alterations in the chemoreflex control of breathing, acid-base balance, and their interaction in postmenopausal ventilatory adaptations. A modified iso-oxic hyperoxic and hypoxic CO2-rebreathing procedure was employed to evaluate central and peripheral chemoreflex drives to breathe, respectively, in 15 healthy postmenopausal and 20 premenopausal women of similar age. Arterialized venous blood samples were collected at rest for the estimation of arterial P-CO2 (Pa-CO2) and H+ concentration ([H+]), plasma strong ion difference ([SID]) and total weak acid ([A] tot) concentrations, and serum progesterone ([P-4]) and 17 beta-estradiol ([E-2]) concentrations. In post-compared with premenopausal women, Pa-CO2, [SID], and the central chemoreflex ventilatory recruitment threshold for P-CO2 (VRTCO2) were higher, whereas [P-4] and [E-2] were lower (all P < 0.05), with no significant change in central or peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity, peripheral chemoreflex VRTCO2, and [A] tot. The acidifying effect of an increased Pa-CO2 was offset by the alkalizing effect of an increased [SID], such that [H+] was preserved in post-compared with premenopausal women. Pa-CO2 correlated positively with the central chemoreflex VRTCO2 (r = 0.67, P < 0.01), which in turn correlated positively with [SID] (r = 0.53, P < 0.01) within the pooled data. In conclusion, the relative alveolar hypoventilation and attendant arterial hypercapnia in healthy post-compared with premenopausal women could be explained, in part, by the interaction of 1) reduced central, but not peripheral, chemoreflex VRTCO2, 2) increased [SID], and 3) reduced circulating female sex steroid hormone concentrations.

AB Background: Dysregulation of daytime cortisol activity has been associated with stress-related pathologies. Research suggests that early environmental adversity might shape cortisol activity. However, little is known about the genetic and environmental contributions to early cortisol and how this varies as a function of environmental circumstances. The goals of the study were to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to daytime cortisol secretion in infant twins and to investigate whether these contributions varied as a function of familial adversity (FA).
   Methods: Participants were 517 6-month-old twins. Salivary cortisol was collected when the infants woke up at home and in the morning, upon arrival at the laboratory. Familial adversity was defined by seven perinatal and postnatal risk factors: maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, low family income, low maternal education, single parenthood, young motherhood; and maternal hostile/reactive behaviors. Genetic and environment contributions to cortisol activity were estimated for high (three risk factors or more: 21.3% of the sample) versus low FA.
   Results: Genetic factors accounted for cortisol levels in different ways: a moderate "main effect" of genes was found for home-based awakening cortisol, whereas the contribution of genes to morning cortisol was conditional to FA. Genetic factors accounted for most of the variance in morning cortisol in high family adversity but not in low family adversity.
   Conclusions: Early FA modulates the heritability of morning cortisol in infants. The results are consistent with the diathesis-stress model, with genetic factors more likely to be expressed in adverse settings.

AB The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of induced labour with intravenous oxytocin with a start in the evening versus in the morning.
   Randomised controlled trial.
   Labour wards of three hospitals in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   Women with an indication for induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin.
   Included women were randomized to either the evening group with a start of induction of labour at 21:00 hours, or the morning group with a start at 07:00 hours.
   Primary outcome was duration of labour. Secondary outcomes were instrumental delivery rate, adverse neonatal outcome defined as an Apgar score below 7 after 5 minutes, number and indications of paediatric consults and neonatal admissions, duration of second stage, number of intrapartum infections and necessity of pain relief.
   We randomised 371 women. Mean duration of labour was not significantly different (primiparae: morning 12 hours and 8 minutes versus evening 11 hours and 22 minutes, P value 0.29; multiparae: morning 7 hours and 34 minutes versus evening 7 hours and 46 minutes, P value 0.70). There were no significant differences in instrumental deliveries rates, number of infections or patient satisfaction. Unexpectedly, neonatal outcome was better in women induced in the evening.
   Induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is equally effective as induction in the morning.

AB An approach combining time-continuous nonlinear stability analysis and a parametric bispectral method was introduced to better describe cortical activation and deactivation patterns in the immature fetal electroencephalogram (EEG). Signal models and data-driven investigations were performed to find optimal parameters of the nonlinear methods and to confirm the occurrence of nonlinear sections in the fetal EEG. The resulting measures were applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation when organized sleep states were not developed and compared to previous results at 0.9 gestation. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already at this early gestational age, suggesting the presence of premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature sleep states associated with nonrapid eye movement sleep later in gestation. Thus, the combined nonlinear and time-variant approach was able to provide important insights into the properties of the immature fetal ECoG.

AB Hypertension develops in 10% of pregnancies. Snoring, a marker of obstructive sleep apnoea, is a newly identified risk factor for gestational hypertension. Moreover, obstructive sleep apnoea is an independent risk factor for incident hypertension in the non-pregnant population. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with new onset of hypertension among pregnant females.
   A case-control study was performed involving 17 pregnant females with gestational hypertension and 33 pregnant females without hypertension. Subjects were frequency-matched for gestational age and recruited in a tertiary obstetrical centre. Obstructive sleep apnoea was ascertained by polysomnography and defined by an apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) of >= 15 events.h(-1), without requirement for desaturation.
   The mean +/- SD AHI for normotensive pregnant females was 18.2 +/- 12.2 events.h(-1) compared with 38.6 +/- 36.7 events.h(-1) for females with hypertensive pregnancies. The crude odds ratio for the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea given the presence of gestational hypertension was 5.6. The odds ratio was 7.5 (95% confidence interval 3.5-16.2), based on a logistic regression model with adjustment for maternal age, gestational age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, prior pregnancies, and previous live births.
   In conclusion, gestational hypertension appears to be strongly associated with the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea.

AB Post-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with diminished lung growth during school age. The current authors aimed to determine whether pre-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with lung function changes in the newborn.
   In a prospective birth cohort of 241 healthy term-born neonates, tidal breathing, lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured during unsedated sleep at age 5 weeks. Maternal exposure to particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) and distance to major roads were estimated during pregnancy. The association between these exposures and lung function was assessed using linear regression.
   Minute ventilation was higher in infants with higher pre-natal PM(10) exposure (24.9 mL.min(-1) per mu g.m(-3) PM(10)). The eNO was increased in infants with higher pre-natal NO(2) exposure (0.98 ppb per mu g.m(-3) NO(2))- Post-natal exposure to air pollution did not modify these findings. No association was found for pre-natal exposure to O(3) and lung function parameters.
   The present results suggest that pre-natal exposure to air pollution might be associated with higher respiratory need and airway inflammation in newborns. Such alterations during early lung development may be important regarding long-term respiratory morbidity.

AB Background: The aim of this Study was to explore the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety across pregnancy and the early postpartum.
   Methods: Participants (N=207) completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait subscale, Beck Depression Inventory, and social support and sleep quality measures at two time points during pregnancy and once in the early postpartum period.
   Results: After accounting for the relative stability of anxiety and depression over time, depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of anxiety in late pregnancy and anxiety in late pregnancy predicted higher depressive symptomatology in the early postpartum. A bi-directional model of depression and anxiety in pregnancy was supported.
   Limitations: Data were based on self-reports and participating women were predominantly tertiary educated with high family incomes.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms precede the development of higher levels of anxiety and that anxiety, even at non-clinical levels, can predict higher depressive symptoms. Clinicians are advised to screen for anxiety and depression concurrently during pregnancy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Engoren M, Courtney SE, Habib RH. Effect of weight and age on respiratory complexity in premature neonates. J Appl Physiol 106: 766-773, 2009. First published November 26, 2008; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol. 90575.2008.-Very low-birth-weight premature infants often suffer from a variety of respiratory problems, including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), hypopnea and periodic breathing, and apnea. These conditions are likely related to immaturity of the respiratory centers; yet how respiratory rhythms originating from these centers, including their complexity, relate to demographic measures of prematurity remains largely unknown. In 39 neonates with mild RDS (22 males, 28 +/- 2 wk gestational age, 1,036 +/- 234 g body wt), we derived the univariate association between complexity of two respiratory rhythms [respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (V(T))] and postmenstrual age, gestational age, postnatal age, and weight at time of study. RR and V(T) rhythm complexities were assessed using approximate entropy, sample entropy, base scale entropy, and forbidden words entropy estimated for 300 consecutive breaths determined from respiratory inductance plethysmography, irrespective of breathing effort rate or amplitude, collected during sleep while the neonates were exposed to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (4-6 cmH(2)O). RR and V(T) exhibited increased complexity with increased maturity, but only in terms of base scale entropy and forbidden words entropy, which are based on pattern matching, rather than approximate entropy and sample entropy, which are based on conditional probabilities. Specifically, RR complexity as measured by forbidden word entropy increased with increasing weight (r = 0.502), postconceptional age (r = 0.423), and gestational age ( r = 0.493). As measured by base scale entropy, RR complexity increased with increasing weight (r = 0.488) and postconceptional age (r = 0.390). V(T) complexity, measured by base scale entropy, was greater with increased postnatal age (r = 0.428). Our results indicate that respiratory rhythms become more complex with increasing levels of maturity, as indicated by increased weight and several age parameters. This emphasizes the importance of the later weeks of gestation in the maturation of respiratory centers in the brain and suggests a promising use of entropy measures in exploring respiratory maturation in infants.

AB Multiple risk factors for deformational plagiocephaly (DP) have been reported. The purpose of this study was to establish the impact of these variables on the severity of this deformity. A prospective cohort study was performed. Parents completed a standardized questionnaire assessing potential risk factors for DP before assessment. Examination included measurement of transcranial difference (TCD; ie, difference in oblique cranial lengths), evaluation of head tilt. and rotational asymmetry. Pearson correlation coefficient, 1-way analysis of variance, and 2-sample t-test were used to quantify the relationship between identified risk factors and TCD. A total of 434 patients with DP were evaluated. Male-to-female ratio was 2: I; mean gestational age was 36.5 weeks. Deformational plagiocephaly was first appreciated at a mean infant age of 6 weeks. A preexisting diagnosis of torticollis was noted in fewer than 50%. Mean TCD was 11.2 mm. Head tilt was documented in 80% of infants, and mean head rotational asymmetry was 16.4 degrees. Deformational plagiocephaly was more severe in multiple birth pregnancies (P < 0.05). males (P < 0.05), infants with a favorite head position (P< 0,01), preexamination diagnosis of torticollis (P < 0.05). and infants with a head tilt (P < 0.05). Lower gestational age (P < 0.05) and greater head rotational asymmetry (P < 0.0001) were found to correlate with DP severity. This study suggests that the relationship between the severity of DP and certain risk factors can be quantified. The presence and degree of cervical imbalance correlate strongly with deformational cranial asymmetry.

AB Pregnancy is associated with many physiologic and hormonal changes along with changes in sleep architecture, placing pregnant women at risk for the development of sleep-disordered breathing or worsening of preexisting sleep apnea. Snoring, the most common symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is markedly increased during pregnancy. The exact prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women is unknown. Because the apneic episodes are commonly associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturations, the combination of obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy can be potentially harmful to the fetus given the low oxygen reserves during pregnancy. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension among the general population, and this raises the possibility of its association with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In this clinical review, we discuss the physiologic changes of pregnancy that predispose pregnant women to the development of obstructive sleep apnea and the effects of sleep-disordered breathing on pregnancy outcomes. We also review the recommendations regarding evaluation for sleep apnea and treatment options during pregnancy and postpartum. (J Am Board Fam Med 2009; 22: 158-168.)

Physiol Genomics 37: 12-22, 2009. First published November 18, 2008; doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.90341.2008. - The molecular physiology underlying human milk production is largely unknown because of limitations in obtaining tissue samples. Determining gene expression in normal lactating women would be a potential step toward understanding why some women struggle with or fail at breastfeeding their infants. Recently, we demonstrated the utility of RNA obtained from breast milk fat globule (MFG) to detect mammary epithelial cell (MEC)-specific gene expression. We used MFG RNA to determine the gene expression profile of human MEC during lactation. Microarray studies were performed using Human Ref-8 BeadChip arrays (Illumina). MFG RNA was collected every 3 h for 24 h from five healthy, exclusively breastfeeding women. We determined that 14,070 transcripts were expressed and represented the MFG transcriptome. According to GeneSpring GX 9, 156 ontology terms were enriched (corrected P < 0.05), which include cellular (n = 3,379 genes) and metabolic (n = 2,656) processes as the most significantly enriched biological process terms. The top networks and pathways were associated primarily with cellular activities most likely involved with milk synthesis. Multiple sampling over 24 h enabled us to demonstrate core circadian clock gene expression and the periodicity of 1,029 genes (7%) enriched for molecular functions involved in cell development, growth, proliferation, and cell morphology. In addition, we found that the MFG transcriptome was comparable to the metabolic gene expression profile described for the lactating mouse mammary gland. This paper is the first to describe the MFG transcriptome in sequential human samples over a 24 h period, providing valuable insights into gene expression in the human MEC.

AB Background: Previous studies have suggested that preterm birth with or without subsequent chronic lung disease is associated with reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and increased ventilation inhomogeneity in the neonatal period. We aimed to establish whether such findings are associated with the degree of prematurity, neonatal respiratory illness and disproportionate somatic growth.
   Methods: Multiple breath washout measurements using an ultrasonic flowmeter were obtained from 219 infants on 306 test occasions during the first few months of life, at three neonatal units in the UK and Australia. Tests were performed during unsedated sleep in clinically stable infants (assigned to four exclusive diagnostic categories: term controls, preterm controls, respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease). The determinants of neonatal lung function were assessed using multivariable, multilevel modelling.
   Results: After adjustment for age and body proportions, the factors gestation, intrauterine growth restriction and days of supplemental oxygen were all significantly associated with a reduced FRC. In contrast, increased ventilation inhomogeneity (elevated lung clearance index) was only significantly associated with duration of supplemental oxygen. After adjusting for continuous variables, diagnostic category made no further contribution to the models. Despite using identical techniques, unexpected inter-centre differences occurred, associated with the equipment used; these did not alter the negative association of preterm delivery and disease severity with lung function outcomes.
   Conclusion: Reduction in FRC is independently associated with prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction and severity of neonatal lung disease. Determinants of lung function shortly after birth are highly complex in different disease groups.

AB The "disk-over-water" method, where animals are awakened by disk rotation triggered by sleep EEG signals, was efficiently used in many studies involving sleep deprivation. Recently, the modification of this method has been developed where, during the period of deprivation, the disk was rotated in accordance with a pre-set program (the "disk-over-water" method without feedback). We considered this modification as a potentially promising one for investigation of relationship between maternal sleep and litter development. However, none of these methods has been used in experiments on female rats, and efficiency of the method without feedback has never been tested using electrophysiological estimation of sleep-wake states either. Performing these tasks was the goal of the present study. Cortical EEG, hippocampal theta-activity and locomotor activity were recorded in 14 female Wistar rats underwent sleep deprivation in the "disk-over-water" setup without feedback. Three days long during the deprivation periods from 11:00 to 14:00 the disk was rotated for 8 s with 15 s intervals. REM sleep was totally eliminated during these periods, and amounts of slow wave sleep did not exceed 10% of 3 h. The results were identical both for pregnant and non-pregnant rats. The rate of sleep reduction during deprivation periods in our experimental conditions did not differ from that in the original system with the feedback. Thus the simplified "disk-over-water" method without feedback can be used in the studies involving relatively short sleep deprivation periods.

AB Background: Current use of treated mosquito nets for the prevention of malaria falls short of what is expected in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), though research within the continent has indicated that the use of these commodities can reduce malaria morbidity by 50% and malaria mortality by 20%. Governments in sub-Sahara Africa are investing substantially in scaling-up treated mosquito net coverage for impact. However, certain significant factors still prevent the use of the treated mosquito nets, even among those who possess them. This survey examines household ownership as well as use and non-use of treated mosquito nets in Sahel Savannah and Niger Delta regions of Nigeria.
   Methodology: This survey employed cross-sectional survey to collect data from households on coverage and use of mosquito nets, whether treated or not. Fever episodes in previous two weeks among children under the age of five were also recorded. The study took place in August 1-14 2007, just five months after the March distribution of treated mosquito nets, coinciding with the second raining period of the year and a time of high malaria transmission during the wet season. EPI INFO version 2003 was used in data analysis.
   Results: The survey covered 439 households with 2,521 persons including 739 under-fives, 585 women in reproductive age and 78 pregnant women in Niger Delta Region and Sahel Savannah Region. Of the 439 HHs, 232 had any mosquito nets. Significantly higher proportion of households in the Niger Delta Region had any treated or untreated mosquito nets than those in the Sahel Savannah Region. In the Niger Delta Region, the proportion of under-fives that had slept under treated nets the night before the survey exceeded those that slept under treated nets in the Sahel Savannah Region. Children under the age of five years in the Niger Delta Region were four times more likely to sleep under treated nets than those in the Sahel Savannah Region.
   Conclusion: This study found that despite the fact that treated nets were distributed widely across Nigeria, the use of this commodity was still very low in the Sahel Savannah region. Future campaigns should include more purposeful social and health education on the importance and advantages of the use of treated nets to save lives in the Sahel Savannah region of Nigeria.

AB Possible prevention of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure has been investigated using peptides that were previously shown to be involved in neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo. I focused in this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects of one of these peptides with regard to the determination of the downstream signaling pathways involved in neuroprotection. This peptide with the sequence NAPVSIPQ, known as NAP, a fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, demonstrated a potent protective effect against oxidative stress associated with alcohol exposure. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched C57BL/6 pregnant females were assigned the following groups: (1) Ethanol liquid diet group (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethano-derived calories, (2) Pair-fed (PF) control group (3) Chow control group, (4) treatment groups with alcohol alongside i.p. injections Of D-NAP (ALC/D-NAP, 20 or 30 mu g/20 g body weight), (5) PF/D-NAP control group. On E13, fetal brains were collected and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, caspase-3 colorimetric assay and ELISA for cytochrome c detection. My results show that NAP significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of the fetal brain. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP administration significantly prevented alcohol-induced increases in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium cingulate cortex and basal ganglia eminence. The investigation of downstream signaling pathways involving NAP neuroprotection revealed that this peptide significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in the concentrations of caspase-3 in E13 fetal brains. Moreover, ELISA for cytochrome c shows that NAP significantly prevented both alcohol-induced increases in the level of cytosolic cytochrome c and alcohol-induced decreases in the level of mitochondrial cytochrome c. These data provide an understanding of NAP intracellular target, and the downstream mechanisms of action that will pave a path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during prenatal stages.

AB Background: Obesity among children and adolescents is a growing public health problem. The aim of the present paper is to identify potential determinants of obesity and risk groups among 3-to 17-year old children and adolescents to provide a basis for effective prevention strategies.
   Methods: Data were collected in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a nationally representative and comprehensive data set on health behaviour and health status of German children and adolescents. Body height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was classified according to IOTF cut-off points. Statistical analyses were conducted on 13,450 non-underweight children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years. The association between overweight, obesity and several potential determinants was analysed for this group as well as for three socio-economic status (SES) groups. A multiple logistic regression model with obesity as the dependent variable was also calculated.
   Results: The strongest association with obesity was observed for parental overweight and for low SES. Furthermore, a positive association with both overweight (including obesity) and obesity was seen for maternal smoking during pregnancy, high weight gain during pregnancy (only for mothers of normal weight), high birth weight, and high media consumption. In addition, high intakes of meat and sausages, total beverages, water and tea, total food and beverages, as well as energy-providing food and beverages were significantly associated with overweight as well as with obesity. Long sleep time was negatively associated with obesity among 3-to 10-year olds. Determinants of obesity occurred more often among children and adolescents with low SES.
   Conclusion: Parental overweight and a low SES are major potential determinants of obesity. Families with these characteristics should be focused on in obesity prevention.

AB Women sleep less in the postnatal period and it has been suggested that mothers diagnosed with depression alternatively could be suffering from the effects of chronic sleep deprivation.
   From a population-based study, we recruited 42 women, of whom 21 scored >= 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Sleep was registered by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), sleep diaries and actigraphy 2 months after delivery.
   There were significant differences in subjective sleep measured retrospectively by the PSQI between depressed and non-depressed women. In contrast, there were no significant differences in sleep measured prospectively by sleep diaries and actigraphy. Both depressed and non-depressed women had impaired sleep efficiency (82%) and were awake for about 1.5 h during the night. Primipara had worse sleep, measured by actigraphy, compared with multipara.
   Measured objectively and prospectively, women with depression did not have worse sleep than non-depressed women.

AB Although twin deliveries after assisted reproduction treatment (ART) are common, the mental health of the parents has scarcely been addressed. Therefore, we evaluated the psychological well-being of ART and spontaneously conceiving parents of twins and singletons. Furthermore, the impact of parity and children's health-related factors on mental health was evaluated.
   We conducted a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study among ART parents of 91 pairs of twins and of 367 singletons and on control parents of 20 pairs of twins and of 379 singletons in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy (T1), and when the children were 2 months (T2) and 1-year old (T3). Symptoms of depression and anxiety, sleeping difficulties and social dysfunction were addressed via a questionnaire. The effects of parity and child-related factors were assessed at T2.
   At T1, ART mothers of twins showed fewer symptoms of depression than control mothers of twins (P < 0.05). At T2, both ART and control mothers of twins had more symptoms of depression and anxiety than all mothers of singletons (F = 5.20, P < 0.05 and F = 3.93, P < 0.05, respectively). At T3, both ART and control mothers of twins continued to report more symptoms of depression than the mothers of singletons (F = 10.01, P < 0.01), but a difference in anxiety symptoms was seen only in the control group. All fathers had similar mental health at T1. At T2, ART and control fathers of twins reported more symptoms of depression (F = 4.15, P < 0.05) and social dysfunction than fathers of singletons. At T3, both ART and control fathers of twins had more symptoms of depression (F = 4.29, P < 0.05) and anxiety (F = 5.40, P < 0.05) than fathers of singletons. Control fathers of twins had more sleeping difficulties than fathers of singletons (F = 6.66, P < 0.01). Parity did not differently affect parental mental health at T2 in the study groups. Prematurity did not affect maternal mental health, but it had a negative impact on control fathers' social dysfunction (F = 3.34, P < 0.05).
   Twin parenthood, but not ART, has a negative impact on the mental health of mothers and fathers during the transition to parenthood. ART parents' mental health was not affected by parity or children's health-related factors.

AB A systematic study in women with persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is urgently needed to develop its clinical management.
   To investigate the features, possible causes, and treatment of PGAD.
   Eighteen women who fulfilled the five criteria for PGAD were included in the study. In-depth interviews were combined with laboratory and imaging studies as reported in Part I of the study. Clinical responses were observed with drugs exerting activity against a number of different neuro-regulatory mechanisms.
   Detailed descriptions and clustering of some well established clinical syndromes.
   The majority of women experienced PGAD during early menopause without pre-existing psychiatric disorders and laboratory abnormalities. Most women had difficulties in describing the quality of the genital sensations. These were described in various terms and were diagnosed as dysesthesias and paresthesias. Their intensity was most severe during sitting. A few women reported PGAD during pregnancy and premenstrual. The majority of women also reported preexistent or coexistent restless legs syndrome (RLS) and overactive bladder syndrome (OBS). These strongly associated morbidities point into the direction of a clinical cluster, which harbors PGAD or PGAD plus these typical other disorders. Notably, as in RLS and OBS, it appeared that daily treatment with clonazepam 0.5-1.5 mg was effective in 56% of PGAD women. Also, oxazepam 10 mg and tramadol 50 mg elicited PGAD-reducing effect.
   PGAD seems to belong to a highly associated disease cluster including morbidities, which share an imperative urge to suppress dysesthesias and paresthesias by firm manipulative actions. PGAD-or as proposed by our group, restless genital syndrome (RGS) in the context of its strong association with restless legs-is probably the expression of a nonsexually driven hyperexcitability of the genitals and subsequent attempts to overcome it by genital manipulations.

AB Prenatal environment exerts profound influences on the development of an organism and stressful events during pregnancy can bring about long-term physiological/behavioral alterations in the offspring. Epidemiological evidence points to a relationship between intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), body weight at birth, and adult cardiovascular disease. Experimental research employed different models of IUGR, including altered maternal nutrition, exposure to elevated glucocorticoids, and reduced placental perfusion, all of which can program, when acting during sensitive temporal windows of foetal life, alterations in cardiovascular regulation and stress sensitivity. Original data are presented indicating that prenatal psychological stress (intermittent restraint) does not induce in the rat adult offspring changes of plasma corticosterone levels, cardiac autonomic modulation, and circadian rhythmicity of heart rate (HR), body temperature (T) and physical activity (Act) at rest. However, prenatally stressed rats - when further stimulated in adulthood - exhibit prolonged adrenocortical stress responsivity, disturbed circadian rhythmicity of HR, T, and Act, and increased adrenal weight. This evidence supports the idea that prenatal stress per se does not change dramatically a given structure or function, but it affects resilience and renders the animal more susceptible to pathophysiological outcomes when further insults occur during adulthood.

AB Background: The decrease of maternal docosahexaenoic (DHA) status during pregnancy has been associated with postpartum depression, especially in women with a low intake of DHA. Since the DHA intake in the Netherlands is low, we investigated whether supplementation of low doses of DHA or DHA plus arachidonic acid (AA) during pregnancy and lactation could prevent depressive symptoms and steep disturbances in this period.
   Methods: Women were supplemented daily with placebo, DHA (220 mg) or DHA+AA (220 mg each) from week 16 of pregnancy till three months postpartum. Fatty acid analyses were performed in the available plasma samples at 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Depressive symptoms were measured in weeks 16 and 36 of pregnancy and six weeks postpartum using EPDS and within one week postpartum using a blues questionnaire.
   Results: 119 women completed the study. The average frequency of fish intake was low, 0.94 times per week, and did not differ between the groups. The supplementation groups did not differ in mean EPDS scores or changes in EPDS scores, nor in incidence or severity of postpartum blues. Red blood cell DHA, AA and DHA/AA ratio did not correlate with EPDS or blues scores. Indices of sleep quality did not differ between the groups.
   Conclusion: Supplementation of 220 mg/day DHA or DHA+AA (220 mg/day each) does not prevent peri-partum depressive symptoms, in a population based sample with low background DHA intake. Trial registration: ISRCTN Register nr. ISRCTN58176213. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Study Objectives: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology.
   Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomnographic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale.
   Setting: Sleep laboratory.
   Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol.
   Interventions: N/A.
   Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211 +/- 6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475 +/- 7,990 pg/mL, P < 0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P < 0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P < 0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin.
   Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

AB Low back pain (LBP) is estimated to affect 50-90% of women during pregnancy with more than a third of women reporting it as a severe problem compromising their ability to work during pregnancy and affecting normal daily life and sleep patterns. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in kinematics and kinetics of lifting in pregnant subjects.
   Methodology
   Fifteen maternal subjects (age: 32.0 +/- 2.3 yrs; height: 165.3 +/- 5.5cm; weight: 71.7 +/- 6.4kg) were tested at the third trimester of pregnancy (32-38 weeks). Twenty-seven retro reflective markers were placed on the various bony landmarks of the subjects. An eight-camera motion analysis system (VICON 512, VICON, Oxford, UK) was used to record movements of the body segment and synchronised force plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) parameters in three dimensions. Eight non-pregnant subjects (age: 29.6 +/- 3.1 yrs; height: 167.3 +/- 5.6cm; weight: 65.4 +/- 8.4kg) were used as controls.
   Each subject lifted a 4 kg plastic box (dimension: 31.5x25x20 cm), which is representative of commonly lifted items. Motion of the ankle, knee and hip joints and pelvic segments were investigated. Principal component (PC) analysis was applied to 23 kinematic and kinetic variables from each group. The total PC score for each subject was calculated, and a one-tail student-t test was used to test for significant differences between the groups.
   Results
   Significant group differences (p<0.05) were found for three of the PC scores. Parameters found to be major contributors to these differences included minimum hip flexion extension moment; maximum knee flexion moment; maximum ankle plantar flexion and knee flexion angles and average hip flexion extension angles.
   Discussion
   PCA was able to identify different lifting kinematics and kinetics in pregnant subjects and important biomechanical differences when compared with the control group. This is the first study to identify such lifting differences during pregnancy.

AB The aim of the study was to explore associations between disrupted rest-activity cycles and symptoms of depression in the perinatal period. Mothers were evaluated in the third trimester of pregnancy at 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum. A group of non-pregnant women was used as reference. Self-reported inventories were completed to assess depressive symptoms and actigraphy was used to measure rest-activity patterns. The rest-activity cycle of mothers was distrubed in pregnancy and particularly during the first months after delivery. Symptoms of depression were associated with altered rest-activity cycles, with a less marked dichotomy between sleep and wake states (BDI-II, r = -.28, p = .03), with less activity when awake (from r = -.26, p = .05, PDSS to r = -.31, p = .02, BDI-II) or before retiring (BDI-II, r = -.40, p < .01) and particularly with more inactivity in the hours after rising (BDI-II, r = .28, p = .03; PDSS, r = .33, p = .01). These results suggest that engaging in daily activities when awake and good sleep hygiene could eventually amcliorate mother's mood.

AB Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, duration and risk factors for benign neonatal sleep myoclonus (BNSM) in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) treated with opioids or sedatives, compared with control infants.
   Methods: This is a single centre observational case control study. Seventy-eight near term and term infants with neonatal opiate abstinence syndrome confirmed by meconium analysis were included. Exclusion criteria were cerebral malformation, intracranial haemorrhage and perinatal asphyxia. The babies were assessed eight hourly with a modified Finnegan score that included sleep myoclonus. Seventy-eight infants not exposed to opiates during pregnancy, hospitalized for at least 14 days and matched for gestational age were used as controls.
   Results: The median gestational age was 38 (1)/(7) (95% CI: 35 (3)/(7)-41 (2)/(7)) weeks, birth weight 2730 (95% CI: 1890-3600) g, umbilical artery pH 7.25 (CI 7.10-7.37) and Apgar score at 5 minutes 9 (95% CI: 7-10). The control infants did not differ in these characteristics.
   Sleep myoclonus was diagnosed in 52 (67%) of the infants with NAS and 2 (2.6%) of the controls (OR 26 [95% CI: 7-223], p < 0.001). Myoclonus appeared as early as day 2 and as late as day 56 of life (median day 6) and lasted for 1 to 93 days (median 13 days). All infants had serum glucose > 2.5 mmol/L at first occurrence. The neurological examinations as well as cerebral ultrasound scans were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) carried out in 18 infants showed no signs of epileptic activity.
   Conclusion: BNSM has a high incidence in infants with NAS. The diagnosis can be made clinically. In the absence of other neurological symptoms further investigations such as EEG are not necessary and anticonvulsive treatment is not indicated.

AB Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (NIC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to study genetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects.

AB Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine neonatal symptoms previously reported to be associated with exposure to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy in a group of infants exposed to antidepressants, using a prospective and controlled design. Method: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. Results: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for 3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. Conclusions: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome.

AB Postpartum psychological distress is common and its detection is important in primary health care. Australia's residential early parenting centres admit mothers with their infants and treat both infant sleep and settling and maternal mental health. Many women have health problems but low uptake of professional assistance after discharge. Psychological distress may be conceptualised as either individual psychopathology or a normal reaction to caring for an unsettled infant, loss of identity and status, and limited emotional and practical assistance, but the potential benefits or harms of psychiatric labelling are uncertain. We examined the opinions of consumers of a residential early parenting centre. The method used was that, 12 months after discharge, a self-report survey was mailed. Results showed 50/94 (54%) women returned completed surveys. Participants identified perceived causes of postpartum psychological distress as: difficult infant temperament and behaviour (57%); fatigue (53%); and insufficient support (47%). Sixty-one per cent thought that diagnostic labels could improve access to health care, but 58% believed that it might cause others to question a woman's mothering ability or limit access to employment (83%). Psychiatric labels may improve access to health care in the postpartum, but effective treatments will address causes of distress as understood by women.

AB This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality in late pregnancy and recurrence of postpartum major depression (PPMD) through 28 weeks postpartum. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 36 weeks gestation was assessed in 51 non-depressed women with a history of PPMD; recurrence was determined by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Sleep quality in late pregnancy was not related to recurrence per se, but it was related to timing of recurrence (Kruskal-Wallace = 9.78, p = .008). Rapid recurrence (within 4 weeks post delivery) was preceded by fewer sleep complaints (mean PSQI for early recurrers = 4.8 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .09). Recurrence after 4 weeks postpartum was preceded by more sleep complaints in late pregnancy (mean PSQI for late recurrers = 9.9 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .02). Sleep quality in late pregnancy may help in identifying women at risk for a PPMD recurrence.

AB Sleep data were collected by maternal report in a prospective longitudinal follow up of cocaine-exposed and unexposed children. There were 139 participants: 23 with no prenatal drug exposure, 55 exposed to cocaine alone or in combination with other drugs, and 61 exposed to drugs other than cocaine. Characteristics differed between exposure groups including birth size, caretaker changes, maternal socioeconomic status, and postnatal drug use. Compared to those with no drug exposure, children with prenatal drug exposure other than cocaine experienced greater sleep problems (p = .026). Prenatal nicotine exposure was a unique predictor of sleep problems (p = .048). Early sleep problems predicted later sleep problems (all ps < .01). Together, these preliminary findings suggest possible neurotoxic sleep effects that persist over time. Larger studies, however, need to be conducted that better control for potential postnatal confounding factors.

AB Activity-rest behaviour of 11 neonates whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy (s-group) and 11 neonates of non-smoking mothers (ns-group) born by Caesarean section (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using Actiwatch actometers. In addition, a standardised diary was kept regularly. Amount of sleep time during daytime, night time, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during daytime and night time, were compared. Both groups showed a significant difference in amount of night time sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at night time. Many adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy are known. We could not, however, detect significant differences in the amount of night time sleep, daytime sleep, and 24h sleep time between the s- and ns-group neonates.

AB Different factors have been proposed to influence morningness-eveningness, biological rhythms, and sleep-wake cycles, but few studies focused on the influence of social habits. Here, we focus on the influence of children and partners on the social habits of women at different stages of their lives and on synchronization within the family. One hundred and seventy-nine women participated in the study and were allocated into four groups: women without children, pregnant women without children, pregnant women with children, and non-pregnant mothers. Morningness was predicted by the presence of children, and earlier chronotype was predicted by the presence of children, pregnancy, and age. Average sleep duration was longest in pregnant women. The presence of children was responsible for a difference in rise times of approximately 1.5h on the weekend. Subjective sleep-onset latencies were shortest in women with children. The synchrony between partners (husband/wife) was 0.46 in women without children, 0.79 in pregnant women, 0.40 in women with children, and 0.56 between mother and child. Partners' chronotypes were highly correlated, as were those of mother and child. This study suggests children have a strong influence on their mother's lifestyle and sleep-wake rhythm, far beyond the first months of life, and that children are a more important social factor than the male partner.

AB Purpose: Many women report disturbed sleep during pregnancy, but its impact on clinical outcomes remains unknown. This study examined subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in relation to preterm birth. Methods: A convenience sample of 220 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during the second trimester. Women who had preterm and full-term births were compared on these measures. Results: The preterm birth rate of the sample was 14.6%. Sleep latency, the period from lights out to sleep onset, was significantly longer in the preterm group, which also reported a tendency to use more sleep medications, but had lower PSQI daytime dysfunction scores. Perceived stress did not differentiate preterm and full-term groups. Conclusion: Disturbed sleep in pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth. Future studies should examine specific physiological factors that underlie this increased vulnerability.

AB Background
   Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period and it is important to examine interventions being used to educate new parents about caring for themselves and their newborns during this time.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered by an educator to an individual or group on maternal/paternal and infant outcomes and health services, and whether the effects of structured postnatal education vary by length or type of intervention and by population.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2007), CINAHL (1982 to September 2007), ERIC (1966 to September 2007), HealthSTAR (1966 to September 2007), PsycINFO (1806 to September 2007), Sociological Abstracts (1974 to September 2007), ClinicalTrials.gov (August 2007), Current Controlled Trials (August 2007), Trialscentral.org (August 2007) and TheNationalResearchRegister (August 2007).
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided by an educator to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post birth related to the care of an infant or of the family. We excluded studies of educational interventions for parents of infants in neonatal intensive care units.
   Data collection and analysis
   Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports.
   Main results
   We included 14 trials (2934 women) and excluded 24. Of the 14 included studies, education tested included: four on infant sleep enhancement, four on infant behaviour, two on general post- birth health, three on infant safety, and one on father involvement/skills with infants. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and/or participant accrual/loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only five were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses and these included the same two studies. Of these five meta-analyses, only one was found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect; education on sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more minutes of sleep in 24 hours (95% confidence interval 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care.
   Authors' conclusions
   The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborn infants remain unclear. Education on sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep although more and larger studies are needed to confirm this.

AB The study of fetal neurobehavioral development in genetically altered mice promises a significant advance in our understanding of the prenatal origins of developmental disabilities in humans. Despite their importance, little is known about fetal neurobehavioral development in mice. In this study, we observed prenatal behavioral patterns of the C57BL/6J mouse, a common background strain for genetically altered mice, and report their similarity to those observed in the early to mid-gestation human fetus. Fetal offspring from pregnant C57BL/6J dams were observed on the day before birth (E18 of a 19-day gestation). Scoring and analysis of fetal movement included Prechtl's Method for Qualitative Assessment, Interlimb Movement Synchrony, a measure of the temporal relationship between movements of limb pairs, and Behavioral State, quantified through detailed analysis of high and low amplitude limb movements. With the exception off fetal breathing movements, all categories and patterns of behavior typically reported in the early to mid-gestation human fetus were observed in the C57BL/6J mouse fetus. Our results suggest that behavioral analysis of fetal C57BL/6J mice may yield important new insights into early to mid-gestation human behavioral development. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Polymicrogyria is a congenital brain malformation characterized by abnormal cortical lamination, excessive cortical folding (smaller and more numerous gyri). It is a consequence of brain perfusion failure during pregnancy between the 20th and the 24th weeks of gestation. Their classification (bilateral versus unilateral malformation) has been greatly improved by brain MRI, and their localizations are more frequently in the perisylvian regions. Sporadic polymicrogyria are predominant, but some familial syndromes have been identified. Mental retardation, pyramidal signs and epilepsy are frequently reported. Specific epileptic syndrome such as electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep can occur and require adapted antiepileptic drugs. When medical treatment is not adequate, surgical therapy has to be considered. We reported a study of 12 children with unilateral polymicrogyria associated with epileptic seizures and continuous spikes and waves syndrome - not controlled by steroids - and treated successfully by hemispherotomy. All but one were seizure-free after surgery, antiepileptic drugs were stopped, without increase of the preoperative deficit, global motricity, behavior as well as learning capacities were moreover improved.

AB Introduction: Malaria causes an overwhelmingly large number of cases and deaths round the globe every year. Insecticide treated nets (ITNs) have become important tools that provide a simple, but effective means of preventing malaria in highly endemic areas.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design Was used to investigate possession, utilization, and factors affecting possession and utilization of ITNs in Arbaminch Town and the malarious villages of Arbaminch Zuria District, southern Ethiopia from 22(nd) January to 1(st) February 2007 on a sample of 454 households. Data were collected using structured, pretested, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data entry and analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 for windows. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out.
   Results: The coverage for any net and ITN was 75.1% and 58.8% respectively; the utilization rate for any net and ITN by any member of the household the night prior to the study was 71% and 73% respectively. Both coverage and utilization were higher in rural areas than in urban. areas. The proportion of pregnant women and children Under five years who slept under ITNs the night preceding the study was 35% and 40.3% respectively. Education and income of head of households, place of residence of households and presence of high risk groups in the household were found to be predictors of net possession. Sex and income of head of households, and presence of radio in the households were predictors of utilization of nets by any household member. Education of head of households and place of residence of households were predictors of utilization of nets by-high risk groups.
   Conclusions: A wide gap exists between coverage and utilization of ITNs. Use of ITNs by high risk groups is far below the Abuja target. Appropriate BCC interventions are required to narrow the gap between coverage and utilization of ITNs and to escalate use of ITNs by high-risk groups. [Ethiop. J Health Dev. 2009;23(3):206-215]

AB Objectives: To describe different sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness in a French population of randomly selected young women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: Cross-sectional design with retrospective survey of pre-pregnancy, symptoms and prospective survey of current symptoms. Mothers were interviewed during pregnancy with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep before pregnancy and to assess alterations in their sleep according to the trimester. Results: 871 pregnant women completed the questionnaire. The rate of pregnant women with insomnia with non-refreshing sleep and frequent awakenings increases during the second and the third trimester reaching more than 75% of the women, essentially due to an urge to urinate, movements of the fetus, backache and restless legs syndrome. Snoring also increases throughout the pregnancy with more than 18% of them snoring every night. Conversely, more than 75% of the women complained of a decrease in their vigilance and a need to nap inreased during the pregnancy. Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy and increases throughout the pregnancy, except for excessive daytime sleepiness which was more frequent during the first trimester.

This article focuses on the potentially adverse effects of the male biological clock on fertility in older men. Advanced paternal age increases the risk for spontaneous abortion as well as genetic abnormalities in offspring due to multiple factors, Including DNA damage from abnormal apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. Increased paternal age is also associated with a decrease In semen volume, percentage of normal sperm, and sperm motility. Older men considering parenthood should have a thorough history and physical examination focused on their sexual and reproductive capacity. Such examination should entail disclosure of any sexual dysfunction and the use of medications, drugs, or lifestyle factors that might impair fertility or sexual response. Older men should also be counseled regarding the effects of paternal age on spermatogenesis and pregnancy.

AB Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a molecule with diverse physiological functions. This neuro-hormone affects reproductive performance in a wide variety of species. In most animals, but not exclusively all, melatonin has an antigonadotrophic effect. The seasonal changes in the number of hours per day that melatonin is secreted mediate the temporal coupling of reproductive activity to seasonal changes in day-length. These observations stimulated a search for a role for the pineal gland and melatonin in human reproduction. Clinical experience related to this issue has yielded inconclusive and sometimes conflicting results. This article reviews the current available evidence concerning the effects of melatonin on human reproductive processes (e.g., puberty, ovulation, pregnancy, and fertility). Possible reasons for the vagueness and elusiveness of the clinical effects are discussed.

AB Background: There is limited information regarding the effects of IGF-I and/ or IGFBP-3 on circulating leptin concentrations. Aim: To determine the effects of IGF-I on leptin and insulin concentrations, we examined leptin and insulin nocturnal profiles before and after the administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex (Iplex (TM)) to prepubertal, low birth weight children. Methods: We studied 20 prepubertal children (11 boys and 9 girls), born after a full-term pregnancy with a mean birth weight below 2.8 kg. They were studied at the mean age of 7.3 +/- 0.5 years (range 4-11 years). Their mean height was -1.8 +/- 0.3 SDS and their mean BMI was 0.1 +/- 0.2 SDS at the time of the study. The children were studied on 2 separate occasions, the first under basal conditions, and the second time after s.c. administration of 1 mg/kg of Iplex (TM) at 21.00 h. Blood samples for determination of leptin and insulin were obtained every 60 min between 23.00 h and 07.00 h, while the children were sleeping. In each patient, we calculated the leptin and insulin mean area under the curve, both under basal conditions and after the administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex. Results: Mean nocturnal leptin area under the curve exhibited a significant increase (2.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 11.2 +/- 2.6 ng/ml h, p < 0.05), whereas that for mean insulin showed a slight decrease, which did not reach statistical significance after administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex. Conclusion: These findings indicate that administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex increases circulating leptin concentrations in short prepubertal, small for gestational age children, suggesting that IGF-I and/or IGFBP-3 may stimulate leptin secretion by adipose tissue.

AB Objective: To determine whether 2-hour and 4-hour urinary proteins correlate with 24-hour proteinuria in patients with preeclampsia. Study design: Protein estimation was done from 2-hour, 4-hour, and 24-hour urine samples in 50 women with preeclampsia and the results were compared. Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the mean protein excretion when comparing the 2-hour values with the 24-hour and further comparing 4-hour values with the 24-hour value. The values of 2-hour and 4-hour urine proteins in total volume (TV) correlated well with 24-hour value for mild severe disease (p 0.001). Amount of the protein excretion in 2-hour and 4-hour samples predicted mild preeclampsia with positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 80%. NPV of both the samples for severe preeclampsia was 100%. Conclusion: 2-hour and 4-hour proteinuria can be used for initial assessment of preeclampsia thereby avoiding the inconvenience and delay in treatment.

AB Pregnant black depressed women were compared to pregnant black non-depressed women on self-report stress measures and cortisol levels at mid and late pregnancy and on neonatal outcomes. The depressed women had higher anxiety, anger, daily hassles, sleep disturbance scores and cortisol levels at both prenatal visits. These higher stress levels may have contributed to the greater incidence of prematurity and low birthweight neonatal outcomes noted in the depressed group, and they may partially explain the higher rate of prematurity and low birthweight among black women.

AB Objective: To determine the current knowledge of postpartum womens' sleep patterns, sleep disturbances, consequences of sleep disturbances, and known strategies for prevention in order to provide best practice recommendations for health care providers.
   Data Sources: A literature search from 1969 through February 2008 was conducted using the CINHL, Index of Allied Health Literature, Ovid, PsycINFO, and PubMed electronic databases in addition to reference lists from selected articles and other key references. Search terms included sleep, postpartum, sleep deprivation, and sleep disturbance.
   Study Selection: A critical review of all relevant articles from the data sources was conducted with attention to the needs of postpartum womens' sleep and implications for health care providers.
   Data Extraction: Literature was reviewed and organized into groups with similar characteristics.
   Data Synthesis: An integrative review of the literature summarized the current state of research related to sleep alterations in postpartum women.
   Conclusions: Postpartum women experience altered sleep patterns that may lead to sleep disturbances. The most common reasons for sleep disturbances are related to newborn sleep and feeding patterns. Although present, the relationships among sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression in postpartum women lack clarity due to their ambiguous definitions and the variety of the studies conducted. Providers should encourage prenatal education that assists the couple in developing strategies for decreasing postpartum sleep deprivation. Alterations of in-hospital care and home care should be incorporated to improve the new family's sleep patterns.

AB To further understanding of the multiple temporal relationships of the physiological process, we monitored simultaneously 25 different variables in individual cows. We used 6 Bruna Italiana non - pregnant and non lactating cows from the same farm. The animals were housed individually in a 12 m(2) box under natural 14/10 light/dark cycle. They were fed twice daily and water was available ad libitum. Locomotor activity and heart rate were recorded continuously. The rectal temperature, respiratory rate and blood samples were recorded every 4 hours for 24 consecutive hours. To describe the periodic phenomenon analytically we applied a trigonometric statistical model according to the single cosinor procedure. Twelve of the 25 variables studied showed a daily rhythm: locomotor activity, rectal temperature, respiratory rate, haemoglobin, glucose, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, total lipids, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), phosphorus and magnesium. Our results contribute to the understanding of the capacity for reaction and adaptation of animals to the environment, and to the improvement in their output by intervention in their environmental circumstances and in the breeding process.

   prolonged-release melatonin and synthetic melatoninergic agonists
SO NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
LA English
DT Review
DE agomelatine; hypnotics; melatonin; prolonged-release; ramelteon;
   tasimelteon
AB Hypnotic effects of melatonin and melatoninergic drugs are mediated via MT1 and MT2 receptors, especially those in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which acts on the hypothalamic sleep switch. Therefore, they differ fundamentally from GABAergic hypnotics. Melatoninergic agonists primarily favor sleep initiation and reset the circadian clock to phases allowing persistent sleep, as required in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A major obstacle for the use of melatonin to support sleep maintenance in primary insomnia results from its short half-life in the circulation. Solutions to this problem have been sought by developing prolonged-release formulations of the natural hormone, or melatoninergic drugs of longer half-life, such as ramelteon, tasimelteon and agomelatine. With all these drugs, improvements of sleep are statistically demonstrable, but remain limited, especially in primary chronic insomnia, so that GABAergic drugs may be indicated. Melatoninergic agonists do not cause next-day hangover and withdrawal effects, or dependence. They do not induce behavioral changes, as sometimes observed with z-drugs. Despite otherwise good tolerability, the use of melatoninergic drugs in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy has been a matter of concern, and should be avoided in autoimmune diseases and Parkinsonism. Problems and limits of melatoninergic hypnotics are compared.

AB Background: Gender differences in the relationship of snoring and diabetes mellitus are mainly unknown. We aimed to analyze the relationship between snoring, witnessed sleep apnea and diabetes mellitus and to analyze possible gender related differences in an unselected population.
   Methods: Questions on snoring and witnessed sleep apneas were included in the Northern Sweden component of the WHO, MONICA Study. Invited were 10,756 men and women aged 25-79 years, randomly selected from the population register.
   Results: There were 7905 (73%) subjects, 4047 women and 3858 men who responded to the questionnaire and attended a visit for a physical examination. Habitual snoring was related to diabetes mellitus in women, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.44, p = 0.041) independent of smoking, age, body mass index and waist circumference. Witnessed sleep apnea was also independently related to diabetes mellitus in women, with an adjusted OR = 3.29 (95% CI 1.20-8.32, p = 0.012). Neither snoring, nor witnessed sleep apneas were associated with diabetes mellitus among men, except for witnessed sleep apnea in men aged 25-54 years old. They had an adjusted OR = 3.84 (95% CI 1.36-10.9, p = 0.011) for diabetes mellitus.
   Conclusions: Snoring and witnessed sleep apneas are related to diabetes mellitus in women. Witnessed sleep apnea is related to diabetes mellitus in men younger than 55 years old. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To determine whether long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs) distributed free of charge to pregnant women at their first antenatal clinic visit in Kinshasa, DRC are used from the time of distribution to delivery and 6 months after delivery.
   Women were enrolled into a cohort study at their first antenatal care (ANC) visit and provided LLINs free of charge. Reported use of these nets was then measured at the time of delivery (n = 328) and in a random sample of women (n = 100) 6 months post-delivery using an interviewer administered, structured questionnaire.
   At baseline, only 25% of women reported having slept under a bed net the night before the interview. At the time of delivery, after being provided an LLIN for free, this increased to 79%. Six months post-delivery (n = 100), 80% of women reported sleeping under a net with a child under the age of 5 the night before the interview.
   Freely distributed bed nets are acceptable, feasible and result in high usage. Free distribution of bed nets during antenatal clinic visits may be a highly effective way to rapidly increase the use of bed nets among both pregnant women and their newborn infants in areas with high levels of ANC attendance.

AB Pregnancy-related low back pain is a common problem during pregnancy. More than half of all pregnant women experience low back pain at some time during pregnancy. The pain can vary from a mild discomfort to being severe and disabling. In one-third of these women, pain is a severe problem compromising activities of daily living, work and sleep. The awareness of the possible impact of low back pain on the quality of life and the associated costs to society has increased medical attention over the last decade. Pain usually develops between the fifth and seventh month of pregnancy but may appear as early as the first trimester. Moreover, some women who experience back pain during pregnancy experience persistent back pain in the postpartum period or have an increased risk of back pain in subsequent pregnancies, and many women with chronic back pain link its onset to a pregnancy. Despite its high frequency, there are some ambiguities inherent in the terminology, diagnosis and classification. The etiology and pathogenesis are not yet clearly understood. The etiology of pain is probably related to a combination of mechanical, hormonal and vascular contributing factors. Low back pain in pregnancy is most commonly subdivided into lumbar pain and posterior pelvic pain. This subdivision is important in terms of both management and prognosis. Characteristic findings and treatment may differ between the two categories. Accurate assessment and effective treatment are important for managing the low back pain of pregnancy.
   The purpose of the present article was to provide a summary review of the performed studies on pregnancy-related low back pain. (Turk J Rheumatol 2009; 24: 39-45)

AB Background. Postpartum sleep is a difficult and complicated concept to measure owing to the intrusive nature of research at a sensitive and private time for new families. Nurses often find themselves advising mothers on ways to improve sleep and reduce fatigue based on teachings that are not evidence based. The purpose of this secondary analysis of a larger study of postpartum fatigue patterns was to examine the relationship between sleep characteristics and postpartum fatigue during the first 6 weeks after delivery.
   Methods. A prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study was conducted of 109 postpartum women. Sleep and fatigue were measured using a 16-item subjective sleep characteristics scale and a 30-statement subjective fatigue instrument. Three measurement points were used: 1) 1-2 days after delivery (before hospital discharge); 2) 2 weeks postpartum; and 3) 6 weeks postpartum.
   Results. Fatigue had a positive correlation with sleep disturbance at all three measurement points, indicating that higher levels of fatigue are associated with more disturbed sleep. No association was found between levels of fatigue and sleep supplementation. Levels of fatigue had a negative correlation with sleep effectiveness at all measurement points, indicating that the women were more fatigued if they perceived their sleep quality and adequacy to be poor or if they perceived the time spent sleeping to be short.
   Conclusions. To reduce fatigue, nurses should focus on exploring ways to reduce maternal sleep disturbance and improve maternal sleep effectiveness. It is unclear whether the age-old advice to "nap when your baby naps" is effective in reducing postpartum fatigue.

AB Background and Purpose. Sleep quality seems to bean antecedent to depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms.
   Methods. Each of the 252 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep quality measure at mid and late pregnancy.
   Results. PSQI total scores showed good internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors. Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that the PSQI is useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early pregnancy.

AB Nicotine is a neuroteratogen and is the likely link between maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Osmotic minipumps were implanted in 5-7 d CF1 pregnant mice to deliver nicotine bitartrate (60 mg Kg(-1) day(-1)) or saline (control) solutions for up to 28 d. Prenatal to early postnatal nicotine exposure did not modify the number of newborns per litter or their postnatal growth; however, nicotine-exposed neonates hypoventilated and had reduced responses to hypercarbia (inhalation of air enriched with 10% CO2 for 20 min) and hypoxia (inhalation of 100% N-2 for 20 s) at postnatal days 0-3 (P0-P3). In contrast, at postnatal day 8, nicotine-exposed neonates were indistinguishable from controls. Isolated brainstem-spinal cord preparations obtained from P0 to P3 nicotine-exposed neonates showed fictive respiration with respiratory cycles longer and more irregular than those of controls, as indicated by high short- and long-term variability in Poincare plots. In addition, their responses to acidification were reduced, indicating compromise of central chemoreception. Furthermore, the cholinergic contribution to central chemosensory responses switched from muscarinic receptor to nicotinic receptor-based mechanisms. No significant astrogliosis was detectable in the ventral respiratory group of neurons with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. These results indicate that nicotine exposure affects the respiratory rhythm pattern generator and causes a decline in central chemoreception during early postnatal life. Consequently, breathing would become highly vulnerable, failing to respond to chemosensory demands. Such impairment could be related to the ventilatory abnormalities observed in SIDS.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women.
   Method: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15 healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p. m. to 11:00 a. m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates.
   Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a. m. to 11:00 a. m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women.
   Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression.

AB The effect of stabling for the first time on the behaviour and welfare of young and naive horses has not yet been studied in detail. In this study we examined the effect of two typical housing systems on their subsequent behavioural and physiological responses upon first time stabling. Thirty-six 2-year-old Dutch warmbloods, 18 geldings and 18 mares were included in the study. Half of the horses were stabled in individual stables (10.5 m(2)) and the other half in pair housing (48 m(2) for two horses). The study lasted 12 weeks. At the end of the study the physiological and temperamental responses of the horses on the different treatments was tested using a CRF challenge test (to test the HPA-axis function) and a Novel Object test (to test temperamental differences) respectively. Especially in the first week after stabling pair housed horses spent more time eating whereas individually housed horses spent more time either standing vigilant or sleeping. Stress-related behaviours like neighing, pawing, nibbling and snorting were ail displayed significantly more frequently in the individually housed horses (P < 0.01). At the end of the study 67% of the individually housed horses was seen performing one or more stereotypies (P < 0.01). The cortisol response and ACTH response on the CRF challenge test were lower for horses in the individually housed boxes. It is suggested that this depression in socially isolated animals is caused by a desensitisation of the HPA axis in response to stress-induced elevations in ACTH and cortisol. In general there was no effect of the treatment on the reactivity of the horses during the Novel Object test. However, there were significant relations between the responses of horses in the Novel Object test and in the stable environment. It is concluded that sudden isolated stabling is stressful to young and naive horses, resulting in a high prevalence of stereotypies and abnormal behaviours. This study also provided some support for the notion that social stress in horses may be associated with it blunted adrenocortical response to CRF challenge. The finding that responses of horses to a behavioural test are correlated with home environment behaviours suggests that individual horses exhibit consistent behavioural traits across different contexts, and opens the possibility of using behavioural tests in horses to predict more general underlying behavioural characteristics.

AB The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of child-bearing age, and the diagnosis carries with it associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors that are likely linked to insulin resistance. Consequently, women affected by PCOS are at significant risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Aggressive screening for glucose intolerance and cardiovascular risk factors should be performed in all PCOS patients, and, when indicated by symptomatology, affected women should be screened for sleep apnea. Long-term goals of therapy should focus on prevention of these comorbidities.

AB Despite a variable prevalence in the literature, HAS is characterized by a higher frequency in men. This study involved a review of published data describing the impact of gender on features of OSAS.
   In women, HAS seems to be associated with certain anatomical factors such as more significant obesity, a thinner oropharyngeal junction, a shorter uvula and reduced upper airway (UA) collapsibility, in comparison with men. Sleep related breathing disorders observed during pregnancy are more likely UA resistance syndrome than true OSAS, and are associated with severe fetal and maternal complications that could be improved by the use of nasal CPAP. Though HAS symptoms are underestimated by women, the Epworth score as well as snoring are not influenced by gender. Gender does not seem to be a risk factor for increased mortality. Compliance with nasal CPAP is identical in both sexes, but oral appliance seem to be more effective in women.
   Further studies are needed to produce the required complementary data to confirm specific sex-related features in the diagnosis and treatment of OSAS.

AB Background: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact with the neurophysiological development of neonates.
   Study Objectives: The present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep patterns in the preterm neonate.
   Design: Overnight sleep patterns were polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset, The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed.
   Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France).
   Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 +/- 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, S-low, n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, S (heavy), n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy.
   Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (-21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep.
   Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

AB Obstructive steep apnea (OSA) is a common cause of daytime sleepiness for millions of Americans. It is also a disease associated with an increased likelihood of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, motor vehicle accidents, and diminished quality of life. A number of population-based studies have shown that OSA is more common in men than in women and this discrepancy is often evident in the clinical setting. There are a number of pathophysiological differences to suggest why men are more prone to the disease than women. Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, differences in obesity, upper airway anatomy, breathing control, hormones, and aging are all thought to play a role. The purpose of this review was to examine the literature on gender differences in OSA and to analyze whether or not these differences in pathogenic mechanisms affect diagnosis or treatment.

AB Fatigue, a common presenting symptom in primary care, negatively impacts work performance, family life, and social relationships. The differential diagnosis of fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia, pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management. (Am Fam Physician. 2008;78 (10):1173-1179.

AB Aim: Exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Foetal and postnatal smoke-exposure may alter cardiovascular control in infants. We studied heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses in smoke-exposed infants.
   Methods: Eleven infants exposed to maternal cigarette smoking were studied at the age of 12 +/- 2.1 (range 10-16) weeks. Twenty healthy, age-matched infants from non-smoking families served as controls. During confirmed slow-wave sleep (NREM3), 3-5 sec side motion and 45 sec 45 degrees head-up tilt tests were performed.
   Results: Control infants showed consistent biphasic HR and BP responses to side motion, with an initial 2-5% increase followed by a 2% decrease (p < 0.0001). In smoke-exposed infants, the initial HR (p = 0.009) and BP responses (p < 0.0001) were markedly reduced, and the subsequent decrease in BP was more prominent (systolic blood pressure, SBP, p = 0.005; diastolic blood pressure, DBP, p = 0.03). No differences were observed between the groups in tilt test results, HR variability or HR responses to spontaneous arousals.
   Conclusion: Maternal cigarette smoking may alter vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control in early infancy. This may contribute to increased SIDS risk.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the association between time of delivery and neonatal outcomes in term deliveries.
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all term pregnancies delivered at an academic institution with 24-hour in-house obstetric and anesthesia coverage. Time of delivery was categorized as day (7 AM to 6 PM), evening (6 PM to 12 midnight), and late night (12 midnight to 7 AM). Outcomes included 5-minute Apgar less than 7, umbilical artery pH less than 7.0, base excess less than -12, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and neonatal death. We excluded patients delivered via cesarean delivery not in labor. We had greater than 80% power to detect a 25% difference in Apgar score, base excess, and admission to the NICU and 80% power to detect a 50% difference in umbilical artery pH less than 7.0.
   RESULTS: Among the 34,424 deliveries meeting inclusion criteria, 15,664 were during the day, 8495 were during the evening, and 10,265 were during the night. In univariate comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences in neonatal outcomes. For example, the rate of pH less than 7.0 was 0.7% during the day, 1.0% in the evening, and 0.6% at night (P = .12). Admissions to the NICU were 3.6% during the day, 3.7% in the evening, and 3.5% at night (P = .81). When we controlled for obstetric history, demographic factors, and labor characteristics, there were still no differences in rates of either neonatal morbidity or mortality by time of delivery.
   CONCLUSION: At our institution, we could not demonstrate any significant differences in neonatal morbidity or mortality by time of day among neonates delivered at term. These data can be used to counsel patients and families concerned about differences in time of delivery and potential impact on their infant's health. Future research should include time of delivery in relation to maternal and neonatal outcomes in various types of inpatient settings.

AB Objective To examine the effects of a community-based mutual health organization (MHO) on utilization of priority health services, financial protection of its members and inclusion of the poor and other target groups.
   Methods Four MHOs were established in two districts in Mali. A case-control study was carried out in which household survey data were collected from 817 MHO member households, 787 non-member households in MHO catchment areas, and 676 control households in areas without MHOs. We compiled MHO register data by household for a 22-month period. Outcome measures included utilization of priority services, health expenditures and out-of-pocket payments. Independent variables included individual, household and community demographic, socioeconomic and access characteristics, as determined through a household survey in 2004.
   Findings MHO members who were up to date on premium payments (controlling for education, distance to the nearest health facility and other factors) were 1.7 times more likely to get treated for fevers in modern facilities; three times more likely to take children with diarrhoea to a health facility and/or treat them with oral rehydration salts at home; twice as likely to make four or more prenatal, visits; and twice as likely, if pregnant or younger than 5 years, to sleep under an insecticide-treated net (P < 0.10 or better in all cases). However, distance was also a significant negative predictor for the utilization of many services, particularly assisted deliveries. Household and individual enrolment in an MHO were not significantly associated with socioeconomic status (with the exception of the highest quintile), and MHOS seemed to provide some financial protection for their members.
   Conclusion MHOs are one mechanism that countries strengthening the supply of primary care can use to increase financial access to - and equity in - priority health services.

AB Objective: To test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is more common in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disease and fetal growth restriction.
   Study design: An observational study comparing pregnant women with these two complications with normal pregnant women and non-pregnant women in two UK maternity hospitals. Each participant completed a sleep apnoea questionnaire and underwent nocturnal oxygen saturation monitoring.
   Results: Using a strict definition of obstructive sleep apnoea confirmed by oxygen saturation monitoring only two mild cases were seen, 0/50 non-pregnant women, 1/69 of normal pregnant women, 0/48 women with various types of hypertensive disease, and 1/33 women carrying fetuses affected with fetal growth restriction. Even using less strict definitions and self-reported sleepiness scores there was no relation between sleep apnoea and either fetal growth restriction or hypertensive diseases.
   Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnoea is at most a rare cause of either growth restriction or hypertensive disease in pregnancy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Tertiary hospital in southern California.
   A convenience sample of 39 antepartum women.
   Data were collected from participants' medical records, questionnaires (General Sleep Disturbance Scale), actigraphy on days 3 to 4 after admission, and a sleep diary that included reasons for awakening and morning and evening fatigue ratings.
   Week gestation ranged from 24 to 35 weeks. Sleep time varied from 310 to 492 minutes and averaged 6.7 hours/night. The women were awakened 9 to 32 times/night and averaged 18 awakenings. They napped an average of 124 minutes throughout the day. Women averaged 3.9 on the General Sleep Disturbance Scale when retrospectively considering 7 days before hospitalization and scored 4.1 when considering the current 3 days of hospitalization. In the diary, most rated their sleep quality as Fairly Good or Very Good (62%-71%), but 29% said Very Bad on night 2, and 38% said Very Bad on night 3.
   Frequent interruptions during the night do not allow for mothers to receive the restorative sleep they need.

AB To compare and measure the effects of sleep quality in women with and without postpartum depression.
   A case-control repeated measures matched pairs design.
   Home and obstetric office.
   Forty-six women who were 6 to 26 weeks postpartum. Two participants were dropped from the final analysis because they were outliers.
   Participants underwent wrist actigraphy at home for 7 consecutive days to measure sleep quality. The Postpartum Depression Screening Scale measured depression severity. Psychosocial variables were collected during a screening interview. A structured clinical interview was used to diagnose postpartum depression. Correlations, t tests, and hierarchical multiple regressions were run to analyze data.
   With the exception of wake episodes, sleep latency (B=1.80, SE=0.73, p <.05), wake after sleep onset (B=6.85, SE=2.85, p <.05), and thus sleep efficiency (B=-6.31, SE=3.13, p <.05) predicted postpartum depression symptom severity.
   Women with postpartum depression experienced poorer sleep quality than women without postpartum depression, and sleep quality worsened with increasing postpartum depression symptom severity. Clinicians need to address measures to improve sleep quality in depressed mothers to decrease symptom severity, and researchers need to develop interventions to facilitate better sleep quality in women with postpartum depression.

AB To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins.
   Descriptive longitudinal pilot study.
   Recruitment from 2 hospital postpartum units. Data collected in parents' homes.
   Eight primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation.
   Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue, and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables.
   Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not significantly different between parents and remained constant over time.
   Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors that influence sleep in parents of twins.

AB This is the ninth biennial report of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) begun in 1991. It includes results of a national survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a nationally representative sample of 14,041 public and private school students in grades 9-12, and results of 39 state and 22 city surveys, conducted in public schools, grades 9-12 by state and local agencies, with sample sizes varying from < 2,000 to > 10,000 students. Overall response rate in the national survey was 68%. State and local response rates varied from 60% to 90%.
   The surveys covered health-risk behaviors in six major categories: behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV); unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical activity. In addition, information was sought on prevalence of asthma and obesity, sun-safety behaviors and hours of sleep. Results were reported for 89 items altogether in the national survey, and a few less in the state and local reports.
   Statistical significance of findings by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade were reported for the national items, and trends over the nine biennial surveys were analyzed.
   Here are the findings for a selection of items from each category that illustrate important current features of risky behaviors by adolescents.

AB Objective. This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors.
   Method. 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis.
   Results. The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness.
   Conclusion. It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women.

AB Background-Being born preterm, small, and to a mother who smokes are common perinatal complications with major public health implications. Evidence suggests that each affects the body's structure and function in ways that could increase susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction later in life. Here, we used 2 routine stress reactivity tests to identify incipient "silent" programming of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with adverse perinatal events.
   Methods and Results-We studied 29 control babies born at term to nonsmokers, 18 term-born babies of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy (mean, 15 cigarettes a day), and 31 babies born preterm to nonsmokers. All infants were compared at the same age after conception (ie, at 40 to 42 weeks), during sleep. We analyzed blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to breathing 4% CO2 for 4 minutes or to passive head-up tilt to 60 degrees. BP was measured continuously from a wrist cuff. CO2 exposure raised heart rate and BP in controls by 10%, and tilt increased their BP by 5%. CO2 elicited the expected BP but no heart rate response from preterm infants but a much-greater-than-expected BP and heart rate response from babies of smokers. Tilt elicited a 3- to 4-fold greater rise in BP from preterm and tobacco-exposed babies.
   Conclusions-Vascular, cardiac, and blood pressure reactivity is heightened in babies born preterm or to smokers. The findings are consistent with in utero and early postnatal "programming" of human cardiovascular dysfunction by adverse circumstances. This incipient dysfunction may be an early manifestation of processes that lead to other problems or complications later on (eg, higher BP or sudden infant death syndrome).

AB Choline supplementation of the maternal diet has long-term facilitative effects on spatial and temporal memory processes in the offspring. To further delineate the impact of early nutritional status on brain and behavior, we examined effects of prenatal-choline availability on hippocampal oscillatory frequency bands in 12 month-old male and female rats. Adult offspring of time-pregnant dams that were given a deficient level of choline (DEF=0.0 g/kg), sufficient choline (CON=1.1 g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP=3.5 g/kg) in their chow during embryonic days (ED) 12-17 were implanted with an electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in combination with an electromyograph (EMG) electrode patch implanted in the nuchal muscle. Five consecutive 8-h recording sessions revealed differential patterns of EEG activity as a function of awake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep states and prenatal choline status. The main finding was that SUP rats displayed increased power levels of gamma (30-100 Hz) band oscillations during all phases of the sleep/wake cycle. These findings are discussed within the context of a general review of neuronal oscillations (e.g., delta, theta, and gamma bands) and synchronization across multiple brain regions in relation to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the hippocampus.

AB The parturition timing pattern was investigated for a total of 153 does during two consecutive years. During the kidding time in February goats were monitored at an hourly interval throughout 24 hours of the day. Hourly frequencies of spontaneous live births showed a unimodal distribution with maximum kidding between 10:00 and 20:00 h (78.5% of the total). The peak of delivery was between 14:00 and 16:00 h (21.6% of the total birth), whereas the lowest incidences of kidding, were observed between 04:00 and 06:00 h in the morning (0.7% of the total birth). There was not any detectable effect of the time of feeding on birth distribution. Frequency of kidding began to increase soon after the morning feeding and decreased sharply after the afternoon feeding. The results suggest that temporal distribution of births corresponding to circadian rhythm and that kidding was concentrated mainly during the daytime hours.

AB Prenatal lung development requires fetal breathing movements (FBM). To investigate the dependence of FBM on feedback originating from the lung, we hypothesized that pneumonectomy stimulates FBM. Time-dated fetal sheep underwent bilateral pneumonectomy, unilateral pneumonectomy, or sham surgery at 125-130 days gestation. The incidence of FBM decreased in sham-operated fetuses at 142 days versus 130 days (p= 0,013), but was unchanged across all gestational ages in bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses (p >= 0.52). In unilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses, the incidence of FBM remained unchanged until 139 days and was higher than that of the bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses at 130-136 days gestation (p <= 0.03). The amplitude of integrated diaphragmatic electromyographic activity (integral EMG(di)) and total respiratory output (frequency of breathing x integral EMG(di)) were lower in pneumonectomized fetuses versus sham-operated fetuses at later gestational ages (p < 0.05). These decreases in integral EMG(di) and total respiratory output were most pronounced at 142 days in bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses versus sham-operated fetuses (p = 0.006 and 0.016, respectively). Low-voltage electrocortical activity (ECoG) increased, and high-voltage ECoG decreased, in unilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses compared with sham-operated fetuses (p = 0.04). In conclusion, we provide new evidence that feedback from the fetal lung modulates the incidence and various components of phrenic nerve output, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism between FBM and lung development.

AB We investigated the effect of carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in the later stages of pregnancy on levels of antibody specific to the S. aureus toxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), in cord blood and breast milk and also explored the relationship between levels of antibody in antenatal serum and cord blood. Nasopharyngeal swabs and stool samples were collected on two occasions, from 96 women, during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy. Samples were cultured and S. aureus isolates were identified. Antenatal and cord blood samples from the same women and their infants were analysed for IgG antibody to SEB, SEC and TSST-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Breast milk samples were analysed for IgA antibody to the same toxins. We found that S. aureus carriage in pregnancy is common and exposure to a toxin-producing isolate boosts immunity. Over 89% of women and infants have some protective antibody to the toxins, and antitoxin IgG levels are higher in cord blood samples compared with antenatal samples. Levels of cord blood IgG and breast milk IgA specific for the staphylococcal toxins vary. Some infants lack protection and could be at risk of toxin-induced disease.

AB The molecular clockwork underlying the generation of circadian rhythmicity within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops gradually during ontogenesis. The authors previous work has shown that rhythms in clock gene expression in the rat SCN are not detectable at embryonic day (E)1.9, start to form at E20 and develop further via increasing amplitude until Postnatal day (P) 10. The aim of the present work was to elucidate whether and how swiftly the immature fetal and neonatal molecular SCN clocks can be reset by maternal Cues. pregnant rats maintained under a light-dark (LD) regimen with 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness were exposed to a 6-h delay of the dark period and released into constant darkness at different stages of the fetal SCN development. Adult rats maintained under the same LID regimen were exposed to an identical shifting procedure. Daily rhythms in spontaneous c-fos, Avp, Per1, and Per2 expression were examined within the adult and newborn SCN by in situ hybridization. Exposure of adult rats to the shifting procedure induced a significant phase delay of locomotor activity within 3 days after the phase shift as well as a delay in the rhythms of c-fos and Avp expression within 3 days and Per1 and Per2 expression within 5 days. Exposure of pregnant rats to the shifting procedure at El 8, but not at E20, delayed the rhythm in c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of newborn PUPS at P0-1. The shifting procedure at E20 did, however, induce a phase delay of Per1 and Per2 expression rhythms at P3 and P6. Hence, 5 days were necessary for phase-shifting the pups' SCN clock by maternal cues, be it the interval between E18 and P0-1 or the interval between E20 and P3, while only 3 days were necessary for phase-shifting the maternal SCN by photic cues. These results demonstrate that the SCN clock is capable of significant phase shifts at fetal developmental stages when no or very faint molecular oscillations can be detected.

ID FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE; UNITED-STATES; VALIDATION; WORK
AB OBJECTIVE. Our goal is to describe the methods used in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II), a study of infant feeding and care practices throughout the first year of life. Survey topics included breastfeeding, formula and complementary feeding, infant health, breast-pump use, food allergies, sleeping arrangements, mother's employment, and child care arrangements. In addition, mothers' dietary intake was measured prenatally and postnatally.
   PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS. The IFPS II sample was drawn from a nationally distributed consumer opinion panel of 500 000 households. All questionnaires were administered by mail, 1 prenatally and 10 postpartum. Qualifying criteria were used to achieve the sample goals of mothers of healthy term and late preterm singleton infants. In addition to the questionnaires about the infants, women were sent a diet-assessment questionnaire prenatally and at similar to 4 months after delivery; this questionnaire was also sent to members of a comparison group who were neither pregnant nor postpartum.
   RESULTS. A sample of 4902 pregnant women began the study, and similar to 2000 continued through their infant's first year. Response rates ranged from 63% to 87% for the different questionnaires. Compared with adult mothers of singletons from the nationally representative sample of the National Survey of Family Growth, IFPS II participants had a higher mean education level; were older; were more likely to be middle income, white, and employed; were less likely to smoke; and had fewer other children. Compared with women who participated in the National Immunization Survey who gave birth in 2004, IFPS II mothers were more likely to breastfeed and to breastfeed longer.
   CONCLUSIONS. The IFPS II provides a valuable database because of its large sample size, the frequency of its questionnaires, and its wide coverage of issues salient to infant feeding.

AB Maternal psychological functioning during pregnancy affects both maternal and fetal well-being. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis provides one mechanism through which maternal psychosocial factors may be transduced to the fetus. However, few studies have examined maternal psychological factors or birth outcomes in relation to the diurnal pattern of cortisol across the day. The current study examined maternal psychological well-being, parity status, and birth weight in relation to the maternal cortisol diurnal rhythm in a group of 98 low-risk pregnant women (51 primiparae). At 36 weeks gestation, participants completed both pregnancy-specific and general self-report measures of psychological functioning and provided saliva samples at 8:00, 12:00, and 16:00 h on 2 consecutive working days for the assay of cortisol. The expected diurnal decline in salivary cortisol was observed. Higher trait anxiety was associated with a flatter afternoon decline for all mothers. For primiparae, steeper morning cortisol declines were associated with tower infant birth weight. The findings suggest that regulation of the HPA axis may differ by parity status with downstream implications for fetal growth and development. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To describe the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) among pregnant women and examine factors associated with its access and use.
   Methods Community-based cross-sectional study of 815 pregnant women in eight malarious kebeles in northern Ethiopia based on two-stage cluster design from May to June 2006. Knowledge on malaria, its cause and preventive measures; treatment seeking behaviour; possession and use of ITNs by pregnant women and under-five children were ascertained through interview and observation. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with ITNs use.
   Results Knowledge about the cause, transmission and preventive measures of malaria was relatively good; 90.2% of women associated malaria with mosquito bites and 94.2% with living near water ponds. Ten per cent reported malaria illness within the 14 days before the survey, and sought treatment mainly from public health facilities (56.5%) and community health workers (37.6%). Of 815 households surveyed, 59% owned at least one non-long lasting or long-lasting ITN (59.5% rural vs. 54.5% urban; P = 0.401). Lack of access to ITNs (68.3%) and the perception that nets could not prevent malaria (27%) were the main reasons for non-ownership of nets. A total of 58.4% of 481 pregnant women from households owning at least one ITN had slept under it during the previous night. Fewer rural (56.7%) than urban women (76.2%) used ITNs (P = 0.001). In 57.6% of households with at least one ITN, under-five children had used it the night before. Higher educational attainment was an important predictor of ITNs use (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.1, 4.6).
   Conclusions Household ownership of ITNs and their use by pregnant women is promising with the current efforts to scale-up ITNs implementation, but the gap between ownership and use remains high. Consistent and proper use of nets by pregnant women should be ensured through information campaigns. Rapid expansion of access to long lasting ITNs requires that government and NGOs supply them in adequate numbers.

AB Background: To describe malaria knowledge, attitudes toward malaria and bed net use, levels of ownership and use of bed nets, and factors associated with ownership and use among pregnant women attending their first antenatal care (ANC) visit in Kinshasa, DRC.
   Methods: Women attending their first ANC visit at one maternity in Kinshasa were recruited to take part in a study where they were given free insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) and then followed up at delivery and 6 months post delivery to assess ITN use. This study describes the baseline levels of bed net ownership and use, attitudes towards net use and factors associated with net use
   Results: Among 351 women interviewed at baseline, 115 (33%) already owned a bed net and 86 (25%) reported to have slept under the net the previous night. Cost was reported as the reason for not owning a net by 48% of the 236 women who did not own one. In multivariable analyses, women who had secondary school or higher education were 3.4 times more likely to own a net (95% CI 1.6-7.3) and 2.8 times more likely to have used a net (95% CI 1.3-6.0) compared to women with less education
   Conclusion: Distribution of ITNs in antenatal clinics in this setting is needed and feasible. The potential for ITN use by this target population is high.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of dipper status in women with preeclampsia by comparing arterial stiffness index (SI) values, and dipper and nondipper status.
   Methods: A total of 60 pregnant women in their third trimester were enrolled in the study. SI values were measured using a digital photoplethysmographic method (Pulse Trace System, Micro Medical Ltd., Gillingham, Kent, UK). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured by a SpaceLabs 90217 oscillometric device (SpaceLabs Inc., Redmond, WA, USA). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) were recorded. Those preeclamptic women whose mean nighttime blood pressure measurements were at least 10% lower compared with mean daytime measurements were classified as dipper status, and those with a decrease of less than 10% were classified as nondipper status.
   Results: Seventeen women were preeclamptic with a dipper status, 13 women had nondipper status preeclampsia, and 30 women were normotensive. SI values were significantly higher in preeclamptic women compared with normotensive women (8.8 +/- 1.2 m/s vs. 5.9 +/- 0.8 m/s, P < 0.001), but SI values of preeclamptic women with dipper status and preeclamptic women with nondipper status did not differ significantly from each other (P=0.485).
   Conclusion: There was no significant difference in SI values between the dipper and nondipper preeclamptic groups. These results indicate that dipper and nondipper measurements may not be suitable for clinical follow-up of preeclamptic women.

AB Background: Prevalence of asthma in developed countries increased between the 1970s and the 1990s. One factor that might contribute to the trends in asthma is the increased use of acetaminophen vs aspirin in children and pregnant women.
   Objective: To examine relationships between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and incidence of respirator), symptoms in the first year of life.
   Methods: A total of 345 women were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy and followed LIP with their children through the first year of life. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy was determined by questionnaire and related to incidence of respiratory symptoms.
   Results: Use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy was significantly related to wheezing (odd ratio, 1.8: 95% confidence interval. 1.1-3.0) and to wheezing that disturbed sleep (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.8) in the first year of life after control for potential confounders.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy may be related to respiratory symptoms in the first year of life. Additional follow-up will examine relationships of maternal and earl), childhood use of acetaminophen with incidence of asthma at ages 3 to 5 years, when asthma diagnosis is more firmly established.

   SIDS
AB PURPOSE: Black infants die from sudden infant death syndrome at twice the incidence observed among non-Hispanic white infants. Explanations for this disparity include a two-fold greater prevalence of prone (i.e., stomach) infant sleep placement among black caregivers. I test the hypothesis that the contraction of state economies may contribute to this disparity by increasing the risk of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers. METHODS: I retrieved data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment series and 33,518 black mothers in 26 states participating in the 1996-2002 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. I use weighted multivariable analyses to control for individual characteristics and state and time trends. RESULTS: Black mothers exhibit an elevated risk of reporting prone placement one month following statewide declines in employment (adjusted odds ratio for a one percent decline = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22). This risk remains elevated after control for individual variables. In contrast, I find no association between the economy and prone placement among white mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Statewide economic decline may reduce adherence to the recommended non-prone infant sleep position among black, but not white, mothers. Additional research among black caregivers should determine which mechanisms connect economic downturns to prone infant sleep placement.

AB Background: Infants exposed prenatally to alcohol are at increased risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
   Aim: To examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous motor movements in early infancy.
   Study design: Low-income women (N = 13) were interviewed regarding pre- and pregnancy rates of alcohol, cigarette smoking and other substance use in the perinatal period. Infants were examined in a laboratory nap study using EEG, videography and actigraphy at 6-8 weeks of age. Estimates of maternal pre- and pregnancy alcohol use were used to divide infants into high vs. tow maternal alcohol use groups.
   Subjects: Mother-infant dyads recruited from a family practice clinic.
   Outcome measures' Sleep-related spontaneous movements, behavioral state, and maternal assessments of infant alertness and irritability.
   Results: Pre-pregnancy rates of alcohol consumption including binge drinking correlated with maternal report of poor infant alertness, and increased irritability. High maternal exposure groups showed increased steep fragmentation, e.g. frequency and duration of wakefulness following steep onset and decreased active steep. Bout analysis of the temporal structure of steep-related spontaneous movements showed significantly reduced bout duration associated with high maternal alcohol use.
   Conclusion: These results present evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts postnatal steep organization and suppresses spontaneous movements during steep, and increased steep fragmentation promotes steep deprivation. Results are consistent with the SIDS model of chronic steep debt and suggest that attenuated sleep-related movements should be examined as an important modulator of cardiorespiratory functions during steep in high-risk groups.

   DISORDERS; PATTERNS; HICCUPS; FETUSES
AB Background: Pregnant women's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well known. Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's steep disturbance and fetal well-being have not been done.
   Aims: To solve these methodological issues, we developed a new sensor with electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration of fetal movement.
   Methods and results: Experiment 1: We verified the reliability of our fetal movement recording system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39 weeks of gestation) were asked to lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a button as a subjective marker when they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously recorded maternal polysomnograms and fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens using a Medilog recorder. The mean of prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for agreements, based on time between fetal movement signals recorded and subjective maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75. Experiment II: We recorded seven pregnant women's polysomnograms and fetal movement simultaneously during all-night steep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and 36 of gestation. We succeeded in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement. The mean value of the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly larger than that at 36 weeks.
   Conclusions: There was a high agreement between subjective maternal markers and fetal movement. Our recording system using the new sensor can be used for home monitoring of fetal movement. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine the changes of end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PETCO2) during the menstrual cycle.
   Design: Controlled clinical study.
   Setting: Department of Gynecologic Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.
   Patient(s): One hundred sixty women with a history of regular menstrual cycles were studied.
   Intervention(s): The PETCO2 was determined once daily. Monitoring of the cycles was performed by ultrasonography and determination of E-2, P, and LH in blood or LH in urine samples.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The changes in PETCO2 during the ovulatory and anovulatory cycles were analyzed.
   Result(s): The time course of PETCO2 followed a biphasic pattern with luteal phase values being on average 6.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg lower than during the follicular phase. The decrease of PETCO2 started, coincident with the increase of E-2, 1-8 days (median: 4.5 days) before onset of the LH surge. No such changes in PETCO2 could be observed during the anovulatory cycles. These changes could be mimicked by administration of E-2 or P. The PETCO2 did not exhibit a circadian rhythm and was not influenced by normal physical activity.
   Conclusion(s): The PETCO2 changes in a characteristic way during the menstrual cycle. Determination of PETCO2 appears to be a promising method for the detection of the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle in the context of natural family planning.

AB Oipoid dependent pregnant and postpartum women and their infants are a complex and vulnerable population requiring individualized, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary treatment. Though methadone maintenance in the setting of comprehensive service provision during pregnance significantly improves pregenancy outcomes for opioid dependent women, its use has implications for the infant, most notably the neonatal abstinence syndrome. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is comprised of physiologic signs and behaviors that indicate a dysfunctional regulation of the central and autonomic nervous systems, and is variable in its expression in affected infants. The disorganized rather than adaptive behaviors displayed by each infant undergoing theeffects of in utero opioid exposure may impair basic functions such as feeding, sleeping, and the ability to the alert and communicate clear cues to caregivers. Understanding and responding to neurobehavioral dysfunction of the newborn may help to promote the infant's self-organization and self-regulation abilities. However, the substance abusing mother's physical and psychologic wellbeing may be debilitated in the perinatal period, and her ability to recognize and respond to the newborn's cues may be limited. A multitiered comprehensive assessment and intervention of the methadone-maintained mother, her child, and the mother/infant dyad can improve early maternal nuturing interactions, a crucial component of early infant development, particularly in this vulnerable population. The purpose of this article is to review the contribution of maternal opioid dependency to the difficulties experienced by the mother-infant dyad and their treatment providers in the postnatal period, and the nonpharmacologic treatment of the infants with suggestions for practical measures with emphasis on the treatment of the mother and baby as an international dyad.

AB A woman's sleep is impacted by biology (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause), sleep disorders (that may manifest differently than in men), and role in the home and workplace. A Women and Sleep Workshop, sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation, in March 2007 reviewed these topics. It was concluded that understanding the relationship between sleep and gender will result in a scientifically based approach to women's sleep problems.

AB Sleep disorders affect women differently than they affect men and may have different manifestations and prevalences. With regard to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), variations in symptoms may cause misdiagnoses and delay of appropriate treatment. The prevalence of OSA appears to increase markedly after the time of menopause. Although OSA as defined by the numbers of apneas/hypopneas may be less severe in women, its consequences are similar and perhaps worse. Therapeutic issues related to gender should be factored into the management of OSA. The prevalence of insomnia is significantly greater in women than in men throughout most of the life span. The ratio of insomnia in women to men is approximately 1.4:1.0, but the difference is minimal before puberty and increases steadily with age. Although much of the higher prevalence of insomnia in women may be attributable to the hormonal or psychological changes associated with major life transitions, some of the gender differences may result from the higher prevalence of depression and pain in women. Insomnia's negative impact on quality of life is important to address in women, given the high relative prevalence of insomnia as well as the comorbid disorders in this population. Gender differences in etiology and symptom manifestation in narcolepsy remain understudied in humans. There is little available scientific information to evaluate the clinical significance and specific consequences of the diagnosis of narcolepsy in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs or other limbs during periods of rest or inactivity and may affect as much as 10% of the population. This condition is more likely to afflict women than men, and its risk is increased by pregnancy. Although RLS is associated with impaired quality of life, highly effective treatment is available.

AB OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to determine the interrater variability and effect of state on systolic blood pressure measurements in infants <= 3 years of age.
   METHODS. Study 1 examined interrater variability, determined by interclass correlation coefficient for 2 raters, and the effect of state on systolic blood pressure measurements in infants at 1, 2, and 3 years. Study 2 examined the variability of duplicate systolic blood pressure measurements by a single rater determined by interclass correlation coefficient and effect of state in 120 infants at 1, 2, and 3 years. Systolic blood pressure was defined as the Doppler-amplified sound corresponding to the first Korotkoff sound using a sphygmomanometer with appropriate cuff size. State was scored as follows: 1, sleeping; 2, awake and calm; 3, awake and fussy/restless; and 4, awake and vigorously crying/screaming.
   RESULTS. In study 1, the overall interclass correlation coefficient for systolic blood pressure was 0.81 and decreased when state varied between raters. When compared with a calm state 1 and/or 2 at both measurements, noncalm state 3 and/or 4 at both measurements was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure. Although state was similar in infants born at <= 36 and >36 weeks' gestational age, the former had a systolic blood pressure 13.0 +/- 14mm Hg greater than the 50th centile for age and gender versus 2.4 +/- 12 mm Hg for those >36 weeks' gestation. In study 2, the interclass correlation coefficient for repeated measurements by a single rater was 0.85, and noncalm state at both measurements was associated with an elevated systolic blood pressure.
   CONCLUSIONS. Systolic blood pressure can be accurately measured in the first 3 years after birth, but state modifies systolic blood pressure and must be determined at the time of measurement. Infants born at >36 weeks' estimated gestational age may be at risk for an elevated systolic blood pressure, but this requires additional study.
