N2  - The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of US women aged 20 to 39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater. Across the life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI, addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve care.

N2  - This article provides an overview of restless legs syndrome (RLS) or Willis-Ekbom disease (WKD). The cause of RLS/WED is unknown. RLS/WED may be either primary or secondary. In primary RLS/WED, symptoms are not associated with other medical conditions. Genetic factors are likely since family history is seen in half of patients. In secondary RLS/WED, the condition is related to other diseases. It may be associated with kidney failure, pregnancy, or peripheral neuropathy. RLS/WED has also been linked to low brain and body iron levels. RLS/WED symptoms include an uncomfortable urge to move the legs in the evening or when at rest during the daytime. Studies have shown that regular moderate exercise may reduce RLS/WED symptoms. Taking warm (or cool) baths or showers, massage, moderate regular exercise, reduced caffeine, and mentally engaging activities can help relieve mild or intermittent RLS/ WED symptoms. However, when symptoms are more severe and regularly disturb sleep or daytime activities, particularly more than 2–3 days per week, RLS/WED treatment may be prescribed. “Augmentation” is an overall worsening of RLS/ WED, with symptoms becoming more intense, occurring earlier in the day, and spreading up to the arms and upper body.

N2  - Objective: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies. Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3 ± 6.9 weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0–82.9%). Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position. Practice implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: The majority of women develop sleep impairments during pregnancy, but alterations in dream experiences remain poorly understood. This study aimed to assess prospectively and comparatively the recall of dreaming and of disturbed dreaming in late pregnancy. Methods: Fifty-seven nulliparous, third-trimester pregnant women (mean age ± SD, 28.7 ± 4.06 years) and 59 non-pregnant controls (mean age ± SD, 26.8 ± 4.21 years) completed demographics and psychological questionnaires. A 14-day prospective home log assessed sleep and dream characteristics and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire measured retrospective dream and disturbed dream recall. Results: Even though pregnant and non-pregnant women showed similar prospective dream recall (P = 0.47), pregnant women reported prospectively more bad dreams (P = 0.004). More pregnant women (21%) than non-pregnant women (7%) reported a nightmare incidence exceeding moderately severe pathology (> 1/week) (P = 0.03). Pregnant women also reported overall lower sleep quality (P = 0.007) and more night awakenings (P = 0.003). Higher prospective recall of bad dreams (r = −0.40, P = 0.002) and nightmares (r = −0.32, P = 0.001) both correlated with lower sleep quality in pregnant women. Conclusions: Late pregnancy is a period of markedly increased dysphoric dream imagery that may be a major contributor to impaired sleep at this time. Further polysomnographic assessments of pregnant women are needed to clarify relationships between sleep and disturbed dream production in this population.

N2  - Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease in developed countries. Despite the known risk, currently 19% of the adult population in the United States smoke cigarettes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). Early exposure to nicotine during development is associated with an increased risk of nicotine addiction in adults. Early exposure includes both initiation of smoking during adolescence and prenatal nicotine exposure. Adolescence is the most common period for the initiation of recreational drug use, and 88% of current adult smokers used their first cigarette before the age of 18 (Public Health Service 1994). Evidence also indicates differences between males and females in addiction rates and smoking behavior. Tobacco is also the most commonly abused substance during pregnancy: tobacco use occurs in an estimated 14% of pregnancies in the United States. Infants exposed to tobacco smoke in utero are more likely to be addicted to nicotine. In addition, females exposed to tobacco smoke through the mother appear to progress from initiation of tobacco smoking to addiction more quickly than non-exposed females. All of the pharmacological effects of nicotine are mediated by neuronal nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (nAChRs), which are widespread throughout the autonomic and central nervous system. In the CNS, nAChRs are primarily presynaptic, and are involved in modulating the release of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine . The involvement of these receptors in the release of neurotransmitters suggests that nicotine use may have widespread effects on important neural pathways in the CNS. In order to help elucidate the underlying causes of sex differences in response to nicotine, we investigated nicotinic receptor regulation and genome expression differences in male and female rats following adolescent and prenatal nicotine exposure. To do this we exposed rats to nicotine under various treatment paradigms using subcutaneously implanted miniosmotic pumps containing either nicotine or saline. Using [3H]epibatidine to label assembled receptors and subunit specific antibodies to characterize receptors, we found sex differences in α4β2* receptor regulation in the cerebral cortex at both early (PN28) and late (PN42) adolescence. These results imply sex differences in sensitivity to nicotine exposure in early and late adolescence. In addition, we found sex differences in α4β2α5 receptor regulation in the cerebral cortex following chronic prenatal nicotine exposure in rats at PN14. After using a fostering paradigm to isolate nicotine exposure to either  in utero only or postnatal only exposure, we determined the sensitivity seen at PN14 in males required a combination of both in utero and postnatal exposure to manifest. Finally, in order to help clarify the underlying basis of behavioral differences in adolescents exposed to nicotine prenatally, we identified persistent alterations in genome expression in dopaminergic cell bodies using microarray analysis of the VTA of adolescent male and female rats following chronic prenatal nicotine exposure. With this method we identified dramatic differences in gene expression between males and females. These changes suggest that disruptions in circadian rhythm regulation may contribute to an increased risk of nicotine addiction in adolescent male rats, but not female rats, exposed to nicotine prenatally. Alterations in these associated genes were confirmed using qRT-PCR. These data suggest both differences in receptor regulation and genomic expression between males and females at ages of increased vulnerability to nicotine.

N2  - Purposes: To analyze which Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Postpartum Depression Screening Scores (PDSS) total and dimensional scores, as well as symptomatic answers proportions significantly differ between women in the perinatal period (pregnant/postpartum) without major depression, with major depression and women outside the perinatal period. Methods: 572 pregnant women in the third trimester completed Beck Depression Inventory-II and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale and were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. 417 of these were also assessed (with the same instruments) at three months postpartum. Ninety non-pregnant women or that did not have a child in the last year (mean age = 29.42 ± 7.159 years) also filled in the questionnaires. Results: Non-depressed pregnant women showed lower scores than depressed pregnant women and higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the BDI-II total score and in its Somatic-Anxiety dimension. Non-depressed postpartum women showed significantly higher scores than women outside the perinatal period only at Sleep/Eating Disturbances. Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without depression presented higher scores only in the somatic items. Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes. Limitations: Women outside the perinatal period were not diagnosed for the presence of a depressive disorder, but their BDI-II mean score was similar to the figures reported worldwide regarding women in childbearing age. Conclusion: In the perinatal period, most particularly at pregnancy, women experience significant somatic changes even if not clinically depressed. Cognitive-affective symptoms are more useful when assessing the presence of perinatal depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: The aim of this study was to measure the brain activity of preterm infants treated with caffeine citrate and doxapram for preterm apnoea, using amplitude‐integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), to identify any adverse effects on cerebral function. Methods: We analysed the aEEG tracings of 13 preterm infants < 30 weeks of gestation before, during and after doxapram treatment, with regard to background activity (percentages of continuous and discontinuous patterns), occurrence of sleep‐wake cycling and appearance of electrographic seizure activity. They were also compared with 61 controls without doxapram treatment. Results: During doxapram treatment, aEEG tracings showed an increase in continuous background activity (19 ± 30% before treatment, 38 ± 35% during treatment) and a decrease in discontinuous patterns. In addition, they showed more frequent electrographic seizure activity (0% before treatment, 15 ± 37% during treatment) and less frequent sleep‐wake cycling (92 ± 27% before treatment, 85 ± 37% during treatment) could be observed. These results were confirmed when compared to the control group. Conclusion: Doxapram treatment influences aEEG in preterm infants, showing higher percentages of continuous activity as well as more electrographic seizure activity and less sleep‐wake cycling. It should, therefore, be used with caution in very preterm infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Case: Thomas is a 5-year 6-month-old boy whose parents requested an urgent care appointment because he has recently been suspended from kindergarten stating “and his doctor must see him before he can come back.” His suspension from kindergarten was due to kicking and biting his classmates, but he has also become increasingly aggressive at home. His teacher reported that he has always had a high activity level and difficulty shifting attention between tasks, as well as noncompliance with rules and directions. He is noted to have learning challenges and is showing difficulties in the concept of numbers and letter sounds. The practice has followed Thomas since his healthy birth. He has a history of delayed language development, and he received early intervention services from 2 years of age. He spoke his first word at 2 years 6 months. He started a half-day preschool program at 3 years of age. He had difficulty acclimating to preschool, interacting with peers, and was described as “hyperactive” by his teachers. His program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom. His parents have always described him as a “difficult child.” He gets frustrated easily and can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs or requests are not met. He has difficulty falling asleep, has frequent night awakenings, and often has trouble getting back to sleep. His self-help skills are poor, and he has difficulty with activities such as brushing his teeth and dressing. His parents report that he does not seem to remember rules from day to day. He was evaluated at 5 years of age and diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but his response to stimulants has been limited. Thomas is an only child. His parents are college educated and professionally employed. They deny drug use, domestic violence, and guns in the home. They reported that prior to the pregnancy, they enjoyed “partying” with friends on the weekends, but Thomas’s mother reported that she stopped drinking as soon as she realized she was pregnant. All are wondering whether this child might have a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, although he seems to have no clear facial dysmorphology. It is unsure what the next step might be and if there is value added in pursuing this diagnosis. What do you do next? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Pregnancy is anecdotally equated with sleep disturbance, most commonly resulting in sleep deprivation, with the possible exception of the first trimester when hypersomnia is frequently reported. The relationship between gestational stage and maternal sleep is likely bidirectional. For example, the dynamic hormonal and physiological changes of pregnancy are known to impact a large variety of sleep parameters, including homeostatic sleep drive, sleep latency, sleep maintenance, duration of sleep, sleep fragmentation, perceived sleep quality, and objectively measured sleep stage cycling. Conversely, sleep disturbance of any kind, including decreased total sleep amount or increased fragmentation, with or without respiratory disturbance, negatively impacts pregnancy outcomes, including gestational hypertensive disease, labor type and duration, prematurity, and birth weight. Thus, while the relationship is undoubtedly complicated, pregnancy provides a natural "experiment" informing the role of reproductive hormones on sleep characteristics, while the interplay of sleep disturbance and pregnancy outcomes alerts to the physiological significance of sleep and its electrophysiological and subjective characteristics. In this chapter, we will review the various aspects of sleep disturbance that may lead to sleep deprivation during pregnancy and the existing evidence that sleep deprivation and disturbance affect pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Objective: Evidence for the adverse effects of prepregnancy obesity on offspring’s neurodevelopmental outcomes has begun to emerge. The authors examined the association between prepregnancy obesity and children’s behavioral problems and if the association would differ by race. Methods: This observational study used a total of 3395 white (n = 2127) and African-American (n = 1268) children aged 96 to 119 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Behavior Problem Index (BPI) total and subscale scores were used to measure children’s behavioral problems. The association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and the BPI scores for each racial group was examined using multivariate linear and logistic regressions, controlling for prenatal, child, maternal, and family background factors. Results: Maternal prepregnancy obesity was independently associated with an increase in the BPI total scores among the white sample only. Among the African-Americans, prepregnancy obesity was not associated with the BPI scores. Subsample analyses using externalizing and internalizing subscales also revealed similar trends. Among the white sample, children born to obese women were more socially disadvantaged than those born to nonobese women, whereas no such trend was observed in children of African-American obese and nonobese women. Conclusion: The impact of maternal prepregnancy obesity on children’s behavioral problems differed by racial groups. Obesity-related metabolic dysregulations during the intrauterine period may not contribute to later children’s behavioral problems. Social and psychological factors seem to play key roles in the association between prepregnancy obesity and childhood behavioral problems among whites.

N2  - Objective: The authors reviewed the published literature on the acute and long-term neurobehavioral effects on infants and children of either in utero exposure to maternal depression or in utero exposure to antidepressants. Data Sources: The PubMed electronic database was searched to locate 292 English-language studies from the first available year to October 2013 using the keywords pregnancy, antidepressants, depression, perinatal, and neurobehavioral. Study Selection: The authors reviewed only prospective studies that assessed the impact of maternal depression during pregnancy or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on (1) clearly defined short-term behavioral outcomes in infants (perinatal outcome) or (2) longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children (neurodevelopmental outcome). Data Extraction: Studies were included if they were prospective and assessed the impact of maternal depression or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on clearly measurable, objective short-term and longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children. Results: Untreated depression during pregnancy is associated with short-term neonatal effects, including increased distress after delivery, less than optimal orientation and motor activity, and disrupted sleep. Longer-term effects on neurobehavioral outcome have also been reported, including disruptive social behavior, depression, and changes in the period of sensitivity for language discrimination. Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse short-term perinatal symptomatology, including effects on autonomic and motor activity, habituation, and sleep. Longer-term studies of neurobehavioral outcomes of in utero antidepressant exposure suggest potential effects on gross motor function and language development but not cognition. Conclusions: In utero exposure to either maternal depression or antidepressants carries risks to the developing fetus. Treatment decisions regarding whether and how to treat depression during pregnancy must be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the impact of these decisions on both mother and infant.

N2  - Objective: To assess how change in sleep duration is related to subsequent obesity. Methods: In this 10-year follow-up, 4903 non-pregnant participants answered a questionnaire on sleeping habits, obesity, and lifestyle factors (questions identical to baseline questionnaire). Habitual normal sleepers were defined as sleeping 6–9 h/night at both baseline and follow-up, whereas women sleeping PP = 0.01) and central obesity (short: 60.5%, P = 0.01; long: 82.4%, P = 0.01) compared with habitual normal sleepers (general obesity: 8.9%; central obesity: 35.9%) at follow-up. Younger women who were short sleepers at baseline but normal sleepers at the follow-up had a higher prevalence of both general (19.3%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (45.4%, P = 0.07) compared with habitual normal sleepers at follow-up. In adjusted analyses, both habitual short [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 6.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.71–17.0] and long (aOR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.09–19.8) sleep durations were risk factors for general obesity in younger women. In younger women habitual long sleep duration was a risk factor also for central obesity (aOR, 6.05; 95% CI, 1.19–30.7) whereas habitual short sleep duration was not (aOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.87–4.81). Similar results were seen also for weight gain and increased waist circumference as dependent variables. In addition, decreased sleep duration from normal to short duration was a risk factor for both weight gain (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14–3.02) and increased waist circumference (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.20–2.81). There were no associations between changes in sleep duration and any of the measures of obesity at the follow-up in women aged > 40 years at baseline. Conclusion: In younger women, both habitual short and long sleep duration was a risk factor for obesity, whereas no such relationship was seen in older women.

N2  - Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions; one way to address this problem before obesogenic behaviors and obese phenotypes emerge is to intervene in infancy. The goal of this dissertation was to examine infant behavioral states associated with subsequent obesity risk. Multiple methods were used to study these behaviors in three empirical studies, all in the context of a pilot childhood obesity intervention, with a final sample of 110 well-educated, predominantly White, primiparous mother-infant dyads intending to breastfeed at infant birth. The goal of the first empirical study (Chapter 2) was to describe changes over time in and relationships among infant behavioral states and to test a model where effects of a "Soothe/Sleep" intervention on weight are explained by increases in total daily sleep duration and decreases in feeding time. Overall, total sleep, nighttime awake/calm time, total and nighttime fussing/crying, and total and nighttime feeding time decreased, and nighttime sleep and total awake/calm time increased over the first four months of infancy. Cross-sectional analysis of relationships between behavioral states at each time point revealed that sleeping and feeding were negatively related at 3 weeks, and these inverse relations strengthened over time for the nighttime period but not over 24-hour periods. The hypothesis that increases in total daily sleep and decreases in feeding time contributed to Soothe/Sleep intervention effects on weight status was supported in breastfeeding dyads but not in formula-feeding dyads. The second study (Chapter 3) examined infants' behavioral transitions using Markov models, demonstrating fewer transitions out of sleep at 16 weeks compared to 3 weeks, as well as substantial individual differences in the likelihood of transitioning out of a fussing/crying state at both time points. Transitions out of fussing/crying were malleable and predictive of weight outcomes: the likelihood of transitioning from fussing/crying to feeding was positively associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and with subsequent infant weight status. Additionally, the pilot intervention focused on infant soothing and sleeping increased the likelihood of transitioning from fussing/crying to awake/calm at 16 weeks. There was evidence that transitions out of fussing had different implications depending on the average duration of a fussing episode preceding a transition to feeding. In the third study (Chapter 5), infant temperament was explored as an outcome, a predictor, and a moderator, and results highlighted the importance of a comprehensive investigation of the role of temperament in behavioral intervention studies. The Soothe/Sleep intervention increased mothers' reports of infant negativity; infants in the intervention group also had higher observed infant self-regulation at 1 year. Infants with greater observed negativity at 1 year whose mothers were low on initial parenting self-efficacy demonstrated the greatest weight gain from 1 to 3 years, suggesting that promoting early maternal self-efficacy could be protective against increased obesity risk in highly negative infants. Infant regulation was inversely associated with weight status but was not related to weight gain over time. Initial infant negativity moderated the effects of the Soothe/Sleep intervention on some, but not all, outcomes. Negative infants who participated in the Soothe/Sleep intervention showed the least weight gain from birth to age 3, and their mothers showed improved parenting satisfaction. These studies confirm that early infancy is a promising time to intervene on a behavioral level to promote healthy behaviors and decreased obesity risk, and results elucidated some of the mechanisms through which a pilot intervention focused on infant soothing and sleeping had its effects, including increased sleep duration, decreased feeding time, and increased transitions from a fuss… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The notion that ‘older’ mothers experience elevated risks during pregnancy and childbirth has proliferated since the mid-twentieth century. In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother’s health, and her newborn’s health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age.

N2  - The effects of rapid eye movement sleep restriction (REMSR) in rats during late pregnancy were studied on the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) made by the pups. USVs are distress calls inaudible to human ears. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was restricted in one group of pregnant rats for 22 hours, starting from gestational day 14 to 20, using standard single platform method. The USVs of male pups were recorded after a brief isolation from their mother for two minutes on alternate post-natal days, from day one till weaning. The USVs were recorded using microphones and were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using SASPro software. Control pups produced maximum vocalization on post-natal days 9 to 11. In comparison, the pups born to REMSR mothers showed not only a reduction in vocalization but also a delay in peak call making days. The experimental group showed variations in the types and characteristics of call types, and alteration in temporal profile. The blunting of distress call making response in these pups indicates that maternal sleep plays a role in regulating the neural development involved in vocalizations and possibly in shaping the emotional behaviour in neonates. It is suggested that the reduced ultrasonic vocalizations can be utilized as a reliable early marker for affective state in rat pups. Such impaired vocalization responses could provide an important lead in understanding mother-child bonding for an optimal cognitive development during post-partum life. This is the first report showing a potential link between maternal REM sleep deprivation and the vocalization in neonates and infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap frequency on maternal glycemic control. Methods: Sixty-three urban, low-income, pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values ⩾130mg/dL. Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9 ± 0.9h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r = −0.28, P = .03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.1–0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia. Conclusions: Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women’s fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum. Results: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ≥ .97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient > .87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88–94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity. Conclusions: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions.

N2  - Objective: This study examined prospectively whether maternal orientation (Facilitator/Regulator) in pregnancy predicted maternal orientation and mothering practices at six months postpartum. Background: A woman’s preferred approach to infant care, present prior to the birth, has been proposed to explain individual differences in mothering behaviour. Method: At 30 weeks gestation, 192 women completed two questionnaire measures assessing maternal orientation. At six months postpartum, maternal orientation and maternal caretaking behaviours were assessed by interview and questionnaire. Results: Bivariate analyses indicated small but significant correlations among measures of antenatal and postnatal maternal orientation. In addition, as predicted, lower Regulator scores in pregnancy were associated with greater likelihood of breastfeeding exclusively, less scheduling of infant feeds and sleeps, and less likelihood of leaving baby to cry to sleep. Associations were found between mother–infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation. Conclusions: Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories.

N2  - Women with gestational diabetes (GD) are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (DM) after delivery compared to those without GD. Numerous studies in the general population have identified that adoption of healthy lifestyles can prevent DM; however limited research has focused on women with GD. The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention of SUGAR (S&barbelow;tart U&barbelow;nderstanding G&barbelow;estational Diabetes a&barbelow;nd R&barbelow;isk of Type 2 Diabetes), on women's perceived risk of developing DM, knowledge of DM, self-efficacy to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors after childbirth among women with GD. A total of 23 women (mean age of 29.7±3.9), 18 in SUGAR group and 5 in control group (CG) completed self-reported standardized questionnaires (Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes adapted for women with GD; Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices; Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile II; General Sleep Disturbance Scale; and Demographic Questionnaire) at baseline (third trimester) and post-test (postpartum 6- 8 weeks). Intervention was given post the baseline data collection with a booster session at 2-4 weeks postpartum. The women in CG received attention control treatment. Study participants were obese (BMI M-33.1, SD-7.7) and a majority had a family history of DM. Findings showed that self-efficacy was the single significant predictor and accounted for 22% of the variance of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Participants had a clinical significant sleep disturbance during both pregnancy and postpartum. At baseline, poor sleepers reported a lower self-efficacy. The intervention significantly increased DM knowledge for women in the SUGAR group; however, not for perceived risk, self-efficacy nor healthy lifestyle behaviors. There was no difference between groups for postpartum glucose screening rates with only 39% receiving recommended testing. Future research needs to focus on prevention programs and center on self-efficacy, postpartum glucose screening, improve sleep, and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. To ensure a better preventive care for GD women, education provided for both patients and health care provider is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: In contrast to postpartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder, little is known about the risk of recurrence in men with bipolar disorder who have just become fathers. Case report: We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder who had a manic episode immediately after becoming a father. His spouse had a normal pregnancy, and delivery started during daytime and lasted until the early morning hours. The patient subsequently developed a manic episode, which had a major impact on the family. Conclusions: There is a well‐known relationship between sleep loss and the occurrence of a manic episode. The study of psychopathology in the postpartum period in relation to sleep disturbance refers mainly to women. Disturbance of sleep patterns in the perinatal and postpartum period may also negatively impact the course of bipolar disorder in the father. In cases of pregnancy of a male bipolar disorder patient's spouse, preventive strategies for the postpartum period should be planned in advance.

N2  - Background: Insomnia and depression are strongly interrelated. This study aimed to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17 and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from 2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Results: After delivery, sleep duration was reduced by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to 75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression, primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression had residual insomnia. Limitations: Depression and insomnia were not verified by clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in the study. Conclusions: Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To identify quantitative MEG indices of spontaneous brain activity for fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies and examine the effect of fetal state on these indices. Methods: Spontaneous MEG brain activity was examined in 22 low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from 30 to 37 weeks. As major quantitative characteristics of spontaneous activity, burst duration (BD) and interburst interval (IBI) were studied in correlation with GA and fetal state. Results: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (−0.21 s/week, P = 0.0031). This trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep state. With respect to BD, no significant trends were detected with GA and state. Conclusion: IBI can be quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter. The decrease in IBI over gestation was similar to the trend reported in the preterm neonatal EEG studies. Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such MEG maturational indices. Significance: With further investigation, indices extracted from spontaneous fetal brain activity may serve as an early warning for fetal neurological distress.

N2  - The impact of pregnancy and lactation on ultradian rhythms (URs) and circadian rhythms (CRs) of locomotor activity was assessed in circadian rhythmic and arrhythmic Siberian hamsters maintained in a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/day). Progressive decrements in CR robustness and amplitude over the course of gestation were accompanied by enhanced URs. Dark-phase UR period and amplitude increased during early gestation and complexity and robustness increased during late gestation. The persistence of pregnancy-associated enhancements of URs in circadian arrhythmic (ARR) hamsters suggests that reproductive modulation of the UR waveform is not dependent on coherent circadian organization. The increased incidence of dark-phase URs appeared more rapidly in ARR dams than entrained (ENTR) dams. Throughout gestation, the percentage of dams with dark-phase URs was significantly greater in the ARR group. Gestational increases in UR complexity and robustness emerged earlier and were greater in ARR than ENTR dams. The attenuation of CRs during lactation is correlated with increased expression of URs. Relaxation of circadian control of the dam's behavior may increase fitness by permitting more efficient interactions with circadian arrhythmic pups.

N2  - Objective: Although many studies have shown the evolution of sleep parameters across the lifespan, not many have included a representative sample of the general population. The objective of this study was to describe age-related changes in sleep structure, sleep respiratory parameters and periodic limb movements of the adult population of São Paulo. Methods: We selected a representative sample of the city of São Paulo, Brazil that included both genders and an age range of 20–80years. Pregnant and lactating women, people with physical or mental impairments that prevent self-care and people who work every night were not included. This sample included 1024 individuals who were submitted to polysomnography and structured interviews. We subdivided our sample into five-year age groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare age groups. Pearson product–moment was used to evaluate correlation between age and sleep parameters. Results: Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep showed a significant age-related decrease (P P < 0.05). Furthermore, apnea–hypopnea index increased and oxygen saturation decreased with age. The reduction in the percentage of REM sleep significantly correlated with age in women, whereas the reduction in the percentage of slow wave sleep correlated with age in men. The periodic limb movement (PLM) index increased with age in men and women. Conclusions: Sleep structure and duration underwent significant alterations throughout the aging process in the general population. There was an important correlation between age, sleep respiratory parameters and PLM index. In addition, men and women showed similar trends but with different effect sizes.

N2  - Reply by the current author to the comments made by Rick Doblin (see record 2014-08230-002) on the original article (see record 2013-26822-003). Human Psychopharmacology recently published my review into the increase in empirical knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA over the past 25 years (Parrott, 2013a). Deficits have been demonstrated in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, complex visual processing, sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, pain, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status. Neuroimaging studies have shown serotonergic deficits, which are associated with lifetime Ecstasy/MDMA usage, and degree of neurocognitive impairment. Basic psychological skills remain intact. Ecstasy/MDMA use by pregnant mothers leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Hence, the damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA were far more widespread than was realized a few years ago. In their critique of my review, Doblin et al. (2014) argued that my review contained misstatements, omitted contrary findings, and recited dated misconceptions. In this reply, I have answered all the points they raised. I have been able to refute each of their criticisms by citing the relevant empirical data, since many of their points were based on inaccurate summaries of the actual research findings. Doblin and colleagues are proponents of the use of MDMA for drug‐assisted psychotherapy, and their strongest criticisms were focused on my concerns about this proposal. However, again all the issues I raised were based on sound empirical evidence or theoretical understanding. Indeed I would recommend potentially far safer co‐drugs such as D‐cycloserine or oxytocin. In summary, MDMA can induce a wide range of neuropsychobiological changes, many of which are damaging to humans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women. Design: Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants: One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10–20 weeks gestation. Methods: Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10–12, 14–16, and 18–20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. Results: On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality (M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income p p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment. Conclusions: Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.

N2  - Reports an error in "Narcolepsy and pregnancy: A retrospective European evaluation of 249 pregnancies" by Eszter Maurovich‐Horvat, David Kemlink, Birgit Högl, Birgit Frauscher, Laura Ehrmann, Peter Geisler, Katharina Ettenhuber, Geert Mayer, Rosa Peraita‐Adrados, Elena Calvo, Gert Jan Lammers, Astrid van der Heide, Luigi Ferini‐Strambi, Giuseppe Plazzi, Francesca Poli, Yves Dauvilliers, Poul Jennum, Helle Leonthin, Johannes Mathis, Aleksandra Wierzbicka, Francisco J. Puertas, Pierre A. Beitinger, Isabelle Arnulf, Renata L. Riha, Maria Tormášiová, Jana Slonková, Sona Nevšímalová and Karel Šonka (Journal of Sleep Research, 2013[Oct], Vol 22[5], 496-512). In the original article, there were two errors in the affiliations. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-33304-004). In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self‐administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P (P P P < 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy���cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy–cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study examined the association between measures of objective sleep (OS) and subjective sleep (SS) to postpartum mood in healthy women from the third trimester of pregnancy to 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Twenty-nine pregnant women completed self-report measures of mood and SS, and wore actigraphs for 7 continuous days during the third trimester (Time 1), within 15 days (Time 2), and 10 to 12 weeks postpartum (Time 3). The subjective perception of marked daytime dysfunction was associated with low mood during Time 1 and Time 3. Poor nighttime SS was related to low mood only at Time 2, whereas poor nighttime OS influenced stress during the same assessment time. These data indicate a stronger association between postpartum mood and the subjective perception of sleep than with OS quality and duration in healthy, non-depressed women, and highlight the awareness of poor daytime functioning as a significant contributor to new mothers’ emotional wellbeing.

N2  - Objective: To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects: A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11–16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. Main outcome measures: Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine. Results: Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity. Conclusions: Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.

N2  - Background: Though migraine and tension type headache are both commonly diagnosed in childhood, little is known about their determinants when diagnosed prior to puberty onset. Our aim was to determine psychosocial- and health-related risk factors of migraine and tension-type headache in 11 year old children. Methods: 871 New Zealand European children were enrolled in a longitudinal study at birth and data were collected at birth, 1, 3.5, 7, and 11 years of age. Primary headache was determined at age 11 years based on the International Headache Society. Perinatal factors assessed were small for gestational age status, sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal perceived stress, and maternal school leaving age. Childhood factors assessed were sleep duration, percent body fat, television watching, parent and self-reported total problem behaviour, being bullied, and depression. Results: Prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was 10.5% and 18.6%, respectively. Both migraine and TTH were significantly associated with self-reported problem behaviour in univariable logistic regression analyses. Additionally, migraine was associated with reduced sleep duration, and both sleep and behaviour problems remained significant after multivariable analyses. TTH was also significantly associated with antenatal maternal smoking, higher body fat, and being bullied. For TTH, problem behaviour measured at ages 3.5 and 11 years both remained significant after multivariable analysis. Being born small for gestational age was not associated with either headache group. Conclusions: Although they share some commonality, migraine and tension-type headache are separate entities in childhood with different developmental characteristics. The association between primary headache and problem behaviour requires further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background and objective: Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are common in primary care and may cause severe pain and sleep disturbance. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of magnesium in treating NLC and the side-effect profile of magnesium compared to placebo. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registries until August 2012. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing magnesium therapy for NLC in adults with any other comparator were eligible. Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies. To compensate for the heterogeneity in outcome measures, simulations were used to summarize the data. Results: Seven RCTs were included in the review (n = 361), all comparing magnesium to placebo. Three of these trials included only pregnant women. The difference in the median number of leg cramps per week between the placebo and the intervention groups was 0.345 (quantile 2.5%: −0.133, quantile 97.5%: 0.875). This difference was 0.807 (quantile 2.5%: 0.015, quantile 97.5%: 1.207) in the three studies involving only pregnant women and 0.362 (quantile 2.5%: −0.386, quantile 97.5%: 1.148) in the others. Overall gastrointestinal side effects were slightly more common with magnesium therapy than with placebo. The strength of this evidence was weak, mainly due to small study sizes and short follow-up. Conclusions: Magnesium therapy does not appear to be effective in the treatment of NLC in the general population, but may have a small effect in pregnant women. Further research using better designed RCTs is necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Alteration in the HPA axis is a robust biomarker of anxiety and depression in adults, but questions remain about this association in pregnancy. We examined the longitudinal links between diurnal cortisol and mood symptoms from self-report questionnaire and diagnostic interview in an ethnically diverse, psychosocially at-risk sample of 101 women at mid-pregnancy and early third trimester. There were modest but significant associations between depression and elevated cortisol, indexed by a decreased morning level and diminished diurnal decline; the effects were strongest for diagnostic data from clinical interview. These effects were independent of socio-demographic factors and sleep disturbance. Associations with anxiety and trauma were generally non-significant. These findings extend prior work by showing that significant mood symptoms in pregnancy are associated with altered diurnal cortisol in pregnancy, which may have implications for maternal and child health.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and its associated factors among pregnant women in Japan. Of the 940 randomly selected survey locations identified by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 344 obstetric institutions participated in the survey. The study was conducted on women with confirmed pregnancies who had had a second or subsequent consultation at one of these institutions. The survey items included age, highest educational achievement, trimester of pregnancy, number of pregnancies, employment status, smoking, alcohol consumption, restless sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, sleep duration, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and restless leg syndrome. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to assess the level of excessive daytime sleepiness. We calculated the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and then examined its associated factors using χ2 test and multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness among pregnant women was 6.2%. The results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly higher among younger women and those in an earlier trimester of pregnancy. The odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was also significantly higher for women in their first pregnancy, full‐time workers, and current alcohol consumers. Women indicating the presence of sleep‐related issues, including restless sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome, reported significantly higher levels of excessive daytime sleepiness.

N2  - Aim: To explore the role of maternal personality (hardiness), sleep‐related cognitions and bedtime involvement in child sleep behaviour during the second post‐natal year in a sample of spontaneous and assisted conception first‐time mothers. Method: Mothers (n = 134 (spontaneous (n = 81); assisted (n = 53) conception)) reported on a resilience measure (hardiness) during pregnancy and child sleep at 7 and 19 months post‐partum. At 19 months post‐partum, mothers also reported on their cognitions and involvement around their child's bedtime, and half the sample used Actigraph monitors (Acitiwatch‐16, Mini Mitter Co. Inc, Bend, OR, USA) to validate maternal report of child sleep. Results: No significant differences were found between spontaneous and assisted conception mothers on any of the study variables; therefore, assisted and spontaneous samples were combined. Structural equation modelling confirmed that lower pre‐birth maternal hardiness was associated with more problematic sleep‐related cognitions (β = 0.23, P P P < 0.001) during toddlerhood, even after considering concurrent maternal mood and child temperament. Conclusions: Pre‐birth maternal hardiness rather than mode of conception contributes to parenting cognitions and behaviour around child sleep and, ultimately, toddlers' sleep outcomes. Findings suggest that targeting negative maternal perceptions of control and efficacy through clinical interventions could benefit toddlers' sleep.

N2  - Circadian variation in biological rhythms has been identified as affecting both labour pain and the pharmacological properties of analgesics. In the context of pain, there is also a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of adult attachment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether labour pain, analgesic consumption and pharmacological effect are significantly affected by the time of day and to analyse whether this circadian variation is influenced by women’s attachment style. This prospective observational study included a sample of 81 pregnant women receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Attachment was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale – Revised. The perceived intensity of labour pain in the early stage of labour (3 cm of cervical dilatation and before the administration of PCEA) was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain was also indirectly assessed by measuring the consumption of anaesthetics. The latency period and the duration of effect were recorded for a chronopharmacology characterisation. Pain, as assessed with the VAS, was significantly higher in the night-time group than in the daytime group. An insecure attachment style was significantly associated with greater labour pain at 3 cm of cervical dilatation (p p p < 0.05). The time of day was significantly associated with the pharmacological effect: the latency period was longer at night, and the duration of the pharmacological effect was longer during the daytime. The interaction between time of day and attachment style was not significant for any of the study variables. Our results provide evidence of the importance of circadian variation in studying labour pain and the pharmacological effect of labour analgesia involving epidural blockage with a PCEA regimen. Moreover, although there was no evidence that attachment style influenced the circadian variation, these data emphasise that insecure attachment patterns are a risk factor for greater labour pain and analgesic consumption, which should be considered in pain management approaches.

N2  - Objective: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26–34weeks gestation). Methods: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized controlled trial design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to achieve mutual calm and promote communication of affect between infants and their mothers throughout the NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants during sleep at ∼35 and ∼40weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 frequency bands between 1 and 48Hz in each of 125 electrodes. Results: Near to term age, compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48Hz (20% to 36% with p-values1500g). Conclusion: FNI leads to increased frontal brain activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of better neurobehavioral outcomes. Significance: FNI may be a practicable means of improving outcomes in preterm infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: 122 pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation. Methods: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals. Results: Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related issues as well as with negative expectations about the future. Conclusions: Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed.

N2  - Pregnant women, both before and after childbirth, frequently experience memory deficits and disrupted sleep. In the present study we assessed the relationship between false memory generation and fragmented sleep during pregnancy and motherhood. We tested 178 pregnant women and 58 female non-pregnant childless controls, during pregnancy (15–35th week of gestation) and again after childbirth (8–13th month). False memories were defined as memories of gist words that were semantically related to studied word lists but were not presented during learning of these lists in the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy in the home environment for seven consecutive nights. Compared to the controls, the group of pregnant women produced more false memories and displayed more fragmented sleep both during pregnancy and after childbirth. However, false memory generation was not correlated to measures of sleep fragmentation. These results show that pregnant women suffer from sleep fragmentation and a higher susceptibility to false memories, but leave open the question as to whether both phenomena are related.

N2  - Study Objectives: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. Design: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. Setting: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009. Patients or Participants: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2–2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3–8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5–10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3–8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4–11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of a 5-year-old girl affected by macrocrania due to benign external hydrocephalus with nocturnal lagophthalmos and SEM during NREM sleep. The patient, a girl of Ethiopian origin and Amhara ethnicity, was born at term after regular pregnancy. She had a negative familial medical history. At the age of 3 months she presented macrocrania, without neurological signs, and findings of enlarged subarachnoid spaces at cerebral ultrasound, confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3 years. The macrocrania and her nocturnal lagophthalmos appeared to be inherited after viewing the photos and clinical history of her mother. She had no history of seizures. This report highlights the association of physiological nocturnal lagophthalmos in a familial hereditary case of Amhara ethnicity with another phenomenon, that of SEM during NREM sleep, otherwise not observable with the eyes closed.

N2  - Antenatal anxiety may adversely impact on several aspects of fetal maturation, pregnancy, the puerperium, and child development, thus demonstrating an intrinsic teratogenic structural, gestational, and neurobehavioral liability. Moreover, insomnia during the first trimester of pregnancy is quite common and is usually a result of associated hormonal changes. Insomnia is also common during the third trimester of pregnancy. There are a number of reasons for this, but by far the most common is the discomfort as the mother gets bigger and her baby begins to place more pressure on her internal organs, making it more difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. However, when possible, benzodiazepines should be avoided in both the first trimester and third trimester of pregnancy because of possible structural teratogenicity (especially, anal atresia and other gastrointestinal tract anomalies, and oral cleft), ascertained gestational teratogenity (spontaneous abortion) when taken in overdose, and ascertained perinatal teratogenicity (neonatal withdrawal syndromes). As regards hypnotic agents, preliminary data, although apparently encouraging, are too limited to confirm or exclude a potential structural teratogenic liability. Above all, concordant safety signals seem to discourage the use of hypnotic agents during pregnancy because of an increase in the risk of gestational teratogenicity (preterm birth, low birth weight, and babies small for gestational age). Given these considerations, interventions alternative to pharmacological treatments should be considered first-line options for managing anxiety and sleep disorders in pregnancy.

N2  - Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression (X² 13.39; p X² 9.20 p X² 20.78; p < 0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI).

N2  - Postpartum depression is major or minor depression that is manifest in the first year after child birth. It is characterized by typical symptoms of major depression including depressive mood, loss of interest, sleep and appetite disturbances, difficulties in concentration and decision making, psychomotor agitation or retardation, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation. These symptoms may arise any time in the postpartum period or even carry over from pregnancy; however, the first 3 months after delivery appears to be the period of highest risk and greatest salience to mothers and health care professionals. Postpartum depression should be distinguished from the postpartum blues, which refers to a common mild clinical state that is manifest in the first week to 10 days postpartum. The blues are typically transitory but do serve as a known risk factor for postpartum depression. On the opposite end of the severity spectrum is postpartum psychosis, which is a severe disorder characterized by hallucinations and delusions and usually reflects bipolar disorder. Postpartum psychosis is often manifest early in the postpartum period, usually within the first 2 weeks and typically has an acute onset. Treatment usually involves hospitalization. Postpartum psychosis is not considered to be on a continuum with postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is often comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety disorders. Postpartum depression is particularly consequential because it occurs at a time of the increased demands on a woman associated with infant care. Postpartum women are particularly likely to experience sleep interruptions, withdrawal from the work force, and isolation from friends. For women who are depressed, these stressors can exacerbate negative mood and lead to further impairment in functioning. Of particular concern is the fact that postpartum depression is associated with suboptimal mother-infant interaction as well as negative consequences for the infant in the realms of social, emotional, and cognitive development.

N2  - Background: Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors. Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N = 161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10–12 weeks), T2 (14–16 weeks) and T3 (18–20 weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs. Results: BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL ≥ 20 min had greater BMI than women without persistent SOL ≥ 20 min prior to covariate adjustment at T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for persistent WASO ≥ 30 min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates. Conclusions: Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Summary Hypocretin/orexin peptides are known for their role in the control of the wake–sleep cycle and narcolepsy–cataplexy pathophysiology. Recent studies suggested that hypocretin peptides also have a role in pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a retrospective analysis on pregnancy complications in two different mouse models of hypocretin deficiency. We recorded 85 pregnancies of mice lacking either hypocretin peptides (knockout) or hypocretin‐releasing neurons (transgenic) and their wild‐type controls. Pregnancy was associated with unexplained dam death before delivery in 3/15 pregnancies in knockout mice, and in 3/23 pregnancies in transgenic mice. No casualties occurred in wild‐type pregnant dams (P < 0.007 versus hypocretin‐deficient mice as a whole). Hypocretin deficiency did not impact either on litter size or the number of weaned pups per litter. These data provide preliminary evidence of a critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum. Background: The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence. Methods: A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament. Results: Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To determine whether maternal mental health mediates the relationship between eczema or asthma symptoms and mental well-being in children. Study design: Analysis of 7250 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high ‘internalizing’ (anxious/depressive) and ‘externalizing’ (oppositional/hyperactive) problems (high was > 90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were ‘none’; ‘early onset transient’ (infancy/preschool only); ‘persistent’ (infancy/preschool and at school age); and ‘late onset’ (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old. Results: Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15; internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62, 1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association. Conclusions: Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

N2  - This study aimed to examine the transition to parenthood and mental health in first‐time parents in detail and explore any differences in this transition in the context of parental gender and postpartum mental health. Semistructured clinical interviews (Birmingham Interview for Maternal Mental Health) were carried out with 46 women and 40 men, 5 months after birth. Parents were assessed on pre‐ and postpartum anxiety, depression, and postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a range of adjustment and relationship variables. One fourth of the men and women reported anxiety in pregnancy, reducing to 21% of women and 8% of men after birth. Pregnancy and postpartum depression rates were roughly equal, with 11% of women and 8% of men reporting depression. Postpartum PTSD was experienced by 5% of parents. Postpartum mental health problems were significantly associated with postpartum sleep deprivation (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5), complications in labor (OR = 5.1), lack of postpartum partner support (OR = 8.0), feelings of parental unworthiness (OR = 8.3), and anger toward the infant (OR = 4.4). Few gender differences were found for these variables. This study thus highlights the importance of focusing interventions on strengthening the couple's relationship and avoiding postnatal sleep deprivation, and to address parents’ feelings of parental unworthiness and feelings of anger toward their baby.

N2  - Background: Depression and anxiety are important mood changes in childbearing women. However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety courses. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N = 139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Group-based modeling identified three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%), and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%), and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly related to anxiety trajectories (p < 0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1∼6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4∼7.3) in the third trimester. Conclusions: Distinctive trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to continuous assessment of psychological well-being among women who undergo an elective CS.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus ambient sound. Design: Repeated‐measures randomized controlled trial. Setting: Special care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center. Participants: Clinically stable preterm infants (22) born at > 28 weeks gestation and enrolled at > 32 weeks gestation and their mothers. Methods: Infants were exposed to lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall. Results: There was no discernible infant response to music and therefore no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over time. However during the mothers’ presence (first 12 minutes), the infants exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p = .024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was not significant. Conclusion: Infants may have been unable to detect the music against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants’ physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and departure of the mothers.
