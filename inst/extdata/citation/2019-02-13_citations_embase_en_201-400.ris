N2  - There is mounting evidence for an association between sleep disorders and hypertension. In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there are plausible biological reasons for the development of hypertension, and treatment of OSA results in modest (2-3 mm Hg), adherence-dependent decreases in blood pressure, with larger effects evident in those with resistant hypertension. However, prospective, population-based cohort studies have not yet convincingly demonstrated a link between OSA and incident hypertension, and adequately powered controlled trials of CPAP for the prevention or treatment or hypertension are lacking. While associations have been identified between short sleep duration, insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), shift work, and hypertension, the causative role of these conditions/circumstances is not proven, and further well-designed pathophysiological and/or interventional studies are needed. Particular emphasis should be placed on defining subgroups of hypertensive OSA patients that stand to benefit most from OSA treatment and in understanding the link between sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Well-controlled intervention studies are needed in populations with short sleep duration, insomnia, shift work sleep disorder, and RLS to confirm their putative links with hypertension.

N2  - Study Objectives: Few studies have objectively evaluated sleep characteristics during pregnancy or investigated the relationship between altered spectral electroencephalogram (EEG) bands and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The study aimed to describe changes in sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG) and spectral EEG bands during pregnancy and to examine the relationship between delta power in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and SDB. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective study. One hundred twenty-three women underwent full PSG in early pregnancy, and 97 repeated PSG in late pregnancy. Spectral analysis of the EEG in NREM sleep was performed. We used linear and logistic mixed-model regression to analyze the sleep measures and linear regression to explore the association between delta power and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) changes during pregnancy. Results: In late pregnancy, women had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep efficiency, more awakenings, more stage N2 sleep, less slow wave sleep, less REM sleep, higher AHI, and higher periodic limb movement index compared to early pregnancy. The percentage of stage N1 sleep, sleep latency, REM sleep latency, and arousal index frequency did not change. Regarding EEG-spectra, delta and theta powers decreased, but beta-2 power increased during pregnancy. In multivariable analyses, greater reduction of delta power was associated with larger increases in AHI (β [95% confidence interval] = −0.038 [−0.073, −0.002], P = .040). Estimates suggest that each one-unit increase in AHI reduces delta power by 4% in late pregnancy. Conclusions: PSG-measured sleep characteristics change during pregnancy. Delta power decreases when the severity of SDB increases during pregnancy. Commentary: A commentary on this article appears in this issue on page 1095.

N2  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OSA and preeclampsia. Methods: Between 30 and 39 weeks gestation, objective sleep apnea were evaluated in 38 normal pregnant and 40 preeclamptic women. Preeclampsia was defined by having a blood pressure (BP) > 140/90 mmHg on two occasions after the 20th week of pregnancy with excess protein in the urine (> 300 mg in 24 h) or 30 mg persistent proteinuria (+ 1 in dipsticks) in random samples. Objective sleep apnea was evaluated using an overnight in-hospital sleep evaluation using the SOMNOwatch plus Respiratory Screener. OSA was defined as an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5–14.9), moderate (15–29.9), and severe (≥ 30). Results: Mean AHI was 33.3 ± 12.1 in preeclamptic women and was 23.8 ± 15.8 in normal pregnant women (p = 0.008). There was significant difference in prevalence of OSA severity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) between groups. Out of 33 preeclamptic women, 11 women had moderate and 22 women had severe OSA. Whereas, among 33 normal pregnant women, 8, 13, and10 women had mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. Two normal pregnant women had no OSA (AHI< 5). Conclusion: Our study suggests women are susceptible to developing OSA during pregnancy that is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.

N2  - Sleep disturbances in pregnancy are associated with depression, preterm delivery, hypertension, hyperglycemic disorders, and higher rate of cesarean as well as adverse perinatal outcomes. Diabetes is other prevalent condition in pregnancy related to these adverse outcomes, and insulin resistance is a common disruptor. As such, it is important to evaluate the quality of sleep and daytime somnolence in diabetic pregnancy. Aim: Evaluate sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in pregnancy complicated by diabetes mellitus. This is a cross-sectional study involving 115 pregnant women with diabetes (PWD), gestational age from 10 to 39 weeks. Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-BR) and daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The study was approved by IPADE ethic board (1.801.860). Statistical analysis was performed using the software IBM SPSS. Results: Poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) was observed in 60,4% of PWD, which is higher them most reported rates for normal pregnancy (60,4% vs. 45% p: 0.01, CI99%. SEDOV, 2017) but similar to reported data on Brazilian overweight pregnant women (65,9%; RIBEIRO 2015). The mean PSQI score was 6.91. Short sleep duration was present in 35,8% (mean sleep duration: 7,2 hours/night). Sleep was disturbed by frequent urination in 66,1% of PWD. Daytime somnolence reported in 20.8% of PWD, and was not related with the quality of sleep. The higher number of parity was independently associated with poor sleep quality [p=0.03; 0R=1.74; CI=1.03-2.97]. The presence of obesity, hypertension, educational level, type of diabetes or treatment were non-influential to sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are frequent in PWD and a higher number of parity is independently associated with poor sleep quality. Given that sleep disturbances are related to adverse outcomes in PWD, we suggest that this group of patients should be the focus of therapeutic measures to improve sleep.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB), particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is poorly understood in pregnancy, yet may insidiously worsen metabolic function. We hypothesized that worse SDB in part accounts for higher 24 hour patterns of glycemia in late pregnancy complicated by obesity without gestational diabetes. At 33±1 weeks, 18 pregnant women without OSA symptoms (29.4±1.2 years [mean±SEM], BMI 34.3±0.6 kg/m2) were provided a eucaloric diet (50% carb, 35% fat) for 72 hour while wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). SDB severity was measured in-home with a Watch- PAT200 wrist-worn device and quantified by the apnea hypopnea index (AHI; apneas and hypopneas/hour) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI; O2 desaturations ≥4%/hour). Surprisingly, (12/18) women had an AHI≥5 (mild OSA). Total sleep time was 370.3±12.4 min (∼6 hours), sleep efficiency was impressively low (80.1±1.5%), and AHI and ODI were at least mild at 11.6±2 and 5.2±1.3, respectively. Importantly, AHI was correlated with 24 hour glucose area-under-the-curve (AUC) (r=0.50, p=0.03) and mean 24 hour glucose (r=0.55, p=0.02). ODI was correlated with both 24 hour AUC (r=0.54, p=0.02, Figure 1a) and mean 24 hour glucose (r=0.58, p=0.01, Figure 1b). Poor sleep and undiagnosed mild OSA are common in late pregnancy complicated by obesity, and may contribute to higher patterns of glycemia. SDB may be a treatable risk factor potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: The prevalence of pregnancy-associated insomnia is high. Although insomnia may flow from normal physiologic features of pregnancy, it may also be an early warning sign of a relapse, or a trigger for a relapse, of a psychiatric illness. Those at risk for psychiatric illnesses may require medications as well as behavioral and psychotherapeutic interventions, to prevent relapse in the perinatal period. Unfortunately, few reviews of psychotropics used to treat pregnancy-related sleep disorders exist. Objective: We discuss issues related to sleep and sleep disorders in pregnancy in the context of co-morbid psychiatric illness, and review the literature on the commonly-used medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, trazodone, and melatonin) for insomnia during pregnancy.

N2  - Study question: Do women trying to conceive who utilize fertility apps have increased fecundability (shorter time to pregnancy) than women who use no apps? Summary answer: Individuals who utilized any fertility app in comparison to no app had increased fecundability. Several apps designated a priori were associated with higher fecundability. What is known already: Many women who are trying to conceive use a menstrual cycle or fertility app to identify the "fertile window," or the days of the menstrual cycle when intercourse is most likely to result in pregnancy. Prior studies have found that some apps are more accurate than others to identify the fertile window. Study design, size, duration: Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) is an internet-based prospective cohort study of women trying to conceive, ongoing since 2013 in the USA and Canada. Women included in this analysis were enrolled through October 2017, were aged 21-45, in a stable relationship with a male partner, not utilizing contraception or fertility treatment, and had been attempting to conceive for < = 6 months. A total of 4345 women were included in this analysis. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Female participants complete a baseline questionnaire providing demographic, lifestyle, medical and reproductive histories. They completed bimonthly follow-up questionnaires in English until conception or up to 12 months after study entry. Each baseline and follow-up questionnaire asked about specific menstrual cycle or fertility apps used, and any occurrence of pregnancy. A proportional probabilities model was used to estimate fecundability ratios (FR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Higher FR indicate higher fecundability (reduced time to pregnancy). Main results and the role of chance: Among 4345 participants, 2527 pregnancies were recorded within 17,185 observed cycles (14.7% crude fecundability). Of participants, 72% used an app to record and possibly also interpret menstrual cycle data and/or fertility signs. The total number of apps used was 78, with 31% using one of a group of likely "advanced" apps specified a priori, because they can track multiple biomarkers of ovulation: Fertility Friend, Kindara, Glow, Clue, or Ovia. At baseline and adjusting for woman's age, gravidity, body-mass index, education, smoking, prior hormonal contraception, cycle regularity, and sleep quality, relative to using no app, the FRfor individuals who used one of the a priori advanced apps, or any other app was 1.13 (CI: 1.03-1.23) and 1.07 (CI: 0.97-1.18), respectively. Results were similar in time-varying analyses based on responses from follow-up questionnaires, but varied somewhat when stratified based on duration of time attempting pregnancy. Strengths of the study include the prospective reporting of app use. Limitations, reasons for caution: Fertility app use was self-reported, with no specific data on how intensively the app was used. Time to pregnancy was also self-reported. We cannot rule out bias due to differential loss-to-follow-up or residual confounding by subfertility history or attempt time at study entry. Wider implications of the findings: A majority of women trying to conceive are likely to use a fertility or menstrual cycle app. Such app use may reduce time to pregnancy. Apps that track multiple biomarkers of fertility appear to be more effective than others to reduce time to pregnancy.

N2  - There are many ways in which women experience sleep differently from men. Women contending with distinct sleep challenges respond differently to sleep disorders, as well as sleep deprivation and deficiency, and face particular health outcomes as a result of poor sleep. Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions. Moreover, studies indicate that during times of hormonal change, women are at an increased risk for sleep disturbances such as poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, as well as sleep disorders such as OSA, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. This article reviews sleep changes in female subjects from neonatal life to menopause.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a commonly occurring disease, particularly among young women of child-bearing age. The underlying pathophysiology for this disease has remained largely unclear; however, the recent literature suggests that focal outflow obstruction of the transverse sinus may be the cause. The purpose of this study was to report one group's early experience with transverse venous sinus stenting in the treatment of IIH and assess its effectiveness. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review to identify patients who had undergone stenting of an outflow-obstructed transverse venous sinus for the treatment of IIH at Gates Vascular Institute between January 2015 and November 2017. Patient demographic data of interest included age, sex, BMI, and history of smoking, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hormonal contraceptive use, and acetazolamide therapy. Each patient's presenting signs and symptoms and whether those symptoms improved with treatment were reviewed. The average opening lumbar puncture (LP) pressure preprocedure, average pressure gradient across the obstructed segment prior to stenting, treatment failure rate (need for shunt placement), and mean follow-up period were calculated. RESULTS Of the 18 patients who had undergone transverse venous stenting for IIH, 16 (88.9%) were women. The mean age of all the patients was 38.3 years (median 38 years). Mean BMI was 34.2 kg/m2 (median 33.9 kg/m2). Presenting symptoms were headache (16 patients [88.9%]), visual disturbances (13 patients [72.2%]), papilledema (8 patients [44.4%]), tinnitus (3 patients [16.7%]), and auditory bruit (3 patients [16.7%]). The mean opening LP pressure pre-procedure was 35.6 cm H2O (median 32 cm H2O). The mean pressure gradient measured proximally and distally to the area of focal obstruction within the transverse sinus was 16.5 cm H2O (median 15 cm H2O). Postprocedurally, 14 patients (77.8%) continued to have headaches; 6 (33.3%) continued to have visual disturbances. No patients continued to have auditory bruit (0%) or papilledema (0%). One patient (5.6%) had new-onset tinnitus postprocedure. Overall improvement of symptoms was noted in 16 patients (88.9%) postprocedure, with 1 patient (5.6%) requiring shunt placement and 2 other patients (11.1%) requiring postprocedural LP to monitor intracranial pressure to determine candidacy for further surgical interventions to treat residual symptoms. The mean duration of follow-up was 194.2 days. CONCLUSIONS Transverse sinus stenting is a rapidly developing technique that has shown good effectiveness and safety in the literature. Authors of the present study found that stenting a flow-obstructed transverse sinus in patients with IIH was a safe and effective way to treat the condition.

N2  - Introduction Separation after preterm birth is a major stressor for infants and parents. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is a method of care suitable to use in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to minimise separation between parents and infants. Less separation leads to increased possibilities for parent-infant interaction, provided that the parents' sleep quality is satisfactory. We aimed to evaluate the effect of continuous SSC on sleep quality and mood in parents of preterm infants born <33 weeks of gestation as well as the quality of parent-infant interaction and salivary cortisol concentrations at the time of discharge. Methods and analysis A randomised intervention study with two arms - intervention versus standard care. Data will be collected from 50 families. Eligible families will be randomly allocated to intervention or standard care when transferred from the intensive care room to the family-room in the NICU. The intervention consists of continuous SSC for four consecutive days and nights in the family-room. Data will be collected every day during the intervention and again at the time of discharge from the hospital. Outcome measures comprise activity tracker (Actigraph); validated self-rated questionnaires concerning sleep, mood and bonding; observed scorings of parental sensitivity and emotional availability and salivary cortisol. Data will be analysed with pairwise, repeated measures, Mann Whitney U-test will be used to compare groups and analysis of variance will be used to adjust for different hospitals and parents' gender. Ethics and dissemination The study is approved by the Regional Research Ethics Board at an appropriate university (2016/89-31). The results will be published in scientific journals. We will also use conferences and social media to disseminate our findings. Trial registration number NCT03004677.

N2  - Background Fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) of normal-to-normal (NN) beat intervals provides high-temporal resolution access to assess the functioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Aim To determine critical periods of fetal autonomic maturation. The developmental pace is hypothesized to change with gestational age (GA). Study design Prospective longitudinal observational study. Subjects 60 healthy singleton fetuses were followed up by fetal magnetocardiographic heart rate monitoring 4–11 times (median 6) during the second half of gestation. Outcome measure FHRV parameters, accounting for differential aspects of the ANS, were studied applying linear mixed models over four predefined pregnancy segments of interest (SoI: <27; 27+0–31 +0; 31+1–35+0; >35+1 weeks GA). Periods of fetal active sleep and quiescence were accounted for separately. Results Skewness of the NN interval distribution VLF/LF band power ratio and complexity describe a saturation function throughout the period of interest. A decreasing LF/HF ratio and an increase in pNN5 indicate a concurrent shift in sympathovagal balance. Fluctuation amplitude and parameters of short-term variability (RMSSD, HF band) mark a second acceleration towards term. In contrast, fetal quiescence is characterized by sequential, but low-margin transformations; ascending overall variability followed by an increase of complexity and superseded by fluctuation amplitude. Conclusions An increase in sympathetic activation, connected with by a higher ability of parasympathetic modulation and baseline stabilization, is reached during the transition from the late 2nd into the early 3rd trimester. Pattern characteristics indicating fetal well-being saturate at 35 weeks GA. Pronounced fetal breathing efforts near-term mirror in fHRV as respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

N2  - Study question: To explore the impact of night shiftonmenstruation among nurses. Summary answer: Night shift might increase the likelihood of irregular menstrual cycle and aggravated dysmenorrhoea among nurses.Menstruation status alteration increased with the frequency of night shift increasing. What is known already: Menstruation status was considered a symbolic of female fertility. Irregular menstrural cycle, including shorter or longer cycles were related to infertility. Some studies illuminated that stress was an important influence to menstruation,besides other factors including age,weight, tumor, imflammation or genetic factors. Study design, size, duration: By questionnaires, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among 702 married female nurses who were at childbear-ing age and currently working at The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, GuangDong Women and Children Hospital or Chinese PLA General Hospital from November 2014 to December 2014. Participants/materials, setting, methods: By questionnaires, a retro-spective cohort study was conducted among 702 married female nurses who were at childbearing age and currently working at The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, GuangDong Women and Children Hospital or Chinese PLA General Hospital. Main results and the role of chance: A total of702 nurses were investigated, among which 597nursesgave valid questionnaires, with an effective rate of 85.04%.Potential confounding factors were adjusted. 134nurses(22.45%) had a trend of irregular menstrual cycles, with apparent difference(P<0.05) if they worked late night shift twice a week or more. 162nurses(27.14%) suffered aggravated dysmenorrhea, especially when nurses worked no less than thrice per week for late night shift (P<0.05). Corresponding OR values of late night shift were larger than those of early night shift. After adjustment for sleeping condition,OR values of both early and late night shifts on menstrual cycle and dysmenorrhea decreasedin certain degree, suggesting that sleeping condition may be the intermediaters. Limitations, reasons for caution: Firstly, nurses without night shifts or unmarried nurses weren't included. Secondly, night shift workload and working hours weren't standardized.Thirdly, recalling bias and reporting bias was indelible in this retrospective cohort study. Wider implications of the findings: Late night working may be the key to biological rhythm alteration. Further study on the machanism and among factors to the change of menstruastion of nurses with night-shifts should be conducted, to better understand reproductive impairment of night shiftwork.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess satisfaction with maternity waiting home built spaces and features in women who are at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. residential facilities that temporarily house near-term pregnant mothers close to healthcare facilities that provide obstetrical care). Specifically we wanted to answer the questions: (1) Are built spaces and features associated with maternity waiting home user satisfaction? (2) Can built spaces and features designed to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function improve maternity waiting home user satisfaction? And (3) Which built spaces and features are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction?
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study comparing satisfaction with standard and non-standard maternity waiting home designs. Between December 2016 and February 2017 we surveyed expectant mothers at two maternity waiting homes that differed in their design of built spaces and features. We used bivariate analyses to assess if built spaces and features were associated with satisfaction. We compared ratings of built spaces and features between the two maternity waiting homes using chi-squares and t-tests to assess if design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function were associated with higher satisfaction. We used exploratory robust regression analysis to examine the relationship between built spaces and features and maternity waiting home satisfaction.
SETTING: Two maternity waiting homes in Malawi, one that incorporated non-standardized design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy, and function (Kasungu maternity waiting home) and the other that had a standard maternity waiting home design (Dowa maternity waiting home).
PARTICIPANTS: 322 expectant mothers at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. first-time mothers and those with no pregnancy risk factors) who had stayed at the Kasungu or Dowa maternity waiting homes.
FINDINGS: There were significant differences in ratings of built spaces and features between the two differently designed maternity waiting homes, with the non-standard design having higher ratings for: adequacy of toilets, and ratings of heating/cooling, air and water quality, sanitation, toilets/showers and kitchen facilities, building maintenance, sleep area, private storage space, comfort level, outdoor spaces and overall satisfaction (p = <.0001 for all). The final regression model showed that built spaces and features that are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction are toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space (R2 = 0.28).
KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The design of maternity waiting home built spaces and features is associated with user satisfaction in women at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes, especially related to toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space. Improving maternity waiting home built spaces and features may offer a promising area for improving maternity waiting home satisfaction and reducing barriers to maternity waiting home use.

N2  - BACKGROUND Among the various factors that may influence the pharmacological response to opioids, genetic polymorphisms [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)] have generated some interest. OBJECTIVES To examine the influence on morphine dose requirements and adverse events in the postoperative period of four SNP [opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) ex-21 and ex-26, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT)] in candidate genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. DESIGN A single centre prospective study. SETTING University Hospital, Paris, France, from 2 January 2007 to 15 November 2011. PATIENTS A total of 438 white adults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery (spine, hip and knee) under general anaesthesia. The main exclusion criteria were receiving opioids for chronic pain, nonopioid drugs within 2 days prior to surgery, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, sleep apnoea obstruction syndrome, morbid obesity, severe hepatic impairment, cognitive dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS Assays of plasma concentrations of morphine and metabolites (morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine 6-glucuronide) were performed and common polymorphisms in four candidate genes [OPRM1 A118G rs1799971; P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) T3435C (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582); COMT Val 158 Met (rs4680)] were analysed. Morphine was titrated by staff in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the ward patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was used for 24h. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The dose of morphine required to achieve pain relief and the influence of SNP in genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and kinetics on morphine dose requirements. Secondary endpoints were the concentrations of morphine, morphine 6-glucuronide and morphine 3-gluguronide, the proportion of patients requiring a rescue analgesic and the proportion of morphine-related adverse events. RESULTS A total of 404 patients completed the study to final analysis. The mean±SD morphine dose to achieve pain relief was 15.8±8.8mg in the PACU and 22.7±18.6mg during patient-controlled intravenous administration. Morphine-related adverse events were observed in 37%. There was no relationship between any genetic polymorphisms and morphine dose, morphine 3-gluguronide and morphine 6-glucuronide concentration, morphine-related adverse events or pain level. In the PACU only, P-glycoprotein polymorphisms (ex-21; ex-26) were significantly associated with morphine concentration but the prediction of the model was poor (R 2 =0.04) CONCLUSION No major relationship has been demonstrated between SNP of OPRM1, ABCB1, COMT and morphine requirement, pain level or adverse effects in the postoperative period.

N2  - Background: Preterm birth leads to multiple morbidities affecting the health of a child. Lack of information on the health impact of prematurity hinders the possibility of any effective public health interventions in this regard. Our aim was to determine the association between preterm birth and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among 3 years old children in the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka. Methods: A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 790 preterm and term born children who were 03 years old. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to identify children. The exposure status, a preterm birth, was established using the maternal pregnancy records. Outcome status was measured using a validated health related quality of life questionnaire (prepared in Sinhala) for preschool-aged children. Mothers of the children responded to an interviewer-administered questionnaire which had variables on the exposure status, outcome and additional variables such as child development status and birth related information. Quality of life was measured in twelve different domains of health (subscales). The impact was analyzed using the multiple linear regression. Results: Response rate was 95.5% (n = 379) for preterm group and 95.2% (n = 378) for term-born group. Health-Related Quality of Life scores obtained by preterm children were lower than the term born children in eight subscales. Preterm birth showed statistically significant association with subscales on sleep wellbeing, general wellbeing and abdominal symptoms in the adjusted analysis (p < 0.05). Among preterm children prolonged illness, delayed development status, socio economic status and maternal perception on the health status of the child were common predictors of quality of life. Conclusion: Preterm birth affected health related quality of life of preschool aged children.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) from maternal cigarette smoking is linked to developmental deficits, including impaired auditory processing, language, generalized intelligence, attention, and sleep. Fetal brain undergoes massive growth, organization, and connectivity during gestation, making it particularly vulnerable to neurotoxic insult. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are extensively involved in growth, connectivity, and function of developing neural circuitry and neurotransmitter systems. Thus, PNE may have long-term impact on neurobehavioral development. The purpose of this study was to compare the auditory K-complex, an event-related potential reflective of auditory gating, sleep preservation and memory consolidation during sleep, in infants with and without PNE and to relate these neural correlates to neurobehavioral development. Methods: We compared brain responses to an auditory paired-click paradigm in 3- to 5-month-old infants during Stage 2 sleep, when the K-complex is best observed. We measured component amplitude and delta activity during the K-complex. Results: Infants with PNE demonstrated significantly smaller amplitude of the N550 component and reduced delta-band power within elicited K-complexes compared to nonexposed infants and also were less likely to orient with a head turn to a novel auditory stimulus (bell ring) when awake. Conclusions: PNE may impair auditory sensory gating, which may contribute to disrupted sleep and to reduced auditory discrimination and learning, attention re-orienting, and/or arousal during wakefulness reported in other studies. Implications: Links between PNE and reduced K-complex amplitude and delta power may represent altered cholinergic and GABAergic synaptic programming and possibly reflect early neural bases for PNE-linked disruptions in sleep quality and auditory processing. These may pose significant disadvantage for language acquisition, attention, and social interaction necessary for academic and social success.

N2  - Introduction: Recent studies have demonstrated an association between maternal supine sleep position and an increased risk of late stillbirth. During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava (IVC) when a woman lies in the supine position. The azygos system of veins is the dominant pathway of collateral venous return back to the heart in the event of acute obstruction of the IVC. It is suggested that this pathway provides adequate collateral venous circulation in the event of IVC compression in the supine position during late pregnancy. Objective: Investigate the effect of supine positioning on maternal hemodynamics during late pregnancy and the role of collateral venous circulation. Methods: Ethics approval was obtained and 12 women with singleton pregnancies between 35- and 38-week gestation underwent magnetic resonance imaging in the supine and left lateral decubitus positions using a Skyra 3T system (Siemens). Phase-contrast images were evaluated to measure cardiac output, blood flow through the azygos vein, and blood flow through the abdominal aorta (AA) and IVC at two levels: at the level of aortic bifurcation and immediately above the renal veins. Results: The supine position was associated with a 16.4% reduction in cardiac output when compared to the left lateral position. In addition, blood flow through the IVC decreased at its origin by 85.3% and by 44.4% at the level of the renal veins. Blood flow through the azygos vein increased in the supine position by 220%. Blood flow through the AA at the level of the renal veins did not differ significantly; however, it is reduced by 32.3% at the level of the aortic bifurcation. Conclusions: Women in late pregnancy experience an increase in collateral venous blood flow when lying supine, likely as a response to marked compression of the IVC in this position. However, cardiac output and aortic blood flow were found to decrease while in the supine position.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the relationship between poor sleep quality during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: A total of 4066 singleton pregnant women from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort (TMCHC) without overt diabetes before pregnancy were analyzed. Sleep quality and duration during early pregnancy were self-reported by enrolled women at their first antenatal care visit before 16 weeks of gestation. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was assessed with a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24–28 weeks of gestation. Information about self-reported sleep quality and duration in mid-pregnancy were also collected at this time. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models, and adjusted for potential confounders to estimate the effect of poor sleep quality and the interaction between sleep quality and duration on the development of GDM. Stratified analyses were performed according to age, parity, family history of diabetes and napping. Results: A total of 335 (8.2%) participants were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality was reported in 259 (6.4%) women during early pregnancy and 248 (6.1%) in mid-pregnancy. The risk of GDM was increased in women with poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20–2.61). No association was found between poor sleep quality during mid-pregnancy and the risk of GDM. The risk of GDM was highest in women with poor sleep and longer nighttime sleep duration during early pregnancy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.20–4.29) when compared with those who reported good sleep and 7.0–8.5 h of sleep duration per night. Stratified analysis found that the association between poor sleep quality in early pregnancy and the risk of GDM was stronger among women aged ≥30 years (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.35–4.09) and those with a family history of diabetes (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.54–10.48). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality during early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of GDM. Screening for and treating sleep problems in early pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk of GDM.

N2  - Context Disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep quality during pregnancy have been related to gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which affect postpartum glucose metabolism and future risk of type 2 diabetes. Objective We assessed whether the circadian rhythm-related melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) genotype was associated with 1 to 5 years of postpartum glycemic changes among women with a history of GDM and whether gestational weight gain modified such associations. Design, Settings, and Participants The established circadian rhythm-associated MTNR1B genetic variant (rs10830963) was genotyped in 1025 Chinese women with a history of GDM. Body weight and glycemic traits, during and after pregnancy, were longitudinally collected. Main Outcome Measures The main outcome measure was postpartum glycemic changes. Results We found that women carrying different MTNR1B genotypes showed distinct postpartum changes in 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test: 0.36, 0.20, and -0.19 mM per additional copy of the shorter sleep duration-related G allele in women with inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight gain, respectively (for interaction, P = 0.028). The corresponding changes in fasting glucose were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.01 mM, although the modification effect of gestational weight gain on the genetic association was marginally significant (for interaction, P = 0.067). Conclusions Our findings suggest that gestational weight gain may modify the circadian rhythm-related MTNR1B genetic variant on long-term glycemic changes, highlighting the significance of gestational weight management in diabetes prevention among women with GDM.

N2  - The spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) ranges from mild snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the most severe form of SDB. Current recommendations are to treat these women with continuous positive airway pressure despite limited data. SDB in early and mid-pregnancy is associated with preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Pregnant women with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea at delivery were at significantly increased risk of having cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and in-hospital death. These effects were exacerbated in the presence of obesity. Postpartum, these women are at risk for respiratory suppression and should be monitored.

N2  - Pregnancy often predisposes women to new-onset sleep disturbances, as well as exacerbations of preexisting sleep disorders. The goals of treating perinatal sleep disorders include the promotion of restorative sleep and the benefits it brings to both mother and fetus. The prescribing of any sleep aid in pregnancy must include consideration of the risks and benefits for both the patient and her fetus. Although data on the perinatal use of sleep aids is limited, there may be effects on fetal development, timing and duration of delivery, and postnatal outcomes.

N2  - Objectives: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep, including habitual snoring and insomnia. The co-occurrence among non-pregnant cohorts is 30%–50% with increased risk for adverse health outcomes. To date, no study has examined the comorbid status or impact in pregnant women. Methods: The prevalence of insomnia (INS) and habitual snoring (HS) were examined in 439 women in the third trimester (34.1 ± 3.7 weeks). Habitual snoring (snoring ≥3 times/week) was self-reported. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ). Results: Four groups emerged: HS−/ISQ− (n = 161; 36.7%), HS−/ISQ+ (n = 146; 33.3%), HS+/ISQ− (n = 63; 14.4%), and HS+/ISQ+ (n = 69; 15.7%). Logistic regression models revealed both independent associations, as well as comorbid HS/INS status with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3–6.5, p < 0.001; aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1–4.4, p = 0.02; aOR 7.2, 95%CI 3.7–14.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Only comorbid HS/INS was associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 3.2 95%CI 1.0–10.6, p = 0.048). Insomnia alone and HS alone were associated with a baby born large for gestational age (aOR 2.9 95%CI 1.2–7.1, p = 0.019 and aOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1–11.1, p = 0.034 respectively) but however, the comorbid state was not significantly associated with LGA. Only women with HS alone were at increased odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.2 95%CI 1.0–4.6, p = 0.046). Conclusions: Both insomnia alone and comorbid insomnia/habitual snoring were associated with adverse outcomes even after accounting for confounders. These findings are clinically relevant since adverse pregnancy outcomes may have severe consequences for both mother and baby. In order to mitigate these outcomes, identifying viable treatment(s) for women at risk should be considered a high priority. Précis: Comorbid insomnia and habitual snoring occur in a substantial number (15.7%) of pregnant women, and are associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to identify factors that may predispose women to excess gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods: Seventy-two healthy women with obesity (30 class I, 24 class II, 18 class III) expecting a singleton pregnancy were studied at 13 to 16 weeks gestation. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured during sleep (SleepEE, average EE from 0200-0500 hours) in a whole-room calorimeter, and total daily EE (TDEE) over 7 days using doubly labeled water. Glucose, insulin, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines were measured. Results: Body composition explained 70% variability in SleepEE, and SleepEE accounted for 67% to 73% of TDEE. Though there was no evidence of consistent low metabolism, there was considerable variability. Low SleepEE was associated with insulin resistance and low triiodothyronine concentrations (both P = 0.01). Physical activity level was 1.47 ± 0.02. For women with SleepEE within 100 kcal/d of their predicted EE, TDEE was significantly less than the estimate (2,530 ± 91 vs. 2,939 kcal/d; P < 0.001) provided from the most recent gestational energy requirement model. Conclusions: Pregnant women with obesity are inactive, possibly predisposing them to excess GWG. Current energy requirement models overestimate activity and may promote excess GWG in women with obesity. Furthermore, the observed large interindividual variability in basal metabolism may be important to consider when assessing the risk for excess GWG.

N2  - Background African-American (AA) women have poorer pregnancy outcomes, and studies in nonpregnant women suggest a different etiology of weight gain in AA compared with white women. We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with white women in pregnancy. Objective We aimed to identify physiologic risk factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy. Design This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity, between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by accelerometers. Markers of metabolic health were obtained from fasting blood and urine. Results AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were comparable in age (mean ± SEM: 27.7 ± 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index [mean ± SEM (in kg/m 2): 36.9 ± 0.7], and body fat (mean ± SEM: 45.0% ± 0.6%). AA women had more fat-free mass (P = 0.01) and tended to be more insulin-resistant (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.06). Energy intake was significantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 ± 76 compared with 2769 ± 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was comparable (AA: 2590 ± 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 ± 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231 ± 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 ± 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women.

N2  - Background: Anxiety and depression levels are higher in obese compared to those in normal weight pregnant women. The aims of this study are to examine anxiety and depression in pregnancy following bariatric surgery and to compare with obese pregnant controls considering the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), folate, and vitamin B12. Methods: Anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) were examined in the first (T1) and third (T3) pregnancy trimester in 54 women with bariatric surgery and 25 obese. T1 and T3 dietary intake of PUFA, folate, and vitamin B12 intake was assessed using a 3-day food record. Mixed models with a compound symmetry covariance structure and regression models were applied. Results: About half of the women with surgery had high state and trait anxiety scores (≥ 40), which did not significantly change during pregnancy. Every 10-kg postoperative weight loss was associated with an increase in T1 state and trait anxiety with respectively 2.7 and 2.3 points. A smoking woman had a 8.6-point higher state anxiety score than a non-smoking woman in T1. In T3, every additional hour of sleep was associated with a decrease in trait anxiety score with 1.59 points. Anxiety and depression scores were not associated with and could not be explained by inadequate PUFAs, folate, and vitamin B12 intakes. Anxiety scores were higher following surgery than those in untreated obesity at both time points. Conclusion: Pregnancy following bariatric surgery induces high levels of anxiety that are not associated with an inadequate maternal diet.

N2  - Exposures during early development can increase the susceptibility to chronic diseases in adult life. In a rat model, periconceptional ethanol (PCEtOH) exposure results in offspring with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Recently, metabolic dysfunction including diabetes, has been linked to disturbances in circadian rhythms. This study aimed to determine if PCEtOH resulted in changes to circadian rhythms that may contribute to the metabolic dysfunction. Sprague-Dawley rats consumed either a control liquid diet (n = 10) or an ethanol (n = 11) diet (12.5%v/v ethanol) from 4 days before mating day 4 of gestation. At 6 months of age, blood was collected every 4 h over a 24-h period, to determine glucose and corticosterone concentrations in 1 male and 1 female offspring from each litter. In a separate group of animals, liver tissue was collected for gene expression studies using realtime PCR. PCEtOH resulted in a phase shift in the circadian pattern of blood glucose and plasma corticosterone concentrations with peak glucose and corticosterone concentrations occurring ∼4 h later in female offspring exposed to PCEtOH. This resulted in a significantly higher blood glucose and plasma corticosterone at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 18.5 (p &lt; 0.05). These differences were associated with altered hepatic expression of the circadian regulating genes Clock and per1. No differences were observed between control and PCEtOH exposed male offspring. These results suggest a sex specific alteration to the circadian regulation of blood glucose and plasma corticosterone in response to PCEtOH exposure along with altered hepatic regulation of circadian regulated genes. Disturbances to circadian rhythms as a result of periconceptional ethanol exposuremay contribute to metabolic deficits in later life, particularly in female offspring.

N2  - The state of the intrauterine environment plays a significant role in the development of disease in adult life, with recent interest in the effects of perturbations around conception [periconceptional (PC) period]. This corresponds to the time period when women are unaware of their pregnancy and thus may partake in risky behaviours including alcohol consumption. We have a model of periconceptional ethanol (PCEtOH) exposure in rats which results in offspring with glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity (1). Recent research suggests that metabolic dysfunction may arise from disturbances to circadian rhythms. As such this study aimed to determine if PCEtOH resulted in changes to peripheral circadian rhythms. Sprague-Dawley rats consumed either a control liquid diet or an ethanol diet (12.5% v/v ethanol) from four days before mating until four days post mating. Blood was collected every 4 hours over a 24-hour period, to determine glucose and corticosterone concentrations in both male and female rat offspring at 6 months of age. Whole-blood glucose was measured using an Accucheck Performa glucometer with plasma corticosterone measured via radioimmunoassay. PCEtOH resulted in alterations in the circadian pattern of glucose and plasma corticosterone concentrations in a sex specific manner. Female offspring exhibited a phase shift with peak glucose and corticosterone occurring ∼4 hours later in animals exposed to PCEtOH. This resulted in a significantly higher blood glucose and plasma corticosterone at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 18.5 (P < .05). No differences were observed between control and PCEtOH exposed male offspring in whole blood glucose or plasma corticosterone at any time point. These results suggest a sex specific alteration to the circadian regulation of blood glucose and plasma corticosterone in response to PCEtOH exposure. Disturbances to circadian rhythms as a result of periconceptional ethanol exposure may contribute to metabolic deficits in later life.

N2  - Aims. Few epidemiological studies evaluated associations between perinatal complications and maternal mood at the early postpartum period and the findings are inconsistent. We aimed at investigating a wide range of complications during pregnancy, at delivery, and at the early postpartum period as determinants of postpartum depression (PPD) at 8 weeks postpartum.Methods. A total of 1037 women who enrolled in the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece participated in the present study. Information on pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications was obtained from clinical records or by questionnaires. Postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed at 8 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were fit to estimate the association between pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications and maternal depressive symptoms, adjusting also for potential confounders.Results. The prevalence of women with probable depression (EPDS score ≥ 13) was 13.6% at 8 weeks postpartum. Gestational hypertension and/or preeclampsia (β coefficient 1.86, 95% CI: 0.32, 3.41) and breastfeeding difficulties (β coefficient 0.77, 95% CI: 0.02, 1.53) were significantly associated with higher PPD symptoms. Sleep patterns during pregnancy, such as sleep deprivation (OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.91, 6.67) and snoring (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.93), and breastfeeding duration less than 2 months (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.64) were significantly associated with increase in the odds for PPD. Some other complications, such as unplanned pregnancy and hospitalisation during pregnancy were also associated with EPDS score, but these associations were explained by socio-demographic characteristics of the mother.Conclusions. We found that several pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications may have an adverse effect on maternal mood at the early postpartum period. These findings have considerable implications for developing effective prevention and early psychoeducational intervention strategies for women at risk of developing PPD.

N2  - The Neuro Endocrine Immune Network (NEI) is the most important communication- system in human body to mantain the health status. NEIRD evaluate the relationships between NEI and Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMDs). The altered interaction between the nervous system, the immune/inflammatory cells and the endocrine system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. The involvement of the adrenal steroid hormones in the immune response is fundamental and follow a circadian rhythm (circadian rhythm studies obtained the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2017). As Matter of fact, the nocturnal ability of the NEI system to mount an efficient immune and inflammatory response, with related clinical consequences, is matter of important chronotherapeutical approaches with exogenous steroids, in particular with glucocorticoids (GCs) (their siscovery obtained the Nobel Prize in 1950 and still a pillar in the treatment of RMDs and not only). Other important steroid hormones involved in the NEI are the sex hormones (estrogens.E2 OH-metabolites are potent enhancers of cell proliferation) and the d-hormone (steroidal hormone structure of the final metabolite of Vitamin D). Clinical observations indicate a strong influence of the neuroendocrine system on immune function and vice versa in chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The influence of hormones and neuronal pathways happens before and after the outbreak of the disease. Very recent data demonstrate the modulatory role of estrogens on epigenetic mechanisms (ie DNA methylation and gene upregulation). For example differentially expressed miRNA pathways linked to E2 in human endothelial cells through ER have been shown, and provide new insights by which oestrogen can modulate endothelial function. This point mighty be crucial in autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis (SSc) a disease prevalent in females and that start from damaged endothelium. We have started a large study on epigenetic and pregnancy on patients with RMDs such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). On the other hand, the disease process with an activated immune system influences several hormonal and neuronal pathways. In addition, the energy bottleneck leads to important disease sequelae such as sickness behaviour/fatigue/ depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, anorexia and malnutrition, bone loss, muscle wasting and cachectic obesity, insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia (insulin-like growth factor-1 resistance), dyslipidemia, alterations of steroid hormone axes, disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, elevated sympathetic tone, hypertension and volume overload, decreased parasympathetic tone, inflammation-related anaemia, and finally circadian (circannual) rhythms of symptoms. New therapeutic strategies should respect these findings because rheumatic patients die earlier due to the mentioned disease sequelae. It is suggested that disease sequelae must be treated more consequently because they are inherent to chronic inflammatory systemic diseases (possible evolution for some of them in cancer). Therapeutic strategies in this field of NEIRD are slowly developing. Low-dose glucocorticoid therapy as supplementation of the 'small adrenal engine', chronotherapy with glucocorticoids (night release) and vitamin D supplementation are the best examples of the successful utilisation of demonstrated concepts.

N2  - Background and aims: Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare sleep disorder, predominantly affecting males during adolescence. We report a female patient with recurrent episodes of hypersomnia and a long sleeping episode during pregnancy. Methods: A 26-years-old female patient is presented with recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, starting at the age of 12, shortly before menarche. Results: Sleep episodes occurred in a frequency of 2-3/year with varying duration, the longest being 3 weeks in 2008, when the patient presented at our clinic the first time. In addition, altered perception and cognitive dysfunction were present, but no hyperphagia or hypersexuality, fulfilling the criteria of the international classification for sleep disorders. Polysomnography, actigraphy and MSLT showed normal results during asymptomatic phases. Encephalopathy was excluded by laboratory results, normal cMRI and normal hypocretin-1 level in cerebrospinal fluid. After 2010, the episodes became less frequent and shorter until 2017, when the patient developed hypersomnia lasting from the 8th to the 18th week of pregnancy. Polysomnography showed a sleep duration of >14 hours with normal sleep architecture, 8 sleep cycles. Genetics confirmed HLA positivity for HLA DQB1∗0201 with maternal transmission. For 2 weeks the patient was treated with i.v. infusions and s.c. heparin to prevent dehydration and thrombosis. The patient slowly became more vigilant and mobile without using any medication because of pregnancy. Conclusion: This is the first case of KLS with a dramatic hypersomnia episode during pregnancy. Sleep studies and HLA-results are presented and discussed together with pathophysiology.

N2  - The Drakenstein Child Health Birth Cohort Study is a unique, multidisciplinary, South African birth cohort, to investigate the impact of antenatal and early life exposures on child health.(1,2) A core focus of the study is on the incidence, risk factors and etiology of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and the long term impact on child lung health.(3) One of the key outcomes is the spectrum and factors associated with development of chronic lung disease. The study investigates the role and interaction of potential risk factors covering 7 areas (environmental, infectious, nutritional, genetic, psychosocial, maternal and immunological risk factors) that may impact on child health.(1) The study is situated in a poor, peri-urban community in Paarl in the Drakenstein region of South Africa, 60 km outside Cape Town. Pregnant women were enrolled in the second trimester at 2 public health antenatal clinics - Newman (serving a mixed ancestry population) and Mbekweni (serving a Black African population). Women were followed through pregnancy and child birth; motherchild pairs are followed until children are at least 5 years old. All births occurred at a central public facility, Paarl hospital. Biomedical, environmental, psychosocial, and demographic risk factors are longitudinally measured. Environmental exposures (carbon monoxide, particulate matter, dust microbiome, SO2/NO2 and volatile organic compounds) were measured using monitors placed at home visits antenatally and at 4-6 months of the child's life(4); tobacco smoke exposure is investigated using urine cotinine measures. Follow-up of children is synchronized with routine primary care visits. Study visits are conducted at Paarl Hospital and at clinics, which provide a strong primary health care program including a strong HIV prevention and treatment program and immunization including 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine given at 6, 14 weeks and 9 months. An intensive cohort of infants was followed 2 weekly for the first year of life, which included 2 weekly nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, to determine colonization and microbiome patterns and association with LRTI. For the other children, NP swabs were done 6 monthly. Active surveillance for LRTI is done for hospitalized and ambulatory episodes, and all cases have a NP swab and induced sputum taken. The etiology of LRTI is investigated using a 33 multiplex PCR done on these specimens at each episode. A case control analysis is performed, matching cases with NP swabs collected from age-matched children without LRTI. In addition, PCR is done on NP samples that have been longitudinally collected to investigate the nasopharyngeal microbiome preceding LRTI. Lung function [tidal breathing measures, multiple breath washout testing, tidal exhaled nitric oxide and respiratory function using the forced oscillator technique (FOT)] is measured in unsedated children during quiet sleep at 6 weeks, annually and during LRTI episodes.(5) There were 1143 live births (4 sets of twins and 1 triplet) amongst 1137 women enrolled; all children have completed 2 years of followup, with high cohort retention and very low mortality (< 1%). The population is poor (with the Mbekweni population relatively poorer than that from Newman), mostly single mothers and 20% of mothers were HIV-infected. Rates of tobacco smoke exposure were very high, with 27% of pregnant women active smokers.(6) At birth, 56% of neonates had cotinine levels indicative of exposure, with 19% had levels of an active smoker.(6) Most infants were born full term, but 17% were premature; the median birth weight was 3 kg (7). Most (92%) of the children were breastfed but the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding (1 month) was very short. Despite high immunization coverage for the EPI schedule, including 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the incidence of LRTI was high [0.27 episodes per child year in infancy; e/cy]. The highest incidence occurred in children 1-6 months of age. Using a case control analysis, RSV, influenza virus or B. pertussis were most strongly associated with LRTI; bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus or CMV were less strongly associated.(7) RSV was the commonest pathogen identified occurring in 24% of cases. However there were several organisms identified at the time of LRTI, with a median of 5 organisms detected on NP swabs. Longitudinal analysis of NP specimens showed high rates of carriage of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis or S. aureus as well as several organism interactions up to 3 months prior to LRTI. A total of 490 children (46%) had at least one episode of wheezing in the first three years of life, with the highest prevalence in the first year; wheezing was strongly associated with LRTI. The prevalence of recurrent wheezing over this period was approximately 8%. Determinants of lung function at 6 weeks of age included infant size, sex, HIV exposure, benzene exposure or maternal smoking in pregnancy or maternal alcohol use (8). Lung function was tracked through the first 2 years of life. LRTI occurring early in childhood impaired lung function at 1 and at 2 years of age.(9) Severe LRTI requiring hospitalization or recurrent LRTI were associated with further reductions in lung function. This study provides an innovative, longitudinal assessment of a range of clinical, molecular, environmental and socioeconomic variables impacting on child lung health and the evolution of chronic disease in a low- and middle-income country setting. The study identifies new areas for potential interventions to prevent early life LRTI, impairment in lung function and evolution of chronic respiratory disease.

N2  - Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has a profound impact on health related quality of life (HRQOL). There has been no qualitative research to the explore patients' perspectives and unmet needs in SLE in sub-Saharan Africa. Objectives: To examine the experiences and perceptions of SLE women. Methods: In-depth interviews of 25 South African women with SLE were conducted to explore a range of HRQOL experiences including pain, fatigue, emotional health, sexual well-being, fertility and aesthetic concerns. Results: Most patients (72%) were black Africans, the remaining were of mixed race ancestry, and only a quarter were employed. Living with pain was the commonest complaint, negatively impacting on activities of daily living, coping with family expectations, social life, sleep and intimacy with partners. Patients struggled to explain the pain to their families, employers, community and health care providers. Seventeen participants expressed the challenge of living with fatigue, described as emotionally draining and as always tired, a person who doesn't have the energy. One patient believed that witches in church had supernatural powers that took all her energy away. Many felt their fatigue was misconstrued, and that they were labelled as 'simply lazy' by health professionals and family members. This pernicious fatigue had negative consequences on many facets of daily life, including caring for dependents, holding down steady job and sexual wellbeing. All patients experienced low emotional states ranging from anger, bitterness, anxiety, confusion, and sadness, which frequently resulted in suicidal ideation. Many patients experienced difficulties with conception, complicated pregnancies and miscarriage. The pessimism of doctors regarding the prognosis of pregnancy in SLE left many patients feeling confused and depressed. Changes in physical appearance such alopecia, rashes and weight fluctuations were also a major concern affecting self-image and libido, often leading to strained relationships and breakups. Coping mechanisms included intense spiritual beliefs giving them the courage to 'push through the difficult times'. Use of alternative therapies was common, which they believed helped contain the symptoms of SLE. These included drinking 'blessed' water, traditional herbal remedies, and soothing leaf or pressure applications to painful joints. A poor understanding of SLE by the patients themselves, family and the community, coupled with the unpredictable course of the disease, exacerbated frustration and uncertainty. For many patients, limited income, lack of basic services like public transport, dependency of family members, and comorbid diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis, exacerbated the negative daily experiences of living with SLE. Patients felt that patient-led support groups, better education by health professionals, and public awareness of SLE would help them cope with the disease. Conclusions: Indigent South African women with SLE in SA have complex, chronic and challenging life experiences. A poor understanding and acceptance of SLE by patients themselves, compounded by a background of poverty and a perception of being misunderstood by family members, health professionals and the community at large had negative impact on multiple dimensions of patient's lives.

N2  - Objective: We report here a novel approach to measure circulating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) non-invasively as a potential way to diagnose and monitor endothelial dysfunction and peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a life-threatening condition caused by arterial constriction and obstruction of blood flow leading to limb ischemia. Current methods to diagnose and monitor PAD lack sensitivity, are expensive, and technically difficult. Recent studies indicate that decreased H2S production is an underlying cause of PAD. Also, reduced plasma H2S correlates with endo-thelial dysfunction in individuals with untreated hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea and other cardiovascular diseases The TAGS device was designed to measure transdermal H2S to test the hypothesis that the diffusion rate (and therefore gas phase concentration) of H2S is directly proportional to dermal blood flow. Methods: Healthy volunteers between the ages of 21-65 were recruited. Exclusion criteria included subjects currently treated for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Smokers and pregnant women were also excluded. Results: We demonstrate that H2S can be detected in healthy volunteers (n11) at 10.8 part per billion (ppb). Interestingly, there is a positive cor-relation between age and TAGS readings in male volunteers (r0.614; n 6) and a negative correlation in female volunteers (r0.482, n5). Conclusions: The TAGS device has the potential, therefore, to serve as a more sensitive, economical, and easy to use diagnostic tool to detect H2S and predict dermal blood flow.

N2  - Aims: To assess the implications of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on long-term respiratory related hospitalizations of the offspring. Methods: A population-based cohort analysis including singleton pregnancies delivered between the years 1991 to 2014 in a tertiary referral hospital was conducted. Incidence of hospitalizations (up to age 18 years) due to various respiratory diseases was compared between offspring of GDM-complicated pregnancies and normoglycemic pregnancies. Kaplan-Meyer curves were used to assess cumulative hospitalization incidence. Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for baseline selected confounders. Results: During the study period 216,197 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 4.7% (n = 10,184) were complicated by GDM. In most of the investigated respiratory diseases, no significant differences were found between offspring of both groups. Nonetheless, obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalization rate was higher among the GDM group, an association which proved to be independent of potential confounders with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% CI 1.02–1.55; p = 0.036). Conclusion: Gestational diabetes mellitus does not appear to be associated with long-term respiratory hospitalizations of the offspring other than obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalizations.

N2  - Sex hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers at least of the humoral immunity and androgens and progesterone (and glucocorticoids) as natural immune-suppressors. Several physiological, pathological and therapeutic conditions may change the serum oestrogen milieu including the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, elderly, chronic stress, altered circadian rhythms, inflammatory cytokines, use of glucocorticoids, oral contraceptives, and steroid hormonal replacements. Cortisol and melatonin circadian rhythms are altered, at least in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and partially involve also sex hormone circadian synthesis and levels. Abnormal regulation of aromatase activity (i.e. increased activity) by inflammatory cytokines production (i,e, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) may partially explain the abnormalities of peripheral oestrogen synthesis in RA (i.e. increased availability of 17-beta estradiol and possible metabolites in synovial fluids) and in systemic lupus srythematosus (SLE). In the synovial fluids of RA patients the increased oestrogen concentration are observed in both sexes and are more specifically characterized by the hydroxylated forms, in particular 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, that is a mitogenic and cell proliferative endogenous hormone. Local effects of sex hormones in autoimmune rheumatic diseases seems to consist mainly in modulation of cell proliferation. Epidemiological evidence indicates that during the fertile age women are more often affected by rheumatic diseases than men, particularly autoimmune diseases. As a matter of fact, rheumatic disorders with autoimmune involvement such as RA or SLE, result from the combination of several predisposing factors, that include the relationships between epitopes of the trigger agent (i.e. virus), the status of the stress response system including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) and mainly the effects of the gonadal hormones (hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis - HPG). The pre-or post-menopausal serum sex hormonal status is a further factor influencing the rate of rheumatic diseases. It is therefore important, whenever possible, to evaluate epidemiologic data broken down into age (for example 10 year age band) and sex-specific group before making inferences. Obviously, sex hormones seem to play an important role as modulators of both disease onset and perpetuation and show circadian rhythms together with cortisol. Sex hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers at least of the humoral immunity and androgens and progesterone (and glucocorticoids) as natural immune-suppressors. Low concentrations of gonadal and adrenal androgens [testosterone (T)/dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate (DHEAS), respectively] levels, as well as reduced androgens/estrogens ratio, have been detected in serum and body fluids (i.e. blood, synovial fluid (SF), smears, salivary) of male and female RA patients, as well as in SLE, supporting the possible pathogenic role for the decreased levels of the immune-suppressive androgens. However, respect to serum levels of estrogens, interestingly they are not significantly changed which is in strict contrast to androgen levels in RA patients (reduced). As a matter of fact, sex hormones can exert also local actions (paracrine) in the tissues in which they are formed or enter the circulation and both T and 17-beta estradiol seem to exert dose and time-dependent effects on cell growth and apoptosis. These effects, as well as important influences on gene promoter of Th1/Th2 cytokines and the recently discovered increased SF oestrogen concentrations, might suggest new interesting roles for estrogens at least in RA. Finally estrogens exert important epigenetic actions on cell proliferation. Estrogens act as key factors in cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as cancer development and progression (prostate). The expression of oestrogen receptor (ER)-b appears to be lost during prostate cancer progression through hypermethylation mechanism. Epigenetic drugs such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZAC) and Trichostatin A (TSA) showed efficacy in restoring ERβ expression in prostate cancer cells. These observations highlights that the strategy of merging epigenetic and hormonal therapies might be beneficial also in inflammatory/autoimmune diseases (synovial tissue).

N2  - Background and aims: Among patients with Episodic Migraine (EM), 2.5% progress to Chronic Migraine (CM) over the course of one year. We herein aimed to analyze precipitating factors for CM evolution in a prospective registry of CM patients. Methods: Patients firstly attended in an outpatient headache unit in a tertiary hospital (January 2013-January 2018). They were referred from primary care or general neurology offices. CM was diagnosed accordingly to ICHD-2R and ICHD-3 criteria. We assessed demographic and clinical data, comorbidities, and risk factors. We considered in each patient latency from onset of CM to diagnosis, and if they identified any precipitating factor for CM appearance Results: We included 725 cases (105 males, 620 females), with mean age at inclusion of 40.1±13.7 years (12-80), age at onset of migraine of 19.3±9.7 years (3-65) and latency from onset of MC to diagnosis of 38.4±64.2 months (3-600). Among risk factors, we gathered other chronic pain conditions in 77 patients (10.6%), symptomatic medication overuse in 498 (68.7%), and mood disorders in 95 (13.1%). In 280 cases (38.6%), at least one precipitating factor was remembered. Stressful life events were described in 238 (32.8%). Other precipitants were weight gain (22, 3%), new-onset pain disorders (5, 0.6%), menopause, (4, 0.5%) labour (4, 0.5%) pregnancy (3, 0.4%), or sleep disturbances (3, 0.4%). New prescription medications were observed by 8 patients (1.1%), hormonal contraceptives in 4 cases Conclusion: In our MC population the identification of a precipitating factor, mainly stressful life events and weight gain, is not uncommon.

N2  - Background and aims: Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a rare X-linked syndrome characterized by psychomotor, intellectual disability and facial dysmorphic features. Nonepileptic drop episodes occur in 3-7% and epileptic seizures in 5-30%. It is unusual for a female present the classic phenotype. Methods: Case Report Results: A 21-year-old female, child of non-consanguineous Caucasian parents, with a psychomotor development delay, attention deficit and hyperactivity. The pregnancy was complicated with pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery occurred at 36 weeks. No history of CNS infections or febrile seizures was reported. When she was 3 years old, she presented multiple episodes of unprovoked sudden falls without loss of consciousness. At the age of 7, she developed daily motor seizures with nocturnal predominance. Objective examination showed craniofacial and osteoarticular dysmorphisms with tapering fingers and hyperlaxity. Cranial MRI showed enlargement of the ventricular system due to subcortical atrophy. Video-EEG recorded asymmetric tonic seizures in sleep and episodes of non-epileptic falls not external-stimulus induced. She was treated with carbamazepine, levetiracetam, zonisamide, clonazepam, with partial benefit on epileptic seizures and without any improvement in drop episodes. The karyotype (46,XX) was determined and exome sequencing analysis was performed and the variant c.1756dup (p.Ala586Glyfs∗11) was detected in heterozygous state in the RPS6KA3 gene, confirming the diagnosis of CLS. Conclusion: This report suggests that CLS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of drop attacks in the presence of the typical phenotype even among females.

N2  - Introduction Anorectal malformations (ARM) include a wide spectrum of diseases that involve the distal rectum and anus lying in an abnormal position. At one end of the spectrum there is the anterior anus and at the other end there is sirenomelia and cloacal extrophy. The most used classification system was the Wingspread classification that distinguished between high, intermediate and low anomalies. High anomalies were anorectal agenesis with rectovaginal and rectoprostaticurethral fistula and rectal atresia; intermediate malformations were rectovestibular, rectovaginal and rectobulbar-urethral fistula; low-type malformations were classified as anovestibular and anocutaneous fistula as well as anal stenosis. Cloaca and rare malformations were considered separate entities. Pena modified this classification based on the type of fistula because this was more useful in the choice of a surgical approach. The latest modification of these classifications systems is the Krickenbeck classification. This system comprises a classification system for anatomy (cutaneous fistula, rectourethral fistula, rectovesical fistula, vestibular fistula, cloaca, no fistula, anal stenosis and rare or regional variants), a classification system for operatieve procedures (perineal operation, anterior sagittal approach, PSARP, etc.) and a classification system for follow up (scoring for voluntary bowel movements, soiling and constipation). Anorectal Malformations The incidence of imperforate anus in newborns is 1:4000-5000, most frequently with a rectourethral fistula in boys and a rectovestibular fistula in girls. The incidence of imperforate anus without fistula is reported at 5%. Approximatelly half of these patients suffer from Down's syndrome, and around 38% have associated genitourinary defects. Rectoperineal fistula represents the simplest of all defects. The rectum opens in a small and stenotic orifice, located anterior to the centre of the sphincter. Most of these patients have an excellent sphincter mechanism, with the rectum and vagina usually well separated. Rectovestibular fistula is the most common female defect, clinically evident as a normal external urethral opening and vagina, with a third hole in the vestibule represented by the rectum. Approximately 10% of cases have two hemivaginas. Rectovaginal fistula is quite rare, occurring in <1% of cases, often misdiagnosed as vestibular fistula or cloaca. Rectal atresia or stenosis occurs in approximately 1% of all cases, and is the only entity in this spectrum with normal anal canal and sphincter mechanisms. ARM is frequently associated with sacral deformity, genitourinary malformations (also affecting the kidneys) and spinal cord abnormalities. High-type malformations generally show more severe associated abnormalities than low-type malformations. Persistent cloaca is the most severe type of ARM and seen exclusively in girls. It is a rare malformation with an incidence of 1:50000 and accounts for 10% of all ARM's. The rectum, urethra and vagina fail to separate and drain via a single common channel onto the perineum. The length of the common channel is 1-7 cm. A long common channel (>3 cm) is associated with complex defects. In approximately 50% of these patients, the vagina is abnormally distended by secretion (hydrocolpos). Approximately 50% of cloaca patients have a significant incidence of Müllerian anomalies and 90% of cloaca patients have associated urological abnormalities. The awareness and identification of such anomalies are an important task for the pediatric radiologist. Currarino triad and sirenomelia are rare combinations of ARM and the caudal regression syndrome. The Currarino syndrome (also known as autosomal dominant sacral agenesis) consists of (1) partial sacral defects consisting of (partial) sacral agenesis with an intact first sacral vertebra (hemisacrum or “sickle-shaped” sacrum), (2) a pre-sacral mass, including an anterior meningocele, an enteric cyst and/or a pre-sacral teratoma, and (3) congenital anal stenosis or other anorectal malformations (such as imperforate anus with/without anal fistula to the spinal cord or to the urogenital system). Sirenomelia, or the mermaid syndrome, is the most extreme example of the caudal regression syndrome. It presents with lower limb fusion, sacral and pelvic bony anomalies, absent external genitalia, imperforate anus and renal agenesis or dysgenesis. Prognosis is very poor. Finally, imperforate anus can also be a part of the spectrum cloacal extrophy/OEIS complex. Cloacal exstrophy is an extremely rare congenital malformation resulting in an exstrophy of the hemibladders with hindgut extrusion and imperforate anus. The OEIS complex (Omphalocele, Extrophy of the bladder, Imperforate anus, Spine anomalies) may represent the most severe manifestation of a spectrum of birth defects, the exstrophy-epispadias sequence. The OEIS complex affects 1 in 200,000 to 400,000 pregnancies and is of unknown cause. Imaging techniques Conventional radiographs have limited value but are not completely obsolete. Particularly in the newborn bowel dilatation and osseous abnormalities can be diagnosed while the child is still in the incubator. These findings determine short term therapy and guide additional imaging techniques. However, in a stable patient additional imaging techniques are necessary to evaluate the local anatomical and functional abnormalities. Moreover screening of the spinal cord and genitourinary tract is mandatory because there is a high incidence of associated genitourinary and spinal cord abnormalities. For this purpose fluoroscopy, ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be used. Fluoroscopy Initial treatment of some patients with anal atresia is a colostomy. Direct contrast injection (iodinated contrast medium) into the colonostomy prior to definitive second-stage reconstruction will demonstrate the level of the obstruction and also the fistula connecting to the vagina, urethra or bladder. In patients with cloacal malformations contrast injection in all accessible orifices shows the relation of urethra, vagina and rectum to a better advantage than MRI of US. Major disadvantage is the lack of visualization of surrounding soft tissue structures that are of concern of the surgeon., such as the pelvic floor musculature. Ultrasonography The overall incidence of associated anomalies in other organ systems in children with ARM is more than 60%. Routine abdominal US is mandatory to evaluate the genitourinary system because of the high incidence of abnormalities in patients with anorectal malformations. The overall incidence of urological anomalies is 52%. Also spinal dysraphism is common in children with ARM and it seems higher in patients with complex ARM. Reported incidence varies widely between 9-50%. Abnormalities include low conus medullaris, fibrolipoma of filum, intradural lipoma, hydrosyringomyelia, dermal sinus tract and meningocele. US is a good screening modality in the first week of life because at this age the relative lack of ossification facilitates the visualization of the spinal cord. Transperineal US is used as a noninvasive imaging technique for identification of a fistula and for determining the distance between the rectal pouch and the perineum. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI has the potential to combine all advantages of the abovementioned imaging techniques and is probably the best technique to evaluate the pelvic floor including the sphincter complex. MRI is able to determine the level of of ARM and the degree of maldevelopment of the sphincter muscle complex and to visualize associated anomalies of the spinal cord, spine and urogenital system. Sequences include T1- and T2-weighted images of the pelvic region with the coronal plane perpendicular and the transverse plane parallel to the pelvic floor. T2-weighted fatsat images may improve visualisation of fistula. The choice of an appropriate FOV and dedicated coil is important. MRI is feasible without the need for sedation in children up to 3 months of age when performed immediately after feeding. Usually these newborn infants fall into a deep sleep after a meal and this effect can be enhanced by some sleep- and food deprivation prior to the meal.Unfortunateley this protocol fails after the age of 3-6 months. Older infants and preschool children usually need sedation for dedicated MRI examinations. Conclusion Anorectal malformations are frequently associated with a lifelong debilitating sequelae such as fecal and urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. During the last decades significant advances have occurred in the surgical management of anorectal malformations. It is the task of the pediatric radiologist to supply the surgeon with optimal anatomical and functional information for planning surgery according to the Krickenbeck criteria.

N2  - Purpose: There have been relatively few studies investigating the effect of time of day on alcohol induced performance decrements although time of administration has been shown to impact sleep (Roehrs et al 1992). Straw polls amongst students suggest thatmorning administration may have a greater impairing effect than more usual late afternoon and early evening consumption. The aims of this preliminary study were to compare the effect of morning/am (09:00) and late afternoon/pm (17:00) alcohol administration on performance. Methods: Sixteen healthy young adult student volunteers (11 female) aged 18-22 years (mean 20.1; SD 1.5) with a BMI between 18 and 25 and an AUDIT score not greater than 8, not pregnant or liable to be pregnant and not taking medication that may interact with alcohol took part in the study. They abstained from alcohol for aminimum of 12 h screened with breathalyser, caffeine for 4 h but having consumed a light meal within an before at the start of each assessment session. Alcohol was administered as 6 9 1 unit drinks of vodka 40%ABV (25 mL/unit) combined with 155 mL of orange juice compared to 180 mL orange juice for the placebo consumed as 3 doubles separated by 20 min intervals, whilst both drinks had alcohol smeared around the rim to aid placebo masking and administered double blind. Assessments after each of the 3 doubles included the biphasic alcohol effects scale (BAES) and performancemeasures of attention (RVIP, visual search: VS), inhibition (stop signal task: SST) andmemory (serial 7 s: S7). Results: Breath alcohol for am and pm administration averaged 80+/-3 mg/100 mL with greater increase in stimulation reported with alcohol and amadministration, whilst sedation increased across drinks uninfluenced by administration time. Alcohol increased SST and S7 errors with greatest errors after the final ambut not pm drink. Conversely, visual search errors were impacted by alcohol with pm administration but slower am reaction time, though greater RVIP errors were again seen in the morning following alcohol. Conclusion: This preliminary study has demonstrated some interesting results with the higher levels of alcohol (80 mg/100 mL) producing a greater effect on subjective stimulation and significant performance decrements that were generally greatest following morning administration.

Methods: Forty women with new-onset hypertension of pregnancy and 60 age-matched normotensive pregnant women were subjected to polysomnography. The maternal and fetal outcomes of all the subjects were noted. Results: SDB occurs more frequently (p = 0.018; OR 13.1) and with more severity (p 0.001; OR 1.8) in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy even after controlling for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, the BMI significantly correlated with both the Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI; r = 0.745; p < 0.001) and the blood pressure (r = 0.617; p < 0.001) highlighting the contribution of obesity in the causation of hypertension and SDB. We also found a significant correlation between AHI and blood pressure even after adjustment for BMI pointing toward an independent role of SDB in the development of hypertension (r = 0.612; p = 0.01). Maternal and fetal complications significantly correlated with different parameters of SDB–AHI, Arousal Index and minimum oxygen saturation, in the cases and with the fetal complications in the controls as well. Conclusion: SDB occurs more frequently and with more severity in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and is associated with more severe preeclampsia and adverse feto-maternal outcomes.

N2  - Background: Due to the high prevalence in pregnant women and potential association with pregnancy complications or perinatal outcomes, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has become an increasing concern. Methods: Pubmed and Embase were retrieved from inception until 2017 to conduct a meta-analysis to explore the association of SDB and several outcomes during gestation. A stratified analysis differentiated by the type of SDB [snoring alone/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)] was also performed. Pooled odds ratios were produced for binary outcomes. Weighted mean differences were also produced for continuous outcomes. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the impact of individual studies on summary results and estimation of publication bias was performed by funnel plot. Results: 35 studies with a total of 56,751,837 subjects were included. SDB during pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), and preeclampsia (PEC), but not significantly associated with fetal maternal outcomes, namely APGAR score and birth weight. Moreover, OSA was linked with an increasing risk of GDM, PIH, PEC and preterm birth while snoring appeared to increase the risk of GDM, PIH, and PEC. Conclusion: The finding provided potential evidence for association between SDB and adverse perinatal outcomes. SDB increased the risk of some pregnancy complications while its influence to fetal outcomes was not clear.

N2  - Postpartum depression has become an important topic of concern in recent years. However, very few studies on the causes of postpartum depression exist, and the effects of prenatal sleep disorders on the development of postpartum depression among pregnant women have not been elucidated. This study aimed to understand the association between prenatal sleep disorders and postpartum depression. The National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan (between 2000 and 2010) was used to assess the effects of prenatal sleep disorder on the risk of postpartum depression using Cox regression analyses. Prenatal sleep disorder in pregnant women increased the risk of developing postpartum depression (the risk in the sleep disorder cases was 5.359-fold increased compared with control cases). In addition, regardless of postpartum week (≤ 6 weeks, 6-12 weeks, or > 12weeks), the risk of developing postpartum depression in pregnant women with prenatal sleep disorders were increased, by 5.461-fold (P < 0.001), 3.490-fold (P = 0.010), and 3.416-fold (P = 0.015), respectively, compared with pregnant women without sleep disorders. Pregnant women with prenatal sleep disorders exhibited increased risks of developing postpartum depression. For pregnant women with prenatal sleep disorder, postpartum intervention measures should be provided as early as possible to reduce the risk of developing postpartum depression.

N2  - Fetal pain and fetal anesthesia are still matter of debate: some authors hypothesize that several intrauterine endocrine neuroinhibitors (ENIn) anesthetize the fetus, keeping it in a constant state of sleep, and making pharmacological fetal anesthesia useless for fetal surgery, while others argue fetal pain is possible and shoud be prevented with fetal anesthesy. Aim: To retrieve evidences about fetal pain, fetal arousability and about the level of sedation induced by the ENIn, in order to assess the necessity of direct fetal anesthesia during prenatal fetal surgery. Methods: We performed a careful literature review (1990–2016) on fetal arousability, and on the possibility that ENIn at the average fetal blood levels induce actual anesthesia. We retrieved the papers that fulfilled the research criteria, with particular attention to the second half of pregnancy, the period when most fetal surgery is performed. Results: Fetuses are awake about 10% of the total time in the last gestational weeks, and they can be aroused by external stimuli. ENIn have not an anesthetic effect at normal fetal values, but only when they areartificialy injected at high doses; their blood levels in the last trimester of average pregnancies are not dissimilar either in the fetus or in the mother. Conclusions: During the second half of the pregnancy, external stimuli can awake the fetuses, although they spend most of the time in sleeping state; the presence of ENIn is absolutely not enough to guarantee an effective anesthesia during surgery. Thus, direct fetal analgesia/anesthesia is mandatory, though further studies on its possible drawbacks are necessary.

N2  - Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in pregnancy, but there are limited data on predictors. Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop predictive models of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy. Study Design: Nulliparous women completed validated questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to snoring, fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome. The questionnaires included questions regarding the timing of sleep and sleep duration, work schedules (eg, shift work, night work), sleep positions, and previously diagnosed sleep disorders. Frequent snoring was defined as self-reported snoring ≥3 days per week. Participants underwent in-home portable sleep studies for sleep-disordered breathing assessment in early (6–15 weeks gestation) and mid pregnancy (22–31 weeks gestation). Sleep-disordered breathing was characterized by an apnea hypopnea index that included all apneas, plus hypopneas with ≥3% oxygen desaturation. For primary analyses, an apnea hypopnea index ≥5 events per hour was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for predictor variables. Predictive ability of the logistic models was estimated with area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves, along with sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios. Results: Among 3705 women who were enrolled, data were available for 3264 and 2512 women in early and mid pregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%, respectively. At each time point in gestation, frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, greater maternal age, body mass index, neck circumference, and systolic blood pressure were associated most strongly with an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Logistic regression models that included current age, body mass index, and frequent snoring predicted sleep-disordered breathing in early pregnancy, sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy, and new onset sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy with 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves of 0.870, 0.838, and 0.809. We provide a supplement with expanded tables, integrated predictiveness, classification curves, and an predicted probability calculator. Conclusion: Among nulliparous pregnant women, logistic regression models with just 3 variables (ie, age, body mass index, and frequent snoring) achieved good prediction of prevalent and incident sleep-disordered breathing. These results can help with screening for sleep-disordered breathing in the clinical setting and for future clinical treatment trials.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition that has been proven to have significant effects on the human body. This study is a pilot study in our State that will seek to identify the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy in New Mexico. Methods: One hundred women in our rural outreach perinatal clinics were given the Berlin questionnaire in order to determine how many of them have symptoms of OSA. Maternal demographics including age, weight, height, and gestational age were analyzed. T tests were used for continuous variables, chi-square for dichot-omous variables, and logistic regression analysis to assess for correlation. Results: Eighty four patients successfully completed the question-naire. Sixteen questionnaires were not completed or were missing vital information. The mean age was 30.49 years, the mean height was 1.61 m (SD 0.06 m), the mean weight was 81.51 kg (SD 20.05), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31.44 (SD 8.18). In our sample, 26 women (30.9%) had a positive OSA screen. Unexpectedly, there was no correlation between the number of positive screening questions and BMI, (correlation coefficient, r=0.29), or between maternal age and BMI (r=0.10). Conclusion: In a high risk pregnancy clinics in New Mexico, around 30% of obese, pregnant women had symptoms consistent with OSA at around 20 weeks of gestation. This study provides researchers cause to further investigate the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy in New Mexico and, subsequently, its impact on the mother and fetus.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy can lead to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), gestational diabetes (GDMA) and preterm birth. Polysomnography screening is "gold standard" for OSA but can be logistically challenging and not cost-effective. In this study, we will investigate simple screening tools such as the Berlin (BQ) and STOP-BANG questionnaires (SBQ) for OSA in pregnancy. Methods: We screened 169 pregnant women using the BQ and SBQ in the third trimester. A chart review was performed for primary outcomes: pre-eclampsia, IUGR and GDMA. Secondary outcomes were gestational age at time of delivery, Apgars, and birth weight. Demographics such as age, race, BMI, gravidity and smoking history were also reviewed. Results: Of the 169 women who participated in the study, 58 women(34.3%) were screened as high risk on the SBQ. Of these, 34.5% were subsequently diagnosed with pre-eclampsia(p5,0.01), 22.4% with GDMA(p=0.098), and 8.6% with IUGR(p=0.743). Of the 80 women(47.3%) who screened high risk on the BQ, 30% were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia(p5,0.01), 21.3% with GDMA(p5,0.01) and 7.5% with IUGR(p=0.929). Rate of preterm births were significantly higher in both BSQ and BQ high risk group at 29.3% and 26.3%, respectively(p5,0.01). No significant difference was noted in demographics. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea is a modifiable risk factor that can be screened at time of first prenatal care visit, using the STOPBANG and Berlin questionnaires. Identifying and treating those with OSA early in pregnancy may lead to a decreased risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and subsequent preterm deliveries.

N2  - Purpose: This research was conducted to determine the effects of sleep hygiene training given to pregnant women with restless leg syndrome on their sleep quality. Methods: This study was conducted using a quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test, and a control group. When the power analysis was made, a sample size with 5% two-sided significance, 95% confidence interval, and 95% ability to represent the population was calculated to have a total of 128 pregnant women. The sleeping hygiene training was given to two sessions of the experiment group. A personal identification form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used for the collection of data. Percentage distribution, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and chi-square were used for statistical evaluation in addition to dependent and independent groups t tests. Results: PSQI pre-test mean values revealed that sleep quality in both groups was similarly poor (p = 0.353). It was determined that the mean post-test score after sleep hygiene training was 7.23 ± 2.17 in the experiment group and 10.54 ± 2.20 in the control group, while the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.000). Accordingly, it was determined that the sleepers in the experimental group had better sleep quality than those in the control group. Conclusions: Sleep hygiene training given to pregnant women with restless leg syndrome increased sleep quality.

N2  - Introduction: Nearly 40% of US women of childbearing age are obese. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with multiple risks for both the woman and fetus, yet clinicians often feel unprepared to provide optimal antepartum care for this group of women. We collected and reviewed current evidence concerning antepartum care of women who are obese during pregnancy. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines. Current evidence relating to the pregnancy care of women with a prepregnancy body mass index of 30kg/m2 or higher was identified using MEDLINE databases via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection between January 2012 and February 2018. Results: A total of 354 records were located after database searches, of which 63 met inclusion criteria. Topic areas for of included studies were: pregnancy risk and outcomes related to obesity, communication between women and health care providers, gestational weight gain and activity/diet, diabetic disorders, hypertensive disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, mental health, pregnancy imaging and measurement, late antepartum care, and preparation for labor and birth. Discussion: Midwives and other health care providers can provide better antepartum care to women who are obese during pregnancy by incorporating evidence from the most current clinical investigations.

N2  - Background: Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological option to relieve pregnancy-related complaints. Objectives: To critically appraise the best available evidence for the use of acupuncture in outpatient care. Search strategy: The MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases were searched for English-language and German-language papers published from January 1980 to March 2017 using search terms related to pregnancy combined with ‘acupuncture’. Selection criteria: Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-pharmacological treatments in unselected or low-risk pregnant women. Data collection and analysis: Quality was assessed using a checklist (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were also performed. Main results: High-quality systematic reviews (n=5) and RCTs with low risk of bias (n=3) were identified. The systematic reviews were based on single studies, with small sample sizes, that showed a benefit of acupuncture for evening pelvic pain; pelvic and low-back pain; nausea; functional disability; and sleep quality. Contradictory results were found in the RCTs regarding cesarean delivery; time to delivery; spontaneous labor; fetal distress; and Apgar score. Data pooling emphasized the heterogeneity of results. Conclusions: Evidence to support the use of acupuncture for relief of pregnancy-related conditions was limited.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate relationships among obesity in pregnancy and plasma levels of tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenine (KYN), inflammatory markers, and depressed mood. METHODS: Pregnant women ( N = 374) were enrolled, and data were collected at a mean gestation of 20 weeks in this cross-sectional study. Plasma was analyzed for TRP, KYN, neopterin, and nitrite levels. Women completed demographic and mood scales. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TRP and positive correlations between BMI and KYN and the kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio. Neopterin was correlated with KYN/TRP, suggesting that the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) enzyme was activated. The correlations of neopterin and nitrite with BMI were too small to be clinically meaningful but may provide mechanistic insight. There was a correlation between depressed mood and nitrite levels. Depressed mood was also associated with lower TRP levels. When the sample was divided into pregnant women with or without obesity, TRP was significantly lower and the KYN/TRP ratio was significantly higher in the women with obesity. CONCLUSION: The pro-inflammatory state of obesity in pregnancy may drive activation of IDO-1, resulting in diversion of TRP away from serotonin and melatonin production and toward KYN metabolites. This alteration could contribute to depression, impaired sleep, increased production of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, and reinforcement of a pro-inflammatory state in pregnancy.

N2  - Maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) has been suggested to be associated with increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in both humans and animal models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is still unclear. We have recently reported that MSD at different stages of pregnancy impairs the emotional and cognitive functions, and suppresses hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) in the offspring rats. Here, we report that the MSD induced LTP impairment at the CA1 hippocampus of the offspring rats is associated with increased long-term depression (LTD) and reduced expression of postsynaptic GluA2-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Importantly, we found that inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis by a synthetic peptide Tat-GluA23Y (3 μmol/kg, i.p.) not only increased level of AMPARs and reduced LTD, but also restored LTP. Moreover, treatment with Tat-GluA23Y peptide markedly alleviated the MSD-induced impairments of spatial learning and memory; and decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring. Together, our findings suggest that the MSD-induced postsynaptic AMPAR endocytosis causally contributes to the impairments of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, thereby disrupting the emotional and cognitive functions in the offspring.

N2  - Endometriosis, with an incidence of 10% in women of childbearing age, is more common than often thought and is considered to be a chronic disease. Symptoms can express themselves as early as menarche and change in character over time. In order to prevent chronic pelvic pain, adequate treatment of the causes of endometriosis and the resulting pain are essential to avoid impairment in quality of life. The focus of therapy is on stress, sleep disorders, relationship problems, and anxiety. If psychiatric diagnoses already exist, special attention should be paid to depression and anxiety disorders. Because the most appropriate therapy can change over time, depending on the life situation and current symptoms, women with endometriosis often need to be accompanied by an interdisciplinary team. In this article, we discuss the important aspects that should be considered to maintain a high quality of life for patients with endometriosis.

N2  - Background: Nearly 1 in 5 women will have an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, yet the risk factors for these problems are not well understood. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify risk factors of both new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during pregnancy and the first year postpartum. Methods: Published articles in PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ovid Portal, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science Portal were searched from their inceptions to September 2017. Studies assessing risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety (defined as anxiety occurring in women without a pre-existing anxiety disorder), and anxiety worsening (worsening of symptoms in women with pre-existing anxiety disorders), were eligible. Results: A total of 11,759 studies were identified, with 11 meeting our eligibility criteria. Prenatal oxytocin exposure (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.31-1.58), poorer educational attainment (OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.17-3.03), comorbid sleep disorders (OR=1.98, 95% CI=1.10-3.59), and a family history of OCD (OR=20.45, 95% CI=5.90-70.91) were significant predictors of new onset anxiety, while prenatal oxytocin exposure (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.26-1.79) and comorbid psychiatric disorders (OR=2.83, 95% CI=1.39-5.76) were risk factors for worsening. Conclusions: While a range of factors predicted new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening, prenatal oxytocin exposure was a significant factor of both. This particular finding may contribute to the current body of knowledge on the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders occurring in the perinatal period. Additional research is required in order to further investigate these risk factors and to determine whether they differ from non-puerperal populations.

N2  - Background Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a noninvasive peripheral stimulation technique used to relieve pain utilizing the “Gate Control Theory”. It generates electric currents, delivered across intact skin via adhesive electrode pads, activating underlying nerves. Systemic reviews have focused on short-term efficacy with variable and inconclusive results due to poor methodology and small sample size. A recent meta-analysis of RCT's by Johnson (2014) demonstrates strong evidence for the use of TENS for musculoskeletal and post-operative pain, and moderate evidence for neuropathic pain. Aims We conducted an audit as a clinical governance project to investigate the effectiveness of TENS for long-term use in patients with various types of chronic pain. Methods 100 consecutive adult patients with miscellaneous pain types of greater than 3 months duration were recruited in our nurse practitioner-led pain management clinic. Appropriate user instructions were given to patients, including application of high-frequency conventional TENS and low-frequency acupuncture-like TENS, with treatment duration of 1-1.5 h and 15-30 min respectively. Patients with cardiac pacemaker, epilepsy, pregnancy, and skin condition, ischaemic tissue or thrombosis over the application site were excluded. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months by telephone, face-to-face in clinic or by posts. Acceptance of any significant clinical benefits were defined by a reduction of visual analogue or numerical rating scale for pain of equal to or greater than 2, as well as record of benefits gained from easing of pain when performing activities of daily living, reduction in medication and improvement of sleep pattern. results 100 adult patients were recruited (72 females and 28 males). At 1 month-63 (63%) patients found TENS beneficial; the remainder found no benefit or discontinued TENS for various reasons. At 3 months-53 (53%) found TENS beneficial; the remainder no longer experienced benefit after 3 months' use or discontinued TENS for other reasons. At 6 months-a further 7 patients dropped out due to having no further benefit or other reasons. However, 46 (46%) patients continued to use TENS as it remained beneficial to them. At 12 months-with such period of long-term use, a significant number of patients (40 = 40%) remained who continued to find TENS beneficial. conclusion The results demonstrate that a significant number of patients with chronic pain continue to find benefit from the TENS at 12 months. This audit lends support for our continuing provision of TENS therapy as a useful option in our pain management clinic. Moreover, TENS is a safe and inexpensive tool to manage pain independently with few side effects.

N2  - Background: Osteitis condensans ilii refers to an increase in bone density (sclerosis) located on the inferomedial aspect of the ilium adjacent to the sacroiliac joint. It is often bilateral, symmetric, and triangular. It is a rare condition of benign cause of axial low back pain. The reason remains unknown since it is first described in 1926. Typically affects females following pregnancy, but males and nulliparous females have also been reported. Objectives: Describe diagnostic process and management of OCI as a rare condition of low back pain. Compare the findings with the available data from literature. Method: 29 years old woman presents with lower back pain and polyarthralgia without a history of trauma or injuries. She is an office worker and the condition affects her daily life activities and disturbs her night sleep. Finds it particularly difficult to lie flat and get in and out of bed. No other comorbidities recorded. Clinically: Paraspinal and midline tenderness at L4/L5 levels, Good spinal flexion, neurovascular intact. Hip examination unremarkable. Distraction, Compression FABER and Gaenslen's test for sacroiliac joints were positive. Radiology findings demonstrate sclerotic area, adjacent to Left SIJ with a triangular shape. MRI scan of the whole spine and pelvis demonstrated finding of syrinx from T5 to the termination of spinal cord and OCI lesion. Laboratory studies demonstrated: Vit D and B12 deficiency, Subclinical hyperthyroidism, Normal CRP and ESR and Rh factor. Further testing for HLA antigen is performed. Discussion: OCI is a rare cause of lower back pain. History, examination, XR and MRI are diagnostic standards. Other spine pathology must be ruled out. Further laboratory tests are also required to distinguish this idiopathic condition from ankylosing spondylitis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, metastatic disease or sacroiliitis. The condition could represent a diagnostic challenge in patients with polyarthralgia.

N2  - Background: Chronic inflammatory diseases, collectively known as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), pose the greatest threat to human health globally1. All of these conditions have their 'origins' in early life, and there is a pressing need to understand how the modern environment is contributing to this unsustainable health burden2. The ORIGINS study is a collaborative project between Joondalup Health Campus (JHC) and Telethon Kids Institute (TKI) undertaken in a community setting which aims to: 1) To improve the health of the next generation through a better understanding of how to optimise the early environment, early intervention and personalized medicine by developing a robust biobank and databank. 2) To initiate and integrate harmonised nested clinical trials within this framework. 3) To understand the interaction of newly recognised exposures, such as the gut microbiome and utilise new technologies (such as epigenetics, metagenomics, metabolomics, proteomics) to further this field of research. Method: The project commenced in November 2016 and aims to recruit 10,000 women and their partners over a 5 year period early in pregnancy and follow their child for 5 years. We are collecting biological samples, routine data and web-based questionnaires on their physical and mental health, diet, physical activity patterns, sleep, electronic use and a range of factors in their environment, creating a large biobank and databank repository. A key point of difference from many cohorts, is our extended focus on diverse and creative interventions that positively change the 'exposome' -to explore wider protective and buffering factors that enhance resilience and reduce allostatic load, such as building nature relatedness, interpersonal relationships, purpose, mindfulness and positive emotions. Outcome: Currently we have recruited 1000 families into the ORIGINS project and running 5 nested studies, which will be described looking at the origins of allergy, neurodevelopmental disorders, obesity and paternal health. We have developed strong partnerships with the Joondalup and Wanneroo communities, government, clinical services, researchers and academic institutions. We have integrated research into clinical care and provide real time feed back of developmental and allergy outcomes to parents. We have secured long term core funding over 10 years from the federal government and a philanthropic organisation the Paul Ramsay Foundation. Conclusion: Developing a new community birth cohort with an emphasis on pregnancy and the early years with real time feed back and having nested clinical trials provides a novel way to develop future cohorts with the ability to increase research capacity, productivity, collaboration and translational impact on future generations. We also anticipate flow-on benefits for community cohesion and purpose, which will provide a sentinel example for tailored replication in other communities around the world -as part of interconnected grass-root strategies to restore global health.

N2  - Introduction: The vast majority of childhood weight gain and obesity prevention interventions included a mix of both normal weight and overweight children, e.g. in school settings. Only about 1/4 of these previous interventions were effective in reducing weight gain, and studies have proposed, that the positive effect of these interventions were restricted to those already overweight, or to those children who were at high-risk for obesity, rather than to the normal weight children. The objective of the Healthy Start primary prevention RCT was to examine if excessive weight and fat gain can be prevented among normal weight, but obesity susceptible children aged 2-6 years. Methods: Children were identified from public registries and considered at high risk for future obesity if they either had a high birth weight, maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, or maternal low educational level. Subsequently, all children were randomized into the intervention group, or the control group. Trained project staff took anthropometric measurements at baseline and follow-up. All overweight children were excluded from subsequent analysis (n = 92), while all normal weight children were included (n = 543). The intervention aimed to deliver improvement in diet and activity habits, optimization of sleep quantity and quality and reduction of stress in the family. Average intervention period was 1.3 years, and drop-out rate was 49%. Per protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were conducted, adjusting for gender and age. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed a lower gain in %-fat mass (β = -1.96 (95% CI -3.69;-0.23, p = 0.03)) and a higher gain in fat free mass (β = 0.35 (95% CI 0.01;0.69, p = 0.05)) in the intervention group compared to the control group, but non-significant differences in BMI z-score gains (p = 0.29). Conclusion: This primary weight gain prevention intervention among young normal weight children at high risk of future obesity suggested improved development in growth and body composition after the 15 months intervention.

N2  - PURPOSE: The average Australian working week in middle-aged and older workers exceeds government recommendations. Long working weeks are associated with poor health outcomes; however, the relationship between long working weeks and health in young Australian workers is unknown.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the 22-year follow-up of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study in Perth, Western Australia. Information was available from 873 young adults about working hours per week, shift work and sleep duration. Blood samples provided measures of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors.
RESULTS: Almost one-third (32.8%) of young workers reported > 38 h working weeks. This was commonly reported in mining and construction industries for males; health and social assistance, mining and retail trade industries for females. CMR factors including increased waist circumference, higher fasting plasma glucose and reduced HDL cholesterol were associated with > 38 h working weeks. These relationships were not moderated by gender or by BMI for glucose and HDL cholesterol. Total sleep time was significantly lower in both male and female workers reporting > 38 h working weeks, but did not mediate the relationships seen with CMR factors.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to early associations between > 38 h working weeks and CMR risk, and highlight the potential benefit of making young employees aware of the health associations with working arrangements to reduce the longer-term relationships seen with working hours and poor cardiometabolic health in population studies.

N2  - The objective of this study was to develop a shared-care model to enable primary-care physicians to participate more fully in meeting the complex, multidisciplinary healthcare needs of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: The design consisted of development of consensus recommendations and a shared-care algorithm. Participants: A working group of 11 Canadian neurologists involved in the management of patients with MS were included in this study. Main message: The clinical management of patients with multiple sclerosis is increasing in complexity as new disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) become available, and ongoing safety monitoring is required. A shared-care model that includes primary care physicians is needed. Primary care physicians can assist in the early detection of MS of individuals presenting with neurological symptoms. Additional key roles for family physicians are health promotion, symptom management, and safety and relapse monitoring of DMT-treated patients. General principles of health promotion include counseling MS patients on maintaining a healthy lifestyle; performing standard screening measures; and identifying and treating comorbidities. Of particular importance are depression and anxiety, which occur in >20% of MS patients. Standard work-ups and treatments are needed for common MS-related symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, spasticity, and sleep disorders. Ongoing safety monitoring is required for patients receiving specific DMTs. Multiple sclerosis medications are generally contraindicated during pregnancy, and patients should be counseled to practice effective contraception. Conclusions: Multiple sclerosis is a complex, disabling illness, which, similar to other chronic diseases, requires ongoing multidisciplinary care to meet the evolving needs of patients throughout the clinical course. Family physicians can play an invaluable role in maintaining general health, managing MS-related symptoms and comorbidities, monitoring for treatment-related adverse effects and MS relapses, and coordinating allied health services to ensure continuity of care to meet the complex and evolving needs of MS patients through the disease course.

N2  - Aims.: Maternal mental disorders have been associated with the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Within the context of a mother–child cohort, we examined whether maternal anxiety, depression and sleep disorders are associated with pre-school ADHD symptoms. Methods.: The study included 3634 singletons from the Italian NINFEA (Nascita e INFanzia: gli Effetti dell'Ambiente’) cohort. Maternal doctor-diagnosed anxiety, depression and sleep disorders before and during pregnancy were assessed from the questionnaires completed during pregnancy and 6 months after delivery. Mothers rated child ADHD symptoms at 4 years of age, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Hyperactive–impulsive (ADHD-H), inattentive (ADHD-I) and total ADHD scores were analysed in the models adjusted for child's gender, first-born status, maternal age, education, alcohol consumption and smoking during pregnancy. Results.: The total ADHD score at age 4 was associated with maternal lifetime anxiety (17.1% percentage difference in score compared with never; 95% CI 7.3–27.9%), sleep disorders (35.7%; 95% CI 10.7–66.5%) and depression (17.5%; 95% CI 3.2–33.8%). Similar positive associations were observed also for ADHD-H and ADHD-I traits, with slightly attenuated associations between maternal sleep disorders and child ADHD-I score, and maternal depression and both ADHD scores. All the estimates were enhanced when the disorders were active during pregnancy and attenuated for disorders active only during the pre-pregnancy period. Conclusions.: Maternal anxiety, depression and sleep disorders are associated with a relative increase in the number of ADHD-H, ADHD-I and total ADHD symptoms in preschoolers.

N2  - Study Objectives: To measure prevalence and severity of third trimester obstructive sleep apnea and evaluate postpartum resolution. To assess a novel biomarker for screening for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy. Methods: This prospective observational study was performed at Wake Forest School of Medicine obstetrics clinics between April 2014 and December 2015. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurements and sleep studies were obtained and compared at 32 0/7 to 35 6/7 weeks gestation and postpartum. Exhaled nitric oxide and risk factors for the development of gestational sleep apnea were evaluated for predictive ability independently and in screening models. Results: Of 76 women enrolled, 73 performed valid sleep studies in pregnancy and 65 had an additional valid study 6 to 15 weeks postpartum. Twenty-four women (37%) had gestational sleep apnea compared with 23 (35%) with postpartum sleep apnea (P >.99). Eight of 11 women (73%) retested 6 to 8 months postpartum had persistent sleep apnea. Exhaled nitric oxide had moderate discrimination screening for sleep apnea in pregnancy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.64). A model utilizing exhaled nitric oxide, pregnancy-specific screening, and Mallampati score improved ability to identify women at risk for gestational sleep apnea (sensitivity = 46%, specificity = 91% and likelihood ratio = 5.11, area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.75). Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is common in the early postpartum period and often persisted at least 6 months. Exhaled nitric oxide as a sole biomarker to screen for sleep apnea in pregnancy has only modest discrimination. Combined with additional parameters sensitivity and specificity improved.

N2  - Background: In low-resource settings, a significant proportion of fetal, neonatal, and maternal deaths can be attributed to intrapartum-related complications. Certain risk factors, such as non-cephalic presentation, have a particularly high risk of complications. This qualitative study describes experiences around non-cephalic births and highlights existing perceptions and care-seeking behavior specific to non-cephalic presentation in rural Sarlahi District, Nepal. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 34 individuals, including women who recently gave birth to a non-cephalic infant and female decision-makers in their households. We also conducted two focus groups with mothers (have two or more children, with at least one child under age five) and two focus groups with grandmothers in the community. Results: Several women described scenes of obstructed labor and practices like provision of unspecified injections early in labor to assist with the delivery. There were reports of arduous care-seeking processes from primary health centers to tertiary facilities, and mixed quality of care among home birth attendants and facility-based health workers respectively. Very few women were aware of the fetal presentation prior to delivery, and we identified no consistent understanding among participants of the risks of and care strategies for non-cephalic births. Risk perception around non-cephalic presentation varied widely. Some participants were acutely aware of potential dangers, while others had not heard of non-cephalic birth. Many interviewees said that the position in which a pregnant woman sleeps could impact the fetal position. Several participants had either taken or heard of medication intended to rotate the fetus into the correct position. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the mixed quality of and access to care associated with non-cephalic birth and a lack of consistent understanding of the risk of and care for non-cephalic births in rural Nepal. The high risk of the condition and the recommended tertiary care present a dilemma in low-resource settings; the logistical difficulties and the mixed quality of care make care-seeking and referral decisions complex. While public health stakeholders strive to improve the quality of and access to the formal health system, those players must also be sensitive to the potential negative implications of promoting institutional care-seeking.

N2  - Postpartum women sleep less during the early days following delivery. Long-term sleep disturbance and fatigue can have significant implications for physical and mental health, relationships, employment and parental competence. Most studies focus on the quality and quantity of maternal sleep between weeks one and six postpartum. We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery. Thirty first-time mothers completed a postnatal sleep questionnaire, detailing their total sleep time (TST), the reasons for being awake and their level of fatigue. The logs were completed in real time during the first 48 h postpartum, while they were still in a hospital environment. The data collected from the mothers in the study indicated that the mean TST in the first 48 h was 9.7 h. Of the factors explored only breastfeeding influenced the TST. Breastfeeding women slept on average 2.6 h longer than women who bottle-fed (p =.042).Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject: Childbearing affects women’s sleep in many ways. Hormonal changes during pregnancy and postpartum as well as physiological and anatomical alterations, and the process of adaptation to the new parent’s responsibilities contribute to changes in sleep architecture. Since first study of sleep and pregnancy published in 1968 there have been very few publications addressing maternal sleep postpartum. Most studies which have focussed on quality of maternal sleep in the first 6-months postpartum period describe the relationships between poor maternal sleep and postpartum depression and other mental health outcomes. What the results of this study add: We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery while they remained in the hospital environment. We found that environmental factors such as background noise, shared rooms, type of delivery, feeding and worrying about the neonate did not influence the total sleep time, however, the main outcome of our study is that breastfeeding promotes maternal sleep. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that this study would be of interest to many obstetricians, general practitioners, nurses and midwives as well as to the general public. Appropriate counselling of patients early in postnatal period can improve their sleep patterns and reduce the risk of depression and other abnormal physical, psychological and social outcomes.

N2  - Postpartum Depression Disorder (PDD) is one of the most recent major depressive episodes, many of which begin with symptoms during pregnancy and become more intense after childbirth. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of biological rhythms and sleep quality in the prediction of PDD. The research method was descriptive-correlational. The statistical population of this study included all women with PDD who referred to health centers of Talesh city (Iran) in the second half of 2016. A total of 110 women were selected through purposive sampling and responded to the Biological rhythms interview, Pittsburgh’s Sleep Quality Questionnaires and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Data was analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that postpartum depression has a positive correlation with the disturbance of biological rhythms and sleep problems. The results of regression analysis also showed that biological rhythms and sleep quality predict 44% and 43% of postpartum depression in women under study. These results indicate that disturbance in biological rhythms and sleep, arose at postpartum period, may be a major risk factor for postpartum depression.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Background - Gestational obstructive sleep apnea (GOSA) is associated with increased risk of maternal and fetal morbidities. GOSA has gained increasing attention as these morbidities may be preventable by identifying risk factors for GOSA. There may be multiple risk factors which may not be applicable to all trimesters of pregnancy due to its dynamic nature. At present, no screening tool has been validated to identify patients with high-risk OSA during pregnancy1. Objective: We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors associated with high-risk OSA during pregnancy. METHODS: The analysis was planned in accordance with the MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guideline for non-randomized studies. A literature search of Medline, Medline In-process, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL up to October 2017 was conducted. The search was restricted to (1) cohort controlled studies in adult pregnant population who were screened as high-risk OSA or diagnosed as OSA by polysomnography; (2) All included studies in the English language must report at least one risk factor (i.e.; either demographic, medical comorbidity or symptomatic risk factor) for both OSA and non-OSA patients. Studies not satisfying the inclusion criteria were excluded. Odds ratios and weighted Mean Differences (MD) were calculated for each risk factor. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale Scoring system. Statistical analysis was conducted using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Twelve comparative studies were included in the final analysis (n=7,232 patients; OSA vs. non-OSA: 1,266 vs. 5,966) (Table 1). The prevalence of OSA during pregnancy in this meta-analysis was 17%. Patients were from II and III trimesters of pregnancy. Among the demographic questionnaires, we identified that prepregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI) (MD: 5.9; 95% CI: 2.3 - 9.4; I2: 95%; P=0.001), BMI during pregnancy (MD: 6.8; 95% CI: 2.3 - 11.3; I2: 88%; P=0.003), weight during pregnancy (MD: 16.0; 95% CI: 1.5 - 30.5; I2: 93%; P=0.03), and neck circumference (NC) (MD: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.0 - 4.5; I2: 93%; P<0.00001) were the important risk factors associated with GOSA. Among the comorbidities, the risk factors were hypertension (OR: 3.18, P<0.000001), pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (OR 2.63, P<0.00001), asthma (OR: 3.85, P<0.00001) and history of smoking (OR: 1.16, P<0.02). Among the symptoms, snoring (ever, loudness, frequency), feeling tired and witnessed apnea had the elevated odds of GOSA (Table 1). The mean Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) is nine times higher and mean Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) is nearly five times higher in OSA group compared to non-OSA group. The lowest oxygen desaturation in the OSA group was 85% compared to 91% in the non-OSA group (Table 1). The gravidity and parity of pregnancy did not show any significant difference between the OSA and non-OSA groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis identified several risk factors associated with GOSA during pregnancy. The demographic risk factors are prepregnancy & pregnancy BMI, weight gain during pregnancy and neck circumference. The risk factors in comorbidities are hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia and history of smoking. As per symptoms, snoring (loudness, frequency, elbowing), feeling tired and witnessed apnea are the important risk factors. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background: It has been proposed that sleep-induced inflammatory dysregulation during pregnancy may contribute to shortened gestation. Of importance, despite marked racial disparities observed in both early delivery and short sleep, African American women lack representation in this literature. Moreover, available data to date is sparse and focused on serum proinflammatory cytokines. Methods: We conducted whole-genome transcriptional profiling on whole blood from 50 pregnant African American women using Illumina HT-12 BeadKits. Among this cohort, 9 reported short sleep (≤ 7 hours/night) per the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The same number of control cases with healthy sleep duration (8-8.5 hours/night) were selected who were matched for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, and gestational age at sampling. Results: Promoter-based bioinformatics analyses (TELiS) identified functional commonalities among genes wi≥th 20% differential expression and p 300 down-regulated and >700 upregulated genes among short sleepers. Women with short sleep exhibited over representation of transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) in gene promoter sequences regulating key proinflammatory pathways (CREB, CREB/c-JUN, NF:B, AP-2; p's<.05). In parallel, these women showed suppression of TFBM of cellular genesis/cell cycle activators (JUN/AP-1, MEF2, OCT) indicating greater cellular arrest/pro-aging as well as TFBM including IFN response factors (IRFs) involved in antiviral immune responses (ISRE, EVI1). Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that short sleep promotes immune dysregulation, including inflammation and related pathways, among African American women during pregnancy. Consequences for birth outcomes remain to be delineated. In addition, the extent to which these are paralleled among women of other races/ethnicities warrants attention.

N2  - Women's sleep quality has been reported to change during pregnancy; prevalence estimates of poor sleep quality during pregnancy vary widely. To further understand the observed variation of findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Articles (N = 24) that reported prevalence of poor sleep quality as captured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) ≥ 5 were included, with a total of 11,002 participants contributing data. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Results indicated that the average PSQI score during pregnancy was 6.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.30, 6.85], and 45.7%, 95% CI [36.5%, 55.2%], of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality. Longitudinal studies indicated that sleep quality decreased from second (M = 5.31, SE = 0.40) to third trimester (M = 7.03, SE = 0.85) by 1.68 points, 95% CI [0.42, 2.94]. Gestational age moderated the average PSQI scores and prevalence of PSQI scores ≥5; older samples reported higher mean PSQI scores and higher prevalence of poor sleep quality. Clinicians should be aware that some reduction in sleep quality is expected during pregnancy, but complaints of very poor sleep quality could require intervention. Future research should examine various factors underlying poor sleep quality during pregnancy.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: During pregnancy, most women experience weight gain, in part attributed to changes in body water and hemodynamic alterations. This can be explained by plasma volume expansion, increased cardiac output and retention of sodium and water 1. Fluid accumulation is likely to be greater in women with pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Increased fluid states and rostral fluid shift have been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea; however, this has not been investigated in pregnant women 2. Therefore examining distribution of body water in pregnant women may provide important insights on the etiology of sleep disordered breathing in this patient population 3. In this systematic review, we aim to summarize literature on distribution and changes in total and segmental body water in women with uncomplicated and complicated pregnancies. METHODS: Electronic literature search of Medline, Medline in-process, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases, international conference proceedings, and abstracts was conducted in March 2017 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols guideline. We included cohort studies and randomized controlled trials investigating both segmental and total body water (TBW) changes in uncomplicated and complicated pregnancies, during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Studies using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to calculate TBW, extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW) and body compartments such as thoracic fluid content (TFC) were included. Screening of articles, data extraction, and compilation were conducted by 2 independent reviewers (JP, SH) and any conflict was resolved by supervising authors (MS, MB). RESULTS: A total of 1784 articles were screened using a two-stage strategy (title-abstract followed by full text). Of these, 43 studies (36 observational cohort and 7 interventional, involving 6255 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen studies included uncomplicated pregnancies (n= 3766 patients), 24 studies included complicated pregnancies (n=2489 patients), comprising mainly of preeclampsia (n=552 patients) gestational hypertension (n=395 patients), and others (n=436 patients). The majority of studies showed that TBW, TFC, ECW and ICW increased throughout the course of an uncomplicated pregnancy and decreased postpartum (p<0.05) (Table 1,2). The measured TBW was predominantly found to be greater in complicated pregnancies compared to uncomplicated pregnancies. TFC was found to be greater in patients with pulmonary edema and more severe preeclampsia than uncomplicated pregnancies (n=37 patients). We found no published studies investigating total or segmental body fluid changes in association with sleep disordered breathing in pregnant subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the TBW increases during pregnancy with increasing gestational age, and this increase is greater in women with complicated pregnancies. This could be the reason for higher incidence of sleep disordered breathing in patients with hypertensive pregnancies 4. Future studies are needed to investigate fluid changes in body compartments and body segments and to evaluate the impact of these changes on maternal and fetal outcomes. (Table Presented) .

N2  - Introduction: Women with overweight/obesity are at higher risk for excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). Both overweight and GWG contribute to poor obstetric outcomes. Appropriate sleep and circadian rhythms, including sleep duration and timing of eating, promote weight loss and improved health outcomes in non-pregnant individuals, but similar data have not been reported for pregnant women. We examined total sleep time (TST) and timing of eating in relation to GWG among women with overweight/obesity during early pregnancy. Methods: Women (N=50; 47% non-White) between 12?20 weeks gestation with a pre-pregnancy body mass index ≥25 were recruited for a study of perinatal weight patterns. At baseline, women self-reported their TST. Women completed 24-hour dietary recalls; the eating window was calculated as the difference between first meal/snack and last meal/snack within one 24-hour period. Women's self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and current weight (measured via calibrated scale) were used to calculate GWG. Independent samples t-tests and correlational analyses were conducted. Results: In the first half of pregnancy, women gained 10.5 ± 10.6 pounds, on average. TST was 7.7 ± 1.9 hours and eating window was 11.4 ± 3.1 hours, which did not differ by weekday or weekend recall (p=0.44). TST and eating window were not significantly correlated (r=-0.2, p=0.22), and were not related to gestational age (number of weeks pregnant; ps>0.17). TST (r=-0.3, p=0.05) and eating window (r=-0.3, p=0.05) were negatively correlated with GWG. Conclusion: Shorter TST was associated with higher GWG during the first half of pregnancy, similar to non-pregnant individuals. However, unlike studies in general adult samples, a shorter eating window was related to higher early GWG. Given that pregnancy alters sleep, circadian, and metabolic function, further investigation into this critical period may improve our understanding of their interrelationships.

N2  - Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia places considerable emphasis on sleep interfering behaviors in bed (stimulus control and sleep hygiene recommendations), with lesser emphasis on the actual sleep environment and its potential to disrupt sleep. We developed and tested a Sleep Environment Questionnaire (SEQ) to better understand the association between these two factors and self-reported sleep difficulties. The SEQ includes 8 items representing an Ambient Sleep Disruptive Factors (ASDF) scale, such as bedpartner disrupting sleep or needing to attend to children at night, and 5 items representing Dysfunctional Sleep Behaviors (DSB), such as watching television or using the internet in bed. Methods: The SEQ was administered to 177 pregnant women with insomnia disorder (32.6 ± 5.05 years) as part of a large randomized controlled trial of non-pharmacological insomnia treatment during pregnancy. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and SEQ were administered at baseline. Results: The ASDF total score and six out of eight individual items were significantly correlated with ISI (p's <.05). Individual ASDF items correlated with ISI were sleep disrupted by: someone making noise other than snoring, movement from others sharing the bed, taking care of children in the middle of the night, pets, light, and uncomfortable temperature. The DSB total score was not related to ISI nor to any individual items. EDPS was significantly correlated only with the ADSF total score and one item of the ASDF (sleep disrupted by taking care of children; p's <.05). Regression analyses to test whether ASDF and DSB total scores predicted ISI found that the ASDF total score, but not the DSB total score, was a significant predictor of ISI after adjusting for depression scores (p=.001). Conclusion: Assessment and treatment of insomnia disorder needs to expand beyond standard treatment recommendations to better understand, and potentially mitigate, the negative effects of external sleep environment on sleep beyond what is addressed by the standard sleep hygiene recommendation to have a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment.

N2  - Introduction: Insomnia Disorder (Insomnia) is diagnosed when sleep complaints persist despite adequate sleep opportunity, and are associated with clinically significant distress or impairment. During late pregnancy, sleep complaints are common and multi-factorial. Not all women with sleep complaints meet the diagnostic criteria for Insomnia. This study examined sleep-related impairment and cognitions, and mental health in women during the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: 159 first-time mothers (age M±SD=33.4±3.4), with singleton pregnancy and without severe physical/psychiatric conditions, completed the following assessments at 28-30 weeks' gestation: Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, Sleep Related Impairment, Depression, and Anxiety Short Forms, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, and Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale. These measures were compared amongst women who met criteria for Insomnia (Insomnia Group), and those who did not, further separated into High (ISI>;7) and Low (ISI<8) Complaint Groups. Results: 33.3% women scored >;7 on the ISI, and 24.5% met DSM-5 criteria for Insomnia (without criterion of 3 months duration). Compared to the Insomnia Group, the High Complaint Group had comparable score on all sleep related measures. The High Complaint Group (and not the Insomnia Group) also reported significantly higher symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to the Low Complaint Group (p-values<.01, d=.92 and .66 respectively). The Low Complaint Group scored the lowest on all sleep measures (p ranges <.001 to .02, d ranges 0.52 to 3.04). Conclusion: Sleep complaints, even in absence of Insomnia, are associated with less adaptive sleep-related cognitions and poorer mental health. These findings contradict the notion that during the perinatal transition, sleep complaints are “expected” and do not merit clinical attention unless Insomnia is present. Women with sleep complaints but fall short on Insomnia criteria may be vulnerable for future insomnia and mood disorders. Clinical attention is needed for not only Insomnia, but also complaints of sleep disturbances and related daytime impairment in perinatal women.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are common in late pregnancy, but are neglected in routine perinatal care. This randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of an automated, therapist-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program in addressing sleep disruption and insomnia symptoms in a community sample. Methods: First-time mothers without major medical/psychiatric conditions were recruited from Childbirth Education of an Australian public hospital. 159 women (age 33.37[3.44]) were randomized into a healthy sleep (CBT) or healthy diet control group. Participants received a 1-hr telephone session with a psychologist or dietician, and automated multimedia emails at 30 and 35 wks' gestation. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (SD), Sleep Related Impairment (SRI), Depression, and Anxiety Short Forms were administered at 28-30 wks (baseline; T1) and 36wks gestation (T2). Results: At baseline, 33.3% women reported clinically significant symptoms of insomnia (ISI>;7), and 24.5% met DSM-5 criteria for Insomnia Disorder, without the duration criterion based on Duke structured interview. Mixed effects models showed overall, ISI, SD, and SRI increased significantly from T1 to T2 (ps<.001), especially among women with low ISI at baseline. Compared to the control group, the CBT group reported significantly less increase in ISI, SD, and SRI (ps<.01; d=0.61, 0.52, 0.53 respectively), such that changes in these measures over time in the CBT group were non-significant (ps >;.33). Effect sizes for ISI, SD, and SRI were larger among women meeting Insomnia Disorder criteria (d=0.74, 0.80, 0.38 respectively), and those with baseline ISI>;7 (d=0.93, 0.90, 1.15 respectively). Changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety were not significant over time, and did not differ between groups (ps>;.22). Conclusion: Sleep disruption and symptoms of insomnia increased with advancing gestation. A brief, automated cognitive behavioral program is efficacious in buffering against these sleep complaints during late pregnancy in a community sample of first-time mothers. The scalable nature of the program holds strong potential for dissemination and implementation in routine perinatal care.

N2  - Introduction: While loss of sleep during pregnancy adversely affects brain development, the mechanisms underlying the lasting physiological and behavioral consequences in the offspring remain unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that sleep deprivation (SD) during pregnancy impacts tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway in the in utero environment. Elevations in kynurenine pathway metabolism, specifically kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous astrocyte-derived antagonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) and NMDA receptors, in utero have been demonstrated to induce long-lasting negative behavioral consequences relevant to the study of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (reviewed in Notarangelo and Pocivavsek, Neuropharm. 2017). Methods: Pregnant Wistar rat dams were sleep deprived by gentle handling for 5 h from zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 to ZT 5. Experimental cohorts included: A) one session of SD on embryonic (ED) 18 or B) three sessions of SD on ED 16 to ED 18. Maternal (plasma, brain) and fetal (placenta, plasma, brain) tissues were collected immediately after the last session of SD or after 24 h of recovery from SD. Respective controls were euthanized at ZT 5 on ED 18 and ED 19. Results: Maternal plasma tryptophan and kynurenine, and fetal brain KYNA, were significantly elevated only after one session of SD on ED 18. Importantly, plasma corticosterone, a measure of the endocrine stress response, was significantly elevated in maternal plasma after one day of SD, and this measure, as well as maternal tryptophan, correlated significantly with fetal brain KYNA. Conclusion: Collectively, our results demonstrate that sleep loss during pregnancy can adversely impact kynurenine pathway metabolism and impact fetal brain KYNA levels. We introduce KYNA as a novel molecular target influenced by sleep loss during pregnancy. Future experiments are designed to unravel the contribution of kynurenine pathway changes during maternal sleep loss on long-lasting biochemical and behavioral outcomes in developing offspring.

N2  - Introduction: Poor sleep during pregnancy has deleterious effects, yet insomnia during pregnancy remains largely under-recognized and under-treated. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is effective in the general population, but its efficacy during pregnancy remains unknown. We present the results of an RCT of CBTI during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N=179) meeting DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder, with duration criterion relaxed to one month, were randomized to five sessions of CBTI or an active control (CTRL) therapy, delivered weekly during pregnancy. Participants were excluded if they used medications that could impact sleep or mood. Mean age and gestation age upon entry were 33.0 (SD 5.1) years and 28.8 (SD 4.9) weeks respectively; 38.0% were Latina, 25.7% received treatment in Spanish. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were administered during baseline and weekly after treatment began. Results: Mixed effects models with continuous time revealed that, compared to women assigned to CTRL, those assigned to CBTI had a significantly greater reduction in ISI (p < .001). Among those who received at least one therapy session, insomnia severity in CBTI decreased from 15.4 (4.4) at baseline to 8.2 (5.2). Among those in CTRL the change was from 15.9 (4.3) to 11.4 (4.9). Cox proportional hazards model showed that, compared to CTRL, participants in the CBTI group had significantly shorter time to remission as defined by ISI<8 (median days to remission: 31 versus 48 days; p<.001). We detected no significant between-group differences in depressive symptom severity. Ethnicity, therapy language, and gestation age at study entry were not significantly associated with outcomes. Conclusion: Longitudinal studies show that the progression of pregnancy is associated with normative increases in sleep disturbances. Our finding suggests that for pregnant women with insomnia CBTI can safely and effectively improve sleep without use of medication and despite the normative increase in sleep disturbance as pregnancy progresses. Additionally, efficacy was equivalent for Latina, including those who chose to receive therapy in Spanish rather than English.

N2  - Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is an emerging concern, as it can adversely affect the development of the offspring brain. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of deprivation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the third term of pregnancy on the sleep–wake profiles of neonates in the Wistar rat model. Sleep–wake patterns were assessed through electrophysiological measures and behavioural observations during postnatal days 1–21 on pups born to REM sleep-deprived dams and control rats. Pups of REM sleep-deprived dams had active sleep that was not only markedly higher in percentage during all the days studied, but also had reduced latency during later postnatal days 15–21. Quiet sleep and wake periods were lower. These factors, along with less frequent but longer sleep–wake cycles, indicated maturational delay in the sleep–wake neural networks. The disruption of time-bound growth of sleep–wake neural networks was substantiated further by the decreased slope of survival plots in the sleep bouts. Examination of altered sleep–wake patterns during early development may provide crucial information concerning deranged neural development in the offspring. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to show that maternal sleep deprivation during pregnancy can delay and impair the development of sleep–wake profile in the offspring.

N2  - Introduction: Women in pregnancy and postpartum periods have high rates of sleep problems that are associated with a wide range of detrimental mother and child outcomes, particularly postpartum depression and anxiety. However, no study has examined long-term trajectories of poor sleep quality from late pregnancy to early motherhood, and association with maternal mood disturbances. Methods: A longitudinal, prospective cohort study of 262 non-clinical women were at late pregnancy, 42 days, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36 months postpartum. Primary measures included the Pittsburgh sleep quality Index, the center for epidemiologic studies-depression scale, and the state-trait anxiety inventory. Group-based trajectory models was used to identify the distinguished sleep trend of these women. Results: Rate of poor sleep quality took a “U” shaped change, with a peak at 42 days postpartum (around 75%), remaining at equivalent level until 9 month postpartum compared to late pregnancy (around 45%), and fluctuating around 35% until 3 years postpartum. Three trajectories that can distinguish latent group variances in long-term change of sleep quality were identified, namely the stable-low complainants (29.4%), the decreasing-mild complainants (56.5%), and the stable-high complainants (14.1%). Poor sleep quality at late pregnancy held consistently higher risk of poor sleep quality at all postpartum following-up points. After controlling for covariants, the trajectory groups of poorer sleep quality demonstrated increased mood disturbances at 3 years postpartum. Replicating the analysis only in women without baseline symptoms of depression and anxiety above clinical cut-offs obtained similar results. Conclusion: Women are persistently subject to poor sleep quality from late pregnancy tp early motherhood, but follow distinct trajectories. Poor sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety at late pregnancy can be used as early identifiers to the sleep trajectories. Trajectory of poor sleep quality inform severity level of mood disturbances in 3 years postpartum.

N2  - Introduction: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are linked to maternal body mass index (BMI) and frequent snoring. However, pathways of associations between maternal BMI, pregnancy-onset snoring and HDP were only partially estimated. We examined and quantified the total and direct associations between pre-pregnancy BMI and incident HDP and their indirect pathway through pregnancy-onset snoring. Methods: Third trimester pregnant women, without pre-pregnancy hypertension and/or snoring enrolled into this study from prenatal clinics of a large tertiary medical center. Sleep data were collected through a questionnaire. Demographic and pregnancy information was abstracted from medical charts. We used causal mediation analysis to estimate the direct association between pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and HDP, their indirect association through pregnancy-onset snoring, and their total association. The proportion of direct and indirect associations from the total association of pre-pregnancy BMI and HDP was also quantified. Results: A total of 1,625 pregnant women enrolled into the study, of which we excluded 169 and 123 women with chronic hypertension and/or chronic snoring, respectively. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was directly associated with a 1.4-fold incident HDP, adjusted for maternal characteristics. Pregnancy-onset snoring significantly mediated the association of pre-pregnancy BMI and incident HDP: adjusted OR=1.07 (95% CI 1.01, 1.14). The mediated pathway of pre-pregnancy BMI and incident HDP by pregnancy-onset snoring accounted for 16% of the total association for pre-pregnancy BMI. Conclusion: Pregnancy-onset snoring mediates the association between pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and incident HDP in women without pre-pregnancy snoring or hypertension. These findings demonstrate the relative contribution of pre-pregnancy BMI and pregnancy- onset snoring to incident HDP. Identification of these two pathways to incident HDP may have prenatal care implications for at-risk pregnant women.

N2  - Background Women with obesity are at increased risk for excess gestational weight gain. Studies in non-pregnant women suggest that the etiology of weight gain may be different between African-American and White women and this may cause higher retention of weight postpartum and the increased prevalence of obesity in offspring. Objective To conduct a cross-sectional study in African-American and White pregnant women to identify metabolic and behavioral risk factors for aberrant weight gain trajectories. Design Metabolic and behavioral phenotyping was conducted in 66 pregnant women with obesity, expecting a single fetus, between 14 and 16 weeks of gestation. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions over 7 days using stable isotopes and during sleep in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by SenseWear™ accelerometers. Fasting blood was collected to measure markers of metabolic health. Results African-American (AA, n=34) and White women (W, n=32) were comparable in age (27.7±0.6 years) but had a lower socio-economic status and higher parity. The two groups were matched for BMI (36.9±0.7 kg/m2) and while body fat was not different (55.1±0.6%), AA women had more fat-free mass (AA: 56.9±1.6 vs W: 51.6±1.1 kg, p=0.009) and tended to be more insulin resistant (HOMA-IR, AA: 4.0±0.4 vs W: 3.1±0.3, p=0.06). Total daily energy intake was significantly lower in AA women compared to their white counterparts (AA: 2633±88 vs W: 2901±76 kcal/d, p=0.03), while diet composition and absolute total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) were not different between the two ethnic groups (AA: 2590±77 vs W: 2711±56 kcal/d, p=0.21). However, after correction for individual differences in body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231±74kcal/d, p=0.003). Similarly, energy expenditure during sleep was comparable between ethnicities in absolute terms (p=0.77), but lower in AA women after adjustment for body composition (-81±37kcal/d, p=0.03). Physical activity was not significantly different between AA and white women as assessed by calorimetrically data or by accelerometry (eg. time spent in activity, average intensity of activity (METs), or as #steps). We observed no differences in substrate oxidation (12h and sleeping RQ) or metabolic profile (plasma T3 and T4 concentrations, urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion). Conclusions Early in pregnancy, African-American and White women with obesity have similar energy intake and physical activity but energy expenditure per kg of metabolic mass is significantly lower in women who are African-American. Energy requirements used by clinicians to counsel pregnant women on healthy weight gain are not race-specific. The lower energy expenditure in African-American women may therefore lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the increasing prevalence of excessive gestational weight gain in African-American women.

N2  - Introduction: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during the peri-partum period and may have negative consequences on mothers and newborns. Changes in sleep quality and especially insomnia are also typical throughout pregnancy and have been associated with adverse outcomes including peri-partum psychopathology. On this basis reasoning that identifying women at high risk of developing insomnia may have important clinical implications on maternal-fetal outcomes, we aimed to study stress-related sleep reactivity, as a risk factor to developing insomnia, and its association with peri-partum psychopathology in pregnant women. Methods: Sixty-two pregnant women (mean age 33.6 ± 3 years, 20.6 ± 0.6 weeks of pregnancy) were evaluated during their routine visit at the Gynecological Unit of the University of Pisa, Italy, using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia symptoms, the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test for sleep-reactivity (FIRST), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for peri-partum depressive symptoms, Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for anxiety symptoms.Item number 10 of the EPDS was used to evaluate sucidality. T test was used to calculate differences in means between women with high (FIRST score ≥ 16) vs low stress-related sleep reactivity. Unilinear/multiple and logist regressions have been performed to study correlations between variables. Results: Pregnant women with greater stress related sleep reactivity (n 29, mean age of 34.2 ± 2 years, FIRST score: 21.4 ± 2 vs 12.2 ± 4 p=0.02) presented higher scores in the EPDS (8.3 ± 5 vs 6.2 ± 4 p=0.04) in the EPDS item 10 (0.2 ± 0.8 vs 0.0,p<0.0001) and in the ISI (6.3 ± 3 vs 3.1 ± 2, p=0.02). Greater FIRST scores correlated with greater SAS (coeff: 0.30, p=0.02), ISI (coeff: 0.33, p<0.0001), EPDS (coeff: 0.22, p=0.02) scores and with greater suicidality (coeff: 0.2, p=0.03). Conclusion: Pregnant women with greater stress related sleep reactivity may suffer from greater psychopathology such as insomnia, anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidality. It should be of importance to evaluate stress-related sleep reactivity during pregnancy to prevent and treat insomnia, psychopathology and their negative consequences on maternal-fetal outcomes.

N2  - This was a retrospective case–control study in 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy and 75 women in the control group. Patients completed the questionnaire by Maurovich-Horvat et al. (J. Sleep Res., 2013, 22: 496–512). We personally interviewed 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy using the administered questionnaire regarding conception, pregnancy, delivery, perinatal and breastfeeding periods. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy reported 59 pregnancies versus 164 in the control group. In 16 cases (27.1%), a disease before pregnancy was present compared with eight cases (4.9%) in the control group (P < 0.001); among them, extrinsic asthma was reported 11 times in the narcolepsy with cataplexy group (P < 0.005). Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy more often had a single pregnancy compared with controls (P < 0.05). Gestational diabetes was more frequent in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (P < 0.05). Induced deliveries were higher in controls (P < 0.009). No differences were found between the groups in terms of duration of pregnancies and complications during and after delivery, as during the puerperium. Neonates from patients had heavier birth weight (P < 0.015). The breastfeeding period was longer in patients (P < 0.01). Modafinil and methylphenidate were the drugs administered in six pregnancies. No significant differences in depression during pregnancy and during puerperium were found between patients and controls. This is the first case–control study in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy related to pregnancy, delivery, childbirth and puerperium. Data suggest that patients have pregnancy outcomes similar to controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes was higher in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Caesarean sections, complications during delivery and normal perinatal period for infants were similar in both groups. Breastfeeding was longer in patients.

N2  - Emerging literature suggests that sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) worsens over the course of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Earlier studies, using mainly snoring as a surrogate marker for SDB, have shown an increase in the prevalence of SDB during pregnancy compared with that in the pregravid state. More recently, prospective observational studies in which the investigators ascertained SDB by using complete polysomnography have shown a prevalence ranging from approximately 17% to 45% in the third trimester. Pregnancy itself can be associated with daytime hypersomnolence, so complaints of increasing fatigue and sleepiness during pregnancy are not specific for SDB. Moreover, snoring in isolation also has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for diagnosing maternal SDB. The indications for screening for SDB during routine obstetric prenatal visits are still unclear, but observational studies indicate that maternal SDB is linked with the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus. Some studies also have identified a relationship between maternal SDB and the delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. Aside from a few small interventional studies of CPAP in pregnant patients with gestational hypertension, little currently is known about whether treatment of SDB during pregnancy improves clinical outcomes for the mother and/or baby. Additional current knowledge gaps include elucidating underlying mechanisms of maternal SDB, determining optimal treatment strategies, and understanding the trajectory of SDB after delivery.

N2  - Background: Underutilisation of antenatal care services due to intimate partner violence during pregnancy has been well documented elsewhere, but it is understudied in Nepal. Our study aimed at exploring the impact of intimate partner violence on antenatal care service utilisation in southern Terai of Nepal. Method: A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in 6 village development committees in Dhanusha district, Nepal. A total of 426 pregnant women in their second trimester were selected using a multistage cluster sampling method. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association between exposure to intimate partner violence and selected antenatal care services, adjusting for covariates. Results: Among 426 pregnant women, almost three out of ten women (28.9%) were exposed to intimate partner violence at some point during their pregnancy. Pregnant women who were exposed to intimate partner violence were less likely to: register for antenatal care (OR 0.31; 95% CI (0.08–0.50)), take iron and folic acid (OR 0.55; 95% CI (0.12–0.90)), report dietary diversity (middle vs low: OR 0.34; 95% CI (0.11–0.58) and high vs low: OR 0.18; 95% CI (0.08–0.37)), have rest and sleep during day time (OR 0.47; 95% CI (0.61–0.58)), and attend mother's group meetings (OR 0.29; 95% CI (0.10–0.83)). Conclusions: Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is associated with low utilisation of antenatal care services. Therefore, effective strategies to prevent or reduce intimate partner violence during pregnancy is needed, which may lead to improved antenatal care service utilization in Nepal with healthier mothers and children's outcome.

N2  - Introduction: About 10% of U.S. newborns require treatment in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The NICU environment, which differs dramatically from the in utero milieu, could influence the development of newborn sleep patterns. Whether NICU environment has differential impact on sleep for preterm versus term newborns, and whether exposure to the mother's voice can modulate that impact, is unknown. Methods: Neonates underwent 12-hour, attended polysomnography in the NICU. Their mothers were recorded reading children's books. This recording was randomized to be played continuously during either the first or second 6-hours of the polysomnogram. Sleep-wake stage distributions, entropy, and EEG power were calculated for each 6-hour block. Quantitative sleep measures were regressed on gestational age (GA), with adjustment for neurological examination (Thompson) sores. Data were compared for epochs with, versus without, the recorded maternal voice playing. Results: For 20 neonates ≥35 weeks gestation at birth, but not 27 born preterm at 33-34 weeks, associations of quantitative sleep measures with increasing GA varied with maternal voice exposure. During the voice recording, among neonates ≥35 weeks gestation, increasing GA was associated with increased percent time awake (R2=0.52, p<0.001), increased wakefulness bout duration (R2=0.39, p=0.003), decreased overall sleep (R2=0.52, p<0.001), decreased REM sleep bouts per hour (R2=0.35, p=0.004), and increased sleepwake entropy (R2=0.47, p=0.001). These remained significant after adjusting for Thompson scores (adjusted model R2=0.25 to 0.49, each p<0.003). Without the voice recording, none of these associations were significant. EEG power at 2-4Hz and 4-8Hz increased with GA in both age groups (R2=0.14 to 0.47, p=0.01 to <0.001); this was not changed by the voice recording. For infants <35 weeks gestation, no other associations emerged between sleep measures and GA or postmenstrual age, during or without the maternal voice recording. Conclusion: NICU patients born at ≥35 weeks gestation, but not more premature neonates, show sleep-wake patterns that appear to respond increasingly with age to enriched maternal voice exposure. Newborns may become progressively more responsive to their mothers' voice as they approach full term.

N2  - BackgroundBrain development underlies maturation of sleep patterns throughout childhood. Intrauterine head growth - marker of early neurodevelopment - has not been associated with childhood sleep characteristics. We explored associations between ultrasonographic measures of prenatal and early postnatal neurodevelopment and childhood sleep.MethodsA total of 6,808 children from a population-based birth cohort (Generation R) were included. Head circumference (HC) and lateral ventricles size were assessed with mid- and late-pregnancy fetal ultrasounds, and with cranial ultrasound 3-20 weeks postnatally. Mothers reported children's sleep duration at 2 and 3 years, and sleep problems at 1.5, 3, and 6 years.ResultsLarger ventricular size, but not HC, was related to longer sleep duration at 3 years (β=0.06 h, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02; 0.10 in late-pregnancy and β=0.11 h, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.20 in early infancy, mid-pregnancy parameters were unrelated to sleep duration). Larger HC in mid-pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk for being a "problematic sleeper" up to the age of 6 years (odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89; 0.99). Consistently, children with larger HC in early infancy were less likely to be "problematic sleepers" at 3 and 6 years.ConclusionsThis study shows that variations in fetal and neonatal brain size may underlie behavioral expression of sleep in childhood. Albeit small effect estimates, these associations provide evidence for neurodevelopmental origins of sleep.

N2  - Introduction: This study examined ethnic differences in infant sleep location and associated maternal/infant sleep outcomes. Methods: Follow-up data from 25 Latina and 45 non-Latina White pregnant women with insomnia disorder enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of insomnia therapy who completed the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at 18 and 30 weeks postpartum were utilized. Results: A Chi-square test showed a significant difference in infant sleep location between groups at both time points (p's<.05). At 18 weeks, among infants of Latina women, 57% slept in their parents' bed (PB), 39% in a crib in their parents' room (CPR), and 4% in a crib in a separate room (CSR). Among infants of non-Latina women, 13% slept in PB, 55% slept in CPR, and 33% slept in CSR. At week 30, among Latina mothers, the percent of infants who were CSR increased to 24%, CPR decreased to 24%, and those in PB was similar (52%). Among non-Latina mothers, the percent of those in CSR increased to 53%, CPR decreased to 31%, and PB was similar (16%). ANCOVAs, adjusting for ethnicity and age, showed that at 18 weeks, mothers of PB infants reported more problematic sleep of their infants than mothers of CSR/CPR infants and at 30 weeks they reported more infant night wakings than mothers of CSR infants. At week 30 PB/CPR infants were rated as having less sleep than CSR infants. No significant difference was found in the relation between infant sleep location and mother's ISI scores at either time point. Conclusion: Infants of Latina mothers were more likely to bedand room-share than infants of non-Latina mothers. Although infant sleep outcomes were rated more poorly among bed sharers compared to room (but not bed) and non-room sharers, mothers' self-reported insomnia severity did not differ between groups. It is possible that objectively defined sleep will differ. Attention to ethnic and cultural choices regarding sleep arrangement will likely enhance interventions for improving sleep of mothers and their infants.

N2  - Introduction: Prior studies have found that parental concerns about limiting their nighttime involvement are associated with poorer infant sleep quality. We examined maternal cognitions about infant sleep in relation to their infants' sleep and maternal insomnia. Methods: The sample consisted of 105 women in a randomized controlled trial for perinatal insomnia. They were randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia plus tips for infant sleep (CBTI+TIPS) or an active control insomnia therapy plus general education about infant sleep (CTRL). Treatment consisted of five weekly sessions during pregnancy and a sixth session at six weeks postpartum. Mothers completed the Infant Sleep Vignettes Interpretation Scale (ISVIS) that assesses parental sleep-related cognitions at 5 weeks postpartum, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) at 30 weeks postpartum, and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at both time points. Results: Mothers in the CBTI+TIPS arm scored lower on the Distress subscale (p=.028) and higher on the Limits subscale (p=.049) of the ISVIS than mothers in the CTRL arm. In the whole sample, after adjusting for treatment, maternal depressive symptoms, insomnia severity, and nulliparous stats, regression analysis revealed that lower ISVIS-Distress scores at 5 weeks postpartum predicted longer duration of infant's nighttime sleep at 30 weeks postpartum (N=72, beta=-.316, p=.003). Mothers with scores below the median (3.71) on the ISVIS-Distress subscale reported their infants slept 36 minutes longer at night (602 vs. 566 minutes) at 30 weeks. However, ISVIS scores at 5 weeks postpartum did not predict maternal insomnia severity at 30 weeks postpartum. Conclusion: Mothers who had insomnia during pregnancy benefited from CBTI+TIPS by learning tools for setting the stage for healthy infant sleep development. They were less likely to interpret infant night-wakings as a sign of distress and more likely to emphasize the importance of limiting parental nighttime involvement. It is unclear if these results will generalize to new mothers without prior histories of insomnia. Nonetheless, it appears that having realistic expectations about infant sleep during the early postpartum can translate to longer infant sleep duration later.

N2  - Objectives There is increasing evidence to suggest an association between sleep and diet. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between sleep duration and fruit/vegetable (FV) intakes and their associated biomarkers in UK adults. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Data from The National Diet and Nutrition Survey. Participants 1612 adults aged 19-65 years were included, pregnant/breastfeeding women were excluded from the analyses. Outcome measures Sleep duration was assessed by self-report, and diet was assessed by 4-day food diaries, disaggregation of foods containing FV into their components was conducted to determine total FV intakes. Sleep duration was divided into: short (<7 hours/day), reference (7-8 hours/day) and long (>8 hours/day) sleep periods. Multiple regression adjusting for confounders was used for analyses where sleep duration was the exposure and FV intakes and their associated biomarkers were the outcomes. Restricted cubic spline models were developed to explore potential non-linear associations. Results In adjusted models, long sleepers (LS) consumed on average 28 (95% CI -50 to -6, p=0.01) g/day less of total FV compared to reference sleepers (RS), whereas short sleepers (SS) consumed 24 g/day less (95% CI -42 to -6, p=0.006) and had lower levels of FV biomarkers (total carotenoids, β-carotene and lycopene) compared to RS. Restricted cubic spline models showed that the association between sleep duration and FV intakes was non-linear (p<0.001) with RS having the highest intakes compared to SS and LS. The associations between sleep duration and plasma total carotenoids (p=0.0035), plasma vitamin C (p=0.009) and lycopene (p<0.001) were non-linear with RS having the highest levels. Conclusions These findings show a link between sleep duration and FV consumption. This may have important implications for lifestyle and behavioural change policy.

N2  - Objective: To assess the accuracy of sleep/wake classification by leg-worn actigraphy in a clinical population. Background: This study was performed to validate the capability of the Quell™ (NeuroMetrix, Inc.) device, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device worn on the calf for the treatment of chronic pain. Simultaneous polysomnography was used as a comparator. Design/Methods: Patients referred to the Massachusetts General Hospital Sleep Center were eligible for the study. Inclusion criteria were: age 18-75 years, expected wake time <30% of total sleep time, and probable periodic leg movements of sleep. Exclusion criteria were: circadian sleep disorders, pregnant women, and implantable medical devices. Ten subjects were recruited, half wearing one device, and the other half wearing one device on each leg. Polysomnography data were all collected following clinical standards and scored by the same technician. The comparison window was Lights Out to Lights On. In two subjects, data were shifted to correct for differences in clock time between the devices and polysomnography. For each device, minute-by-minute agreement in scoring sleep was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), accuracy, sensitivity to sleep, and specificity to sleep. Group statistics were quantified by median and median absolute deviation. Results: Prospective performance was ROC 0.76 (0.06), accuracy 0.87 (0.02), sensitivity 0.95 (0.03), and specificity 0.37 (0.20). In post-hoc analysis with the same activity threshold, applying Cole- Kripke averaging and rescoring improved performance to ROC 0.89 (0.03), accuracy 0.87 (0.03), sensitivity 0.96 (0.03), and specificity 0.53 (0.25). Conclusions: In this pilot study, actigraphy performance of the leg-based Quell device was similar to published data for most wrist-based actigraphy. Applying Cole-Kripke averaging and rescoring increased ROC and specificity without adversely impacting accuracy or sensitivity. It is possible that performance may be improved further by adjusting the activity threshold..

N2  - Introduction: Clinical data have suggested the relationship between sleep disruption during pregnancy and postpartum depression. Consequently, preclinical studies evaluating the effects of gestational sleep deprivation on maternal behavior are needed in order to provide more details on the background mechanisms underlying this relationship and to promote a better understanding of it under an ethological perspective. A.Basic and Translational Sleep Science XI. Sleep and Development SLEEP, Volume 41, Abstract Supplement, 2018 A102 Methods: Thirty-two female 90 days-old Wistar-Hannover rats were distributed in 2 groups: Control group (CTRL - n=13), not subjected to any manipulation during pregnancy; and sleep restriction group (SR - n=19) - subjected to sleep restriction during the whole pregnancy (21 days). Maternal behavioral analysis was conducted from postpartum day 1 (PPD1) to PPD7, based on observational ethograms. On PPD11 the animals were subjected to a self-grooming analysis by means of the grooming analysis algorithm, followed by behavioral testing on the elevated plus maze. Results: On initial uncontrolled ethogram-based analysis, an increased in self-grooming was observed among sleep-deprived rats, but no significant differences were found in maternal behavior. Controlled analysis, balanced for potential confounding factors, detected an impairment in high-arched back nursing in sleep-deprived animals. The grooming microstructure analysis, performed on PPD11, showed a reduced frequency of incorrect transitions on the sleep restricted animals, denoting reduced anxiety. No significant differences were observed in the elevated-plus maze. Conclusion: Female rats sleep-restricted during pregnancy display an equivalent or slightly modified behavior during the postpartum period, when compared to animals not submitted to any stressful factor, concomitantly with a decrease in anxiety-like behavior parameters. This behavioral maintenance is mediated by adaptive mechanisms, which are tailored to assure the viability and survival of the litter. These effects probably happened due to an inhibition of both anxiety-like behavior and stress responses. Thus, results suggests that anxiolysis is an adaptive mechanism to allow the lactating females to perform maternal behavior in adequate levels, even in face of a stressful factor such as prenatal sleep-deprivation.

N2  - Introduction: Studies have shown that maternal emotion and mood during and after pregnancy is associated with young children's sleep disturbances. However, few studies have examined this relationship for different trimesters of pregnancy, and sleep assessments have been limited to infancy. Furthermore, studies examining this relationship with both positive and negative emotions for different trimesters of pregnancy are lacking. Importantly, potential mediators of this relationship are unclear. We aimed to tackle these gaps in a longitudinal cohort study in kindergarten children. Methods: Participants included 833 kindergarteners with mean age 5.57(0.40) years. Women's emotional status, including prenatal/postnatal depressive emotion and perceived happiness throughout trimesters, was rated by a self-designed set of questions with a 5-point scale for happiness and a 3-point scale for depression. Sleep problems were assessed using the sleep subdomain of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Child behavioral problems were measured using the CBCL total score. General linear models were performed to examine the adjusted associations between childhood sleep problems and maternal emotional status. Results: Adjusted models showed that children of women who expressed either depressive emotion during the postnatal period (β=3.13, p=0.003) or during both the prenatal and postnatal periods (β=2.65, p=0.04) were more likely to exhibit sleep disturbances. Similarly, increased levels of happiness in the second (β=-1.45, p=0.01) and third (β=-1.46, p=0.02) trimester were significantly associated with decreased risk for children's sleep problems. We found a significant mediation effect of child's behavior on the maternal emotion and child sleep relationship. Conclusion: Maternal depressive emotion during the prenatal and postnatal periods are associated with children's sleep problems while increased happiness during pregnancy decreased children's sleep problems. This relationship may be mediated by children behavioral problems, Measures promoting maternal emotional status may help minimize children's behavioral problems and further alleviate sleep disturbances in children.

N2  - Introduction Accumulating evidence has shown an association between maternal supine going-to-sleep position and stillbirth in late pregnancy. Advising women not to go-to-sleep on their back can potentially reduce late stillbirth rate by 9%. However, the association between maternal right-sided going-to-sleep position and stillbirth is inconsistent across studies. Furthermore, individual studies are underpowered to investigate interactions between maternal going-to-sleep position and fetal vulnerability, which is potentially important for producing clear and tailored public health messages on safe going-to-sleep position. We will use individual participant data (IPD) from existing studies to assess whether right-side and supine going-to-sleep positions are independent risk factors for late stillbirth and to test the interaction between going-to-sleep position and fetal vulnerability. Methods and analysis An IPD meta-analysis approach will be used using the Cochrane Collaboration-endorsed methodology. We will identify case-control and prospective cohort studies and randomised trials which collected maternal going-to-sleep position data and pregnancy outcome data that included stillbirth. The primary outcome is stillbirth. A one stage procedure meta-analysis, stratified by study with adjustment of a priori confounders will be carried out. Ethics and dissemination The IPD meta-analysis has obtained central ethics approval from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee, ref: NTX/06/05/054/AM06. Individual studies should also have ethical approval from relevant local ethics committees. Interpretation of the results will be discussed with consumer representatives. Results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. PROSPERO registration number CRD42017047703.

N2  - Objectives: Primary: To describe sleep disturbances in SLE patients and compare them to healthy controls. Secondary: To evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in sleep disturbances in SLE patients. Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study. Cases were defined as patients >18 years of age with SLE (ACR 1997), evaluated between 01-07/2017 who responded the questionnaires. Pregnant and obese patients, those with COPD, diabetes, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, kidney failure and heart failure were excluded. Educational and socioeconomic level (Graffar) were evaluated. We assessed time of diagnosis, current treatment, demographic data, disease activity (SLEDAI) and damage accrual (SLICC Damage Index or SDI). Controls were healthy individuals who responded to the questionnaires. Sleep disturbance was assessed by self administered questionnaires. Insomnia was evaluated by ISI, sleep quality by PSQI, depression by BECK, fatigue by FACIT, and function by HAQ. The statistic analyses wer performed using Epi-info 7. Descriptive data are shown as means ± SD. Percentages and prevalence as 95%CI. Chi square or Fisher's tests were used as appropriate (α=0.05). Results: 51 caseswere included (Mean age 39.6 ± 12.9 years, 92%female) and 49 controls (mean age 41.8 ± 13.0 years, 88% female). Conclusions: SLE patients presented more insomnia, sleep disturbances depression, fatigue and functional incapacity compared to controls. In this study, despite previously published data, no differences in sleep disturbances were found related to the dose of steroids used.

N2  - Introduction: Long working hours are with poorer health and safety outcomes in middle-aged and older Australians, and this relationship can be mediated by shorter sleep, especially for obesity. However the relationships, particularly with cardiometabolic risk (CMR) are not well understood in younger workers. Methods: Data from the 22 year follow-up of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study in Perth, Western Australia were used to determine the relationship between working hours, sleep and cardiometabolic risk factors (CMR). N=873 young adults provided details about working hours per week. CMR factors, including waist circumference, glucose, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were determined from fasting blood samples and also facilitated calculation of a continuous clinical index of cardiometabolic risk (cCICR). Self-reported sleep duration was provided in addition to highest educational attainment, routine time demands (work versus work and study), smoking habits, and shift work status. Results: CMR factors including increased waist circumference (F5,698 = 6.66, p<0.001), higher fasting plasma glucose (F5,647 = 3.89, p=0.002), and reduced HDL-cholesterol (F5,647 = 5.63, p<0.001), were associated with >;38h working weeks when adjusted for education, shift work status, time demands, and smoking. Total sleep time was significantly lower in both male and female workers reporting >;38h working weeks, but did not mediate the relationships seen with CMR factors Conclusion: These findings indicate associations between >;38h working weeks and CMR risk early in working life. Given the longerterm relationships seen between working hours and poor cardiometabolic health, there is a need for early education and awareness of the impact of working hours. Longitudinal studies to determine the impact of working hours, sleep and sociodemographic characteristics from early working years are required to better understand the contribution to poor cardiometabolic health.

N2  - A substantial percentage of pregnant women report disturbed sleep. These frequently include increased awakenings, long periods of wake after sleep onset, and poor sleep quality. Recent data indicate that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and insomnia appear to be on the rise. The co-occurrence of habitual snoring and insomnia have been described in non-pregnant cohorts with a prevalence of 30%-55%. Independently, each is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disease. When co-morbid, risk for morbidity substantially increases above and beyond their independent presentation. To date, no study has examined the co-morbid status or impact in pregnant women. We examined the prevalence of insomnia and symptoms of SDB in women in the third trimester (34.1 3.7 weeks). A sample of 439 women completed questionnaires on snoring and “stoppage of breathing or gasping for air”. If a participant reported snoring at least 3-4 times per week (habitual), she was deemed HS+. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ). Women were classified as HS-/ISQ-(n=161; 36.7%), HS-/ISQ+ (n=146; 33.3%), HS+/ISQ-(n=63; 14.4%), HS+/ISQ+ (n=69;15.7%). Logistic regression models controlling for confounders revealed that while both INS alone and HS alone were associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3-6.5, p.

N2  - Introduction: The primary purpose of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between poor sleep and chronic low back pain (CLBP) among non-institutionalized U. S. adults utilizing the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Secondarily, if an association is present, the effect of depression in the past 12 months on the association will be explored as well. Methods: Participants' information was gathered through participation in the NHIS of adults (18 years-old or older) from 2012. Participant data was excluded if they were currently pregnant, were recently pregnant within the past 12 months, had a history of cancer, or missing data regarding sleep, insomnia, or presence of low back pain. Poor sleep was defined as insomnia in the past 12 months or <7 hours of sleep per night. CLBP was defined as low back pack pain ≥3 months in duration. A logistic regression model was fitted to explore the association between poor sleep and CLBP alone. A second logistic regression model was fitted to adjust for potential confounding by age (by decade of life), race, sex, body mass index, and physical activity level. After adjusting for potential confounders, odds ratios (OR) were stratified by depression within the past 12 months. Results: A statistically significant relationship between poor sleep and CLBP was identified in both the crude (OR: 2.323, 95% CI: [1.771, 2.812]) and the adjusted (OR: 2.204, 95% CI: [1.742, 2.790]) models. The OR between poor sleep and CLBP was similar among participants who were depressed (OR: 2.003, 95% CI: [1.515, 2.648]) and among those who were not (OR: 2.347, 95% CI: [1.503, 3.668]). Conclusion: A strong and statistically significant relationship between having poor sleep and CLBP. These results allow for an understanding of the prevalence of comorbid sleep issues with CLBP. Limitations to this analysis include potential for recall and reporting biases.

N2  - Each year, over half a million women develop sleep disordered breathing (SDB) by the third trimester, the prevalence of which is increasing in parallel with the obesity epidemic. While negative consequences of SDB during pregnancy on the health of the mother and newborn are becoming better appreciated, nothing is known about the impact of SDB on the neural function of her offspring. SDB is a potent inflammatory stimulus, inducing chronic inflammation that contributes to many of the morbidities associated with SDB. Since epidemiological studies suggest that maternal inflammation is associated with the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in her offspring, we tested the hypothesis that in utero intermittent hypoxia impairs cognitive behavior in the offspring. Pregnant rat dams were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (8 hrs/day, 2 min 10.5% O2 separated by 2 min of 21% O2) or normoxia from gestation days 10-21 (GIH and GNX, respectively). Juvenile (3 week) and adult (8 week) offspring were tested in a Y-maze spontaneous alternation task, a well-validated index of spatial working memory. We found that spontaneous alternation performance was severely impaired in juvenile and adult male GIH offspring relative to GNX offspring, suggesting GIH results in early developmental emergence of working memory impairments. In contrast, female GIH offspring did not exhibit impairments in spatial working memory at either age. Microglia isolated from the forebrain of male GIH offspring exhibited significant reductions in the expression of the phagocytic receptor gene complement receptor 3 (CD11b), suggesting that GIH impairs microglial synaptic pruning activities. In the same samples, expression levels of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs), that are responsible for repressing gene expression, were increased. Since hypoxia enriches the transcriptional activation mark H3K4me3 in microglial cultures, we hypothesize that GIH upregulates DNMT gene expression via epigenetic histone alterations to fetal microglia, which represses microglial phagocytic gene expression. Together, these data suggest that GIH: 1) sex-dependently alters cognitive phenotypes in GIH offspring, and 2) may induce epigenetic suppression of microglial phagocytic activities that impair microglial synaptic pruning during development, altering forebrain synaptic connectivity in male offspring.

N2  - Aim: To determine the effect of music on sleep–wake cycle (SWC) patterns in late preterm neonates. Methods: In a masked crossover study, infants between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks gestation were randomised to music exposure either during the first six or last six hours of a 12-hour observation period. SWC characteristics were determined by continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) read by two coders masked to exposure sequence. Analysis was performed in paired comparisons. ANOVA was used to assess the effects of music exposure, period and crossover on SWC outcomes: (i) Burdjalov Scores (BS) during active sleep (AS) (ii) per cent and duration of quiet sleep (QS). Results: Thirty infants were studied. A total of 222 QS cycles (median seven per patient; range five to 12) were analysed. Music exposure was associated with higher BS (F = 10.60, p = 0.0019) in AS and decreased interruptions during QS. The advanced postconceptual age (PCA) SWC pattern during AS was equivalent to a one-week mean. Number, duration and ratio of QS cycles did not change with music exposure. Conclusion: Music exposure elicits an increasing PCA pattern in AS and fewer interruptions in QS. Music may benefit sleep in late preterm infants.

N2  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and markers of microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes. Study design: A total of 151 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited for repeat 24-h BP recordings thrice during pregnancy and once three months post partum. Fifty women without diabetes served as controls. The AASI and pulse pressure (PP) were computed from blood pressure recordings. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used for comparison between groups during and after pregnancy. Linear regression analysis was performed with AASI and PP as dependent variables and albuminuria and retinopathy as independent variables. Main outcome measures: AASI during diabetic pregnancy and association with microvascular disease. Results: Micro- or macroalbuminuria was present in 23% of the women and 58% had either simplex or proliferative retinopathy. The AASI was inversely associated with the coefficient of determination, which means that the stiffer vascular wall the more random variability in BP. Conclusion: AASI showed a strong association with microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes. Together with the flattened circadian rhythm this indicates a pregnancy-related functional change in the vascular bed.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy is increasing at an alarming rate, but virtually nothing is known about long-lasting effects on adult offspring physiology. Preliminary data suggest that microglia isolated from adult rat offspring exposed to in utero intermittent hypoxia exhibit enhanced inflammatory gene expression and primed responses to inflammatory stimuli. Since neuroinflammation abrogates some forms of respiratory plasticity, we tested the hypothesis that gestational intermittent hypoxia (GIH) impairs respiratory plasticity in adult offspring. Pregnant rat dams were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (8 hrs/day, 2 min 10.5% O2 separated by 2 min of 21% O2) or intermittent normoxia from gestation days 10-21 (GIH and GNX, respectively). Respiratory plasticity was assessed by measuring the response to recurrent neural apnea in urethane-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated male and female GNX and GIH offspring. Recurrent neural apnea was induced by briefly hyperventilating below the CO2 apneic threshold for breathing (5, ∼1 min neural apnea episodes, separated by 5 min). In GNX offspring, recurrent neural apnea triggered a significant increase in phrenic burst amplitude (45±3 %baseline, n=6, p<0.05), a form of plasticity known as inactivity-induced phrenic motor facilitation (iPMF). By contrast, intermittent neural apnea did not trigger increased phrenic burst amplitude in GIH offspring (7±8 %baseline, n=10, p>0.05), suggesting that in utero intermittent hypoxia impairs the capacity to elicit iPMF. Further, the phrenic response to intermittent neural apnea was significantly different in GIH and GNX rats (p<0.05). A critical role for microglial neuroinflammation is suggested by preliminary data indicating that the capacity to elicit iPMF can be restored in adult GIH offspring in which microglia are depleted with Pexidartinib (PLX3397) or following administration of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen. Since iPMF is hypothesized to be a compensatory form of respiratory plasticity that prevents recurrent apneas, the impact of impaired iPMF on breathing stability in adult GIH offspring during sleep is currently being investigated.

N2  - Although smoking while pregnant is associated with developmental abnormalities in newborns, at least 20% of women smoke during pregnancy. In addition, many women that quit smoking in pregnancy are prescribed nicotine replacement therapies, despite limited knowledge of its developmental consequences on the fetus. Human infants that were smoke-exposed in utero tend to have more obstructive apneas during sleep than unexposed infants. Here we report the results of experiments designed to examine the impact of developmental nicotine exposure (DNE) on motor output to upper airway muscles in neonatal rats. Pregnant dams were exposed to nicotine (6 mg/kg of nicotine tartrate daily) with an osmotic mini-pump implanted subdermally on the 5th day of gestation. Neonates (P3-P10) were lightly anesthetized and placed in a head out body plethysmograph to measure airflow, and fine wires were inserted into the genioglossus muscle to measure the EMG. We examined ventilatory and EMG responses during and after 15-sec nasal occlusions. The change in EMG burst amplitude in response to nasal occlusion was blunted in DNE animals compared to control, but only in animals younger than P7. DNE animals also show an increased latency period (time of first EMG burst after the onset of nasal occlusion) compared to control animals, again only in animals P7 and younger. Twelve of the 112 animals studied failed to recover following nasal occlusion, and 9 of those 12 were nicotine-exposed. These results show that nicotine exposure in-utero does alter upper airway protective reflexes in neonates by increasing the time it takes to respond to respiratory stress and blunting the magnitude of each effort to breathe during their response. Moreover, DNE animals were more likely to die following a nasal occlusion challenge.

N2  - Objectives To investigate whether the efficacy of low dose aspirin (LDA) in regulating gestational blood pressure (BP) and reducing the incidence of pre-eclampsia is dependent on the timing of dosing. Methods A systematic literature review to investigate evidence for the optimum timing of LDA administration, and the relationship of the timing of LDA with BP level and risk of pre-eclampsia. Results Five parallel randomised controlled trials have shown that evening compared with morning intake of LDA significantly reduces BP in non-pregnant patients with untreated mild, or prehypertension. One randomised trial of 257 mild hypertensive patients observed significant BP reduction in patients who received LDA at bedtime (decrease of 7.2/4.9 mmHg; P < 0.001). The pattern was reproducible where in another study of over 200 pre-hypertensive patients, significant BP reduction was noted in bedtime LDA group (decrease of 6/3 mmHg; P < 0.001). One randomised controlled trial in 350 pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia showed that nocturnal LDA compared with morning LDA significantly reduced BP and the incidence of pre-eclampsia (P < 0.001). Conclusion Despite the large number of pregnant women taking LDA as prophylaxis against pre-eclampsia, only one study has investigated and shown that nightly compared with morning LDA is more effective as prophylaxis against pre-eclampsia. However, the circadian rhythm of platelet aggregation supports a role for LDA to have optimum activity at night. As more women become eligible for pre-eclampsia prophylaxis, future studies into preeclampsia prophylaxis should consider the timing of LDA administration and the dose of LDA.

N2  - Introduction Sleepiness during work hours is the most common complaint of night shift workers, and is a sensitive indicator of performance decrements. Sleepiness levels vary between individuals, yet few have investigated individual factors as predictors of night shift sleepiness, and these have shown mixed results. We aimed to examine the effects of biopsycho- social factors on subjective sleepiness of nurses during the night shift. Methods Female nurses (n=119) working irregular rotating shifts were recruited from two hospitals in Northern Israel, using convenience sampling by clusters. Inclusion criteria were working at least 75% of full time, with at least one night shift per week. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, a diagnosed sleep disorder, and/or chronic medical conditions. Subjective sleepiness was measured hourly during two night shifts using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Sleep was monitored by actigraphy 24 hours before and until the end of the night shifts. Participants completed a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire for Shiftwork (MCTQshift), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS). Results Mixed models stepwise analyses found main effects for hour, age, cognitive pre-sleep arousal and number of children on nighttime sleepiness (all p<0.01). Effects of chronotype on sleepiness were inconsistent. Interactions were found for age∗number of children (p<0.01), pre-sleep cognitive arousal∗- chronotype (p<0.05), and age∗chronotype (p=0.06). Older nurses were less sleepy than younger nurses, but this impact was attenuated by early chronotype and having more children. High cognitive pre-sleep arousal, but not sleep, predicted increased sleepiness, especially in nurses with late chronotype. Discussion The impact of bio-psycho-social factors on night shift sleepiness is complex and depends on mutual interactions between these factors. Nurses who are young, late chronotypes and with high cognitive pre-sleep arousal require special attention and support, and must develop personal strategies for maintaining vigilance on the night shift.

N2  - A preference for eveningness (being a "night owl") and preterm birth (<37 weeks of gestation) are associated with similar adversities, such as elevated blood pressure, impaired glucose regulation, poorer physical fitness, and lower mood. Yet, it remains unclear if and how preterm birth is associated with circadian preference. The aim of this study was to assess this association across the whole gestation range, using both objective and subjective measurements of circadian preference. Circadian preference was measured among 594 young adults (mean age 24.3 years, SD 1.3) from two cohorts: the ESTER study and the Arvo Ylppö Longitudinal Study. We compared 83 participants born early preterm (<34 weeks) and 165 late preterm (34 to <37 weeks) with those born at term (≥37 weeks, n = 346). We also compared very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) participants with term-born controls. We obtained objective sleep data with actigraphs that were worn for a mean period of 6.8 (SD 1.4) nights. Our primary outcome was sleep midpoint during weekdays and weekend. The sleep midpoint is the half-way time between falling asleep and waking up, and it represents sleep timing. We also investigated subjective chronotype with the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) in 688 (n = 138/221/329) ESTER participants. The MEQ consists of 19 questions, which estimates the respondent to be of a "morning", "evening," or "intermediate" chronotype, based on the Morningness-Eveningness Score (MES). We analyzed the data from the actigraphs and the MES with three linear regression models, and analyzed distribution of the chronotype class with Pearson χ2. There were no consistent differences across the study groups in sleep midpoint. As compared with those born at term, the mean differences in minutes:seconds and 95% confidence intervals for the sleep midpoint were: early preterm weekdays 11:47 (-8:34 to 32:08), early preterm weekend 4:14 (-19:45 to 28:13), late preterm weekdays -10:28 (-26:16 to 5:21), and late preterm weekend -1:29 (-20:36 to 17:37). There was no difference in sleep timing between VLBW-participants and controls either. The distribution of chronotype in the MEQ among all participants was 12.4% morningness, 65.4% intermediate, and 22.2% eveningness. The distribution of the subjective chronotype class did not differ between the three gestational age groups (p = 0.98). The linear regression models did not show any influence of gestational age group or VLBW status on the MES (all p > 0.5). We found no consistent differences between adults born early or late preterm and those born at term in circadian preference. The earlier circadian preference previously observed in those born smallest is unlikely to extend across the whole range of preterm birth.

N2  - Introduction: Rare disorders such as narcolepsy require casting a broad net to identify potential patients for clinical trials. The present report presents the results of an internet based pre-selection recruitment methodology to accomplish this. A collaboration between Flamel Ireland/Avadel Ireland and Link2Trials used this approach to identify type 1 narcolepsy patients for potential eligibility for a clinical trial. Methods: The link to the pre-selection website was available via internet search engines as well as social media websites. The link had potential participants respond to 11 questions regarding their eligibility for the trial. A unique aspect of this study is that the previous use of sodium oxybate was an exclusion criteria. Thus the link did not merely identify narcolepsy subjects, but rather narcolepsy patients with cataplexy without a negative history of sodium oxybate use. Results: 836 people successfully completed the 11 questions online. Of those, 205 (24.5%) were eligible and were referred on to the nearest investigative site. The main reasons for exclusion were past sodium oxybate use (n=268), comorbid medical/sleep disorder (n=252) and narcolepsy without cataplexy (n=250). Other exclusion reasons included no narcolepsy diagnosis (n=156), working nights or shift work (n=76), driving for a living (n=60), not willing to discontinue contraindicated medication (eg. anti-cataplexy medication) (n=28), not willing to discontinue alcohol (n=19), not meeting excessive daytime sleepiness requirements (n=11), pregnancy/breastfeeding (n=7) and not willing to use electronic diary (n=3). Conclusion: The use of an internet based pre-selection system, even for rare conditions such as type 1 narcolepsy was shown to be an effective screening method to identify potential subjects meeting specific entry criteria. For this study, 205 (24.5%) individuals who completed the survey were eligible for clinical trial participation.

N2  - A 2-year-old child was delivered at term after twin pregnancy by ICSI with intrauterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 1710 g., length 43 cm, and head circumference 31.5. APGAR score was 6I, 8V, 9X. No family history of malformations, epilepsy, or intellectual disability was reported. The twin is healthy. Neonatal brain ultrasound was normal. Psychomotor delay was reported: he could sit unsupported at around 12 months of age and at 24 months he is unable to walk alone. First phonemes appeared at 24 months. The neurological examination showed severe generalized hypotonia with joint hyperlaxity, brisk symmetrical reflexes, and severe psychomotor delay. Severe dorsolumbar scoliosis was evident. Dysmorphological evaluation revealed a triangular face, low-set ears, microcephalia, and micrognathia. A craniospinal MRI performed at 2 years of age showed hypoplasia of the adenohypophysis associated with a minor dysmorphism of the brainstem characterized by a shorter midbrain, thinning of the periventricular white matter with enlargement of the lateral ventricles and frontal subarachnoid spaces. Molecular karyotyping (array-CGH) was performed showing partial deletion of 15 q 25.3 q 26.1 that includes 10 genes OMIN. The most important are CHD2, ACAN, and PLIN1. At the age of 18 months, he presented monthly tonic-clonic generalized seizures and daily absences. An electroencephalogram showed high amplitude centrotemporal spikes or sharp-and-slow wave complexes bilaterally with severe increase during the sleep. He was started on valproic acid and then topiramate with partial seizures control.

N2  - Introduction: Prolactin (PRL) secretion follows a circadian rhythm (CR) in parallel to Luteinizing hormone. Impaired CR of PRL was reported among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), who are at risk for hyperglycemia. They are classified as hyper or normo-prolactinemic based on 24 hr PRL profiles; which could guide the development of therapies. Such 24 hr assessment is not practical in larger clinical trials. We explored an alternative model and evaluated whether PRL follows predictable changes after glucose (GLU) ingestion during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in normoglycemic women (NW) and hyperglycemic women (HW). PRL levels were measured using blood samples collected during OGTT and stored for a different study. Study Objectives The primary objective was to describe PRL change after GLU ingestion during OGTT among NW and HW. The secondary objective was to correlate PRL change (from baseline (B) with peak GLU levels in each group. Normoglycemia was defined as fasting GLU < 100 mg/dl 1 hr GLU < 160 mg/dl and 2 hrs GLU level < 140 mg/dl. Methods: The excess of blood samples pre-approved IRB. The investigators of this study are blinded to identifying data. Women who were pregnant, treated with corticosteroids, oral contraceptive pills and/or diabetes medications or who had bariatric surgery were excluded. Changes in PRL levels during OGTT were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis test. The relationship between changes in PRL levels and peak GLU were assessed using Spearman's correlations (rho). Results: A total of 79 women met the criteria. PRL levels were significantly lower after GLU ingestion. The delta change (decrease) in PRL levels was smaller in association with higher GLU levels [rho 0.33 95% CI (0.13 0.51); P=0.01 at 1 hr]. Data are presented as median and quartile levels [Q1 Q3] for BMI in kg/m2 GLU in mg/dl and PRL in μIU/ml (nl: 96 - 570). NW (n=33) had BMI of 26.8 [23.6 33.4], B GLU 84 [80 86] 1hr peak Glu 108 [88 126] with corresponding B PRL 277 [234 511] and 1hr PRL 234 [170 468]. HW (n=46) had BMI of 29.5 kg/m2 [25.6 37.2], B GLU 92 [85 104] 1 hr peak GLU 191 [164 220] with corresponding B PRL 191 [149 298] and 1 hr PRL 170 [106 277]. There was no significant correlation between change in PRL and peak GLU at 1 hr among NW women (rho 0.16; p=0.38). PRL changes at 1 hr in HW were associated with peak GLU levels (rho 0.38; p=0.010); they had less reduction in PRL level. Discussion: To our knowledge, our study is among few to describe prolactin changes during OGTT and the first to show attenuated PRL response to GLU ingestion in association with hyperglycemia among women; the underlying hypothesis is altered CR. This finding should be further confirmed in a larger sample of prospectively enrolled patients. If confirmed, we can then evaluate for its association with PCOS.

N2  - Women represent more than half the number of people living with HIV worldwide. Young women between 10 and 24 years of age have twice the risk of HIV infection than men of the same age, and some contraceptive methods, such as medroxyprogesterone injections, have been associated with an increase of more than 40% in the risk of acquiring the virus. However, in our region, probably the biggest concern of women in this age range is not that of acquiring HIV but that of an unwanted pregnancy. The health topics relevant to women living with HIV differ according to age. For young women with HIV infection, contraception, pregnancy and HPV infection are the topics most frequently addressed during consultation. In older women, the topics are menopause, bone mineral disease, cardiovascular risk, neurocognitive disorders and cancer (associated or not with HIV/AIDS). Regarding mental health issues, we found that up to 82% of women present with depressive symptoms, anxiety and/or sleep disorders at some point throughout life. For the treating clinician of a woman living with HIV, it becomes a challenge to control the infection with antiretroviral therapy at each stage of the patient's life. This is because there may be multiple interactions between medical therapies such as contraceptives and hormone therapy with antiretrovirals, and also because of the effects that some antiretrovirals may have in skeletal, nervous and cardiovascular systems.

N2  - Aim: Gather ‘proof-of-concept’ evidence of the adverse developmental potential of cotinine (a seemingly benign biomarker of recent nicotine/tobacco smoke exposure). Methods: Pregnant C57 mice drank nicotine- or cotinine-laced water for 6 wks from conception (NPRE = 2% saccharin + 100 μg nicotine/mL; CPRE = 2% saccharin + 10 μg cotinine/mL) or 3 wks after birth (CPOST = 2% saccharin + 30 μg cotinine/mL). Controls drank 2% saccharin (CTRL). At 17 ± 1 weeks (male pups; CTRL n = 6; CPOST n = 6; CPRE n = 8; NPRE n = 9), we assessed (i) cardiovascular control during sleep; (ii) arterial reactivity ex vivo; and (iii) expression of genes involved in arterial constriction/dilation. Results: Blood cotinine levels recapitulated those of passive smoker mothers’ infants. Pups exposed to cotinine exhibited (i) mild bradycardia – hypotension at rest (p < 0.001); (ii) attenuated (CPRE, p < 0.0001) or reverse (CPOST; p < 0.0001) BP stress reactivity; (iii) adrenergic hypocontractility (p < 0.0003), low protein kinase C (p < 0.001) and elevated adrenergic receptor mRNA (p < 0.05; all drug-treated arteries); and (iv) endothelial dysfunction (NPRE only). Conclusion: Cotinine has subtle, enduring developmental consequences. Some cardiovascular effects of nicotine can plausibly arise via conversion into cotinine. Low-level exposure to this metabolite may pose unrecognised perinatal risks. Adults must avoid inadvertently exposing a foetus or infant to cotinine as well as nicotine.

N2  - Aim: Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) rates for Māori and Pacific infants remain higher than for other ethnic groups in New Zealand and bed-sharing is a major risk factor when there is smoking exposure in pregnancy. Sleep space programmes of education and Pēpi-Pod baby beds require evaluation. Methods: Two hundred and forty Māori and Pacific women and infants were randomised 1:1, to the Pēpi-Pod sleep space programme, or to a control group with ‘usual care’. When infants were under 2 weeks of age, baseline interviews occurred, followed up by interviews at 2 and 4 months of age to assess safe sleep knowledge, infant care practices and Pēpi-Pod use and acceptability. All participants were offered a New Zealand Standard approved portable cot. Results: At baseline, 25% of babies did not have a baby bed. Knowledge of smoking and bed-sharing as SUDI risks improved at follow-up in both groups. One quarter regularly bed-shared at follow-up in both groups. Intention to bed-share was a strong predictor of subsequent behaviour. Pēpi-Pods were regularly used by 46% at 2 months and 16% at 4 months follow-up. Conclusions: Bed-sharing and knowledge improvement were similar irrespective of group. It is likely that the impact of the intervention was reduced because the control group received better support than ‘usual care’ and all participants had a baby bed. New Zealand SUDI rates have declined since sleep space programmes have been available. Sleep space programmes should be prioritised for those with modifiable SUDI risk.

N2  - Background: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger prospective cohort study, which will aim at determining the independent contribution of male and female lifestyle-related factors to assisted reproductive technology (ART) success. The study also examined whether couples seeking fertility treatments present lifestyle-related factors that may interfere with their reproductive health. Materials and Methods: This prospective pilot study was conducted in a fertility clinic between May 2015 and February 2016. Feasibility factors evaluated were recruitment rates, compliance with the protocol, retention rate and ART outcomes at six-month follow-up. Anthropometric profile and lifestyle habits of both partners were evaluated before the beginning of infertility treatments. Results: We approached 130 eligible infertile couples. Among them, 32 (25%) agreed to participate and 28 (88%) complied with the protocol. At six-month follow-up, seven couples (25%) did not start, or stop, infertility treatments and 13 couples (62%) achieved a clinical pregnancy. Among the 28 couples included in the analyses, 16% of the partners were obese and 23% had abdominal obesity. The majority of the subjects were still drinking alcohol (84%). Sixty-eight percent of women needed improvement in their diet (vs. 95% of men, P=0.05) and none of them achieved the Canadian recommendations for physical activity (vs. 33% of men, P=0.001). Moreover, 35% of the partners had a poor sleep quality. Overall, women presented a worse reproductive health profile than men, with 3.1 and 2.4 out of seven adverse factors, respectively (P=0.04). Conclusion: Conducting a large prospective cohort study in our fertility clinic will be feasible but recruitment and compliance with the protocol need to be improved. Many women and men seeking fertility treatments present unfavourable lifestyle-related factors that may explain, at least partially, their difficulties in conceiving.

N2  - Objectives: Infants are at risk of overweight. Infant overweight predisposes child, adolescent, and adult to obesity. We hypothesized that parent education, initiated prenatally and provided in the home, would reduce the incidence of infant overweight at age 12 months. Methods: Pregnant obese Latina women were recruited at Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and randomized to intervention versus control. Intervention subjects received home visits by trained Spanish-fluent community health workers who provided counseling on infant growth, breastfeeding, nutrition, child development, sleep, physical activity, and safety. Promotoras did not visit the control subjects. A research assistant collected outcome data on all subjects. Results: Compared to controls, parent education did not reduce infant overweight. Infant overweight developed rapidly and was present in 46% of infants by age 6 months. Infants overweight at 6 months were likely to be overweight at age 12 months (r = 0.60, P <.0001). Overweight was more common in formula-fed infants at ages 6 months (P <.06) and 12 months (P =.005). Breastfeeding was less common in families with employed mothers (P =.02) and unemployed fathers (P <.01), but the father living with the mother at the time of the prenatal visit predicted successful breastfeeding at infant age 2 months (P <.003). Compared to formula feeding, overweight at age 12 months was 2.7 times less likely for infants breastfed for ≥2 months (P =.01). Conclusions: The lack of success of the intervention may be explained in part by a high cesarean section rate in the intervention group, food and employment insecurity, and confounding by WIC breastfeeding promotion, which was available to all mothers. Breastfeeding was the most important mediator of infant overweight. The study supports efforts by WIC to vigorously promote breastfeeding.

N2  - Background: As part of the medicines optimisation CQUIN, NHS Trusts have been tasked with switching patients to generics/best value treatment including switching from ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r) to cobicistat-boosted PI therapy (PI/c). We aimed to examine how many patients started on PI/c switched to a different third agent/booster, and reasons why. Methods: We interrogated our pharmacy database for patients who had ever been prescribed PI/c, and those with a subsequent prescription for a different third agent/booster. We confirmed switches off PI/c via the electronic patient record, with additional data for patients who switched. Lower than expected denominators indicate missing data. Results: 801 people had ever been prescribed PI/c, between April 2016 and Dec 2017. 76% were prescribed darunavir/c (608/801) and 24% atazanavir/c (193/801). 59% were male (472/796); 46% were Black African (345/752); median age 46 years. 10% of people prescribed PI/c switched to another third agent or booster (81/801). 11% of people who switched were naïve to ART when PI/c was prescribed (9/81). Third agents prior to start of PI/c in experienced patients who switched were: 72% darunavir/r (51/71); 24% atazanavir/r (17/71); 4% other (3/71). People who switched were more likely to be Black African: 54% vs. 45% of people who did not switch (p=0.04). There was no difference in switch rate with gender, median age, or between darunavir/c & atazanavir/c. Indication for switching off PI/c was intolerance in 44% (35/79); 15% pill size (12/79); 9% treatment failure/resistance (7/79); 9% renal function (7/79); 4% drug interaction (3/79); 4% to improve CNS penetration (3/79); 3% pregnancy/conception (2/79); 3% pill burden (2/79); and 10% other (8/79). The most common adverse events in people switching due to intolerance were: 43% gastrointestinal upset (15/35); 17% sleep disturbance/vivid dreams (6/35); 11% fatigue (4/35); 11% rash (4/35); 9% mood disturbance (3/35); 9% weight gain (3/35) and 9% leg pain (3/35). 77% of experienced patients who switched off PI/c reverted to their original PI/r regimen (55/71); 48% of these patients switched back due to intolerance (26/ 54); 19% pill size (10/54) and 33% another reason (18/54). Conclusion: We found a 10% switch rate in 801 patients prescribed PI/c, with the majority of experienced patients who switched going back to their previous PI/r. Clinicians should be cautious that a 'routine' switch of PI formulation may be destabilising.

N2  - With rapid urbanization and life style changes, loud noise is omnipresent and has become a part of life. Indoor and outdoor environmental noise pollution have been documented as a serious health hazard with increasing adverse effects on fetus, infants, children, adolescents and adults. Noise induced hearing loss and non-auditory adverse effects due to noise pollution, are being increasingly diagnosed in all age groups including the fetus. Outdated motorized vehicles, machinery, increasing traffic, congested residential areas, crowded educational institutions and workplaces, unregulated commercial and industrial noise have become a source of noise pollution with long-term disability. Areas of noise pollution must be identified and corrective measures be taken. Toys, personal, domestic, commercial, industrial equipment should be within the safe sound intensity. Loudspeakers and vehicular horns should be banned except in emergencies. Nocturnal noise pollution must be avoided near residential areas as sleep disturbances have serious long-term health consequences. Pregnant women, fetus, newborns, infants and children are most susceptible to noise induced health hazards and should be given utmost protection. Educational institutions, workplaces, commercial and industrial areas should be regularly monitored for noise levels and protective ear muffs and plugs be used. Public be educated repeatedly regarding health hazards of noise. Traffic noise should be regulated to be within safe limits. Bus-stands, railway stations and airports should be moved away from residential areas. Houses should be sound proofed suitably. Long term studies should be conducted in pregnant women, newborn children and adults to have more data on hazards of noise pollution.

N2  - Aims: We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time. Methods: The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age. Results: Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later. Conclusions: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.

N2  - Background: Depression, a psychological disorder manifested as persistent sadness, sleep disturbance etc. is a threatening condition during pregnancy, as it has been shown to be associated with adverse maternal and fetal consequences. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of antenatal depression in a hospital based sample in Lahore, Pakistan, ascertaining its significant predictors and frequently utilized coping techniques. Methods: A total of 197 antenatal attendees within the age limit of 20-40 years, visiting the out-patient department of the said tertiary-care hospital, were accepted as the study participants. Subjects receiving psychiatric treatment or anti depressant medication were excluded from the study. Beck's Depression Inventory, was utilized as the screening tool for depression. Results: Brief COPE was employed to assess the use of various coping strategies. Pearson Chi square and multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate significant risk factors and predictors respectively, for development of depression. As per investigation, 57.4% participants screened negative for depression, 23.4% showed mild mood disturbance, 4.6% screened positive for borderline clinical depression, 10.2% presented with moderate depression, 3.6% elicited severe depression and 1% reported with extreme depression. Conclusion: History of abortion/miscarriage, unplanned pregnancy, separation from husband and stressful life events, were identified as the predictors of antenatal depression. Great majority of the sample population used Problem Focused Coping techniques.

N2  - Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study assessed the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in obese pregnant females with GDM and OSA. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted (April 2014-June 2016). Obese females at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and with diet-controlled GDM were screened for OSA. Those with OSA were randomly assigned to receive 2 weeks nightly CPAP or be part of a waitlist control group. After 2 weeks, all patients were offered CPAP. The primary outcome was glucose metabolism, obtained from an oral meal tolerance test (MTT) at baseline and 2 weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were collected. Results: Eighteen patients were randomized to CPAP and 18 to control groups. There were no significant changes between groups in fasting glucose, glucose response to MTT, and insulin sensitivity or secretion after 2 weeks. Those adherent to CPAP had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .016) compared to the control group. When a counterfactual instrumental variable approach was applied to deal with nonadherence, the CPAP group had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .002) and insulin sensitivity (P = .015). Lower rates of preterm delivery (P = .002), unplanned cesarean section (P = .005), and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (P < .001) were observed among those who used CPAP longer than 2 weeks. Conclusions: Two weeks of CPAP in females with GDM and OSA did not result in improved glucose levels, but insulin secretion improved in those adherent to CPAP. Continued CPAP use was possibly associated with improved pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Objective: Sleep complaints are clinically expected in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep–wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver’s informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns. Results: A total of 4008 words were indexed where sleep took the 91st place of most important words. Sleep and wake were however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were: night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, and wake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were: huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a ‘family’ issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostly night was associatively conversed, the association of Routines, Managing, and Planning with sleep underscores the challenges faced. Conclusion: When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate ‘sleep’ but rather ‘night’ with FASD-characteristics. Increased sleep awareness combined with educational initiatives regarding sleep are advocated.

N2  - Clock gene oscillations are necessary for a successful pregnancy and parturition, but little is known about their function during lactation, a period demanding from the mother multiple physiological and behavioral adaptations to fulfill the requirements of the offspring. First, we will focus on circadian rhythms and clock genes in reproductive tissues mainly in rodents. Disruption of circadian rhythms or proper rhythmic oscillations of clock genes provoke reproductive problems, as found in clock gene knockout mice. Then, we will focus mainly on the rabbit doe as this mammal nurses the young just once a day with circadian periodicity. This daily event synchronizes the behavior and the activity of specific brain regions critical for reproductive neuroendocrinology and maternal behavior, like the preoptic area. This region shows strong rhythms of the PER1 protein (product of the Per1 clock gene) associated with circadian nursing. Additionally, neuroendocrine cells related to milk production and ejections are also synchronized to daily nursing. A threshold of suckling is necessary to entrain once a day nursing; this process is independent of milk output as even virgin does (behaving maternally following anosmia) can display circadian nursing behavior. A timing motivational mechanism may regulate such behavior as mesolimbic dopaminergic cells are entrained by daily nursing. Finally, we will explore about the clinical importance of circadian rhythms. Indeed, women in chronic shift-work schedules show problems in their menstrual cycles and pregnancies and also have a high risk of preterm delivery, making this an important field of translational research.

N2  - Introduction: Numerous physiologic and anatomic changes during pregnancy exacerbate or unmask obstructive sleep apnea in women. Left untreated, upper airway flow limitation during pregnancy may lead to dire maternal and fetal health consequences. Areas covered: This review outlines the relationship between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. It also discusses the implications of SDB on fetal and maternal health and concludes with a review of the emerging literature of treatment options for SDB in pregnancy and its benefit. Expert commentary: Providers should screen, recognize, and treat SDB in pregnant women given its implicated risk on maternal and fetal health. This is particularly true in preeclampsia, a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality where SDB has been shown to add risk and severity. It is important to note that repetitive upper airway flow limitations in pregnancy are associated with surges in nocturnal blood pressure and poor maternal and fetal outcomes, and may be just as detrimental as frank apneas/hypopneas. Future large, prospective, randomized controlled studies on the effects of CPAP are still needed. The epidemiology of SDB in pregnant women needs to be further studied, as well as highlighting the need for systematic, long-term follow ups on mother and infant health post-delivery.

N2  - Objectives: The prevalence of RLS in pregnancy is higher when compared with the general population however it remains unknown among indigenous black Africans. Available data indicate that RLS is uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa. We embarked on this study to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in an antenatal clinic sample of Nigerian pregnant women compared with a primary care sample of non-pregnant women. Methods: A total of 310 pregnant women and non-pregnant women filled out a questionnaire which incorporated the 2014 minimal criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Demographic and clinical data, including sleep duration and samples for blood hemoglobin concentration and urinalysis were obtained. Results: The mean ages of the pregnant and non-pregnant women were 24.9 ± 5.6 years and 23.6 + 5.4 years, respectively (p = 0.003). There was no case of RLS found among pregnant women while five (1.6%) of the non-pregnant women fulfilled the criteria for RLS. Overall, the prevalence report of RLS symptoms was associated with lower mean habitual nocturnal sleep duration (p < 0.05) coffee (p = 0.013) and kola nut (0.023) consumption, report of leg cramps (p < 0.001) and proteinuria (p = 0.047), Report of leg cramps and proteinuria were independently associated with RLS. Conclusion: The prevalence of restless legs syndrome is low among women of child-bearing age in the Nigerian population and may be lower in pregnancy. Report of leg cramps and proteinuria are independently associated with RLS.

N2  - Study Objectives In humans and other mammals, sleep is altered during pregnancy. However, no studies have been conducted on sleep/wakefulness during pregnancy in mice. In this study, we examined sleep/wakefulness in female C57BL/6 mice during pregnancy. We also examined sleep/wake behaviors in an animal model of preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertensive (PAH) mice, in which increased angiotensin causes hypertension. Methods Sleep/wake behaviors of female C57BL/6 and PAH mice were examined based on electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram recordings before, during, and after pregnancy. To examine whether high blood pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in PAH mice, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (olmesartan)-administered PAH mice and female Tsukuba hypertensive mice were also examined. Results C57BL/6 mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time during late pregnancy. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy. PAH mice exhibited a general slowing of EEG during late pregnancy and subsequently returned to apparently normal sleep/wakefulness after delivery. All PAH mice exhibited multiple focal leakages of Evans blue dye in the brain. Spike-and-wave discharges were observed in 50% of PAH mice. Olmesartan-administered PAH mice did not show general slowing of EEG. Tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time spent in wakefulness and NREM sleep and a decreased total REM sleep time. Conclusions This study showed pregnant-stage-specific changes in sleep/wakefulness in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, PAH mice may be useful as an animal model for eclampsia.

N2  - Purpose: Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to sleep-disordered breathing. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy is associated with poor pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Oxidative stress caused by intermittent hypoxemia and reoxygenation may impact pregnancy health. We hypothesize that pregnant women with OSA have a pronounced oxidative stress profile. Methods: A case-control study was performed to study oxidative stress markers in the serum of pregnant women with or without OSA. Patients with OSA were identified between 2003 and 2009. Contemporaneous controls were pregnant subjects without apnea, gasping, or snoring around the time of delivery. Serum markers of oxidative and carbonyl stress were measured by spectrophotometric/fluorometric methods. Multiple linear regression analysis was used with a model including age, body mass index at delivery, history of diabetes, and gestational age. Results: Serum samples from 23 OSA cases and 41 controls were identified. Advanced oxidation protein products, a marker for oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a marker for carbonyl stress, were significantly lower in women with OSA than in controls (p value OpenSPiltSPi0.0001). Total antioxidant capacity was higher in women with OSA in comparison to controls (p value OpenSPiltSPi0.0001). The difference in AGEs remained significant even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: Contrary to our hypothesis, the results of this study suggest that pregnant women with OSA have higher antioxidant capacity and lower oxidative and carbonyl stress markers compared to controls, suggesting a possible protective effect of intermittent hypoxia. Whether OSA in pregnancy impacts oxidative stress differently than OSA in the general population remains to be confirmed.

N2  - Objective A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to determine whether pregnant women diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) are more likely to have adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes compared to women without a diagnosis of SDB during pregnancy (controls). Methods PubMed, Embase and Cinahl databases were searched for publications prior to June 2017 from the last 30 years. Full text studies only, in English, including case series (with a sample number of 10 or greater) and reports of SDB in human pregnancy were included. Only studies that reported on SDB in relation to gestational age or birthweight at delivery, pre-term birth, mode of delivery, cord pH, Apgar score, nursery admission, stillbirth or perinatal death, meconium at delivery or wound complications were included. Results A total of 1576 results were identified with 33 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with preterm birth (<37 weeks of gestation) (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.57-1.92). Babies of women with SDB were at a higher risk of having a low birthweight baby (<2500 g) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.43-2.23), a 5-minute Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.42-2.41), having a stillbirth or perinatal death (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.18-3.03), and having a neonatal nursery admission (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.43-1.78). Women with SDB were also less likely to have a vaginal delivery (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78-0.86) and at a higher risk of having an assisted vaginal delivery (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.09-2.67) or a caesarean section delivery (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.33-1.44). The risk of both elective (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.59) and emergency caesarean (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.20-1.72) was increased. Women with a diagnosis of SDB were significantly older (MD 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-1.92) and had a significantly higher BMI (MD 1.38, 95% CI 1.13-1.64) than those that did not. Conclusion Maternal SDB is associated with adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. Clinicians and pregnant women need to be aware of the increased risk of these adverse outcomes associated with SDB during pregnancy. Further studies are urgently needed to inform advice on best sleep practices to employ during pregnancy for the health of the fetus and to improve outcomes.

N2  - Objectives Much of the literature on psychosocial burden of Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) relates to the mother. Yet, little is known about the psychological and behavioural outcomes of children exposed to maternal HG. One study linked in utero exposure of HG with long-term affective disorders in adulthood; however, how the severity of maternal vomiting relates to behaviours in early childhood is not clearly documented. Methods Data were obtained from the Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study (n = 1247). Pregnant women of Chinese, Indian, and Malay ethnicity were recruited in their first trimester of pregnancy and 1172 with singleton pregnancies responded to a structured questionnaire at 26-28 weeks of gestation about first and second trimester nausea and vomiting. Medical records were utilized to confirm the severity of the vomiting, including antiemetic medications and admissions. Cases were categorised into 3 severity groups: 1) no vomiting (n = 296), 2) mild-moderate vomiting (n = 686), 3) severe vomiting (n = 190), of which 35% required hospital admission for rehydration. Children underwent at least 15 developmental assessment visits in their first 7 years of life. The outcomes of this study were behaviours from the 12-month Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), total score from the 18-month Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT), cognitive score from the 24-month Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, T-scores from the 24-month Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and composite IQ score from the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT). Analyses were adjusted for gestational age, birthweight Z-scores, maternal age, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, smoking, baby gender, breastfeeding, antenatal and postnatal maternal anxiety and depression, and household income. Results Among the women in this Asian study, 22% had severe vomiting and 58.5% mild-moderate vomiting. After controlling for pregnancy, child, and maternal factors, the severity of vomiting (no, mild-moderate, severe) was predictive of socialemotional functioning of the child at 12 months (externalizing symptoms β=0.117, P = 0.006; dysregulation β=0.106, P = 0.005), autism symptoms at 18 months (β=3.737, P = 0.036) and a variety of behavioural problems at 24 months (Total behavioural problem β=5.552, P = 0.005 affective disorders β=3.805, P = 0.003, sleep β=2.423, P = 0.026, attention problem β=3.511, P = 0.002, and poor emotional control β=2.383, P = 0.017). Severity of vomiting did not predict cognitive and IQ skills in the Bayley Scales (β=-2.360, P = 0.297) and KBIT-2 (β=-2.639, P = 0.300), respectively. Conclusion HG is highly prevalent in this Asian cohort. Compared to no maternal vomiting, severe vomiting during pregnancy was associated with multiple child neurobehavioural problems and autism-related symptoms in early childhood.

N2  - Introduction.- Sleep disturbances in early childhood are linked to several behavioral and psychological problems. Moreover, some prenatal factors have been found to influence infants' sleep. Among them, most of the studies have been focused on prenatal depression and/or anxiety, whereas other relevant psychological factors during pregnancy have not been acknowledged. Objectives.- We aimed to examine the effect of several clinical and psychological maternal problems during pregnancy (i.e., anxiety, depression, sleep problems, alcohol abuse, seasonality, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder-ADHD, and/or trauma) on the onset of sleep problems (i.e., short sleep, night awakenings, circadian rhythm and self-shooting problems, and irregular sleeping routine) in infants at 3 months of age. Methods.- A sample of 1221 cases was recruited, with subjective measures during pregnancy in mothers, and at 3months after birth in infants. Results.-Wefound that somematernal problems during pregnancy were able to explain the onset of some sleep disturbances in infants at 3 months of age. Interestingly, ADHD symptomatology in mothers was the variable that predicted the highest number of sleep disturbances at 3 months. Conclusions.- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the effect of several maternal prenatal factors on child sleep, and not exclusively anxiety and depression.

N2  - Background: There is recent interest exploring the possible impact of sleep disordered breathing on the mechanisms of preeclampsia. A biomarker of preeclampsia, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, has come to prominence in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between continuous positive airway pressure treatment, sleep disordered breathing and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations during pregnancy. Methods: A 38-year-old G1P0 presented at 20 + 5 weeks. She had a history of chronic hypertension. Sleep studies revealed she had sleep disordered breathing with an AHI of 7.3/h. She was commenced on continuous positive airway pressure. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations and blood pressure recordings were taken at various points during her pregnancy. Results: She did not develop preeclampsia or require an escalation in her antihypertensives. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations rose 16% from a low baseline. She remained compliant with her continuous positive airway pressure. She progressed to birth a well, live, term baby. Conclusion: Continuous positive airway pressure treatment controlled sleep disordered breathing in a high risk pregnant woman with chronic hypertension with no increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations.

N2  - Background: In individual studies maternal supine going-tosleep position is reported to increase the risk of late stillbirth (≥28 week) 2.3 to 6.2 fold compared to left side position. We aimed to: 1) confirm the relationship between going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth risk and 2) test for interactions between sleep position and indicators of fetal vulnerability (small for gestational age [SGA], maternal smoking, and obesity). Methods: We searched publications identified by systematic bibliographic searches for studies that collected data on: women with late stillbirth and pregnant controls matched for gestation, and late pregnancy sleep position with no sleep position intervention. One-step meta-analysis of individual participant data using mixed-effects models was performed. Results: We identified data from four case-control studies (cases, n=713 late stillbirths; controls, n=1804). Pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for supine going-to-sleep position compared to left side was 3.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.29 to 4.9), and for right side, 1.11 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.38) compared to left side. There was no significant interaction between supine going-to-sleep position and maternal obesity (p=0.10), smoking (p=0.52), or SGA (p=0.21). Conclusions: As there was no interaction with measures of vulnerability, supine going-to-sleep position can be considered a risk factor for late stillbirth in all pregnancies, with no difference in fetal outcome risk between left and right side going-to-sleep position for women in the third trimester.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are multifactorial diseases caused by complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, analyses of both factors are important to develop methods of early detection and prevention of such diseases. However, most of the previous researches have used self-report questionnaires to collect information on environmental factors, and had limitations in the frequency of data acquisition and the objectivity of the information. METHODS: We are conducting a prospective cohort study “Maternity Log Study” of pregnant women. By using a smart phone and monitoring devices, participants (n=302) upload daily life-logs including biometric information on more than 20 items such as home blood pressure, as well as lifestyle information on more than 10 items such as hours of sleep. Furthermore, we collected specimens including blood, saliva, dental plaque, and urine for multi-omics analyses. This study protocol obtained approval from the ethics review committee established by Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine (ID 2014-1-704). In the present study, we demonstrated differences in life-logs between an HDP (n=17) and control (n=124) groups. Furthermore, prediction models for onset of HDP was exhibited based on machine learning method. RESULTS: We found significant differences in several items of life-logs between the two groups. Interestingly, sleep quality of the HDP group was stably and significantly poorer than the control group. In addition, HDP group showed larger numbers of days with palpitation after 28 weeks of gestation. Next, we established prediction models using several life-logs. A leave-one-out cross-validation demonstrated the specificity of 0.82, and the sensitivity of 0.88 at the 24 weeks. Moreover, we found that the prediction models showed better performance, when increased numbers of time-points of life-logs were used in the models. CONCLUSION: By analyzing daily life-logs during pregnancy, we identified candidate life-log predictors for HDP. These results may contribute to the development of future monitoring service for pregnant women to predict onset of HDP.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Women who work night shifts are at increased risk of several pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, low birth weight, and preterm birth. Long term, we aim to develop an animal model and clinical infrastructure with which to determine the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and develop interventions to prevent them. Here, we present the first steps in this process: defining the effects of pregnancy on chronotype (an individual's preferred daily wake time) in women and assessing the utility of mice to model any changes. METHODS: We recruited 25 day-shift-working women attempting to become pregnant. They wore actigraphy watches to allow us to measure mid-sleep phase and sleep duration continuously over a two-week period before pregnancy and continuously from pregnancy confirmation until delivery. We allowed adult C57BL6/NJ mice access to a running wheel, which we used to continuously monitor their activity on a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle from the observation of vaginal plug until delivery. In mice, we measured the timing of the daily onset of activity, day-to-day period variability, percentage of activity during the light, total and duration of daily activity, and number of activity bouts. Prism or customized Python scripts were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Women's mid-sleep phase was significantly earlier in the first (18.30 ± 38.40 min) trimester than in pre-pregnancy (P<0.05). Additionally, their sleep duration was significantly longer in the first (40.40 + 46.55 min; P<0.01) and second (increase of 28.30 ± 46.6 min; P<0.01) trimesters than before pregnancy. Similar to humans, pregnant mice (as early as day three of gestation) became active earlier in the day than non-pregnant mice (17.71 ± 0.41 hr vs. 19.11 ± 0.25 hr, P<0.05), spent more time being active in the light phase (33.26 ± 2.92% vs. 20.98 ± 1.45%, P<0.05), and had 20-fold more variability in the timing of daily activity onsets (2.72 ± 0.24 hr. vs 0.13 ± 0.03 hr, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: In day-shift-working women, pregnancy shifts chronotype and sleep duration. These changes are modeled in mice. Future efforts will focus on pregnancy outcomes in night and rotating-shift-working women and experimental and genetic models of disrupted chronotype in mice.

N2  - Background: In individual studies maternal supine going-tosleep position is reported to increase the risk of late stillbirth (≥28 weeks gestation) compared to a left-sided position. To understand the variation between individual studies' estimates we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Methods: We conducted systematic bibliographic searches, for studies that collected data on: pregnancy sleep position, late stillbirth, with pregnant controls at similar gestational ages to stillbirth cases, and had no sleep position intervention. Meta-analysis was performed; heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Results: We identified 4 case-control which studies met the inclusion criteria. The sample for meta-analysis comprised 713 late stillbirths and 1804 live-born controls. Going to sleep in the supine position compared with all other positions was associated with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 2.62 (95% CI 1.83-3.76), and an I2 of 0. Going to sleep on the left compared to all of positions, showed a reduced pooled OR (0.76 (0.63-0.91) and there was no effect of right sided sleeping (0.88 (0.72-1.07). The heterogeneity of the pooled estimates was 68.4% and 26.5% for left and rightsided going to sleep position. Conclusions: This meta-analysis confirms that supine going to sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. There is little variation between the individual estimates, and difference is likely due to chance rather than systematic differences between studies. Further studies are needed to understand the origin of the observed heterogeneity in left and right-sided going to sleep position.

N2  - Context: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects postpartum glucose metabolism and future risk of type 2 diabetes. Pregnancy and GDM are related to disturbed circadian rhythms and sleeping, which are determined by genetic variations in genes such as Melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B). Objective: We prospectively assessed whether the circadian rhythms related MTNR1B genotype was related to on 1-5 years of postpartum glycemic changes among women with a history of GDM, and whether gestational weight gain modified such associations. Design: The established circadian rhythms-associated MTNR1B genetic variant (rs10830963) was genotyped in 1025 Chinese women with a history of GDM. Body weight and glycemic traits during and after pregnancy were longitudinally collected. Results: The frequency of MTNR1B rs10830963 was not different among the three categories of gestational weight gain (inadequate, adequate, and excessive). We found women carrying different MTNR1B genotype showed distinct postpartum changes in 2-h glucose (OGTT)-0.36, 0.20, and-0.19 mmol/L per additional copy of the G allele in women with inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight gain, respectively (p for interaction=0.028). The corresponding changes in fasting glucose were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.01, though the modification effects of gestational weight gain on the genetic association was marginal (p for interaction= 0.067). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that gestational weight gain may modify the circadian rhythms related MTNR1B genetic variant on long term glycemic changes, highlighting the significance of gestational weight management in diabetes prevention among women with GDM.

N2  - Objective: To compare perinatal outcomes, blood pressures throughout pregnancy, rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and immediate obstetric outcomes in adolescents younger than 20 years at delivery and those in the 20- to 34-year age group. Patients and Methods: Questionnaires were administered to pregnant women at Campbelltown and Liverpool hospitals within South West Sydney, Australia, as part of a broader study of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy between February 1, 2009, and February 28, 2013. Data collected included demographic data, blood pressure readings, pregnancy complications, delivery type, and neonatal outcomes. Adolescents were compared with older women using Student t tests and χ2 statistics. Results: A total of 103 adolescents were compared with 2291 women aged 20 to 34 years. Adolescents were more likely to be primiparous, had longer average gestations, and had lower pre-pregnancy body mass index. Adolescents had lower rates of cesarean section delivery and gestational diabetes mellitus. There was no significant difference in smoking rates, perinatal mortality rate, small for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes, admission to special care nursery, or hypertensive disorder of pregnancy rates. Adolescents had lower booking systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and their highest antenatal systolic blood pressures were lower. Conclusion: Adolescents have birth outcomes to similar to those of their older counterparts. Adolescents had lower booking blood pressures. This may have implications for the screening and diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in adolescents.

N2  - Study Objectives Zika virus infection during pregnancy may result in congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), whose characteristics are being described. Methods The present study aimed to investigate the sleep characteristics of 136 infants/toddlers (88 with CZS and 48 with typical development (TD), age and gender matched, 60% girls and 40% boys in both groups) using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. The ages of children in both groups ranged from 5 to 24 months (CZS 15.9 ± 0.4 vs. TD 15.8 ± 1.0 months, P= 0.90). Results The results show that 34.1% of CZS and 2% of TD children were defined as poor sleepers, 15% of CZS and 2% of TD children remained awake at night for a period longer than 1 hour, and 24% of CZS and 2% of TD children slept less than 9 hours. The CZS group showed shorter total sleep time (CZS 11.24 ± 2.6 vs. TD 12.02 ± 1.9 hours, P= 0.03) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration than the TD group (CZS 8.2 ± 0.2 vs. TD 9.4 ± 0.2 hours, P= 0.0002). In contrast to the control group (P= 0.02, r= -0.34), in the CZS group, no correlation was found between age and nocturnal wakefulness. Future studies should explore these data in relation to the development and maturation of the central nervous system of these children. Conclusions Considering the well-known consequences of poor sleep quality on health in several populations, the presence of sleep disorders should be considered in CZS using multidisciplinary treatments.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Prior work with cohorts of nurses and women undergoing ART suggests lifestyle factors are important to fertility. We sought to identify potentially modifiable risk factors associated with fertility in a diverse population of pregnancy planners. METHODS: Women attempting natural conception were enrolled by trained study staff. On enrollment, women completed a series of surveys covering demographics, diet, physical activity, sleep, and a number of other lifestyle factors. Participants who did not conceive after one year were censored at one year. Survey variables were divided into 6 blocks including demographics, fruit and vegetables, proteins and fat, snacks and nuts, physical activities, and sleep variables. Variables in each block were ranked by importance using random survival forest algorithm, and indices were created based on the most important variables within each block. Cox regression models were conducted to generate unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for time to pregnancy. The top two models with lowest Akaike information criterion were identified, and the model with higher area under the curve was selected as the final model. RESULTS: A total of 233 women were enrolled: 94 were pregnant, and 139 were not by the end of one year followup. There were no significant differences between the groups in regards to age (30.1 years versus 30.9). Women who conceived were more likely to be Caucasian (68.5% versus 42.4%, p<0.001), had a lower BMI (26.2 versus 32 kg/m2, p<0.001), were less likely to smoke (3.2% versus 14.6%, p=0.004), and had a higher income (>$25,000 versus <$25,000, p<0.005). In Cox Regression, the following selected variables were associated with higher likelihood of pregnancy: income>$25,000 (HR 2.97, 95% CI 1.68-5.25), healthy food intake (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19-1.52), and physical activity (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13-1.65). The following were negatively associated with pregnancy: BMI (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.95), fried food and fat intake (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.88). A final model including healthy food score, fried food and fat intake, dark chocolate, BMI, and income found that BMI and higher score for fried food and fat intake remained significant (aHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99 and 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.93 respectively). CONCLUSION: Higher BMI and intake of fried foods and fat (bacon, butter, margarine) are associated with infertility as defined by no pregnancy after one year of unprotected intercourse. Further work to educate pregnancy planners about modifiable risk factors for improved fertility is important.

N2  - Introduction/Aim: A major impediment to the provision of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) treatment is the reliance on labour-intensive and costly, sleep physician-led diagnostic laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG).This study investigated if oximetry and nasal flow measurement via the ApneaLink® device (AL) could be used to identify patients with moderate-severe OSA in those referred for PSG to a tertiary Sleep Service. Methods: New referrals to The Prince Charles Hospital Sleep Disorders Centre were assessed for study suitability. Demographics, anthropometrics, Epworth Sleepiness and OSA50 scores were collected. Exclusion criteria included age <18 years, pregnancy, significant cognitive impairment, poorly controlled psychiatric disorder, domiciliary oxygen and prior OSA treatment. Participants underwent concurrent Level 1 PSG and AL assessments. Results: The 100 participants had a mean age of 55 (SD 17) and were 49% male. 48 (48%) had moderate-severe OSA on PSG. AL 3% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) ≥16 had receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 0.86, sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 84% for PSG AHI ≥15. Various composites of AL, anthropometric and questionnaire variables did not improve upon the AUC or sensitivity of 3% ODI ≥16 but did improve specificity. There were 6 false negative AL 3% ODI (AL 3% ODI <16 but PSG AHI ≥15). 7 of the 8 false positives (AL 3% ODI ≥16 but PSG AHI <15) had PSG AHI >5 (mild OSA) and 7 had average PSG SpO2 <94%. Conclusion: AL may play a role in the diagnosis of moderate-severe OSA in those referred for PSG to a tertiary Sleep Service. This could lessen the reliance on PSG for OSA diagnosis, shorten time to treatment initiation, improve waiting lists for PSG and provide significant cost savings. False positive results occurred in those with mild sleep apnoea and/or low baseline oxygen saturations.

N2  - Background: Maternal supine sleep position is associated with increased risk of late stillbirth. While supine the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava (IVC), causing dramatic haemodynamic changes. It is thought that IVC compression is better relieved by lying on the left side, rather than the right. Methods: Twenty two women between 34-38 weeks gestation underwent MRI scanning either in the supine and left lateral positions or left and right lateral positions. Phase contrast images were evaluated to measure blood flow through the aorta, IVC and azygos vein. Results: The supine position was associated with a reduction in cardiac output when compared to the left lateral (4.70 ± 1.37 vs 5.49 ± 1.10 L/min; p=0.004), while blood flow decreased through the IVC (0.17 ± 0.18 vs 1.15 ± 0.40 L/min; p<0.0001) and the abdominal aorta (1.09 ± 0.24 vs 1.67 ± 0.53 L/min; p<0.0001). Blood flow through the azygos vein increased significantly in the supine position (0.80 ± 0.25 vs 0.31 ± 0.21 L/min; p=0.02). Cardiac output and blood flow through the IVC and azygos vein did not differ significantly between the left and right positions. Conclusions: Women in late pregnancy experience an increase in collateral venous circulation in the supine position, likely to compensate for compression of the IVC. However, reductions in maternal arterial blood flow may reduce uteroplacental blood flow and may, in part, explain the association between maternal supine sleep position and increased risk of late stillbirth.

N2  - Objectives To examine possible influence of quality of life domains in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not achieving pregnancy. Methods Data from RevNatus, a Norwegian nationwide observational register of women with rheumatic diseases planning pregnancy was used. We compared women with SLE and RA who did and did not achieve pregnancy during follow-up. Fifty-three women with SLE and 180 women with RA with a pregnancy wish had follow-up until pregnancy and known pregnancy outcome or at least one year if not achieving pregnancy. We assessed quality of life (QoL) using RAND-36. A higher score indicates a better QoL. A change in score of 3-5 points is considered a minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Results During follow-up 47 (88.7%) SLE- women and 130 (72.2%) RA-women conceived, while 6 (11.3%) SLE-women and 50 (27.8%) RA-women did not. In women with SLE not achieving pregnancy (NAP), a higher frequency were nulliparous, smoked, had active disease or overweight compared to SLE women achieving pregnancy (AP). Women with RA not achieving pregnancy were older and had experienced preeclampsia more often than women with RA achieving pregnancy. Women with SLE not achieving pregnancy compared to SLE-women achieving pregnancy had lower mean QoL-scores (MCID) in all domains except for bodily pain, which was higher. Women with RA had generally lower QoL than women with SLE in the domains physical role, bodily pain and global health whether or not conceiving. The women with RA not achieving pregnancy had higher QoL-scores on bodily pain and lower scores on emotional role, but not differences in scores of clinical relevance in the other domains of QoL compared to RA-women achieving pregnancy (table 1). Conclusions Reduced quality of life may contribute to not achieving pregnancy in both women with SLE and women with RA. (Figure Presented).

N2  - In New Zealand, Maori, like many indigenous people, place a cultural value on bedsharing as a way of facilitating breastfeeding and attachment (Tipene-Leach et al., 2010). Objective overnight infrared video recordings have identified increased breastfeeding episodes during bedsharing compared to solitary sleeping (Baddock, Galland, Bolton, Williams, & Taylor, 2006). However, bedsharing is associated with increased risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), particularly if the mother smoked in pregnancy. In New Zealand, the Maori SUDI rate is 5 times that of non- Maori, non-Pacific (2.34 deaths per 1,000 live births vs. 0.52; Child and Youth Mortality Review Committee, 2009), and many of these deaths are associated with bedsharing after exposure of the infant to the effects of cigarette smoking in utero. The wahakura (flax bassinet) originated from theMaori community as a potentially safer sleep place to use on the adult bed frombirth, but to date, there has been no assessment of its safety. The aim of this study was to compare wahakura with bassinets to identify potential advantages such as breastfeeding duration; and potential risks such as head-covering, prone sleep position, and time bedsharing; and other factors such as total sleep time and mother-baby interactions. Two hundred participants were recruited, through midwifery practices supporting mainly Maori families in more deprived areas, and were randomised to receive a wahakura (W) or a bassinet (B) during pregnancy. Questionnaireswere completed at baseline, 1, 3, and 6months. Overnight infant sleep studies using infrared video, and physiological measures of temperature and SaO2 were completed at 1 month. Video data were analysed using a taxonomy to identify predetermined infant behaviours. Intention to treat analysis was used. Increased full breastfeeding was reported at 6 months by the wahakura group compared to the bassinet group (11%B vs. 23%W, p = .04). On the study night, mean head covered time (B:0.45 vs. W:0.43 hr) and breastfeeding (B:0.38 vs. W:0.44 hr)were not significantly different. Nor were the number of head covering (mean, B:2.1 vs. W:1.5, p = .4) and breastfeeding events (B:3.2 vs. W:3.9, p = .3) or maternal-baby interactions. Time bedsharing (B:1.7 hr vs. W:2.1 hr, p = .48) was similar. Babies slept in the bassinet (mean, B:6.7 hr vs. W:1.9 hr, p < .0001) and slept in the wahakura (B:0 vs. W:4.2 hr), while study time (B:9.9 vs. 10.1 hr) and asleep time (B:6.7 vs. W:6.7) were not significantly different between groups. Allocation of a wahakura was associated with increased full breastfeeding at 6 months, although on the study night there was no increase in mother-baby interactions, time bedsharing, or any other behaviours measured on the study night. This study suggests that it is as reasonable to provide a wahakura as it is to provide a bassinet as a safe sleep intervention in this population with the added advantage of increased duration of breastfeeding.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate prospectively the association between male sleep duration and fecundability. Design: Pregnancy Online Study (PRESTO), a Web-based prospective cohort study of North American couples enrolled during the preconception period (2013–2017). Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Male participants were aged ≥21 years; female participants were aged 21–45 years. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): At enrollment, men reported their average nightly sleep duration in the previous month. Pregnancy status was updated on female follow-up questionnaires every 8 weeks for up to 12 months or until conception. Analyses were restricted to 1,176 couples who had been attempting to conceive for up to six cycles at enrollment. Proportional probabilities regression models were used to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders. Result(s): Relative to 8 hours per night of sleep, multivariable-adjusted FRs for <6, 6, 7, and ≥9 hours per night of sleep were 0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.87), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87–1.30), 0.97 (95% CI 0.81–1.17), and 0.73 (95% CI 0.46–1.15), respectively. The association between short sleep duration (<6 hours per night) and fecundability was similar among men not working nights or rotating shifts (FR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41–0.88) and among men without a history of infertility (FR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44–0.87) and was stronger among fathers (FR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28–0.76). Conclusion(s): Short sleep duration in men was associated with reduced fecundability. Because male factor accounts for 50% of couple infertility, identifying modifiable determinants of infertility could provide alternatives to expensive fertility workups and treatments.

N2  - Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is the most common mechanism of pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction and has been documented in >40% of cases. Case: A 36 year old Caucasian female at 34 weeks gestation (G3P2), presented with severe sharp tearing interscapular pain that woken her up from sleep which did not subside after a few hours. On arrival she was diaphoretic and restless. General examination including cardiac exam was unremarkable ECG revealed NSR with STE in the anterior leads measuring 2-3 mm and the serum troponin was 237 ng/ml. CXR was unremarkable. Other labs were normal. The patient was taken to the Cath lab. Angiography revealed 50% narrowing in the mid LAD otherwise normal coronaries. There were no apparent intimal tears. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 30%, severe hypokinesis of the anterior septal wall. Fetal medicine were contacted for possible emergent CS and felt fetus was viable but delivery posed too high a risk for the mother and a decision was made to continue with conservative management. On the 4th hospital admission day there was a recurrence of similar chest pain with new STE in the anterolateral leads and re elevation of troponins. Coronary angiography revealed a spiral dissection of the diagonal artery with TIMI-III fow. Mid to distal left anterior descending artery was patent but diffusely narrowed giving the impression of a recently healed dissection. Decision-making: Fetal medicine again felt that emergency CS is high risk to both mother and fetus. After careful consideration of risks and benefts and discussion with patient and family a conservative approach was undertaken. She remained hemodynamically stable. After observation for few days, cardiology felt it would be benefcial to both the mother and fetus to proceed with CS. The patient tolerated the surgery well and did not require pressor or mechanical circulatory support. The patient and baby did well during the post op period. She was doing well when she was seen in clinic few weeks later. Conclusion: Conservative management strategies with close monitoring should be considered in stable women with pregnancy associated SCAD.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the association of sleep duration and quality at 12 months and myopia at 3 years.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
METHODS: The Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort recruited pregnant women at 2 major public maternity hospitals (n = 1236). We included 376 children of Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnicity who had completed caregiver questionnaires on the child's sleep at 12 months of age [Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ)] and also completed cycloplegic autorefraction and eye axial length (AL) measurement at 3 years of age. Data on total sleep duration and number of night wakings were collected by BISQ. Univariable and multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, parental myopia, maternal education level, outdoor time, near work, and height) were used.
RESULTS: Thirteen (3.5%) participants were myopic and mean spherical equivalent (SE) was 0.89 diopters (D) (SD 0.88) at 3 years. Total sleep duration and number of night wakings at 12 months were not associated with SE at 3 years (P > 0.05). The total sleep duration (P = 0.07) and number of night wakings (P = 0.49) were not associated with AL in the multivariate model. Total sleep duration in tertile 2 was not associated with AL (P = 0.11) compared with tertile 1. Only total sleep duration in tertile 3 was associated with longer AL (P = 0.006), but there was no association with SE.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep duration and quality at 12 months of age were not associated with refractive error at 3 years.

N2  - Introduction: Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of certified nurse-midwives related to sudden infant death syndrome and infant safe sleep. However, this population is an important and trusted source of information for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these topics with certified nurse-midwives to identify potential barriers as well as enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal health care environment. Methods: Participants in this cross-sectional survey study were certified nurse-midwives who provide prenatal health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse-midwives listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333). Results: A total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two-thirds had positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether they discussed this topic with their patients. Discussion: Certified nurse-midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important that they are familiar with current evidence-based recommendations on infant safe sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment.

N2  - Introduction/Aims: Asthma is common during pregnancy and can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this analysis was to explore for an association between preterm delivery, infant lung function at 6 weeks of age and the development of bronchiolitis in the first 6 months of life in a cohort of babies born to women with asthma during pregnancy. Methods: We performed tidal breathing flow-volume loop (TBFVL) measurements during quiet unsedated sleep in infants born to mothers who participated in an ongoing multi-centre RCT of FeNO-guided asthma management versus usual care (Breathing for Life Trial). All researchers remain blinded in regards to the pregnancy intervention. Results: 324 babies have been recruited to date, of which 289 attended clinical assessment and 261 remained in quiet sleep during testing. 232 TBFVL were attempted (44% female; mean (SD) age 6 (1.2) weeks and 209 (90%) tests were technically acceptable. Mean time to Peak Tidal Expiratory Flow/time Expiratory Flow % (tPTEF/tE%)in preterm infants (n=19) was 25.9 (SD 4.8) versus those who were born at term 32.6 (SD 9.9). Mean respiratory rate (RR) was 47 breaths/ per minute in preterm babies vs 44 breaths/ per minute in fullterm babies. At the time of abstract submission, 140/209 (67%) were 6 months old and 36/209 (17%) had at least one bronchiolitis episode. 37% of preterm babies developed bronchiolitis during the first 6 months of life compared to 22% full-term babies. Conclusion: Prematurity resulted in lower tPTEF/tE % at 6 weeks of age in babies born to asthmatic mothers which may be associated with the subsequent development of bronchiolitis.

N2  - Introduction: Previous studies identify suboptimal sleep as a risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MetS), but many lack racial/ethnic minorities. Our study objective was to investigate the relationship between suboptimal sleep and risk of MetS by race/ethnicity. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the positive association between suboptimal sleep and MetS is stronger among Black and Hispanic compared to White women. Methods: We used longitudinal data (2003-2015) from 50,884 female participants (aged 35-74 years) of the Sister Study who were non-pregnant and without cardiovascular disease or cancer. We defined suboptimal sleep by: duration (short: <7 hours, recommended: 7-<9 hours, long: ≥9 hours) and dichotomized (yes/no) sleep parameters including sleep irregularity.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor disorder characterized by unusual, uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs. It is commonly associated with sleep disturbance and it may appear or worsen during the third trimester of pregnancy. RLS is experienced by one in four women during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep, lowered quality of life and an increased risk of cesarean delivery. Review of the literature suggests that low serum levels of iron and ferritin, and a high level of estrogen may play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy. Exercise training and massage therapy are nonpharmacological interventions that can be safely applied to these patients. Studies including larger sample sizes need to be carried out to provide more information on the etiology and management of this condition.

N2  - Introduction/Aim: FeNO-guided asthma management during pregnancy was associated with a reduction in bronchiolitis episodes in the first year of life (Mattes et al., Thorax 2013). The aim of this analysis was to investigate an association between infant lung function at 6 weeks of age and bronchiolitis in the first 6 months of life in a cohort of babies born to women with asthma during pregnancy. Methods: Tidal breathing flow-volume loop (TBFVL) measurements were performed during quiet unsedated sleep in infants born to mothers who participated in an ongoing NHMRC-funded multi-centre RCT of FeNO-guided asthma management versus usual care (Breathing for Life Trial). All researchers remain blinded in regards to the pregnancy intervention. Results: Of 324 babies recruited to date, 289 attended a clinical assessment and 261 remained in quiet sleep during testing. 232 had TBFVL attempted (44% female; age 6 weeks SD 1.2), of which 209 (90%) tests were technically acceptable. At the time of abstract submission, 140/209 (67%) were 6 months old. Infants with one episode of bronchiolitis in the first 6 months of life had a mean of time to Peak Tidal Expiratory Flow/time Expiratory Flow % (tPTEF/tE%) of 28.5 (SD 6.8; n=30) at 6 weeks of age. Infants with >1 episode of bronchiolitis had a mean tPTEF/tE% of 22.79 (SD 4.46; n=6) while those without bronchiolitis had a mean tPTEF/tE% of 32.34 (SD 9.4; n=104). There were no difference in respiratory rate (RR) between groups (1 episode: mean RR 44 breaths per minute; >1 episode: mean RR 42 breaths per minute; no bronchiolitis: mean RR 44 breaths per minute). Conclusions: Lung function may be associated with the risk of developing bronchiolitis which could provide a linking mechanism for the effect of FeNO-guided management on bronchiolitis prevalence.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy related disorders, including preterm birth (PTB), are caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors such as lifestyle and living environment. We have designed a prospective cohort study named “Maternity Log Study” to investigate unrevealed mechanisms of those disorders from both genetic and environmental aspects. METHODS: A total of 302 participants were recruited by written informed consent. We collected daily lifelogs of physiological data (body weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, physical activity, body temperature, and hours of sleep) and symptoms (morning sickness, abdominal pain, uterine contraction, and bowel movement) as well as blood and urine samples at several points throughout pregnancy. We analyzed the association between the course of lifelogs and PTB. RESULTS: Several lifelog features showed differences between a spontaneous PTB (SPTB) group (n=14) and a control group (n=77). Especially, daily caloric expenditure of the SPTB group measured by a wearable activity monitor was significantly lower than controls after 20 weeks of gestation (1655±221 vs 1949±297 kcal, p<0.002). An adjusted odds ratio of daily caloric expenditure was 0.61 (95%CI 0.43 to 0.83) at 20 weeks of gestation. Interestingly, morning body temperatures of the control group decreased gradually according to the gestational age (36.56-> 36.36°C from 16 to 30 weeks of gestation), while those of the SPTB group did not as much (36.64-> 36.54°C during the same period as the control). An adjusted odds ratio of morning body temperatures was 0.50 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.66) at 20 weeks of gestation. A SPTB prediction model using lifelogs before 26 weeks of gestation demonstrated sensitivity higher than 0.85 and specificity higher than 0.90. CONCLUSION: Combinations of daily lifelogs could be predictive markers for SPTB. Further combinations with genome, transcriptome, and metabolome data may improve our prediction model and reveal underlying mechanisms of SPTB.

N2  - Introduction/Aim: Perinatal risk factors for allergic disease such as maternal asthma, birth season and even birth order can be linked to detectable alterations in cord blood immune cells. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), have been implicated in the development of allergic diseases and are capable of regulating eosinophilic inflammation. Their potential role in the development of asthma is of great interest but remains poorly understood. Here we examine the cord blood cell profile in infants born to mothers with asthma in pregnancy taking part in the NHMRC funded Breathing for Life Trial (BLT). Methods: Cord blood from 29 BLT participants was collected into EDTA tubes and processed within 6 hours of birth. Cells were stained in whole cord blood: Eosinophils (CD 45+CD16-CD193+), ILC1(Lin- CD127+ CD161+ CD117- CD294-), ILC2 (Lin- CD127+ CD161+ CD294+), ILC3 natural cytotoxic receptor (NCR)- (Lin- CD127+ CD161+ CD294- CD117+ NKp44-), ILC3 NCR+ (Lin- CD127+ CD161+ CD294- CD117+ NKp44+). Cells were fixed overnight, samples were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa X-20 flow cytometer and analysed using FlowJo software. Tidal breathing flow-volume loop (TBFVL) measurements during quiet sleep were performed in infants at 6 weeks of age. Results: In this preliminary analysis, there were correlations between ILC1, ILC2 and (NCR)- ILC3s in cord blood (r=0.54-0.74, p<0.005; n=29). No significant correlations were found with NCR+ positive ILC3. Eosinophils weakly correlated with ILC2 (r=0.38 p=0.04) and were inversely correlated with lung function (tPTEF/tE%) at 6 weeks (r=-0.83, p=0.005, n=10). Conclusion: The study of ILC subtypes in cord blood is feasible and ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 NCR+ numbers in cord blood show strong correlations with each other. The apparent correlation between ILC2 and eosinophils in cord blood and the potential association with lung function at 6 weeks of age warrants further investigation in this ongoing study.

N2  - Introduction: Postpartum morbidities are among the most important health problems across the world. However, the frequency and types of these morbidities remain unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate postpartum morbidities and the influential factors in the women in Gonabad city, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Gonabad city, located in the northeast of Iran, during 2015-2016. Subjects included 158 pregnant women referring to the community health center in Gonabad for prenatal care. Data on the pregnancy period were collected using the general health questionnaire (GHQ-28) and demographic questionnaires, and the scale of postpartum morbidities was used two months after delivery. Data analysis was performed in SPSS version 16 using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Chi-square at the significance level of P<0.05. Results: The most common postpartum morbidities included pain in the C-section sutures (69%), fatigue (50%), backache (46.5%), episiotomy pain (46.5%), and sleep disturbance (44.4%). Moreover, statistically significant correlations were observed between headaches and feeding method (P=0.038), constipation and low maternal age (P=0.027), flatulence and mode of delivery (P=0.018), pain in C-section sutures and high maternal age (P=0.017), episiotomy pain and low maternal age (P=0.008), urinary frequency and maternal occupation (P=0.029), sore nipples and low maternal age (P=0.013), sore nipples and exclusive breastfeeding (P=0.040), and dysuria and neonatal weight (P<0.0001). Conclusion: According to the results, the most common postpartum morbidities were pain in C-section site, fatigue, backache, episiotomy pain, and sleep disturbance. Considering the high frequency of these morbidities, it is recommended that accurate postpartum examinations be performed, focusing on the timely diagnosis and treatment of these problems.

N2  - Introduction: Animal studies and limited human research suggest that nightly fasting duration (NFD) and timing of food intake may influence cardiometabolic risk through behavioral and physiological mechanisms. Research is needed to clarify these associations in diverse populations including Hispanic/Latina women, who have elevated cardiometabolic risk. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that longer NFD would be associated with lower body adiposity, inflammation, blood pressure (BP) and lipids, and glucose regulation indicators and with healthier lifestyle behaviors that may explain associations with cardiometabolic risk. Methods: We examined associations of NFD with cardiometabolic risk among n= 9,781 diverse Hispanic/Latina women, aged 18-76y, from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), recruited from four US cities between 2008-2011. Pregnant women and those treated for diabetes were excluded. NFD, defined as time from last meal on one day to first meal on the next day, was calculated from two 24-hour recalls. BMI, waist size (WS), BP, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, hemoglobin A1c, and C-reactive protein measurements were used in linear and logistic regression models to evaluate associations of NDF with cardiometabolic risk. Models accounted for sample weights and design effects and were adjusted for age, marital status, education, employment, income, health insurance, race, Hispanic/Latino background, acculturation level, BMI, and percent caloric intake consumed after 8PM. Results: The mean NFD was 12.9±2.3 hours. In linear regression models, longer NFD was associated with higher BMI (β=0.19,p<0.0001), WS (β=0.42,p<0.0001), systolic BP (β=0.20,p=0.012) and lower HDL (β=-0.25,p=0.006). In logistic models, NFD ≥13h vs.<13h was associated with elevated odds of overweight and obesity (OR:1.34,95%CI:1.16-1.54), obesity alone (OR:1.26,95%CI:1.11-1.42), and an “at-risk” WS (OR:1.25,95%CI:1.09-1.43). NFD ≥13h vs.<13h was also associated with higher odds of hypertension (OR:1.20,95%CI:1.02-1.42) and low HDL (OR:1.28,95%CI:1.13-1.46), respectively. When examined in relation to lifestyle, longer NFD was associated with longer self-reported sleep (β=0.05,p<0.0001) and lower caloric intake (β=-37.3,p<0.0001), and null results were observed for diet quality and objectively-measured physical activity. Conclusions: This large cross-sectional population-based study in U.S. Hispanic/Latina women showed null associations between NFD and glycemic control and inflammation, contrary to previous findings in Caucasian women, but uniquely evaluated and demonstrated deleterious associations between prolonged NFD and other cardiometabolic risk factors. Future studies should investigate longitudinal associations of NFD with cardiometabolic outcomes in this population group.

N2  - Current actigraphic sleep/wake detection algorithms have predominantly been validated against polysomnography, although the accuracy of such validations is dependent on the degree to which the timestamps of these two methods of data collection are synchronised. We created and validated an algorithm to temporally align actigraphy and polysomnography data using a sample of 100 healthy young adults, recruited from a pool of participants in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Each participant underwent one night of polysomnography with simultaneous wrist actigraphy (Actigraph GT3X+). Our alignment algorithm incorporates the raw acceleration data and considers the best alignment when the sum of the products of acceleration and polysomnography values are maximised. Segments of the night of various lengths and locations were considered as input values in addition to several values for the maximum allowable discrepancy. The optimal input values were determined by comparing accuracies, sensitivities and specificities calculated from two commonly used sleep/wake classification methods, and then validated using a simulation study. Validation suggested that our alignment algorithm can successfully align polysomnography and actigraphy timestamps. This allows for more accurate and detailed actigraphic sleep/wake detection algorithms to be created, thus strengthening the use of actigraphy as an appropriate method for sleep detection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing demand for assisted reproductive technology (ART) amongst patients with significant medical co-morbidities in recent years as gamete and embryo cryopreservation has become more commonplace. These medical co-morbidities frequently require follicular aspiration to take place in high acuity surgical settings for higher level anesthesia and surgical support. Often, these advanced surgical care settings are distant from outpatient surgical centers and specialized in vitro fertilization (IVF) laboratories, requiring laboratory equipment to be transferred on site. This results in increased set-up time and potential risk of harm to costly equipment. There is limited literature available describing resourceful and cost effective follicular aspirate transport methods. OBJECTIVE: To describe an inexpensive, efficient, and effective method of follicular aspirate transport following ultrasound guided follicular aspiration (USFA) from an advanced surgical care center to a specialized IVF laboratory. MATERIALSANDMETHODS: Here we describe a retrospective case series from a single academic tertiary care center from March, 2017 to November, 2017. Four female patients underwent USFA in an advanced surgical care center, remote from a specialized IVF laboratory, secondary to comorbid conditions precluding outpatient surgical center care. Following USFA, follicular aspirate is collected in a sterile specimen cup and placed in Modified Human Tubal Fluid Medium with Gentamicin-HEPES-(Irvine Scientific) transport medium supplemented with heparin. The aspirate with culture medium is then immediately placed in a portable incubator charged with a portable lithium-iron battery pack at 37-C (Figure 1). After the last follicle is aspirated, the incubator is immediately transported to a specialized IVF laboratory for oocyte identification. RESULTS: Case 1 involves a 37-year-old with tubal factor infertility, class III obesity (bodymass index of 44), and obstructive sleep apnea. She had 19 oocytes retrieved, a single blastocyst transfer with successful ongoing pregnancy, and 10 blastocyts cryopreserved. Case 2 is a 32-year-old with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndromewith vaginal and uterine agenesis complicated by bilateral ovarian masses concerning of cystadenomas that necessitated an exploratory laparotomyandmass removal bygynecologic oncology. She underwent successful gonadotropin stimulation and USFA at the time of laparotomy that resulted in 24 oocytes retrieved and 8 blastocysts cryopreserved. Case 3 is a 25-year-old with Hodgkin's lymphoma complicated by a neck tumor concerning for airway obstruction undergoing fertility preservation prior to chemotherapy, that had 13 oocytes transported and cryopreserved. The fourth and final case describes a 16-year-old with large B-cell lymphoma similarly undergoing fertility preservation prior to chemotherapy, complicated by a large mediastinal mass potentially compromising her airway, in which 27 oocytes were successfully retrieved, transported and cryopreserved. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with complex medical co-morbidities undergoing ART often require USFA in advanced surgical care settings remote from IVF laboratories, rather than in outpatient surgical centers. Here we describe a novel, cost effective, easily accessible and successful protocol for transfer of follicular aspirate via a portable thermoelectric warmer to an IVF laboratory off-site that can be utilized for patientswhose optionsmay otherwise be limited.

N2  - Osteitis condensans ilii refers to an increase in bone density located on the inferomedial aspect of the ilium adjacent to the sacroiliac joint. It is often bilateral, symmetric, and triangular. It is a rare condition of benign cause of axial low back pain. Typically affects females following pregnancy, but males and nulliparous females have also been reported. Clinical problem: 29 years old woman presents with lower back pain and polyarthralgia without a history of trauma or injuries. The condition affects her daily life activities and disturbs her night sleep. Finds it particularly difficult to lie flat and get in and out of bed. No other comorbidites recorded. Clinically: Paraspinal and midline tenderness at L4/L5 levels, Good spinal flexion, neurovascular intact. Hip examination unremarkable. Distraction, Compression FABER and Gaenslen's test for sacroiliac joints were positive. Radiology findings demonstrate well defined sclerotic area, adjacent to Left SIJ only on the iliac side. The SIJ is preserved without any joint erosions. Further MRI scans of LS spine and pelvis were performed to rule out other reasons for LBP. Laboratory studies have shown: Vit D deficiency, Hyperthyroidism, Normal CRP and ESR and Rh factor. Further testing for HLA-B27antigens is performed. Conservative treatment modalities like physiotherapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication was employed. Results: Conservative measures taken have led to satisfactory symptoms control. Discussion: OCI is a rare cause of lower back pain. XR and MRI isneeded to diagnose and exclude other reasons for lower back pain. Further laboratory tests are also required to distinguish this idiopathic condition from ankylosing spondylitis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, metastatic disease or sacroiliitis.

N2  - Background: Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of stillbirth. Women who quit smoking during the first trimester have a similar stillbirth risk to nonsmokers. There is inconsistent evidence regarding stillbirth risk and environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ETS). We explored this relationship using data from the Cribss IPD study. Methods: The Cribss IPD comprises four case-control studies investigating modifiable risk factors for late stillbirth (≥28weeks) and includes comprehensive maternal data (PROSPERO registration: CRD42017047703). Maternal tobacco exposure was categorised into four groups: non-smokers (including previous smoker stopped in the first trimester) no ETS, non-smokers with ETS, smokers no ETS; and smokers with ETS. One stage logistic regression was carried out with a stratification variable for study and study site. Results: Compared to non-smokers no ETS: non-smokers with ETS had increased late stillbirth risk (OR 1.42 95% CI (1.11 to 1.83) as did those who were smokers with no ETS (OR 2.70 (1.70 to 4.29). Risk of late stillbirth was also increased in smokers with ETS (OR 2.39 (1.76 to 3.24). Conclusions: Maternal environmental tobacco exposure during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of late stillbirth in women who are non-smokers. In women who continue to smoke in pregnancy there is no additive effect of ETS on late stillbirth risk.

N2  - Objectives Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked with ill-health in adulthood, but ACE literature has focused on family disruption or dysfunction (e.g., child abuse, parental separation), with less attention to economic adversity. We examined whether a mother's economic hardship in childhood (EHC) was associated with women's hardships and health-risk behaviors during/just before pregnancy. Methods We analyzed population-based survey data on 27,102 postpartum California women. EHC included respondents' reports that during childhood they/their families experienced hunger because of inability to afford food or moved because of problems paying rent/mortgage and the frequency of difficulty paying for basic needs. We examined six maternal hardships/behaviors during/just before pregnancy, including four hardships (poverty, food insecurity, homelessness/no regular place to sleep, intimate partner violence) and two behaviors (smoking, binge drinking). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated from sequential logistic regression models estimating associations between EHC (categorized by level of hardship) and each maternal hardship/behavior, first without adjustment, then adjusting for other childhood and current maternal factors, and finally adding family disruption/dysfunction. Results Before adjustment for family disruption/dysfunction, the highest and intermediate EHC levels were associated with each maternal hardship/behavior; after full adjustment, those associations persisted except with smoking. Higher EHC levels generally appeared associated with larger PRs, although confidence intervals overlapped. Conclusions for Policy/Practice These findings link childhood economic hardship with women's hardships, binge drinking, and possibly smoking around the time of pregnancy. Without establishing causality, they support previous research indicating that childhood economic adversity should be considered an ACE.

N2  - Parenting or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, social, spiritual and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood. It consist of a combination of behavior, feelings and expectations unique to a particular parent and child. Parenting skills are thus the guiding forces of a “good parent” to lead a child into a healthy adult. There are four types of relationship between parent and child, secure, avoidant, ambivalent and disorganized relationship. Secure relationship is the strongest of all. The child in this category feels he can depend on his parent and or caretaker. Psychological constructs representing standard strategies parents used in their child rearing are authoritarian, authoritative, permissive or Indulgent and detached. Factors that influence the parent child relationship include social and community support, relationship history, temperament, parenting experiences, Intellectual capacity, education of parents and cultural context and experiences. Parenting begins before birth like planning to have a family, spacing between births, selection of ones place of delivery etc. During pregnancy management of the pregnancy in its various stages and birthing options are important. In early neonatal life providing basic needs like food, sleep, comfort and bonding are important. Toddlers are much more active and are challenging requiring different skills to be managed. Young children demand constant attention and enjoy helping and feeling useful. Parents at this stage need to encourage social interactions and model proper social behaviors. Adolescence can be a time of high risk for children, where new-found freedoms can result in decisions that drastically open up or close off life opportunities. Parenting is thus a lifelong process. Support are needed in a child's life well beyond the adolescent years and continues into middle and later adulthood.

N2  - Background: Maternal age, weight and ethnicity are known risk factors for stillbirth. Previous studies have assessed these risk factors within populations in one country. We explored these risk factors across different countries using data from the Cribss IPD study. Methods: The Cribss IPD comprises four case-control studies investigating modifiable risk factors for late stillbirth (≥28 weeks) and includes comprehensive maternal data (PROSPERO registration: CRD42017047703). Earliest maternal BMI in pregnancy was categorised into five groups. Maternal age was categorised into 6 groups from <20 to >40 in 5 year epochs. Ethnicity was categorised as White, Black, South Asian, South East and East Asian, Maori, Pacific and other. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: There was a dose-response relationship between maternal BMI and late stillbirth risk. Compared to normal BMI, women who were overweight or obese had increased late stillbirth risk. Conclusions: Maternal obesity has a dose response risk for late stillbirth which is consistent across countries and has implications for population health as even small increments in BMI are associated with increased risk. Risk for women over 40 is also consistent. Ethnicity risk for late stillbirth varies depending on the population studied. (Table Presented).

N2  - Objective Skin-to-skin care (SSC) has proven benefits in preterm infants, but increased hypoxic and bradycardic events have been reported. This may make clinicians hesitant to recommend SSC as standard care. We hypothesised that regional cerebral oxygenation (rStO 2) measured with near infrared spectroscopy is not worse during SSC compared with standard incubator care. Design Prospective, observational, non-inferiority study. Setting Single tertiary perinatal centre in Australia. Patients Forty preterm infants (median (IQR) 30.6 (29.1-31.7) weeks' gestation) not receiving respiratory support were studied on day 14 (8-38). Interventions Recordings during 90 min of incubator care, followed by 90 min of SSC. Each infant acted as their own control and caregivers were blinded to the rStO 2 measurements. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the mean difference in rStO 2 between SSC and incubator care. The prespecified margin of non-inferiority was â '1.5%. Secondary outcomes included heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2), time in quiet sleep, temperature and hypoxic (SpO 2 <80% for >5 s) or bradycardic events (HR <80 bpm for >5 s) and time spent in cerebral hypoxia (rStO 2 <55%) and hyperoxia (rStO 2 >85%). Results Mean (SD) rStO 2 was lower during SSC compared with incubator care: 73.6 (6.0)% vs 74.8 (4.6)%, mean difference (95% CI) 1.3 (2.2 to 0.4)%. HR was 5 bpm higher, SpO 2 1% lower and time in quiet sleep 24% longer during SSC. Little evidence of a difference was observed in temperature. The number of hypoxic or bradycardic events as well as the proportion of time spent in cerebral hypoxia and hyperoxia was very low in both periods. Conclusions Mean rStO 2 was marginally lower during SSC without observed differences in hypoxic or bardycardic events but an increase in time spent in quiet sleep. Trial registration number This trial is linked to Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: identifier 12616000240448. It was registered pre-results.

N2  - This abstract reports on women's experiences of breastfeeding their late preterm baby/babies (LPBs), born between 340/7 and 366/7 weeks of gestation. These women's experiences are especially relevant to explore as the number of babies born late preterm is rising. Traditionally, woman-mothers and their LPBs have been studied under the umbrella of the general preterm population, with all experiences extrapolated from within this group. While there is a growing body of literature related to LPBs, the focus is on physiology and physical needs. There is minimal research exploring women's experiences of breastfeeding LPBs and their views are largely unknown. My aim was to privilege women's experiences; therefore, a feminist approach to research was utilised which enabled an opportunity to understand the world of women who care for LPBs, and what I learned from their experiences. To obtain in depth perspectives, individual qualitative interviews were carried out in two phases, with a purposefully selected sample of 14 women who were caring for LPBs. Template Analysis linked to Birth Territory Theory was utilised to identify key issues. Many of the women revealed that infant feeding was an important part of their experience with some claiming that feeding support was “hit and miss.” My findings further demonstrated that breast feeding was controlled and evaluated on the basis of two practices: schedules and weighing. Scheduled feeding as opposed to flexible feeding has been proposed, as LPBs have a propensity to sleep for many hours. However, feeding flexibility may cause a baby to fall behind in its daily requirements due to sleepiness and/or poor feeding techniques, resulting in a less than optimal weight gain. While feeding regimes prescribed by medical authority appear to be of benefit to LPBs, strict feeding schedules work against mothering in two ways. First, it increases women's mother-work when breastfeeding, as they are required to produce a certain amount of milk at fixed points in time, and second, alarm clock feeding goes against women's “mothering” instincts and reinforces the ideology of scientific motherhood (Apple, 1995). For the women in my study, breastfeeding was hard work. Their experiences were further influenced by a post-natal environment that was industrial in purpose and where women were producers of a product (breast milk) and their babies recipients of that product (Dykes, 2006). What eventually became apparent to the women was that going home was incumbent on their baby/babies gaining weight, which was the reward for good mothering. To get to that point however, they had to follow feeding policies based on preterm fragility and women appeared, at least initially, unable to influence any aspect of their baby's feeding except to enforce the regime as stipulated by health care professionals. Feeding instructions were didactic and strictly enforced with women having no choice but to follow orders. Professional advice was deemed “authoritative” (Murphy, 2003), and women appeared powerless to alter the course of events, even when intuitively, they felt their babies were being overfed. So, while on the one hand they appeared to value “scientific-based advice,” women were somewhat bewildered when, at times, their knowledge and common sense were in conflict with “expert opinion” (Apple, 1995). This study has demonstrated that women caring for LPBs frequently encountered contradictory advice regarding breastfeeding and often felt their own experiences, intuition, and instincts were devalued. Therefore, my research concludes that the practice of breastfeeding LPBs should be revisited in partnership with women, so their experiences and perspectives can be utilised to develop satisfying nurturing relationships while also meeting nutritional requirements.

N2  - Background Although the association between lead exposure and children's neurodevelopment has been studied, gender differences remain to be investigated. We examined the effects of lead exposure on the neurobehavioral development of 5-year-old children to identify the vulnerable time window of exposure and potential gender difference. Method A total of 1751 pregnant women and children participated in the prospective birth cohort study, Mothers and Children's Environmental Health study, since 2006. Lead levels were measured in the maternal blood in early and late pregnancies, in cord blood at birth, and in 2-, 3-, and 5-year-old children's blood. The behavior of 575 children aged 5 years were assessed using the Korean Child Behavior Checklist. The association between the blood lead level at each time window and behavior was examined using a generalized linear model adjusted for potential confounders and covariates. Results Lead levels at late pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of behavioral problems in males. Lead levels in 2- and 5-year-old children's blood significantly increased behavioral risks in females: for a 1-μg/dL increase in blood lead levels, the score for total behavioral problems increased by 3.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56–5.45) during the late pregnancy in males, whereas it increased by 3.82 (95% CI: 1.25–6.39) at 2 years and by 5.72 (95% CI: 0.44–10.99) at 5 years in females with a stronger effect in attention and sleep problems. Conclusion Effects of lead toxicity on children's neurobehavioral development showed gender differences. Males were more susceptible to prenatal exposure, while females were more susceptible to postnatal exposure with stronger effects in attention and sleep problems.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep is a physiological state of self-regulation. The international classification of sleep disorders now includes as a new category those occurring during pregnancy. Regular physical activity is known to improve the quality of life, one aspect of which is sleep quality. During pregnancy, physical activity is decreased but should not be eliminated, as studies have reported a high correlation between sleep disorders and the absence of physical activity. Regular physical exercise during pregnancy, whether performed in water or out of it, provides greater control of gestational weight gain. Furthermore, the reduced weight gain during pregnancy, as a result of physical exercise, is associated with greater physical resistance to the demands of childbirth, combats the fatigue caused by pregnancy and reduces back pain. All of these outcomes tend to enhance sleep quality, among other beneficial effects. Objective: To determine whether, in pregnant women, there is an association between moderate-intensity physical activity in an aquatic environment and sleep quality. Material and methods: A randomised clinical trial was conducted with a sample of 140 pregnant women aged 21–43 years, divided into two groups; Intervention Group and Control Group. The women were recruited in the twelfth week of gestation and took part in the [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy programme from week 20 to week 37. Sleep quality was evaluated in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Results: The Mann–Whitney U test showed that the results obtained were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the Intervention Group, 44 of the women (65.67%) were classified as “poor sleepers” versus 62 women (92.54%) in the Control Group. Conclusions: The [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy method improves the quality of sleep in pregnant women, both subjectively and in terms of latency, duration and efficiency.

N2  - The in utero environment is inherently rhythmic, with the fetus subjected to circadian changes in temperature, substrates, and various maternal hormones. Meanwhile, the fetus is developing an endogenous circadian timing system, preparing for life in an external environment where light, food availability, and other environmental factors change predictably and repeatedly every 24 h. In humans, there are many situations that can disrupt circadian rhythms, including shift work, international travel, insomnias, and circadian rhythm disorders (e.g., advanced/delayed sleep phase disorder), with a growing consensus that this chronodisruption can have deleterious consequences for an individual’s health and well-being. However, the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy on the health of both the mother and fetus is not well understood. In this review, we outline circadian timing system ontogeny in mammals and examine emerging research from animal models demonstrating long-term negative implications for progeny health following maternal chronodisruption during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective To quantify insomnia and their components in a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women and factors associated with insomnia. Study design A prospective cohort of 486 healthy singleton pregnancies assembled before the 14th gestational week (February 2013 to March 2016). Insomnia data were collected pre-gestationally, in each trimester and six months post-partum, analysing five different moments. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to generate adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of determinants of insomnia in each trimester, defined using Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) as score ≥8. Results Insomnia prevalence was 6.1% (3.9–8.9) pre-gestational, 44.2% (39.3–49.6) in first trimester (T1), 46.3% (41.9–51.3) in second (T2) and 63.7% (57.7–67.8) in third trimester (T3). Post-gestational insomnia was 33.2% (28.2–37.9) (p < 0.001 pre-gestational vs T1, T2 vs T3 and T3 vs after pregnancy). There was worsening mean AIS score, from: 2.34 before pregnancy to 9.87 in T3 because the deterioration of nighttime sleep, in absolute terms, but daytime impact was higher in T1. Previous trimester insomnia was associated with insomnia in T2 (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI 2.78–6.37) and T3 (aOR = 4.43, 95% CI 2.77–7.08). Pre-gestational insomnia was determinant of insomnia in T1 (aOR 12.50, 95% CI 3.58–43.60) and obesity was associated with insomnia in T3 (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI 0.99–5.32). On the contrary, moderate physical activity reduced the odds of insomnia in T3 (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40–1.03). Conclusions Insomnia prevalence was high from the beginning of pregnancy, associated with pre-gestational insomnia. In late pregnancy, two out of three pregnant women suffering insomnia. Insomnia prevention should be targeted particularly to those with high body mass index and pre-gestational insomnia.

N2  - Purpose: Exercise during pregnancy has clear mental and physical health benefits for pregnant women including improved sleep and mood, and prevention of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. Most women do not achieve the recommended amount of exercise during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to understand the knowledge and beliefs of pregnant youth regarding exercise during pregnancy, and how these beliefs may affect their level of activity during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant young women between the ages of 16-24 were recruited from two Midwest primary care clinics that serve a pre-dominantly low-income community. Young women were interviewed late in their third trimester during a prenatal appointment at their primary care clinic. We used a semi-structured interview protocol to elicit perspectives and behaviors related to weight gain and exercise during pregnancy. Qualitative interview transcripts were coded using an inductive approach. Descriptive codes were applied to segments of text to build a codebook. Research team members then applied codes to all transcripts, compared codes to build themes, and discussed discrepancies to reach a shared understanding of key concepts. MAXQDA software was used to support analytic procedures. Results: Our sample (n = 43) had a mean age of 21.2 years (SD = 2.2). The majority of young women were African American (51%) with 30% identifying as white, 12% mixed race, 2% Native American and 4% other. 14% of the sample identified as Hispanic. The majority of participants graduated from high school (44%), while 30% had received at least some post secondary schooling and 23% had completed only some high school. No women reported engaging in any moderate in-tensity physical activity during pregnancy. Safety of exercise during pregnancy was mentioned in 22 out of 43 interviews. Several myths about exercise during pregnancy were reported such as not “pushing yourself” during pregnancy (n = 6), not lifting weights (n = 6), not reaching above your head for baby's safety (n = 4), and not running (n = 4). A large proportion of the sample reported low intensity walking during pregnancy (n = 30), but had no knowledge of other types of activity that were safe to engage in during pregnancy. For example, one par-ticipant explained, “Um, walking is about the only thing that you should be doing. There's nothing else you could possibly do. Not skating, none of that. Walking it is.” Conclusions: Physical activity during pregnancy was limited to low intensity walking in our sample of pregnant youth. Fear and lack of knowledge about safety may be preventing young women from en-gaging in necessary physical activity during pregnancy. Tailored interventions could address these myths and fears to reduce barriers to exercise and promote the positive mental and physical benefits of exercise during pregnancy. Sources of Support: This research was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development at the National Institute of Health (1K23HD083527-01A1).

N2  - Introduction: Delusion of pregnancy (DP) is defned as the belief of being pregnant despite factual evidence to the contrary. DP is a somatic type of delusional disorder classifed within Schizophrenia spectrum and other Psychotic disorders according to DSM-5. Case History: This is an unusual case of 62 years old married menopausal female who was referred to Psychiatry department with complaints of belief of being pregnant since 1986, cough and vomitting. She believes that her vomitting is due to her pregnancy. She believes that she was pregnant in 1986 when she underwent tubectomy. Due to sutures of tubectomy the child is not getting delivered but is in a healthy state as she can regularly feel its movements. She has continuous illness of 17-18 years with marked irritability and delusions of being pregnant & infdelity. She is performing all her daily chores properly. She is able to maintain her self-care. Sleep and appetite are also normal. She was started on Risperidone 2mg and her irritability has reduced and her interaction with family has improved. Discussion: In this patient we noted delusion of pregnancy without any other psychotic features which favours the diagnosis of Delusional disorder according to DSM-5. What is unusual is that she believes that she is pregnant since 1986 and was actively menstruating until 2000 after which she had menopause.

N2  - Study Objectives: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) occurs in up to 10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of prematurity and neurodevelopmental impairment. FGR also alters sleep-state distribution in utero and maturation in infancy. Currently, limited data on the long-term associations of FGR and childhood sleep exist. Accordingly, we assessed the associations between preterm birth and FGR and sleep in children aged 5-12 years. Methods: Seventeen children born preterm and FGR, 15 children born preterm but appropriately grown (appropriate birth weight for gestational age [AGA]), and 20 term AGA children (controls) were studied using overnight polysomnography. Sleep macroarchitecture was assessed using standard criteria, and sleep microarchitecture was assessed using spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (C4-M1) with total, δ (0.5-3.9 Hz), θ (4.0-7.9Hz), α (8.0-11.9 Hz), σ (12.0-13.9 Hz), and β power (14.0-30 Hz) calculated. Results: For sleep macroarchitecture, preterm FGR children had higher N2% compared with term AGA children (p < .05). Preterm AGA children had reduced total sleep time, NREM%, and sleep efficiency compared with term AGA children (p < .05 for all). For sleep microarchitecture, preterm FGR children had a higher amount of total, δ and α power compared with both groups (p < .05). Sigma and β power was lowest in the preterm AGA group compared with both groups (p < .05 for both). Conclusions: Prematurity and FGR were associated with altered sleep macro- and microarchitecture measures indicative of reduced sleep quantity and quality in childhood. As sleep disturbance can affect both behavior and neurodevelopment in children, sleep in FGR and preterm children warrants further investigation.

N2  - Increasing evidence suggests a role for inflammation in neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous work in rodents has established that immune activation during critical developmental periods can cause phenotypes that reproduce core features of ASD, including decreased social interaction, aberrant communication, and increased repetitive behavior. In humans, ASD is frequently associated with comorbid medical conditions including sleep disorders, motor hyperactivity, and seizures. Here we use a 'two-hit' immune-activation paradigm to determine whether perinatal immune activation can also produce these comorbid features in mice. In this paradigm, we treated timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which simulates a viral infection, on gestational day 12.5 according to an established maternal immune activation regimen. A subset of the offspring also received a second 'hit' of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which simulates a bacterial infection, on postnatal day 9. At 6 weeks of age, mice were implanted with wireless telemetry transmitters that enabled continuous measurements of electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), locomotor activity, and subcutaneous temperature. Effects at 7 and 12 weeks of age were compared. Both prenatal Poly I:C and postnatal LPS produced changes in locomotor activity and temperature patterns, increases in slow-wave sleep, and shifts in EEG spectral power, several of which persisted at 12 weeks of age. Postnatal LPS also produced persistent increases in spontaneous bursts of epileptiform activity (spike-wave discharges) that occurred predominantly during sleep. Our findings demonstrate that early-life immune activation can lead to long-lasting physiologic perturbations that resemble medical comorbidities often seen in ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions.

N2  - Introduction: Depressive disorder will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide by 2030 estimated World health organization. An episode of depression leads to increased risk of absenteeism from work, decreased productivity and the treatment related costs. Depression is a common and treatable condition and antidepressants are most common prescribed psychotropic medication. Among various antidepressant SSRI is most commonly used drugs due to safety and effcacy profile of this drug. STAR∗ D study results at level 1 shows about one-third of the participants reached remission and about 10-15 percent more responded, but did not reach remission usually 4-6 week required to get therapeutic effects. To get earlier onset of response, rapid restoration of the biological function in depression e.g. sleep, appetite and higher remission rate various pharmacological strategy was used. Current trends shows Mirtazepine is added with SSRI even in first episode of depression to achieve above mention effects. This study intended to assess the pros and cons of adding the Mirtazepine with SSRI in depressive episode. Aim: To study the therapeutic effcacy and safety of adjunctive Mirtazepine with SSRI in depressive episode. Objective: To study demographic profile of patients. To study clinical profile of patients. To study the onset of antidepressant effect of prescribed medication. To study the response rate of antidepressant effect of prescribed medication. 5. To study the side effect profile of prescribed medication. Methodology: Study design: An observational prospective study Study site: Department of psychiatry out patients (OPD) Study duration: 6weak Study sample Inclusion criteria: Patients had to be 18 years or older Suffer from International classifcation of disease-10 (ICD-10) major depressive episode Patients had to declare that they understood the goal of the study and gave their informed written consent. Exclusion criteria. Nonstabilized somatic disease (seizures, renal, or hepatic insuffciency), History of blood dyscrasias. Known case of diabetes mellitus Known allergic reaction to Mirtazepine, Escitalopram. Current suicidal risk (according to the physician's judgment). Pregnancy, breastfeeding, no contraception in women of reproductive age. Current depressive episode of more than 1 year's duration or nonresponsive to 2 antidepressant treatments, Antidepressant use including monoamine oxidase inhibitor treatment during the previous 2 weeks. Tools: International classifcation of disease-10 (ICD-10) Hamilton depression rating scale for depression (HAM-D 17) MADRS Procedure: After discussion with mentor study was conceptualized and study protocol was made and approved by institutional scientifc committee. Patient who were attending psychiatry OPD and diagnosed major depressive disorder (as per ICD-10) Detailed history regarding socio demography, illness and medication taken. Data was collected in the semi-structured proforma and HAM-D & MADRS scale applies to asses baseline severity of depression. Patient recruited who are receiveing antidepressant SSRI with Mirtazepine and SSRI alone as per advice of consulting psychiatrist. Patient review every week up to 6week and apply HAM-D, MADRS scale for severity of depression and asses for side effects. If patient getting serious side effect or not tolerated medication or clinical condition get worse during follow up, subjected is treated individually by treating psychiatrist and excluded from study. Statistical analysis: Means with standard deviations and frequencies with percentages were used to summarize continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Student's t-test (continuous variables) and Chisquare test (categorical variables) were used for comparative analyses between the genders. Repeated measures used to compare change in variable with time and Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) used to asses difference between group. Statistical signifcance was fxed at p=0.05. Result & Discussion: Appropriate statistical analysis was used for analysis the data using SPSSv16 and results will be discussed at the time of presentation.

N2  - Background: There appears to be a chasm between idealised motherhood and reality, and for women who experience birth trauma this can be more extreme and impact on mental health. Australia is unique in providing residential parenting services to support women with parenting needs such as sleep or feeding difficulties. Women who attend residential parenting services have experienced higher rates of intervention in birth and poor perinatal mental health but it is unknown how birth trauma may impact on early parenting. Aims and objectives: This study aims to explore the early parenting experiences of women who have accessed residential parenting services in Australia and consider their birth was traumatic. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with eight women across Australia who had experienced birth trauma and accessed residential parenting services in the early parenting period. These interviews were conducted both face to face and over the telephone. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: One overarching theme was identified: “The Perfect Storm of Trauma” which identified that the participants in this study who accessed residential parenting services were more likely to have entered pregnancy with pre-existing vulnerabilities, and experienced a culmination of traumatic events during labour, birth, and in the early parenting period. Four subthemes were identified: “Bringing Baggage to Birth”, “Trauma through a Thousand Cuts”, “Thrown into the Pressure Cooker”, and “Trying to work it all out”. Conclusion: How women are cared for during their labour, birth and postnatal period impacts on how they manage early parenthood. Support is crucial for women, including practical parenting support, and emotional support by health professionals and peers.

N2  - Background and aims: The ideal cardiovascular health (iCVH) construct consists of 4 health behaviors (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) and 3 health factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose). A greater number of iCVH components in adolescence are related to better cardiovascular health, but little is known about the correlates of iCVH in adolescents. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine correlates of iCVH in European adolescents. Methods and results: The study comprised 637 European adolescents with complete iCVH data. Participants were part of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted in 9 different European countries. Correlates investigated were sex and age, family affluence scale, maternal education, geographic location, sleep time, television viewing, duration of pregnancy, birth weight and breastfeeding. Younger adolescents, those whose mothers had medium/high education or those who watched television less than 2 h per day had a greater number of iCVH components compared to those who were older, had a mother with low education or watched television 2 h or more daily (P ≤ 0.01). Conclusion: Since in our study older adolescents had worse iCVH than younger adolescents, early promotion of cardiovascular health may be important. Future studies may also investigate the usefulness of limiting television viewing to promote iCVH. Finally, since adolescents of mothers with low education had poorer iCVH, it may be of special interest to tailor public health promotion to adolescents from families with low socioeconomic status.

N2  - The aim of this review is to clarify the interrelationship between melatonin and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during fetal development. ASD refers to a diverse range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social deficits, impaired communication, and stereotyped or repetitive behaviors. Melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland, has well-established neuroprotective and circadian entraining effects. During pregnancy, the hormone crosses the placenta into the fetal circulation and transmits photoperiodic information to the fetus allowing the establishment of normal sleep patterns and circadian rhythms that are essential for normal neurodevelopment. Melatonin synthesis is frequently impaired in patients with ASD. The hormone reduces oxidative stress, which is harmful to the central nervous system. Therefore, the neuroprotective and circadian entraining roles of melatonin may reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.

N2  - Background: Sleep is one of the most basic human requirements. This research aims at determining the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life among high-risk pregnant women in Tabriz, Iran, in 2015. Materials and methods: This research was a sectional study done on 364 qualified women in 28–36 weeks of pregnancy suffering from mild preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The sampling was done as convenience. Personal–social–midwifery questionnaire, Pittsburg sleep quality, and quality of life in pregnancy (QOL-ORAV) were used for gathering data. Multivariate linear regression model was used for determining the relationship between sleep quality and its subsets with quality of life and controlling confounders. Findings: In the current study, the prevalence of sleep disturbance was 96.4%. Mean (SD) of the total score of sleep quality was 10.1 (4.1) and the total score of quality of life was 61.7 (17.3). According to Pearson’s correlation test, there was statistically significant relationship between quality of life and sleep quality and all its subsets except sleep duration and use of sleep medication (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, according to the multivariate linear regression model, sleep latency, day time dysfunction, health status, and home air-conditioning were related with quality of life. Discussion: The findings of current research show that sleep quality is low among high-risk pregnant women and quality of life is medium. So, it is necessary that required training is given by health cares for improving sleep quality and quality of life to mothers.

N2  - Background: Most studies regarding the relationship between binge eating disorder (BED) and depression have targeted obese populations. However, nurses, particularly female nurses, are one of the vocations that face these issues due to various reasons including high stress and shift work. This study investigated the prevalence of BED and the correlation between BED and severity of self-reported depressive symptoms among female nurses in South Korea. Methods: Participants were 7,267 female nurses, of which 502 had symptoms of BED. Using the propensity score matching (PSM) technique, 502 nurses with BED and 502 without BED were included in the analyses. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman's correlation, and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results: The proportion of binge eating disorder was 6.90% among the nurses, and 81.3% of nurses displayed some levels of depressive symptoms. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that age (40 years old and older), alcohol consumption (frequent drinkers), self-rated health, sleep problems, and stress were associated with self-reported depression symptoms. Overall, after adjusting for confounders, nurses with BED had 1.80 times the risk (95% CI = [1.41-2.30]; p-value < 0.001) of experiencing a greater severity of self-reported depression symptoms. Conclusions: Korean female nurse showed a higher prevalence of both binge eating disorder and depressive symptoms, and the association between the two factors was proven in the study. Therefore, hospital management and health policy makers should be alarmed and agreed on both examining nurses on such problems and providing organized and systematic assistance.

N2  - Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This propensity toward heightened insulin resistance in OSA patients has not been well characterized and may be related to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The aim of this study was to (1) assess the prevalence of OSA in pregnant women with GDM, (2) evaluate whether HPA axis dysregulation relates to OSA, and (3) investigate the relation between insulin resistance and OSA. We hypothesized that OSA is prevalent among pregnant women with GDM and that women with OSA will have higher levels of insulin resistance and dysregulation of the HPA axis. Methods: Twenty-five pregnant women in whom GDM was diagnosed were enrolled. Subjects answered sleep questionnaires and underwent in-home sleep studies using a level III device. The presence of OSA was defined by apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 events/h. Homeostasis Model Assessment of insulin resistance was derived from measurements of fasting glucose and C-peptide levels. Three salivary cortisol levels were obtained across 1 day to assess circadian variation. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between variables. Results: The sample consisted of 54% Caucasian pregnant women with a median body mass index of 36.1 and interquartile ratio of 10.6 kg/m2. OSA was diagnosed in 17% of participants. Circadian variation of cortisol was preserved in women with OSA. Women with OSA displayed blunted cortisol awakening responses. Conclusions: OSA is prevalent in women with GDM. OSA is associated with preserved circadian variation and blunted cortisol awakening responses.

N2  - In two studies, the relationship between sleep and working memory performance was investigated in children born very preterm (i.e., gestation less than 32 weeks) and the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. In Study 1, parent-reported measures of snoring, night-time sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness were collected on 89 children born very preterm aged 6 to 7 years. The children completed a verbal working memory task, as well as measures of processing speed and verbal storage capacity. Night-time sleep quality was found to be associated with verbal working memory performance over and above the variance associated with individual differences in processing speed and storage capacity, suggesting that poor sleep may have an impact on the executive component of working memory. Snoring and daytime sleepiness were not found to be associated with working memory performance. Study 2 introduced a direct measure of executive functioning and examined whether sleep problems would differentially impact the executive functioning of children born very preterm relative to children born to term. Parent-reported sleep problems were collected on 43 children born very preterm and 48 children born to term (aged 6 to 9 years). Problematic sleep was found to adversely impact executive functioning in the very preterm group, while no effect of sleep was found in the control group. These findings implicate executive dysfunction as a possible mechanism by which problematic sleep adversely impacts upon cognition in children born very preterm, and suggest that sleep problems can increase the cognitive vulnerability already experienced by many of these children.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this paper was to examine the role of perinatal, obstetric and post partum factors on maternal and paternal stress. It will present the first examination of the role of prenatal, obstetric, post-partum, and demographic variables in parenting stress for mothers and fathers at 9 months. Methods: Data from 6821 parental dyads of 9-month-old infants were extracted from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children. Participants completed the Parental Stress Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Quality of Attachment Sub-scale from the Maternal and Paternal Postnatal Attachment Scales, and a single item health status question from the Short Form 12 Health Survey. Information on prenatal care, pregnancy complications, obstetric outcomes, infant health, and participant demographics were also collected. Separate hierarchical linear regressions were conducted for mothers and fathers Results: Mothers reported higher levels of parenting stress than fathers (p < 0.001). Maternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment, own health status, average sleep, occupation, household income, and having a very rapid labor. Paternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment and own health status. Discussion: A range of perinatal factors was associated with an increased risk of higher parenting stress at 9 months post-partum and the roles of these factors differ between mothers and fathers. These findings are important for predicting and reducing risk of parenting stress in both genders.

N2  - Background: Gestational diabetes (GDM) and sleep disorders, are prevalent conditions during Pregnancy, but the interrelationships between sleep and metabolic changes are not well established in the literature. It is known that insulin resistance is a common disruptor and sleep disorders are risk factors for diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome also out of gestation. The in uence of sleep disturbances during diabetic gestation is not well established. Objectives: To investigate the quality of sleep in a group of patients with diabetes during pregnancy attending a referral service in northwest of Brazil. Methodology: This is a prospective study, with convenience sample. Data were collected through an interview. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a validated version in Portuguese. The study was approved by Instituto para o Desen-volvimento da Educação Ltda-IPADE ethic board, approval number 1.801.860. The statistical analysis was performed by Epi Info software version 7.1.3.10. Results: Eighty-six diabetic pregnant women aged 19-44 with a mean age of 32.5 years were evaluated. The mean gestational age was 25.6 weeks (ranging from 10 to 38 weeks). It was observed 8.5% with Type 1 DM, 21.7% Type 2 DM and 69.8% GDM. They were treated with insulin 43%, Metformin: 31.4%, Glibenclamide: 1.1 and 48.8% with diet alone. 87.2% were overweight/obese. Sleep quality assessed by PSQI ranged from 1 to 16 with an average score of 7.4. Poor quality of sleep (PSQI ≥ 6) was observed in 67.5% of the patients, and more prevalent among obese pregnant women, 56.9% with BMI > 30, 42.2% with BMI ≥ 25 and < 30, and only 0.9% had BMI < 25. Conclusions: Sleep disorders characterized by poor sleep quality were frequent in pregnant women with diabetes. There was an association between overweight/obesity and poor sleep quality. Due to the importance of health and metabolic balance in women with diabetes in pregnancy, we consider it important to deepen this research and to evaluate if measures that improve the quality of sleep in these women can possibly have a positive impact on the weight gain during pregnancy or other gestational outcomes.

As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy. Methods Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26–28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26–28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score > 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS ≥ 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state ≥ 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates. Results Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0 µmol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10 µmol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being. Limitation Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being. Conclusions We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To report maternal sleep practices in women who experienced a stillbirth compared with controls with ongoing live pregnancies at similar gestation. Design: Prospective case-control study. Setting: Forty-one maternity units in the United Kingdom. Population: Women who had a stillbirth after ≥ 28 weeks’ gestation (n = 291) and women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of interview (n = 733). Methods: Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire that included questions on maternal sleep practices before pregnancy, in the four weeks prior to, and on the night before the interview/stillbirth. Main outcome measures: Maternal sleep practices during pregnancy. Results: In multivariable analysis, supine going-to-sleep position the night before stillbirth had a 2.3-fold increased risk of late stillbirth [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.04–5.11] compared with the left side. In addition, women who had a stillbirth were more likely to report sleep duration less than 5.5 hours on the night before stillbirth (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24–2.68), getting up to the toilet once or less (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.85–4.26), and a daytime nap every day (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26–3.94). No interaction was detected between supine going-to-sleep position and a small-for-gestational-age infant, maternal body mass index, or gestational age. The population-attributable risk for supine going-to-sleep position was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5–9.2). Conclusions: This study confirms that supine going-to-sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. Further work is required to determine whether intervention(s) can decrease the frequency of supine going-to-sleep position and the incidence of late stillbirth. Tweetable abstract: Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with 2.3× increased risk of stillbirth after 28 weeks’ gestation. Plain Language Summary: Stillbirth, the death of a baby before birth, is a tragedy for mothers and families. One approach to reduce stillbirths is to identify factors that are associated with stillbirth. There are few risk factors for stillbirth that can be easily changed, but this study is looking at identifying how mothers may be able to reduce their risk. In this study, we interviewed 291 women who had a stillbirth and 733 women who had a live-born baby from 41 maternity units throughout the UK. The mothers who had a stillbirth were interviewed as soon as practical after their baby died. Mothers who had a live birth were interviewed during their pregnancies at the same times in pregnancy as when the stillbirths occurred. We did not interview mothers who had twins or who had a baby with a major abnormality. Mothers who went to sleep on their back had at least twice the risk of stillbirth compared with mothers who went to sleep on their left-hand side. This study suggests that 3.7% of stillbirths after 28 weeks of pregnancy were linked with going to sleep lying on the back. This study also shows that the link between going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth was not affected by the duration of pregnancy after 28 weeks, the size of the baby, or the mother's weight. Women who got up to the toilet once or more at night had a reduced risk of stillbirth. This is the largest of four similar studies that have all shown the same link between the position in which a mother goes to sleep and stillbirth after 28 weeks of pregnancy. Further studies are needed to see whether women can easily change their sleep position in late pregnancy and whether changing the position a mother goes to sleep in reduces stillbirth.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there are still limited data on how best to test for and treat OSA in pregnancy. Home sleep testing (HST) devices with autoscoring capabilities may lessen the burden of testing for OSA in pregnancy, however data regarding their reliability in pregnancy are limited. Our goal was to evaluate the reliability of HST with autoscoring at low apnea hypopnea index (AHI) values. STUDY DESIGN: This was an ancillary study of an ongoing prospective study of OSA in obese pregnant women. For the primary study women are recruited in early pregnancy and undergo an in-lab polysomnogram (PSG) before 21 weeks' gestation to evaluate for OSA. OSA is defined as an AHI of ≥ 5, with values of 4.6 or greater rounded up to 5. Those who test negative for OSA at the first PSG, return for a repeat evaluation between 28-32 weeks' gestation. It is anticipated that some of these women will developed mild OSA during pregnancy, but most are expected to have a second negative study. A subgroup of these women were asked to wear an Apnea-Link HST device for 1 night, within 2 weeks of the repeat PSG. We used the Apnea-Link autoscoring algorithm to obtain a AHI for the HST. HSTs were considered valid if they had a ≥ 4 hours of nasal flow signal. We compared the HST-autoscore to PSG using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and assessed categorical agreement (AHI≥ 5 (positive) or <5 (negative)). RESULTS: 34 women were recruited and we obtained 21 valid HST (5 women never wore the device, 8 had an inadequate signal). 4/21 women were diagnosed with OSA by in-lab PSG. The agreement between HST-autoscore AHI and PSG AHI was good (ICC 0.73, Figure). Categorical agreement was excellent (90.5%). All negative PSG studies were negative on HST-autoscore. The 2 positive HST-autoscore studies were also positive on PSG. Of the 4 positive PSG, 2 were negative by HST-autoscore (5.01 PSG vs. 2.4 auto and 5.47 PSG vs. 4.2 auto). CONCLUSION: A low HST-autoscore of < 2 may be sufficient to rule out OSA in obese pregnant women. Our data demonstrates that HST with autoscoring may be a useful tool to help quickly triage obese women for further OSA evaluation. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction/Rationale: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) increases in prevalence over the course of pregnancy. Although the mechanisms are not well understood, gestational weight gain, hormonal influences and fluid shift may play a role. Importantly, maternal SDB is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and delivery of small-for-gestational age infants. However, there is very limited data on whether SDB improves or resolves postpartum with reversal of pregnancy-related physiological changes, and to what extent persistent SDB post-partum may impact on longer-term maternal health outcomes. Methods: This is a preliminary analysis of ongoing prospective data collection on pregnant women with SDB (apnea-hypopnea index; AHI>5) diagnosed in the second to third trimester using level 1 or 2 polysomnography, followed by re-evaluation at 3 months postpartum or later with either inlaboratory or home sleep testing, depending on subject preference. Pregnant women were recruited for various study protocols examining the association between maternal SDB and smallfor- gestational age infants, gestational diabetes, and the adherence to oral appliance devices during pregnancy. Thus far, 33 participants who had postpartum sleep studies (while off treatment for SDB) were included. Results: Subjects to date (n=33) had mean (±SD) age of 34±8 y and body mass index (BMI) of 33±8 kg/m2 at time of sleep study during pregnancy. Subjects were at a mean of 32±4 weeks gestation for the sleep study during pregnancy. The mean AHI was 22±12. Sleep studies were repeated postpartum at a mean duration since delivery of 23±12 weeks in 27 participants and 1-4 years in 6 participants. The distribution of absent (AHI<5), mild (AHI 5-15), moderate (AHI 15-30), or severe (AHI>30) SDB postpartum was: 12, 45, 30 and 12%, respectively. The 3% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was > 5 in 10 (31%) subjects postpartum. The Figure demonstrates the distribution of severity of SDB during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Conclusions: SDB diagnosed late in pregnancy resolved in the postpartum period in only 12% of patients studied. The finding that SDB persists in a majority of women studied postpartum stands in contrast to previous limited data. Our findings indicate that further study is warranted to better characterize the natural history of SDB diagnosed during pregnancy with longer follow-up in the postpartum period. Finally, further evaluation of postpartum SDB in relation to its consequences for long-term maternal health, including cardiometabolic outcomes, is needed.

N2  - Pregnant women have a two- to threefold increased prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) compared to the general population, and the majority of RLS patients also experience periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). PLMS have been associated with sleep disturbance as well as autonomic heart rate and blood pressure responses; however, the prevalence, cause and significance of PLMS during pregnancy remain unknown. This study evaluated the presence of PLMS in late pregnancy and its relationship to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Ninety-one women in the third trimester of pregnancy underwent overnight polysomnography. An RLS questionnaire and the Multivariate Apnea Risk Index were administered and venous blood was sampled within 2 weeks of the sleep study. After exclusions due to obstructive sleep apnoea and signal loss, PLMS data were available for 73 women, 36 hypertensive women and 37 BMI- and gestation-matched controls. PLMS were found to be very common during pregnancy; 45% of women had a PLMS index > 5 and 25% had a PLMS index > 15. The number of PLMS per hour did not differ by hypertensive status. Sleep quality was mostly unaffected by PLMS, as was change in blood pressure overnight. While RLS was reported by 18.3% of the sample, this did not reliably predict the presence of PLMS. Despite iron deficiency being common in this population, it was not associated with PLMS. This novel study investigating the frequency and impact of PLMS during pregnancy revealed that PLMS are very common in the third trimester; however, this disorder appears to be benign in terms of objective sleep quality and relationship with pregnancy-related hypertension.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk for obstetric complications including hypertension, diabetes, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. The best way to screen for OSA in pregnancy remains unknown. We sought to determine whether simple questions about snoring would aid in determining who should undergo a sleep study. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women were recruited from a large, academic medical center during the third trimester. All women completed a questionnaire that included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and were screened for habitual snoring, defined as snoring at least 3 nights per week. Medical records were reviewed for preexisting comorbidities such as obesity and chronic hypertension (HTN). Diagnoses of pre-eclampsia and gestational HTN were also collected. Women then underwent sleep studies and OSA was considered present if the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was at least 5 events per hour of sleep. Test characteristics were calculated including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Stratified analyses by HTN and BMI≥40 were also done. RESULTS: 91 women answered questionnaires and underwent sleep studies. Habitual snoring had a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 77%, PPV 61%, and NPV 85% for detecting OSA. The addition of daytime sleepiness or loudness of snoring did not improve test characteristics. Among women with any HTN (n=46), habitual snoring had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 59%. Among women with BMI≥40 (n=20), habitual snoring had a sensitivity of 93% and a PPV of 81% for identification of OSA. CONCLUSION: Habitual snoring had reasonable sensitivity and high NPV for OSA, particularly among women with HTN and those with a BMI ≥40. Brief questions about habitual snoring are an easy triage tool for sleep study referral early in pregnancy. (Table Presented).

N2  - Purpose: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common during pregnancy. Nevertheless, prevalence estimates of OSA have varied widely due to variabilities in the assessment methods. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the prevalence of objectively assessed OSA and its association with pregnancy-related health outcomes in pregnant women. Methods: This review was developed following the PRISMA guideline. A systematic search was conducted in major electronic databases to identify studies conducted from inception to January 2018. The pooled estimates with 95% confidence interval were calculated using the inverse variance method. Forest plots were used to present the results of individual studies and the pooled effect sizes. Results: Thirty-three studies were included. The mean gestational age was between 21.2 (8.5) and 37.3 (2.1) weeks. The pooled worldwide prevalence of OSA was 15% (95% CI 12–18%). The prevalence estimates ranged from 5% in the European Region to 20% in the Region of Americas. The prevalence estimates for different trimesters ranged from 15 to 19%. OSA was related to an increased risk for gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, C-section, postoperative wound complication, and pulmonary edema. The pooled adjusted odds ratio (aOR) values were 1.97, 1.55, 2.35, 1.42, 1.87, and 6.35, respectively. OSA was also related to an increased risk for preterm birth (aOR = 1.62) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (aOR = 1.28). Conclusions: OSA is a common health issue in pregnant women. OSA is associated with various pregnancy-related health outcomes. Routine screening, early diagnosis, and effective treatment of OSA are recommended in pregnant women, particularly during mid and late pregnancy.

N2  - Rationale: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects between < 1% and 14% of all pregnancies. It is an important public concern due to its association with maternal and fetal complications. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common during pregnancy, and several studies link OSA with GDM. However, few studies have measured OSA using full-polysomnography and controlled important confounders. We performed a case-control study to determine if OSA is associated with an increased risk of GDM controlling important confounding factors. Methods: Women with newly-diagnosed GDM (n=49) and healthy pregnant women (n=48) matched for race, maternal age (32.3±3.9 yrs vs 32.1±4.0 yrs, respectively) and parity underwent a full labpolysomnography after being screened for GDM (24-36 wks pregnancy). They also completed questionnaires including apnea symptom score from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction index (MAPI). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the clinical characteristics that were significantly associated with GDM. Using GDM diagnosis as the dependent variable, sleep parameters and demographic characteristics (having a p<0.2 in a bivariate analysis) were reevaluated in full regression models as independent variables. Results: Participants' characteristics were similar between the two groups including age and pregnancy BMI (mean BMI, 34.1±7.5 vs 33.8±7.0, p=0.88). MAPI apnea symptom score, objective and subjective-measured sleep duration and sleep quality, habitual snoring, mean oxygen saturation were not different between the two groups. However, women with GDM had higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) compared with matched controls (mean AHI±SD; 3.6±2.4 vs 1.4±5.5, p=0.04, respectively). Four percent of controls and 25% of GDM cases had OSA (AHI>5). The diagnosis of OSA by PSG and log-AHI were significantly associated with newly-diagnosed GDM (OR 5.07 CI, 1.17-22.05 vs OR 1.82; 95% Cl, 1.03-3.23, respectively), after adjustment for pregnancy BMI, periodic limb movement index (PLMI) and gestational age. Women who had HI>5 have more than an 11-fold (95%CI 1.24-101) increase risk of having GDM. Further analysis demonstrated that women who had ODI3>10 and ODI4>5, (ODI3 and ODI4: the number of oxygen desaturations >3% and >4% per hour), are almost 10 (95%CI 1.17-84.48) and 7 (95%CI 1.32-35.45) times, respectively, more likely to have GDM, adjusting the same variables mentioned above. ODI3>5, habitual snoring, MAPI apnea symptom score, percentages of NREM and REM sleep were not significantly associated with GDM. Conclusion: This study indicates that OSA is common in women with GDM. OSA is significantly and independently associated with GDM.

Pregnant women are at greater risk of developing OSA compared to non-pregnant women. Gestational OSA can lead to adverse maternal/neonatal outcomes including preeclampsia, diabetes and reduced fetal growth. We investigated the effects of gestational CIH on uterine artery function and placental angiogenic factors in mice subjected to GIH. Methods: Female WT C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks) were subjected to either IH or intermittent air (IA) during gestation. Pregnant mice were sacrificed at day 14.5 of pregnancy. Uterine artery function was assessed using a wire myograph system. Placental anti-angiogenic markers in the plasma [soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin (sENG) and the angiogenic placental growth factor (PIGF)] levels were measured using ELISA. Plasma oxidative stress marker [8-Isoprostane] and inflammatory marker [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)] were also measured using ELISA. Results: In uterine arteries, acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation was reduced in mice subjected to GIH (Emax: IA: 93.8 ± 4.9 vs. GIH: 63.3 ± 4.3% of induced tone, P<0.01). Phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction was increased in uterine arteries from GIH mice (Emax: IA: 95.4 ± 3.4 vs. GIH: 128.6 ± 9.4%, P<0.05). GIH increased oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in pregnant mice (8-Isoprostane: 142.4 ± 22.9 vs. 72.3 ± 19.4 pg/ml, P<0.05. TNF-α: 25.5 ± 6.9 vs. 9.9 ± 2.9 pg/ml, P<0.01). Plasma PIGF was lower in GIH mice (GIH: 63.1 ± 14.5 vs. IA: 160.2 ± 40.3 pg/ml, P<0.01) while plasma sFlt-1 and sENG levels were higher (sFlt-1: 13894 ± 2695 vs. 6614 ± 1073 pg/ml, P<0.001. sENG: 2122 ± 225 vs. 1301 ± 109 pg/ml, P<0.0001). Conclusion: GIH impaired uterine artery function in pregnant mice and increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, GIH elevated anti-angiogenic factors (sFlt-1 and sENG levels) that may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and preeclampsia. GIH also decreased the ability to maintain normal placental growth by lowering PIGF levels. Our data suggests that GIH could lead to maternal adverse vascular outcomes, causing placental insufficiency and complicated pregnancies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality are associated with many adverse health outcomes. Metabolic hormones are increasingly implicated as the intermediaries in this sequence. This study aims to determine the effect of sleep duration and quality in pregnancy on the maternal and fetal levels of adiponectin, leptin and resistin. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study of healthy women with singleton gestations. Third-trimester sleep habits were obtained with a 7-day sleep diary. Maternal serum was collected between 32-34 weeks, with maternal and cord blood collected at delivery. Plasma adiponectin, leptin and resistin were measured using commercially available immunoassays. Cohorts were defined as sleeping <8 or 8 hours per night. Analysis was performed using Student's T-test with bootstrapping and Spearman's correlations, with generalized linear models to control for confounding. RESULTS: 45 women sleeping <8 hrs. were compared with 43 women sleeping 8 hrs. Cohort characteristics are in Table 1. The mean sleep duration was 6.7 and 9.2 hrs. respectively (P<0.01). The mean time napping per day was 0.7 and 0.4 hrs., respectively (P=0.049). Both groups averaged 2.2 awakenings per night (P=1). Total mean sleep duration was inversely associated with term resistin (r2=-0.17, P=0.01). Total nightly awakenings were inversely associated with resistin and leptin at term (Table 2). In 32-34 week maternal serum, adiponectin levels were higher in women who slept <8 hrs. (7.5mg/ml vs. 5.4mg/ml, P=0.015). At term, maternal resistin levels were higher in women who slept <8 hrs. (16.5ng/ml vs. 14.7ng/ml, P=0.005). CONCLUSION: Similar to non-pregnant subjects, adiponectin and resistin are inversely related to sleep duration in pregnancy. Leptin levels did not decrease with short sleep duration. However, a significant decrease in leptin levels with worsening sleep quality was noted. Relative to non-pregnant subjects, the influence of sleep duration on leptin levels may be dampened by placental leptin secretion in pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To quantify the quality of life (QoL) and visit-specific satisfaction of pregnant women. Design: A prospective cohort within a practice-based research network (PBRN). Setting/Locations: Individual chiropractic offices. Subjects: Pregnant women (age ≥18 years) attending chiropractic care. Intervention(s): Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and adjunctive therapies). Main outcome measures: The RAND VSQ9 to measure visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®)-29 to measure QoL. Results: A convenience sample of 343 pregnant patients (average age = 30.96 years) comprised their study population. They were highly educated with 75% attaining a 2-year associate's degree or higher. The pregnant patients presented for chiropractic care with a mean week of gestation of 25.67 weeks (median = 28 weeks; range = 0-42 weeks) and parity (i.e., the number of live births) of 0.92 live births (median = 1; range = 0-6). From baseline (i.e., at study entrance with minimum first visit) and comparative (i.e., following a course of chiropractic care), the VSQ9 measurements revealed increasingly high satisfaction on the part of the subjects (i.e., the mean difference of baseline minus comparative measures =-0.7322; p < 0.005). The median number of visits (i.e., visits attended) at baseline and comparative measures was 1.00 (standard deviation [SD] = 22.69) and 3.30 (SD = 22.71), respectively. Across outcomes, QoL improved from baseline to comparative measurement after holding constant for visit number and time lapse, trimester of pregnancy, and care provider type. There was a reduction in mean T scores associated with fatigue (p < 0.05), pain interference (p < 0.05), sleep disturbance (p < 0.05), and an improvement in satisfaction with social roles (p < 0.05). A significant decrease was also found with pain interference (p < 0.05). No evidence was found that anxiety (p = 0.1404) or depression (p = 0.8785) changed. Conclusion: A PBRN study was successfully implemented among chiropractors to find pregnant patients highly satisfied and their QoL scores improving with care beyond chance.

N2  - Many women experience sleep problems during pregnancy. This includes difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep due to physiologic changes that occur as pregnancy progresses, as well as increased symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Growing evidence indicates that sleep deficiency alters glucose metabolism and increases risk of diabetes. Poor sleep may exacerbate the progressive increase in insulin resistance that normally occurs during pregnancy, thus contributing to the development of maternal hyperglycemia. Here, we critically review evidence that exposure to short sleep duration or SDB during pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Several studies have found that the frequency of GDM is higher in women exposed to short sleep compared with longer sleep durations. Despite mixed evidence regarding whether symptoms of SDB (e.g., frequent snoring) are associated with GDM after adjusting for BMI or obesity, it has been shown that clinically-diagnosed SDB is prospectively associated with GDM. There are multiple mechanisms that may link sleep deprivation and SDB with insulin resistance, including increased levels of oxidative stress, inflammation, sympathetic activity, and cortisol. Despite emerging evidence that sleep deficiency and SDB are associated with increased risk of GDM, it has yet to be demonstrated that improving sleep in pregnant women (e.g., by extending sleep duration or treating SDB) protects against the development of hyperglycemia. If a causal relationship can be established, behavioral therapies for improving sleep can potentially be used to reduce the risk and burden of GDM.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome in late pregnancy in a population of obese women. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in fourth university hospitals between July 2011 and July 2015. Inclusion criteria were obese class II and more women with a singleton pregnancy and no documented or treated OSA. Women were included between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation and were then evaluated using the Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Score, and screened for OSA using a nocturnal polysomnogram. Women with proven OSA were offered appropriate medical care by today's standards and were re evaluated by a second polysomnogram six months after delivery. The primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of severe or moderate OSA, which required a sample size of 170 women to be included to obtain high precision. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors and outcomes associated with OSA. RESULTS: A total of 170 pregnant women were included in the study and 72 of them (42.4%) were screened positive for OSA. OSA was severe or moderate in 26 women (15.3%) and mild in 46 women (27.1%). OSA disappeared in 13 women (26%) out of 50 women who were re-evaluated six months after delivery. Multivariate analysis showed that only snoring at third trimester (3.48 OR, 95% CI 1.56-7.76, p = 0.002) were associated with OSA. OSA was an independent risk factor for gestational hypertension (4.58 OR, 95% CI 1.43-14.64, p = 0.01), and planned cesarean delivery (2.71 OR, 95% CI 1.15-6.4, p = 0.02) (Table). Maternal and neonatal outcomes were similar between women with severe and moderate versus mild OSA. CONCLUSION: OSA was frequently reported in obese women at third trimester. OSA could be induced by pregnancy and disappeared after delivery. OSA was mostly complicated by gestational hypertension and planned cesarean delivery, but with no increased neonatal morbidity.
