AB We recently reported that gestational chronodisruption induces fetal growth restriction and marked effects on fetal adrenal physiology. Here, whole-transcriptome profiling was used to test whether gestational chronodisruption modifies gene expression in the fetal heart, potentially altering cardiac development. At day 10 of gestation (E10), pregnant rats were randomized in two groups: constant light (LL) and control 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod (LD). RNA isolated from E18 heart was subjected to microarray analysis (Affymetrix platform for 28,000 genes). Integrated transcriptional changes were assessed by gene ontology and pathway analysis. Significant differential expression was found for 383 transcripts in LL relative to LD fetal heart (280 up-regulated and 103 down-regulated); with 42 of them displaying a 1.5-fold or greater change in gene expression. Deregulated markers of cardiovascular disease accounted for alteration of diverse gene networks in LL fetal heart, including local steroidogenesis and vascular calcification, as well as cardiac hypertrophy, stenosis and necrosis/cell death. DNA integrity was also overrepresented, including a 2.1-fold increase of Hmga1 mRNA, which encodes for a profuse architectural transcription factor. microRNA analysis revealed up-regulation of miRNAs 218-1 and 501 and concurrent down-regulation of their validated target genes. In addition, persistent down-regulation of Kcnip2 mRNA and hypertrophy of the left ventricle were found in the heart from 90 days-old offspring from LL mothers. The dysregulation of a relevant fraction of the fetal cardiac transcriptome, together with the diversity and complexity of the gene networks altered by gestational chronodisruption, suggest enduring molecular changes which may shape the hypertrophy observed in the left ventricle of adult LL offspring.

AB Background: Pregnancy has been identified as a risk factor for increasing rates of obesity in women. In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining postpartum weight retention (PWR). Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between psychological distress during late pregnancy and early postpartum, specifically depression, anxiety, stress, and body dissatisfaction, and early PWR. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 227) completed a series of questionnaires at 32 weeks gestation and 3 months postpartum. Results: The most salient predictor of PWR was gestational weight gain (GWG). In a prospective hierarchical regression analysis, only GWG contributed unique prediction of early PWR. In a second hierarchical regression analysis examining cross-sectional relationships with three-month PWR, GWG and early postpartum stress contributed unique variance while the contribution of feelings of fatness approached significance. Conclusions: Given the large association of GWG to early PWR, interventions should focus on the prevention of GWG during pregnancy, as well as screening for body dissatisfaction and stress in the early postpartum.

   ALLOPREGNANOLONE CONCENTRATIONS; 5-ALPHA-PREGNANE STEROIDS
AB Neuroactive steroid concentrations are remarkably high in the foetal brain during late gestation. These concentrations are maintained by placental progesterone synthesis and the interaction of enzymes in the placenta and foetal brain. 5 alpha-Pregnane-3 alpha-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) is a key neuroactive steroid during foetal life, although other 3 alpha-hydroxy-pregnanes may make an additional contribution to neuroactive steroid action. Allopregnanolone modulates GABAergic inhibition to maintain a suppressive action on the foetal brain during late gestation. This action suppresses foetal behaviour and maintains the appropriate balance of foetal sleep-like behaviours, which in turn are important to normal neurodevelopment. Neuroactive steroid-induced suppression of excitability has a key role in protecting the foetal brain from acute hypoxia/ischaemia insults. Hypoxia-induced brain injury is markedly increased if neuroactive steroid levels are suppressed and there is increased seizure activity. There is also a rapid increase in allopregnanolone synthesis and hence levels in response to acute stress that acts as an endogenous protective mechanism. Allopregnanolone has atrophic role in regulating development, maintaining normal levels of apoptosis and increasing myelination during late gestation in the brain. In contrast, chronic foetal stressors, including intrauterine growth restriction, do not increase neuroactive steroid levels in the brain and exposure to repeated synthetic corticosteroids reduce neuroactive steroid levels. The reduced availability of neuroactive steroids may contribute to the adverse effects of chronic stressors on the foetal and newborn brain. Preterm birth also deprives the foetus of neuroactive steroid mediated protection and may increase vulnerability to brain injury and suboptimal development. These finding suggest replacement therapies should be explored.

AB Objective: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap frequency on maternal glycemic control.
   Methods: Sixty-three urban, low-income, pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values >= 130 mg/dL.
   Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9 +/- 0.9 h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r = -0.28, P = .03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [ OR], 0.2 [ 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.1-0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia.
   Conclusions: Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectivesTo determine the incidence of admission in labor after morphine sleep (therapeutic rest), patient characteristics associated with labor, and adverse outcomes associated with treatment.
   MethodsWe reviewed medical records of women treated with morphine sleep from December 2005 to December 2009. Variables evaluated included medications used for treatment, cervical examination, maternal demographic characteristics and obstetric history, fetal heart rate patterns, and maternal/neonatal outcomes. These characteristics were compared between those admitted in labor after morphine sleep versus those discharged.
   ResultsFifty-eight women received morphine sleep: 36 (62%) were admitted in labor, 17 (29%) were discharged, and 5 (9%) were admitted secondary to category II fetal heart rate tracings. All fetuses had category I fetal heart rate tracings prior to treatment. Median dose of morphine sulfate was 20 mg. Those with effacement>50% (p<0.01) and carrying term gestations (p<0.01) were more likely to be admitted in labor after treatment. There were no adverse maternal outcomes. There were no significant differences in neonatal outcomes.
   ConclusionSixty-two percent of women were admitted in labor after morphine sleep. Admission effacement>50% and term gestational age were associated with admission in labor. There were no significant differences in maternal or neonatal morbidity in those admitted versus discharged home after treatment with morphine sleep.

AB Power spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability has been proposed to provide a non-invasive estimate of autonomic balance. However, there are few systematic data before birth. We therefore examined developmental changes in the frequency power spectrum at very low (0-0.04 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequencies (0.15-0.4 Hz), as well as the ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF), in chronically catheterized, healthy fetal sheep at 0.6 (n= 8), 0.7 (n= 7) and 0.8 gestational age (ga; n= 11). In a second study, 0.8 ga fetuses received either atropine (4.8 mg bolus, then 4.8 mg h(-1) for 30 min, n= 6) or 6-hydroxydopamine (20 mg ml(-1) at 2.5 ml h(-1) for 3 h; n= 9). Data were analysed by sleep state, defined by low-voltage-high-frequency (LV) or high-voltage-low-frequency (HV) EEG. Total spectral power increased with gestational age (P < 0.05), while LF/HF decreased from 0.6 to 0.7 ga. At 0.8 ga, heart rate and LF/HF were significantly higher during HV than LV sleep (P < 0.05). Consistent with this, although total spectral power was not significantly greater during HV sleep, there was a significant interaction between sleep state and frequency band (P= 0.02). Both atropine (P= 0.05) and 6-hydroxydopamine (P < 0.05) were associated with an overall reduction in spectral power but no significant effect on the LF/HF ratio. This study does not support substantial, consistent differences between the frequencies of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in late-gestation fetal sheep.

AB OBJECTIVE: Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are increased in pregnancy compared to the nongravid state. Maternal SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this is still under investigation. We performed a systematic literature review, and where feasible, a metaanalysis, to evaluate whether women with SDB in pregnancy have a higher risk of specific adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women without SDB.
   STUDY DESIGN: Original studies published until June 2012 evaluating the association between gestational hypertension/ preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight infants, and maternal SDB, defined either by symptoms or the reference standard polysomnography, were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data were extracted on study design and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect estimates from each study were pooled using a random-effects model.
   RESULTS: Of the 4386 studies identified, 31 met the defined criteria. Twenty-one studies, all observational in design, reported dichotomous outcomes; 9 of these adjusted for potential confounders. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-3.09; 5 studies), and gestational diabetes (pooled aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; 5 studies).
   CONCLUSION: Based on published observational studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. However, large-scale, prospective cohort, and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the relationship between maternal SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been used in pregnancy for just over 20 years now and is generally well tolerated. Normal values have been established for different gestations; these are slightly higher than conventional blood pressure (BP) in normal pregnancy, presumably reflecting greater activity during the 24h of ABPM recordings. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a better predictor than conventional BP for the development of pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, but it is not sensitive or specific enough to be recommended for these purposes in routine practice. Studies of ABPM have shown that sleep hypertension is common in women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia, but detecting this in routine clinical practice does not aid usual decision making in the pregnancy, including timing of delivery. Studies using ABPM have found that pregnant women who are working outside the home have higher BP than non-working women, but these data should not be interpreted to mean that not working during pregnancy will prevent gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. The best role for ABPM is to determine whether women with office hypertension in early pregnancy have true (usually essential) hypertension or white-coat hypertension. The latter can be managed without antihypertensives and pregnancy outcomes appear good, although possibly with a slightly increased incidence of pre-eclampsia. Women who have had pre-eclampsia are at greater life-time risk for cardiovascular diseases; several years postpartum these women have slightly higher ABPM-measured BP than women who had normal pregnancies and a greater propensity to metabolic syndrome.

AB Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is secreted during the dark hours at night by the pineal gland. After entering the circulation, melatonin acts as an endocrine factor and a chemical messenger of light and darkness. It regulates a variety of important central and peripheral actions related to circadian rhythms and reproduction. It also affects the brain, immune, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, bone and endocrine functions and acts as an oncostatic and anti-aging molecule. Many of melatonin's actions are mediated through interactions with specific membrane-bound receptors expressed not only in the central nervous system, but also in peripheral tissues. Melatonin also acts through non-receptor-mediated mechanisms, for example serving as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. At both physiological and pharmacological concentrations, melatonin attenuates and counteracts oxidative stress and regulates cellular metabolism. Growing scientific evidence of reproductive physiology supports the role of melatonin in human reproduction. This review was conducted to investigate the effects of melatonin on female reproduction and to summarize our findings in this field.

AB Objective: this study evaluates how an internet-based intervention affects mothers' parenting satisfaction, infant centrality and depressive symptoms.
   Design: a quasi-experimental design and repeated measures were used.
   Settings: this study was conducted in two Finnish public maternity hospitals (intervention/control).
   Participants: a convenience sample (N=1300) of primiparous and multiparous Finnish-speaking mothers were invited to participate. Multiple-birth and early discharge mothers receiving home visits were excluded. The analysis included 760 mothers.
   Intervention: the intervention offered online support for parenting, breast feeding and infant care beginning from the middle of pregnancy. It consisted of an information database, a peer discussion forum and expert advice.
   Measurements: Outcomes were measured by the Evaluation and Infant Centrality subscales of the What Being the Parent of a New Baby is Like-Revised, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale after childbirth, and six weeks, six months and 12 months post partum. Age, parity, parenting self-efficacy, and perception of infant and family functioning were used as the covariates.
   Findings: during the first postpartum year, mothers' parenting satisfaction increased significantly, whereas infant centrality and depressive symptoms decreased within groups. However, these changes were not linear. The mean difference between groups in parenting satisfaction and depressive symptoms was not significant within any of the four assessments. The mean difference in infant centrality between control and intervention mothers was significant only at six weeks post partum. Primiparas scored significantly higher in infant centrality and significantly lower in depressive symptoms than multiparas.
   Key conclusion and implications for practice: an internet-based intervention did not significantly affect mothers' perceptions of parenting satisfaction and depressive symptoms, but intervention mothers experienced higher infant centrality compared with control mothers at six weeks. Parenting self-efficacy was a significant covariate for all measures. Parity needs to be taken into account when infant centrality and depressive symptoms are used as outcome variables in intervention studies. More research is needed to study the potential of information data bank, professional, and peer online support. This study also highlights the need to pay more attention to the selection of the target population, the selection of outcome measures, and implementation issues in intervention research.

DT Review
DE circadian rhythms; estrous cycle; clock gene; proestrus; parturition
AB Over the past two decades, it has become clear just how much of our physiology is under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the cell-intrinsic molecular clock that ticks with a periodicity of approximately 24 h. The SCN prepares our digestive system for meals, our adrenal axis for the stress of waking up in the morning, and the genes expressed in our muscles when we prepare to exercise. Long before molecular studies of genes such as Clock, Bmal1, and the Per homologs were possible, it was obvious that female reproductive function was under strict circadian control at every level of the hypothalamic pituitary-gonadal axis, and in the establishment and successful maintenance of pregnancy. This review highlights our current understanding of the role that the SCN plays in regulating female reproductive physiology, with a special emphasis on the advances made possible through the use of circadian mutant mice.

TI Chiari 1 malformation presenting as central sleep apnea during
   pregnancy: a case report treatment considerations, and review of the
   literature
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
LA English
DT Review
DE Chiari malformation; central sleep apnea; pregnancy; presentation;
   adaptive servoventilation
AB Purpose: Chiari malformation (CM) type-1 frequently causes obstructive or central sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in both adults and children, although SDB is relatively rare as a presenting manifestation in the absence of other neurological symptoms. The definitive treatment of symptomatic CM is surgical decompression. We report a case that is, to our knowledge, a novel manifestation of central sleep apnea (CSA) due to CM type-1 with severe exacerbation and initial clinical presentation during pregnancy.
   Methods: Case report from tertiary care comprehensive sleep medicine center with literature review of SDB manifestations associated with CM type-1. PubMed search was conducted between January 1982 and October 2013.
   Results:We report a 25-year-old woman with severe CSA initially presenting during her first pregnancy that eventually proved to be caused by CM type-1. The patient was successfully treated preoperatively by adaptive servoventilation (ASV), with effective resolution of SDB following surgical decompression, and without recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy. Our literature review found that 58% of CM patients with SDB had OSA alone, 28% had CSA alone, 8 (10%) had mixed OSA/CSA, and 6 (8%) had hypoventilation. Of CM patients presenting with SDB, 50% had OSA, 42% had CSA, 8% had mixed OSA/CSA, and 10.4% had hypoventilation. We speculate that CSA may develop in CM patients in whom brain stem compression results in excessive central chemoreflex sensitivity with consequent hypocapnic CSA.
   Conclusion: Chiari malformation type-1 may present with a diversity of SDB manifestations, and timely recognition and surgical referral are necessary to prevent further neurological deficits. ASV therapy can effectively manage CSA caused by CM type-1, which may initially present during pregnancy.

AB Background/Aims: Early life experiences are homeostatic determinants for adult organisms. We evaluated the impact of prenatal immune activation during late gestation on the neuroimmune-endocrine function of adult offspring and its interaction with acute stress. Methods: Pregnant Swiss mice received saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 17. Adult male offspring were assigned to the control or restraint stress condition. We analyzed plasmatic corticosterone and catecholamine levels, the monoamine content in the hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex, and the sleep-wake cycle before and after acute restraint stress. Results and Conclusion:Offspring from LPS-treated dams had increased baseline norepinephrine levels and potentiated corticosterone secretion after the acute stressor, and no effect was observed on hypothalamic monoamine content or sleep behavior. The offspring of immune-activated dams exhibited impairments in stress-induced serotonergic and dopaminergic alterations in the striatum and frontal cortex. The data demonstrate a distinction between the plasmatic levels of corticosterone in response to acute stress and the hypothalamic monoamine content and sleep patterns. We provide new evidence regarding the influence of immune activation during late gestation on the neuroendocrine homeostasis of offspring. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB This study aimed to explore a broad range of psychological reactions to trauma in a sample of bereaved parents in order to assess whether the traumatic framework is adequate for describing the entire range of emotional reactions to infant death. A sample of bereaved parents (N=455) who lost their child through perinatal or postnatal loss were compared to a control group of parents (N=110) who gave birth to a healthy child. Multivariate regression analysis clearly demonstrated that bereaved parents scored significantly higher on the Depression, Anxiety, Dissociation, Sleep Disturbances, Somatization, Interpersonal Sensitivity, and Aggression subscales of the Trauma Symptom Checklist. Consistent with previous studies, the results showed that for up to 5 years postloss bereaved parents expressed elevated levels of trauma-specific and psychological outcomes, in particular interpersonal sensitivity and aggression.

AB Mental health is an important medical issue in perinatal care, and there is increasing evidence that insomnia during pregnancy is associated with postpartum depression (PPD). Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of insomnia treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy on PPD symptoms. Fifty-four pregnant women with insomnia were randomly assigned to trazodone, diphenhydramine, or placebo treatment. Sleep quality was measured by actigraphy at baseline, and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, depression was assessed 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. Trazodone and diphenhydramine improved sleep profile compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Further, depressive symptoms were reduced 2 and 6 weeks after delivery in trazodone and diphenhydramine groups compared to placebo. No differences in depressive symptoms were observed between the trazodone and diphenhydramine groups. These findings indicate that insomnia treatment with trazodone or diphenhydramine during the third trimester of pregnancy may prevent PPD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Narcolepsy is a rare disorder classified as hypersomnia of central origin. Its core symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. Associated symptoms, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, automatic behavior, and sleep fragmentation, are unspecific. Genetic, autoimmune, and environmental factors contribute to hypocretin deficiency.
   Areas covered: This article focuses on therapies for narcolepsy symptoms and comorbid disorders. Despite the enormous increase of knowledge about narcolepsy's pathologies no substance has been developed that can cure the disease. So far hypocretin substitution is not available. Substances targeting the autoimmune mechanism have failed to show objective improvement despite subjective improvement. The standard medication in adults comprises stimulants and anticataplectics. Only few substances are capable of improving core and associated symptoms. Within the last years, only modafinil and its enantiomer armodafinil and sodium oxybate have been approved as new substances.
   Expert opinion: The choice of stimulants to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy needs to be expanded and anticataplectic medication needs to be approved for the indication. Head-to-head comparisons between the established medications, studies of high evidence in older non-evidence-based medications, in children, pregnant women, and of behavioral therapy need to be performed including the long-term effects on metabolic and cardiovascular risks. Narcolepsy is a model disease for so many sleep disorders, among which it has the most severe daytime sleepiness. New insights into its etiology have advanced sleep medicine immensely. Still it stays an orphan in terms of treatment options which are challenging because narcolepsy covers so many symptoms from neuropsychological metabolic-, cardiovascular-, endocrinological-, movement disorders, and parasomnias to name a few.

AB Purpose: This qualitative study aimed to explore how Turkish women experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy based on the Roy Adaptation Model.
   Methods: To collect data, in-depth interviews were undertaken with 35 pregnant women who had nausea and vomiting. The sample of the study included pregnant women who were in their first 12 weeks of gestation, did not have medical problems and had nausea, retching and/or vomiting for at least the last 3 days. Data were collected in semi-structured interview form based on the Roy Adaptation Model and with a background data sheet. Data were analyzed using direct content analysis.
   Results: Data were classified into four adaptive modes according to the Roy Adaptation Model. The behaviors in the physiological mode were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, inadequate nutrition, inguinal pain, burning sensation and irritation in the throat, ketosis, and urinary incontinence. The behaviors in the self-concept mode were feeling weak, crying, inadequate self-care, changes in sexual intercourse, and social isolation. The behaviors in the role function mode were being unable to fulfill the responsibilities at home and work. The behaviors in the interdependence mode were dissatisfaction with relationships.
   Conclusion: The study findings help nursing staff detect the stimuli and the behaviors of pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Further research may evaluate the impact of a counseling program prepared under the guidance of a nursing model on nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

AB Objectives. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can contribute to a favorable disease course by their own behaviour and environmental adaptations. However, no standardized consensus recommendations on patient behavior and adaptations exist, neither internationally nor nationally. The aim of this study was to establish a core set of recommendations concerning favorable patient behavior to be given to patients with AS by rheumatologists.
   Methods. An extended literature research in the scientific and patient-oriented literature revealed 70 recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated and ranked by importance at a meeting of the Ankylosing Spondylitis International Federation (ASIF, 26 participants from 13 countries) in November 2011. The remaining 59 recommendations were extensively discussed, supplemented, partially reworded, condensed and those with the highest priority were selected by consensus at a seminar of local branch leaders of the AS patient organization in Germany (Deutsche Vereinigung Morbus Bechterew) in March 2012 (80 participants, 95% patients with AS).
   Results. The core set encompasses 1) a general statement on living with AS and 2) recommendations in the areas of sitting position, walking, sleeping, at work, exercising, sports and recreational activities, diet and life style, sexuality and pregnancy, fall prevention, car driving and membership in an AS-specific patient organization. The selected recommendations received agreement by 80-100% of the patients. Some recommendations (e. g. fall prevention and car driving) are more relevant to patients with advanced and usually longstanding disease, i.e. with advanced ankylosis or osteoporosis.
   Conclusions. For the first time a core set of recommendations for the behavior of patients with AS was created in collaboration with many persons affected by the disease. Patients with AS should receive these recommendations from their rheumatologists, ideally early in the disease course. The German version of this core set is presented in this article.

   RISK-FACTOR; MATERNAL STRESS; PRENATAL STRESS; UNITED-STATES; INSOMNIA;

AB Objective: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10-20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N=160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks' gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%-38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient (p<0.01). Depressive symptoms were higher among women with diary-defined sleep deficiency across all time points (p=0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB The establishment of the National Perinatal Depression Initiative (NPDI, 2008-2013) has brought a focus across Australia for the need to identify women at risk of perinatal mental health disorders, suggesting that routine screening by relevant health professionals may aid earlier detection, better care and improved outcomes. Midwives are frequently the primary point of contact in the perinatal period and thus ideally placed to identify, interpret and manage complex situations, including screening for perinatal mental health disorders.
   This paper offers strategies that could be implemented into daily midwifery practice in order to achieve the goals consistent with the National Perinatal Depression Initiative. A case study (Jen) and discussion, guided by recommendations from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Competency standards and beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines, are used to demonstrate how midwifery care can be provided.
   In accordance with her legal obligations, the midwife should act within her scope of practice to undertake a series of psychosocial and medical assessments in order to best determine how midwifery care and support can be of benefit to Jen, her infant and her family. Suggestions described include administration of validated screening questionnaires, clinical interview, physical assessment, discussion with partner, awareness of the mother-infant interactions and questioning around baby's sleep and feeding. Based on evaluation of the information gained from a bio-psycho-social assessment, suggestions are made as to the midwifery care options that could be applied.

   RESTRICTION; TRANSCRIPTION; ADAPTATIONS
AB OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea, a breathing disorder caused by the repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, results in a state of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Although the etiology and consequences of CIH are extensively investigated in the adult, the developmental ramifications of this disease process are unknown.
   DESIGN: This study was done to investigate the effect of CIH during gestation on offspring development. Pregnant female Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIH throughout the gestational period.
   RESULTS: Postnatal day-1 offspring from CIH mothers were asymmetrically growth restricted, with decreased body weights and elevated brain-weight: liver-weight ratios. Furthermore, CIH newborns had elevated heart-and brain-weight: body weight ratios, and decreased liver-weight: body weight ratios. By adulthood, body weights of growth restricted offspring were significantly greater, as were the liver-weight: body weight ratios. CIH offspring also had greater body fat deposition, were hyperglycemic and had elevated plasma levels of insulin during development into adults.
   CONCLUSION: These data suggest that alteration of the maternal intrauterine environment by gestational CIH effects the long-term development of the offspring and increases the risk of the offspring to metabolic diseases in adulthood.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence, course, and risk factors for nighttime hot flashes during the pregnancy and postpartum periods.
   Design: Clinical interview, physical measurements, and questionnaires administered at weeks 20, 30, and 36 of pregnancy and weeks 2, 12, 26, and 52 after delivery.
   Setting: Academic medical setting.
   Patient(s): 429 women.
   Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Nighttime hot flashes.
   Result(s): Thirty-five percent of women reported nighttime hot flashes during pregnancy and 29% after delivery. In multivariable binomial mixed effects models, women who were younger (per year: odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.99), had a higher prepregnancy body mass index (per unit increase: OR 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10), and had less than a college education (OR 2.58; 95% CI, 1.19-5.60; vs. >= Rcollege) were more likely to report nighttime hot flashes during pregnancy. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with nighttime hot flashes during pregnancy (per unit increase: OR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13) and the postpartum period (OR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14-1.25, multivariable models).
   Conclusion(s): Hot flashes, typically considered a menopausal symptom, were reported by over a third of women during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period. The predictors of these hot flashes, including depressive symptoms, low education, and higher body mass index are similar to those experienced during menopause. Future work should investigate the role of hormonal and affective factors in hot flashes during pregnancy and postpartum. (Fertil Steril (R) 2013;100:1667-72.

AB Objective: To investigate the effects of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on the reproductive capability of the offspring.
   Design: Using a sleep loss model or control home-cage group (male and females rats) to evaluate sexual behavior and hormonal profile in males and females F1 offispring.
   Setting: Laboratory.
   Animals(s): First experiment: Pregnant females were exposed to sleep restriction (SR) protocol and the F1 generation was evaluated. Second experiment: male rats were submitted to SR or paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) protocol and the F1 generation was evaluated.
   Intervention(s): Male and female rats were subjected to sleep restriction (SR) for 21 days or paradoxal sleep-deprived (PSD) for 96 hours.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Sexual behavior and hormonal levels during the adult phase were analyzed in F1 offspring of female and male rats submitted to sleep loss.
   Result(s): F1 male offspring of SR females had lower motivation for sex and reduced progesterone concentrations. In contrast, F1 female offspring displayed significantly enhanced proceptivity compared with control offspring. F1 female offspring also demonstrated hypersexuality by mounting the males in the absence of any significant hormonal alterations. F1 male offspring of SR or paradoxically sleep-deprived (PSD) males presented a decline in the sexual response, accompanied by a reduction in testosterone concentrations. Proceptivity was significantly increased among F1 female offspring of PSD and SR males compared with control offspring.
   Conclusion(s): SR in progenitors may alter sexual behavior of the F1 offspring in adulthood. These findings reveal far-reaching consequences of sleep deprivation, and suggest that parental sleep influences the reproductive capability of subsequent generations.

AB The East African root rat Tachyoryctes splendens (Ruppell, 1835) is a solitary subterranean rodent mole. The present study investigated breeding patterns in both sexes of T.splendens from data collected at monthly intervals over an entire calendar year. The study focused on the analyses from post-mortem examination of male and female East African root rats to assess the presence of foetuses, gonadal histology, reproductive tract morphometrics, measurement of gonadal steroids (plasma progesterone and oestradiol-17 in females and testosterone in males) and field observations (i.e. the presence of infants, juveniles, subadults and lactating females). The objective of this study was to assess if the reproductive biology of root rats reflected the bimodal pattern of rainfall that is characteristic of East Africa. Rainfall has been suggested to trigger breeding in many subterranean rodents and as a consequence, this study aimed to assess the relationship between rainfall and reproductive characteristics of T.splendens. Peaks in mean gonadal mass, increases in concentration of reproductive hormones and the presence of graafian follicles and corpora lutea in the ovaries of females, and testes mass, seminiferous tubule diameter and testosterone titre mirrored the annual peaks of precipitation at the study area. Together with field observations of the temporal occurrence of pregnancies, infants, juveniles and subadults, the data show that T.spendens cues its breeding with the patterns of rainfall, such that offspring are born in the latter half of each rainy season, from April to July and November to December.

AB Women are at increased risk of developing mood disorders during the postpartum period, and poor postpartum sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of depression. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited from their outpatient obstetricians' offices from July 2009 through March 2010. Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks (p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep, is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression symptoms.

AB Sleep and headache have both generated curiosity within the human mind for centuries. The relationship between headache and sleep disorders is very complex. While Lieving in 1873 first observed that headaches were linked to sleep, Dexter and Weitzman in 1970 described the relationship between headache and sleep stages. Though our understanding of sleep and headache relationship has improved over the years with expanding knowledge in both fields and assessment tools such as polysomnography, it is still poorly understood. Headache and sleep have an interdependent relationship. Headache may be intrinsically related to sleep (migraine with and without aura, cluster headache, hypnic headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania), may cause sleep disturbance (chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, and medication overuse headache) or a manifestation of a sleep disorder like obstructive sleep apnea. Headache and sleep disorder may be a common manifestation of systemic dysfunction-like anemia and hypoxemia. Headaches may occur during sleep, after sleep, and in relation to different sleep stages. Lack of sleep and excessive sleep are both considered triggers for migraine. Insomnia is more common among chronic headache patients. Experimental data suggest that there is a common anatomic and physiologic substrate. There is overwhelming evidence that cluster headache and hypnic headaches are chronobiological disorders with strong association with sleep and involvement of hypothalamus. Cluster headache shows a circadian and circannual rhythmicity while hypnic headache shows an alarm clock pattern. There is also a preferential occurrence of cluster headache, hypnic headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania during REM sleep. Silencing of anti-nociceptive network of periaqueductal grey (PAG), locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus doing REM sleep may explain the preferential pattern. Sleep related headaches can be classified into (1) headaches with high association with obstructive sleep apnea, which includes cluster headache, hypnic headache, and headache related to obstructive sleep apnea; and (2) headaches with high prevalence of insomnia, medication overuse, and psychiatric comorbidity including chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache. The initial step in the management of sleep related headache is proper diagnosis with exclusion of secondary headaches. Screening for sleep disorders with the use of proper tests including polysomnography and referral to sleep clinic, when appropriate is very helpful. Control of individual episode in less than 2 hours should be the initial goal using measures to abort and prevent a relapse. Cluster headache responds very well to injectable Imitrex and oxygen. Verapamil, steroids and lithium are used for preventive treatment of cluster headache. Intractable cluster headache patients have responded to hypothalamic deep brain stimulation. Hypnic headache patients respond to nightly caffeine, indomethacin, and lithium. Paroxysmal hemicrania responds very well to indomethacin. Early morning headaches associated with obstructive sleep apnea respond to CPAP or BiPAP with complete resolution of headache within a month. Patient education and lifestyle modification play a significant role in overall success of the treatment. Chronic tension-type headache and chronic migraine have high prevalence of insomnia and comorbid psychiatric disorders, which require behavioral insomnia treatment and medication if needed along with psychiatric evaluation.
   Apart from the abortive treatment tailored to the headache types, - such as triptans and DHE 45 for migraine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication for chronic tension-type headache, preventive treatment with different class of medications including antiepileptics (Topamax and Depakote), calcium channel blockers (verapamil), beta blockers (propranolol), antidepressants (amitriptyline), and Botox may be used depending upon the comorbid conditions.

AB We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed sleep-related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap duration and 24-hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy-derived nor self-reported sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep.

AB Snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and Cesarean deliveries. The purpose of this study was to assess whether excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) increases the risk of these complications further.
   Following institutional review board approval and informed consent, English-speaking women in the immediate postpartum period were systematically selected and recruited. Women answered a survey that included questions regarding symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using the multivariable apnea prediction index and excessive daytime sleepiness using ESS. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were collected by review of medical records. Standard statistical analysis with multivariable logistic regression was performed. ESS was evaluated both as a continuous variable and with various cutoffs given that pregnant women are likely more sleepy at baseline than the general population.
   In patients who underwent planned Cesarean delivery, mean ESS was significantly higher than in those with uncomplicated vaginal delivery, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.08; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.15; p = 0.02). There was no significant association between EDS (defined as ESS of > 10) and gestational diabetes or gestational hypertensive disorders in snorers or non snorers. However, a significant association with gestational diabetes was found in patients with an ESS of > 16 compared to those with an ESS of a parts per thousand currency sign16, even after multiple adjustments (aOR, 6.82; 95 % CI, 1.19-39.27), but the number of subjects in an ESS of > 16 category was small.
   There is an increased association between women with higher ESS and planned Cesarean delivery. Severe EDS was associated with gestational diabetes in pregnant women in a small sample size. Future studies in larger samples need to confirm the association of severe EDS and gestational diabetes and elucidate potential mechanisms of the links with adverse outcomes.

AB Survey questions are commonly used to assess sleep duration because of their low cost and convenience. Responses to these questions correlate moderately with objectively measured sleep duration in nonpregnant individuals, but little is known about the validity of self-reported sleep measures in pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which self-reported gestational sleep duration assessed by questionnaire predicted objectively measured gestational sleep duration via actigraphy.
   We analyzed data from 80 mothers enrolled in an ancillary study of Project BABIES, a prospective cohort study of urban, pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in midpregnancy and included 7 days of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and survey questions about sleep time adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
   Mean measured gestational sleep duration derived from actigraphy was 6.87 h [standard deviation (SD) 0.87], and questionnaire-assessed nocturnal sleep time averaged 7.29 h (SD 1.84). While the difference between measures did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 for paired samples t test), over half (62 %) of participants reported a habitual average nightly sleep time that differed more than 1 h from their average actigraphically measured sleep duration (39 % overestimated by more than an hour; 23 % underestimated by more than an hour). There was no correlation between measures (r = 0.007; 95 % confidence interval -0.21, 0.23).
   Questionnaire-derived reports of usual sleep hours do not reflect objectively measured sleep time in urban, pregnant women. Actigraphy is preferable to accurately assess gestational sleep duration.

AB Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is reported commonly during pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but the majority of these data are based upon self-report measures not validated for pregnancy. This study examined the predictive value of screening questionnaires for SDB administered at two time-points in pregnancy, and attempted to develop an optimized predictive model' for detecting SDB in pregnancy. A total of 380 women were recruited from an antenatal clinic in the second trimester of pregnancy. All participants completed the Berlin Questionnaire and the Multivariable Apnea Risk Index (MAP Index) at recruitment, with a subset of 43 women repeating the questionnaires at the time of polysomnography at 37weeks' gestation. Fifteen of 43 (35%) women were confirmed to have a respiratory disturbance index (RDI)>5h(-1). Prediction of an RDI>5h(-1) was most accurate during the second trimester for both the Berlin Questionnaire (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.50, positive predictive value 0.50 and negative predictive value 0.93), and the MAP Index [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.768]. A stepwise selection model identified snoring volume, a body mass index (BMI)32kgm(-2) and tiredness upon awakening as the strongest independent predictors of SDB during pregnancy; this model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.952. We conclude that existing clinical prediction models for SDB perform inadequately as a screening tool in pregnancy. The development of a highly predictive model from our data shows promise for a quick and easy screening tool to be validated for future use in pregnancy.

   RECOMMENDATIONS; EXPANSION; TRENDS; RISK; SIDS
AB IMPORTANCE Some professional associations advocate bedsharing to facilitate breastfeeding, while others recommend against it to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and suffocation deaths. A better understanding of the quantitative influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration is needed to guide policy.
   OBJECTIVE To quantify the influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal data were from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, which enrolled mothers while pregnant and followed them through the first year of infant life. Questionnaires were sent at infant ages 1 to 7,9,10, and 12 months, and 1846 mothers answered at least 1 question regarding bedsharing and were breastfeeding at infant age 2 weeks.
   EXPOSURES Bedsharing, defined as the mother lying down and sleeping with her infant on the same bed or other sleeping surfaces for nighttime sleep or during the major sleep period.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Survival analysis to investigate the effect of bedsharing on duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding.
   RESULTS Longer duration of bedsharing, indicated by a larger cumulative bedsharing score, was associated with a longer duration of any breastfeeding but not exclusive breastfeeding, after adjusting for covariates. Breastfeeding duration was longer among women who were better educated, were white, had previously breastfed, had planned to breastfeed, and had not returned to work in the first year postpartum.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Multiple factors were associated with breastfeeding, including bedsharing. Given the risk of sudden infant death syndrome related to bedsharing, multipronged strategies to promote breastfeeding should be developed and tested.

AB Epidemiological studies demonstrated initially that maternal undernutrition results in low birth weight with increased risk for long-lasting energy balance disorders. Maternal obesity and diabetes associated with high birth weight, excessive nutrition in neonates, and rapid catchup growth also increase the risk of adult-onset obesity. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease concept, nutrient supply perturbations in the fetus or neonate result in long-term programming of individual body weight set point. Adipose tissue is a key fuel storage unit involved mainly in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Studies in numerous animal models have demonstrated that the adipose tissue is the focus of developmental programming events in a sex- and depot-specific manner. In rodents, adipose tissue development is particularly active during the perinatal period, especially during the last week of gestation and during early postnatal life. In contrast to rodents, this process essentially takes place before birth in bigger mammals. Despite these different developmental time windows, altricial and precocial species share several mechanisms of adipose tissue programming. Offspring from malnourished dams present adipose tissue with a series of alterations: impaired glucose uptake, insulin and leptin resistance, low-grade inflammation, modified sympathetic activity with reduced noradrenergic innervations, and thermogenesis. These modifications reprogram adipose tissue metabolism by changing fat distribution and composition and by enhancing adipogenesis, predisposing the offspring to fat accumulation. Subtle adipose tissue circadian rhythm changes are also observed. Inappropriate hormone levels, modified tissue sensitivity (especially glucocorticoid system), and epigenetic mechanisms are key factors for adipose tissue programming during the perinatal period.

AB ObjectiveTo synthesize published research on genetic and heredity findings related to restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a pregnant population.
   Data SourcesPubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases and reference lists from published articles.
   Study SelectionLiterature searches were conducted for primary research studies published in English on the genetic and heredity findings of RLS in pregnant populations.
   Data ExtractionStudy characteristics and findings related to genetic and heredity aspects of RLS in a pregnant population.
   Data SynthesisFive data-based articles met the criteria for study inclusion. Study findings comprised Level-2 and Level-3 evidence. Four of the five studies were larger population studies and contained a subset of pregnant participants. Parity and family history were important predictors of RLS proband status. Probands reported symptoms were often initiated during or after pregnancy.
   ConclusionsSymptoms of RLS for female probands are often initiated during pregnancy or after childbirth. A history of RLS in a previous pregnancy and family history of RLS were strong predictors of RLS in the current pregnancy. Future research on genetic associations of RLS in pregnancy is warranted.

AB We report on two pregnant women who either had de novo restless legs syndrome (RLS) or had marked enhancement of preexisting RLS symptoms during pregnancy. Both patients had ferritin values <50 mu g/L at baseline. The patients had relevant sleep disorders and daytime symptoms caused by RLS. The women were treated in an open paradigm with intravenous iron sucrose. A few weeks after therapy, both patients experienced a significant reduction or even remission of RLS symptoms. Their quality of life and sleep substantially improved and no treatment-related adverse effects were observed. According to our initial experience, intravenous iron sucrose administration appears to be an effective therapy in RLS patients with low ferritin values during pregnancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB Objective: Tooth eruption is a multifactorial process in which bone tissue plays a prevailing role. In this study we evaluated the bone overlying the developing tooth germ and the degree of tooth eruption of the first mandibular molar in pups born to mothers subjected to constant light during pregnancy.
   Design: Pregnant rats were divided into two groups: mothers chronically exposed to a 12:12 light/light cycle (LL) from day 10 to 20 of pregnancy and controls (C) maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. Pups from each group were euthanized at the age 3 or 15 days.
   Buccolingually oriented sections of mandibles were stained with haematoxylin-eosin or for histochemical detection of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The histomorphometric parameters evaluated were bone volume, number of osteoclasts, TRAP+ bone surface, number of TRAP+ and TRAP- osteoclasts per mm(2) and degree of tooth eruption (mm).
   Results: It was found an increase in bone volume (LL: 58.14 +/- 4.24 vs. C: 32.31 +/- 2.16; p < 0.01) and a decrease in the number of osteoclasts (LL: 3.5 +/- 0.65 vs. C: 8.03 +/- 1.31; p < 0.01) and TRAP+ cells (LL: 0.84 +/- 0.53 vs. C: 8.59 +/- 1.26; p < 0.01) in 3-day-old pups born to LL-exposed mothers. These observations are consistent with the decrease in the degree of tooth eruption observed in 15-day-old experimental pups (LL: -0.605 +/- 0.05 vs. C: -0.342 +/- 0.02; p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that chronic constant light applied as a pre-natal stressor impairs the resorptive capacity of osteoclasts involved in the formation of the eruption pathway and consequently the degree of tooth eruption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman's ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4-15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score a parts per thousand yen9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years +/- A 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m(2) +/- A 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored a parts per thousand yen9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

AB Study Objective: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and small-for-gestational age.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: A large tertiary medical center.
   Patients or Participants: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010.
   Measurements and Results: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-for-gestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes.

AB Objetive To determine whether full-term newborn infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) present immature/disorganised EEG patterns in the immediate neonatal period, and whether there was any relationship with maternal glycaemic control.
   Design and setting Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a tertiary hospital neonatal unit.
   Patients 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born between 2010 and 2013.
   Interventions All underwent video-EEG recording lasting >90min at 48-72h of life.
   Main outcome measures We analysed the percentage of indeterminate sleep, transient sharp waves per hour and mature-for-gestational age EEG patterns (discontinuity, maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI), asynchrony, asymmetry, brushes, encoches frontales and / rolandic activity). The group of IDM was divided into two subgroups according to maternal HbA1c: (1) HbA1c6% and (2) HbA1c<6%.
   Results Compared with healthy newborns, IDM presented significantly higher percentage of indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%; p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and brushes in the bursts (6% vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3s vs 0s; p=0.017); fewer encoches frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced / rolandic activity (3/h vs 9/h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; p<0.001). IDM with maternal HbA1c6% showed greater percentage of brushes in the burst (14% vs 4%; p=0.007).
   Conclusions Full-term IDM newborns showed video-EEG features of abnormal development of brain function. Maternal HbA1c levels<6% during pregnancy could minimise the risk of cerebral dysmaturity.

AB Background. Shift-work is suggested to affect fetal development negatively. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm changes may disturb fetal growth or lead to complications during pregnancy. Exposure to constant light is an environmental stressor that can affect the circadian system and has been shown to induce neurochemical and behavioral changes when used during the prenatal and/or postnatal period in experimental animals. However, studies investigating long-term effects of constant light in the offspring are sparse.
   Methods. An accidental power outage resulted in pregnant females being housed under constant light (LL) conditions for seven days of the offspring perinatal development (embryonic day 20 to postnatal day 4). The long-term effects of constant light on the behavior in the adult offspring were assessed by means of open field, object recognition, and water maze tests.
   Results. In adulthood, LL-animals displayed an intact recognition memory and no deficits in spatial learning or memory. In the open field test, LL-animals exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior, observed as significantly more thigmotaxis and less ambulation. These results were confirmed in the other behavioral tests as the LL-animals spent less time exploring the objects in the object recognition test, and showed thigmotactic behavior also in the water maze test.
   Conclusion. The results confirm that early life experience can cause changes in brain development that shape brain function and add to the sparse literature on long-term effects of constant light conditions during perinatal development on specific behaviors in adulthood.

AB Electromagnetic field (EMF) radiations emitted from mobile phones may cause structural damage to neurons. With the increased usage of mobile phones worldwide, concerns about their possible effects on the nervous system are rising. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the possible effects of prenatal EMF exposure on the cerebellum of offspring Wistar rats. Rats in the EMF group were exposed to 900-MHz pulse-EMF irradiation for 6 h per day during all gestation period. Ten offspring per each group were evaluated for behavioral and electrophysiological evaluations. Cerebellum-related behavioral dysfunctions were analyzed using motor learning and cerebellum-dependent functional tasks (Accelerated Rotarod, Hanging and Open field tests). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used for electrophysiological evaluations. The results of the present study failed to show any behavioral abnormalities in rats exposed to chronic EMF radiation. However, whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed decreased neuronal excitability of Purkinje cells in rats exposed to EMF. The most prominent changes included afterhyperpolarization amplitude, spike frequency, half width and first spike latency. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that prenatal EMF exposure results in altered electrophysiological properties of Purkinje neurons. However, these changes may not be severe enough to alter the cerebellum-dependent functional tasks. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cardiovascular diseases are the principal cause of death in women in developed countries and are importantly promoted by hypertension. The salt sensitivity of blood pressure (BP) is considered as an important cardiovascular risk factor at any BP level. Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that arises as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study measured the salt sensitivity of BP in women with a severe preeclampsia compared with women with no pregnancy hypertensive complications. Forty premenopausal women were recruited 10 years after delivery in a case-control study. Salt sensitivity was defined as an increase of >4 mm Hg in 24-hour ambulatory BP on a high-sodium diet. The ambulatory BP response to salt was significantly increased in women with a history of preeclampsia compared with that of controls. The mean (95% confidence interval) daytime systolic/diastolic BP increased significantly from 115 (109-118)/79 (76-82) mm Hg on low-salt diet to 123 (116-130)/80 (76-84) on a high-salt diet in women with preeclampsia, but not in the control group (from 111 [104-119]/77 [72-82] to 111 [106-116]/75 [72-79], respectively, P<0.05). The sodium sensitivity index (SSI=Delta mean arterial pressure/Delta urinary Na excretionx1000) was 51.2 (19.1-66.2) in women with preeclampsia and 6.6 (5.8-18.1) mm Hg/mol per day in controls (P=0.015). The nocturnal dip was blunted on a high-salt diet in women with preeclampsia. Our study shows that women who have developed preeclampsia are salt sensitive before their menopause, a finding that may contribute to their increased cardiovascular risk. Women with a history of severe preeclampsia should be targeted at an early stage for preventive measures of cardiovascular diseases.

AB We tested if the risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with PTSD symptoms was dependent on comorbid sleep disturbance. Our cross-sectional sample included 2465 participants with complete data from the 21 year follow-up of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a birth cohort study of young Australians. Using structural equation modelling with indirect pathways we found that 12 month PTSD symptoms did not directly predict suicidal ideation at 21 when adjusting for major depression symptoms, polyvictimization and gender. However, PTSD symptoms had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via past-month sleep disturbance. Our results suggest that increased suicidal ideation in those with PTSD may result from the fact that PTSD sufferers often exhibit other comorbid psychiatric conditions which are themselves known to predict suicidal behaviours. Sleep disturbance may be targeted in those who experience PTSD to help prevent suicidal ideation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death among infants aged 1 to 12 months. In this article, we review risk factors that may predispose infants to increased vulnerability. Maternal characteristics, including nonmodifiable and modifiable factors, antenatal medical conditions, labor and delivery events, and infant characteristics, are reviewed, with the purpose of helping obstetric care providers target risk reduction efforts. We have reviewed over 85 case-control, retrospective, and prospective cohort studies published between 1975 and 2011. Major modifiable risk factors include maternal and paternal smoking, drug use, alcohol use, and insufficient prenatal care. Infants at increased risk include males, premature infants, infants of low birth weight or growth-restricted infants, and infants in multiple gestations. By targeting modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, it may be possible to decrease the incidence of SIDS. Efforts should be put on decreasing high-risk behaviors and encouraging sufficient antenatal follow-up. In view of recent increases in ethnic and social disparity with SIDS, it is essential that risk reduction guidelines, which have recently been expanded by the American Association of Pediatrics, be explained in a culturally sensitive manner.

SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE

ID SHORT-COMMUNICATION; ANIMAL-WELFARE; BEHAVIOR; CATTLE; MOTIVATION;
   STRESS; ESTRUS; TIME
AB Animals allocate time and effort to a range of core (e.g., sleeping, feeding, drinking) and "luxury" (e.g., playing, exploring) activities. A luxury activity is characterized by low resilience and, as such, will be reduced when time or energy resources are limited, including under conditions of stress or discomfort. One seemingly luxurious activity available to cows on an increasing number of dairy farms is rubbing against an automated brush. The current study examined the effect of distance from food, heat load, and an intrusive medical procedure (i.e., artificial insemination and transrectal pregnancy examination) on the resilience of brush usage. The probability of using the brush decreased significantly when food was located distantly from the brush (mean = 0.53) compared with days when food was located closer to the brush (mean = 0.81). Brush usage also decreased at high temperature and humidity levels, with an average decrease of 0.062 brushing events for an increase of 1 temperature-humidity index unit (95% confidence interval = -0.93-0.030). In addition, a significant reduction of approximately 50% in brushing activity was observed on days of artificial insemination compared with the preceding 3 d and the following 3 d. These findings show that brush usage is a low resilience activity that reduces under a range of conditions. It may thus have the potential to be used as an indicator of a range of health and welfare problems in cows. Further research should be conducted to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this suggested tool and its possible contribution to the early detection of morbidity.

ID MORNINGNESS-EVENINGNESS
AB We have investigated if biological rhythms, which affect many physiological and pathological events, influence the time of birth. Two hundred and sixty-three cases who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of active labor and who delivered vaginally were enrolled in the study. Information about the age, gravidity, parity, gestational age on admission, and time of onset of labor and birth was registered. A Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was administered for determining the patients' chronotypes and dividing them into a morning- or evening-type group. While 20 (35%) of the morning-types delivered between 18:00 and 24:00h, only 11 (19%) of them delivered between 06:00 and 12:00h. From the evening types, 6 (33%) delivered between 18:00 and 24:00h and 3 (17%) between 06:00 and 12:00h. We conclude that there was no statistically significant difference between the chronotypes in terms of delivery time.

AB Aim. The aim of this paper was to know and analyze information, attitudes and behaviors related with transformations occurring in men when they become fathers.
   Methods. A self-administered questionnaire has been given out to all men whose newborns were born in the Hospitals located into Borgosesia, Ivrea, Novara, Verbania and Vercelli (Piedmont region in north west of the Italy) in the last quarter of 2006. The questionnaire was created ad hoc and filled out on the day of discharge; results underwent statistical analyses through SPSS system.
   Results. For the duration of the research, out of 870 men who became fathers in the hospitals were involved in this study, 570 responded voluntarily to the self-administerd questionnaire (65.6% of the total sample). They showed a lack of information about how to take care of their newborns and the emotional turmoil of women after delivery (58% think children are blind when they are born, 52% think it is better to breastfeed newborns at fixed times and 47% ignore that mothers can enter a depression state). Eighty-eight percent of respondents were in the delivery room to see their child's birth, 56% took a leave from job to stay with mother and child in the hospital and 58% of them report the intention to take an additional 2-3 days leave after coming home from the hospital; 27% had trouble sleeping during pregnancy and are afraid not to be good fathers for their child; 90% believe that their newborn will make them change life habits. Most of the new fathers had difficulties in sharing emotions and feelings related with their status of fathers-to-be with other men. Some of these results are significantly different in older fathers, fathers having their first child and fathers with a lesser level of education.
   Conclusion. During pregnancy and in the first months after their child is born, fathersto-be and new fathers must be considered a potential target for educational interventions aiming at promoting their parenting information and reinforcing their positive attitudes and beliefs related with their fathering status.

AB OBJECTIVERecently, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been reported to be associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Accordingly, as this is emergent area of research that has significant clinical relevance, the objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between SDB with GDM.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe searched several electronic databases for all of the studies published before January 2013 and reviewed references of published articles. Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate the unadjusted and BMI-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a random effects model. Significant values, weighted effect sizes, and 95% CIs were calculated, and tests of homogeneity of variance were performed.RESULTSResults from nine independent studies with a total of 9,795 pregnant women showed that SDB was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Women with SDB had a more than threefold increased risk of GDM, with a pooled BMI-adjusted OR 3.06 (95% CI 1.89-4.96).CONCLUSIONSThese findings demonstrate a significant association between SDB and GDM that is evident even after considered confounding by obesity. This meta-analysis indicates a need to evaluate the role of early recognition and treatment of SDB early during pregnancy.

AB Objective: To investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and to evaluate factors associated with RLS in a population of Iranian pregnant women. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, 443 consecutive pregnant women admitted for delivery underwent an interview within 2 days of parturition. The diagnosis of RLS was established by the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The severity of RLS was assessed through the IRLSSG Rating Scale. Results: Seventy-nine (17.8%) women met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with most (74.7%) having RLS of moderate severity. The mean RLS duration before delivery was 3.1 +/- 2.1 months among 69 (873%) women; 10 (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Sleep disturbances including insomnia and early awakening were significantly more common among women with RLS than among those without (P < 0.001), and the frequency of cesarean delivery was also significantly higher (58.2% versus 44.5%, P = 0.027; odds ratio 2.4). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, number of pregnancies, folate and iron supplementation, hemoglobin level, and neonatal anthropometric data. Conclusion: Restless legs syndrome is common during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep and an increased risk of cesarean delivery.

AB Context: Questionnaire studies linked symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Whether this association is present when OSA is assessed objectively by polysomnography is not known.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between pregnancy, OSA, and GDM.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted observational case-control studies using polysomnography in 15 nonpregnant, non diabetic women(NP-NGT), 15 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (P-NGT), and 15 pregnant women with GDM (P-GDM). The groups were frequency matched for age and race/ethnicity. Pregnant women were studied during the late second to early third trimester.
   Main Outcome Measures: Comparisons of OSA diagnosis and sleep parameters between NP-NGT and P-NGT to assess the impact of pregnancy and between P-NGT and P-GDM to explore the association between GDM and OSA were measured.
   Results: Compared with NP-NGT, P-NGT women had a higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (median 2.0 vs 0.5, P = .03) and more disrupted sleep as reflected by a higher wake time after sleep onset (median 66 vs 21 min, P = .01) and a higher microarousal index (median 16.4 vs 10.6, P = .01). Among the pregnant women, P-GDM had markedly lower total sleep time (median 397 vs 464 min, P = .02) and a higher AHI (median 8.2 vs 2.0, P = .05) than P-NGT women. OSA was more prevalent in P-GDM than in P-NGT women (73% vs 27%, P = .01). After adjustment for prepregnancy body mass index, the diagnosis of GDM was associated with a diagnosis of OSA [odds ratio 6.60 (95% confidence interval 1.15-37.96)]. In pregnancy, after adjusting for prepregnancy body mass index, higher microarousal index significantly associated with higher hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose levels. Higher oxygen desaturation index was associated with higher fasting glucose levels.
   Conclusion: Pregnancy is associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep is more disturbed in GDM than in P-NGT women. There is a strong association between GDM and OSA.

AB Aim To evaluate the impact of moderate noise on the sleep of very early preterm infants (VPI).
   Methods Observational study of 26 VPI of 26-31weeks' gestation, with prospective measurements of sound pressure level and concomitant video records. Sound peaks were identified and classified according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above background noise. Prechtl's arousal states during sound peaks were assessed by two observers blinded to the purpose of the study. Changes in sleep/arousal states following sound peaks were compared with spontaneous changes during randomly selected periods without sound peaks.
   Results We identified 598 isolated sound peaks (5SNR<10 decibel slow response A (dBA), n=518; 10SNR<15dBA, n=80) during sleep. Awakenings were observed during 33.8% (95% CI, 24-43.7%) of exposures to sound peaks of 5-10dBA SNR and 39.7% (95% CI, 26-53.3%) of exposures to sound peaks of SNR 10-15dBA, but only 11.7% (95% CI, 6.2-17.1%) of control periods. The proportions of awakenings following sound peaks were higher than the proportions of arousals during control periods (p<0.005).
   Conclusions Moderate acoustic changes can disrupt the sleep of VPI, and efficient sound abatement measures are needed.

AB Aim To investigate gender-related differences in amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) associated with neurodevelopmental outcome at 3years.
   Methods Preterms born <30weeks' gestational age between 2000 and 2002 were prospectively included. aEEGs obtained within the first 2weeks of life were classified according to aEEG composite scores - including background pattern, sleep-wake cycling (SWC) and seizure activity. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 3years of age.
   Results Neurodevelopmental outcome data was available for 148 of 264 eligible infants - 64 showed a normal outcome and 84 an impaired outcome. A logistic regression model revealed a significant independent influence of IVH, analgetic/sedative/anticonvulsant medication, gestational age and gender on aEEG composite scores. Odds ratios for having an abnormal aEEG composite score within the first 2weeks of life for female sex', no IVH', no medication' and gestational age' were calculated. aEEG did not differ between males and females with normal outcomes. In patients with abnormal outcome, however, male preterms showed more burst-suppression patterns and less SWC when compared with female preterms.
   Conclusion Being male with an abnormal outcome at 3years of age is reflected by a less mature early aEEG when compared with the one of females. This association is independent of IVH and medication and was less evident with increasing gestational age.

AB Background: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Methods: Twelve women (age +/- SD=26.9 +/- 5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase.
   Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts >= 30 min. On average +/- SD, new mothers phase delayed 42 +/- 80 min (range = 163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6.
   Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication.
   Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Early and rapid growth in Infants is strongly associated with early development and persistence of obesity in young children. Substantial research has linked child obesity/overweight to increased risks for serious health outcomes, which include adverse physical, psychological, behavioral, or social consequences.
   Methods/design: The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of structured Community Health Worker (CHW) provided home visits, using an intervention created through community-based participatory research, to standard care received through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) office visits in preventing the development of overweight (weight/length >= 85th percentile) and obesity (weight/ length >= 95th percentile) in infants during their first 3 years of life. One hundred forty pregnant women in their third trimester (30-36 weeks) will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group.
   Discussion: This study will provide prospective data on the effects of an intervention to prevent childhood obesity in children at high risk for obesity due to ethnicity, income, and maternal body mass index (BMI). It will have wideranging applicability and the potential for rapid dissemination through the WIC program, and will demonstrate the effectiveness of a community approach though employing CHWs in preventing obesity during the first 3 years of life. This easy-to-implement obesity prevention intervention can be adapted for many locales and diverse communities and can provide evidence for policy change to influence health throughout life.

AB Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are currently diagnosed in the presence of impairments in social interaction and communication, and a restricted range of activities and interests. However, there is considerable variability in the behaviors of different individuals with an ASD diagnosis. The heterogeneity spans the entire range of IQ and language abilities, as well as other behavioral, communicative, and social functions. While any psychiatric condition is likely to incorporate a degree of heterogeneity, the variability in the nature and severity of behaviors observed in ASD is thought to exceed that of other disorders. The current paper aims to provide a model for future research into ASD subgroups. In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW), and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The findings from this "proof of principle" paper provide support for this "bottom-up" approach as a feasible method for creating homogenous groups.

AB Fetal brain development involves the development of the neuro-vegetative (autonomic) control that is mediated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Disturbances of the fetal brain development have implications for diseases in later postnatal life. In that context, the fetal functional brain age can be altered. Universal principles of developmental biology applied to patterns of autonomic control may allow a functional age assessment. The work aims at the development of a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS) based on heart rate patterns. We analysed n = 113 recordings in quiet sleep, n = 286 in active sleep, and n = 29 in active awakeness from normals. We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet sleep (n = 113, 63 females) and active sleep (n = 286, 145 females) state by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. According to universal system developmental principles, we included indices that address increasing fluctuation range, increasing complexity, and pattern formation (skewness, power spectral ratio VLF/LF, pNN5). The resulting models constituted fABAS. fABAS explained 66/63% (coefficient of determination R 2 of training and validation set) of the variance by age in quiet, while 51/50% in active sleep. By means of a logistic regression model using fluctuation range and fetal age, quiet and active sleep were automatically reclassified (94.3/93.1% correct classifications). We did not find relevant gender differences. We conclude that functional brain age can be assessed based on universal developmental indices obtained from autonomic control patterns. fABAS reflect normal complex functional brain maturation. The presented normative data are supplemented by an explorative study of 19 fetuses compromised by intrauterine growth restriction. We observed a shift in the state distribution towards active awakeness. The lower WGA dependent fABAS values found in active sleep may reflect alterations in the universal developmental indices, namely fluctuation amplitude, complexity, and pattern formation that constitute fABAS.

AB Background: In Benin, around four million Long-Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets were freely distributed to household to prevent malaria in 2011. In contrast to a previous campaign that targeted only children under 5 years and pregnant women, this distribution campaign was conducted in order to achieve universal coverage. This study presents the results of LLIN coverage and utilization after the distribution campaign.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional household survey which utilized a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. The strata represented the twelve departments covered by the national distribution campaign in 2011 and included a total of 4,800 households randomly selected in the country. A questionnaire adapted from the standard Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) Household Questionnaire was used. Data were entered using QPS software and analyzed with R 2.14.1.
   Results: LLIN ownership was 86.4% (74 - 94). On average, each household received 3 LLINs (2-4). The proportion of households that met the ratio one net for two persons was 77%. The proportions of individuals sleeping under LLINs were high (84.8%). LLIN use among urban residents was 10% lower than in effective users from rural areas (P = 0.00224).
   Conclusions: The universal distribution campaign conducted in Benin has increased LLIN ownership and use in the community. But additional efforts are need to improve and maintain LLIN coverage.

ID TEENAGE PREGNANCY; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; WOMEN; YOUTH
AB Background: Sexual violence is a major public health concern as well as human rights violation. Homeless women are far more likely to experience violence of all sorts than women in general. The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence and consequence of rape, and explore the reasons and factors associated with rape among street females in Bahir-Dar town, North West Ethiopia.
   Methods: This is a mixed method study which included: a survey of 395 street females age 15 - 49; key informant interview with 4 stakeholders; 5 case studies; one focus group of 10 street females and one focus group of 10 street males. Street females are those who spend most of their time on the street and who depend on the street for their life. Qualitative and quantitative data were assessed separately with thematic and statistical analysis respectively. Quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. Bivariate and Multivariate analysis were determined.
   Results: Life time prevalence of rape was 24.3% and the prevalence of rape in the last year was 11.4%. Factors like females "off" the street [OR (95% CI) = 6.2 (3.0, 12.9)], being a prostitute [OR (95% CI) = 4.1 (1.5, 11.1)] and age 15-29 [OR (95% CI) = 3.5 (1.1, 11.2)] were significantly associated with rape. Most, 93.8% of the rapes were not reported to legal bodies. None of the victims used condom during the rape event. Only, 4 (4.2%) of the victims used emergency contraceptive method following the rape event. Out of the total of 96 victims of rape, 13 (19.1%) and 9 (13.2%) experienced unwanted pregnancy and induced abortion respectively. Beside, 38 (41%) and 15 (22%) victims claimed genital injury and unusual vaginal discharge respectively. Psychological consequence like, hating others by 34 (35.8%), fear and concern for HIV/AIDS by 44 (46.6%), guilt feeling by 28 (29.4%) and loss of interest in sexual activity by 28 (29.4%) of victims were reported. Majority, 42.9% of victims attribute their victimization with sleeping in areas where there are many brothels. Being physically weak, long stay in street life, and sleeping around street males were reasons mentioned for rape by 11.9%, 29.7% and 15.4% of rape victims respectively.
   Conclusion: In general, there is a very high prevalence of rape exacting significant physical and psychological tolls in victims of the study. Therefore, timely and integrated actions of the various stakeholders working in this area are crucial to curtail this critical human rights violation.

AB Objective: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes. Methods: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n - 168) at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events. Results: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (<7 hours) was associated with higher interleukin (IL)-8 across time (beta = 0.506, p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (<85%) was associated with higher IL-6 (beta = 0.205, p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor alpha (beta = 0.105, p =.024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values <.053). Among depressedwomen, interferon-gamma increased risk for pretermbirth (odds ratio - 1.175, p-.032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (beta = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-gamma and lower birth weight (beta = -19.92, p < .069), and increased IL-8 and babies weighing less than 4000 grams (odds ratio = 0.72, p < .083) were observed. Conclusions: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships.

AB Nearly all pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) to some degree, yet its effects on quality of life (QOL) have not been studied extensively. The National Voice of Pregnancy survey was undertaken to increase understanding about the symptoms of NVP and their impact on QOL in women in the United States. In all, 621 currently or recently pregnant women completed an online survey about their NVP experiences. Their responses indicated that NVP can occur at any time of day or night and can have negative effects on eating, sleeping, and ability to handle domestic and occupational responsibilities. Relationships with spouse, family, friends, and coworkers can also be adversely affected. The effects of NVP are greater in women with moderate or severe symptoms, but women with mild NVP are also affected. These findings are consistent with previous studies conducted in various countries. Women sometimes fail to discuss NVP with their health care providers, and QOL issues rarely come up if it is discussed. Most women try dietary and other lifestyle modifications first to control their symptoms. Safe and effective medications are also available to help ease the symptoms of NVP and thereby improve QOL.

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) impacts on both structural and functional brain development in childhood, but how early its effects can be demonstrated is unknown. In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma frequency range in awake 6-9-month-olds from areas of East London with high socioeconomic deprivation. Between-subject comparisons of infants from low- and high-income families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants from low-income homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing infants according to maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups yielding lower power. Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and birth weight, as well as smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these differences. Our results show that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on brain activity can already be detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to very early risk for language and attention difficulties. This is the first study to reveal region-selective differences in functional brain development associated with early infancy in low-income families.

AB Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory animals, and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is being used increasingly in both clinical practice and hypertension research. Although there are many guidelines that emphasize the indications for ABPM, there is no comprehensive guideline dealing with all aspects of the technique. It was agreed at a consensus meeting on ABPM in Milan in 2011 that the 34 attendees should prepare a comprehensive position paper on the scientific evidence for ABPM.This position paper considers the historical background, the advantages and limitations of ABPM, the threshold levels for practice, and the cost-effectiveness of the technique. It examines the need for selecting an appropriate device, the accuracy of devices, the additional information and indices that ABPM devices may provide, and the software requirements.At a practical level, the paper details the requirements for using ABPM in clinical practice, editing considerations, the number of measurements required, and the circumstances, such as obesity and arrhythmias, when particular care needs to be taken when using ABPM.The clinical indications for ABPM, among which white-coat phenomena, masked hypertension, and nocturnal hypertension appear to be prominent, are outlined in detail along with special considerations that apply in certain clinical circumstances, such as childhood, the elderly and pregnancy, and in cardiovascular illness, examples being stroke and chronic renal disease, and the place of home measurement of blood pressure in relation to ABPM is appraised.The role of ABPM in research circumstances, such as pharmacological trials and in the prediction of outcome in epidemiological studies is examined and finally the implementation of ABPM in practice is considered in relation to the issue of reimbursement in different countries, the provision of the technique by primary care practices, hospital clinics and pharmacies, and the growing role of registries of ABPM in many countries.

AB In March 2012, an article in The Straits Times entitled 'Freezing eggs could reverse falling birth rate' suggested that employing the latest oocyte cryopreservation techniques could both foster individual women's reproductive autonomy and impact Singapore's fertility rate, which in recent years has consistently been among the world's lowest. The article cited both local and international fertility specialists' approval of elective oocyte cryopreservation for young women wishing to protect their reproductive potential against ageing and as a potential antidote to the contemporary 'delay and defer' model of family-building. Later in 2012, the Ministry of Health announced a review of oocyte cryopreservation policy taking into account related medical, scientific and ethical issues, while the Singapore College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists endorsed oocyte cryopreservation as an "important, safe and efficient technology". This paper outlines and analyses the arguments and empirical evidence used both to support and oppose offering elective oocyte cryopreservation as a routine fertility service, before concluding that this remains unjustifiable on the basis of insufficient evidence of its clinical efficacy and safety as regards either pregnancy rates or birth outcomes. If it is to be made available at all for these reasons in Singapore, it should be subjected to rigorous clinic-specific evaluation in accordance with accepted clinical and ethical norms.

AB Objectives: The present study was designed to identify the association between work hours and obesity in Korean adult manual and nonmanual workers, and to determine whether there is a gender difference in this association. Methods: The study was conducted using Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected between 2007 and 2010. Individuals aged below 25 or over 64 years, pregnant women, part-time workers, soldiers, housewives and students were excluded. The total number of individuals included in the analysis was 8,889 (5,241 male and 3,648 female subjects). The outcome variable was obesity, defined as body mass index kg/m(2). Variables considered in the model were age, education, income, marital status, alcohol drinking, smoking, daily energy intake, physical activity, sleep hours per day, the type of job, work hours, and work schedule. Work hours were categorized as <40, 40-48 (reference), 49-60, and >60 hours per week. Results: In the multiple SURVEYLOGISTIC regression analyses, the adjusted odds ratio of obesity for long work hours (>60 hours per week) in male manual workers was 1.647 (95% confidence interval 1.262-2.151). Long work hours did not significantly increase the odds ratio for obesity in male nonmanual workers and female manual and nonmanual workers. Conclusions: More than 60 work hours per week increased the risk of obesity in Korean male manual workers. This result might be helpful in preventing obesity in Korean adult workers, especially male manual workers.

AB Perinatal alcohol exposure (AE) has multiple detrimental effects on cognitive and various behavioral outcomes, but little is known about its impact on the autonomic functions. In a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), we investigated neurochemical and neuroanatomical alterations in two brainstem nuclei, the hypoglossal nucleus (XIIn) and the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve (Xdn).
   One group of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6) received 2.625 g/kg ethanol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy, and another group (n = 6) was sham-intubated. On PD 18-19, the rats were perfused and medullary sections were immunohistochemically processed for choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) or two aminergic receptors that mediate excitatory drive to motoneurons, alpha(1)-adrenergic (alpha(1)-R) and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A-R), and c-Fos.
   Based on ChAT labeling, AE rats had reduced numbers of motoneurons in the ventral XIIn (XIIn-v; 35.4 +/- 13 motoneurons per side and section vs. 40.0 +/- 1.2, p = 0.022), but not in the dorsal XIIn or Xdn. Consistent with ChAT data, both the numbers of alpha(1)-R-labeled motoneurons in the XIIn-v and the area of the XIIn-v measured using 5-HT2A-R staining were significantly smaller in AE rats (19.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 25.0 +/- 1.4, p = 0.031 and 0.063 mm(2) +/- 0.002 vs. 0.074 +/- 0.002, p = 0.002, respectively). Concurrently, both 5-HT2A-R and c-Fos staining tended to be higher in AE rats, suggesting an increased activation.
   Thus, postnatal AE causes motoneuronal loss in the XIIn-v. This may compromise upper airway control and contribute to increased risk of upper airway obstructions and sudden infant death in FASD victims. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (a sudden weakening of posture muscle tone usually triggered by emotion) caused by the loss of orexin neurons in the hypothalamus. Autoimmune mechanisms are implicated in narcolepsy by increased frequency of specific HLA alleles and the presence of specific autoantibody (anti-Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) antibodies) in the sera of patients with narcolepsy. Presently, we passively transferred narcolepsy to naive mice by injecting intra-cerebra-ventricularly (ICV) pooled IgG positive for anti-TRIB2 antibodies. Narcolepsy-IgG-injected mice had a loss of the NeuN (neuronal marker), synaptophysin (synaptic marker) and orexin-positive neurons in the lateral hypothalamus area in narcolepsy compared to control-IgG-injected mice and these changes were associated with narcolepsy-like immobility attacks at four weeks post injection and with hyperactivity and long term memory deficits in the staircase and novel object recognition tests. Similar behavioral and cognitive deficits are observed in narcoleptic patients. This is the first report of passive transfer of experimental narcolepsy to naive mice induced by autoantibodies and supports the autoimmune pathogenesis in narcolepsy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective To analyse the circadian rhythm maturation of temperature, activity and sleep during the first year of life in offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) and its relationship with obesity markers.
   Methods A prospective analysis of the children of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) controlled with diet and 19 GDM with insulin). Fetal abdominal circumference was evaluated ecographically during gestation. Skin temperature and rest-activity rhythms were monitored for 3 consecutive days in children at 15days and 1, 3 and 6months. Anthropometrical parameters of the children were evaluated during the first year of life.
   Results Children from the GDM groups tended to higher fetal abdominal circumference z-score than controls at the beginning of the last trimester (p=0.077) and at delivery (p=0.078). Mean skin temperature or activity was not different among the groups. The I<O sleep index pointed to increasing concordance with parental sleeping at 3 and 6months but no significant GDM-dependent differences. However, some of the parameters that define temperature maturation and also the circadian function index from the temperature-activity variable were significantly lower at 6months in the GDM+insulin group. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score, as a predictor of fetal adiposity, correlated negatively with parameters related to circadian rhythm maturation as the circadian/ultradian rhythm (P-1/P-ult ratio).
   Conclusions Fetal adiposity correlated with a worse circadian rhythm regulation in ODM. In addition, ODM insulin-treated showed a disturbed pattern of the circadian function index of temperature activity at 6months of age. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Aim: Fetal magnetography enables the recording of biomagnetic fetal signals, including fetal heart and fetal brain signals. These signals allow the determination of fetal behavioral states and functional brain signals with auditory evoked responses (AER). In the current study, we investigated how the behavioral state influences the AER and how stimulation affects fetal state.
   Methods: One hundred and four fetuses in three age groups (28-31 weeks, 32-35 weeks and 36-41 weeks) were recorded with and without auditory stimulation. Both sessions were scored for fetal states. The AER latency was determined for each state separately. Forty-five additional subjects were recorded with two sessions of 10 min without stimulation to investigate a possible time effect on state changes.
   Results: The state distribution was significantly different between stimulation and no stimulation conditions. The AER latencies were significantly shorter in active sleep (P = 0.013) and active wakefulness (P = 0.004) compared to quiet sleep.
   Conclusion: Auditory stimulation has an effect on fetal states. The state information should be taken into account for the analysis of AER latencies.

AB The sleep disorder in pregnant women remains unfamiliar to perinatal care providers, resulting in lack of appropriate care. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women and to identify the associated risk factors.
   Married pregnant women were enrolled from their first trimester and followed up until delivery. Nonpregnant married healthy women were selected as controls. A survey questionnaire was administered to each of them.
   We successfully performed a survey to 1,993 pregnant women and 598 nonpregnant women. The overall prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women was significantly higher than the controls (56.1 vs. 29.9 %, P < 0.05). There was higher prevalence of snoring (30.2 %), observed sleep apnea (1.1 %), mouth breathing (23.7 %), nocturnal arousal (46.5 %), insomnia (35.1 %), and daytime sleepiness (52.6 %) in pregnant women. There were no significant differences of the prevalence of bruxism (7.0 vs. 6.7 %), sleep talking (8.1 vs. 7.2 %), and sleep walking (0.4 vs. 0.2 %) between the two groups (P > 0.05). Nocturnal sleep time (8.0 +/- 1.3 h) was less in the third trimester compared with the nonpregnant women (8.2 +/- 1.1 h) (P < 0.05). Smoking (OR = 3.39), drinking (OR = 2.40), allergic rhinitis/asthma (OR = 1.71), an obvious difference in neck circumference (OR = 1.11), and waistline (OR = 1.07) changes between the first and third trimesters were the risk factors for sleep disorder-related problems.
   There is a high prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women. Our data may provide a baseline for prevention and treatment of sleep disturbances in pregnant women.

AB Sleep disturbances in pregnancy may impair glucose mechanism. This study aimed to examine associations of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep, and nap duration with 1-h glucose challenge test (GCT) levels in pregnant women after controlling for known risk factors for gestational diabetes.
   This is a case-control study of 104 pregnant women. All women underwent full polysomnography and a GCT and completed the multivariable apnea prediction and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality indexes. The primary outcome was maternal hyperglycemia measured by GCT. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Over 13 % subjects reported habitual snoring in the first trimester. Only 9.3 % women with normoglycemia (GCT < 135) were habitual snorers, whereas 45.5 % women with hyperglycemia (GCT a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 135) had habitual snoring (p < 0.001). Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (loud snoring, snorting/gasping, and apneas) (odds ratio (OR) 2.85; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.50-5.41; p = 0.001) and total nap duration (OR 1.48; 95 % CI 0.96-2.28; p = 0.08) were associated with hyperglycemia. After adjusting for confounders, sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (OR 3.37; 95 % CI 1.44-8.32; p = 0.005) and nap duration (OR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.00-2.681.02; p = 0.05) continued to be associated with hyperglycemia. However, the primary exposure measure, the apnea/hypopnea index in the first trimester was not significantly associated with hyperglycemia (OR 1.03; 95 % CI 0.83-1.28; p = 0.77).
   Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms and nap duration are associated with hyperglycemia. Sleep duration was not associated with hyperglycemia. Research is needed concerning whether women with sleep-disordered breathing and/or daytime napping are at risk for gestational diabetes.

AB Advice concerning behaviour and adaptations of living and working environment is considered an unmet need by patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The aim of this study was to develop a core set of recommendations to be given to patients by their rheumatologists. A systematic literature research of scientific and patient-oriented literature revealed 70 raw recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated and ranked at a meeting of the Ankylosing Spondylitis International Federation (ASIF, 26 participants including 19 patients with AS, 5 rheumatologists and 2 physiotherapists from 13 countries) in November 2011. Thereafter, the 59 remaining recommendations were extensively discussed, supplemented, reworded, condensed and voted on during a meeting of local branch leaders of the AS patient organisation in Germany (Deutsche Vereinigung Morbus Bechterew, DVMB) with 80 participants (95 % of whom with AS), 2 rheumatologists and 1 occupational therapist in March 2012. The core set of final recommendations comprises (1) a general statement regarding living with AS which was considered highly important by patients and (2) the following domains: sitting position, walking, sleeping, at work, exercises, sports and recreational activities, diet and lifestyle, sexuality and pregnancy, fall prevention, car driving and advantages of membership in an AS-specific patient organisation. Most recommendations are relevant already in early disease, others concern advanced AS (e.g. fall prevention and car driving). The selected recommendations received high agreements (80-100 %). A first core set of recommendations for the behaviour and environmental adaptations of patients with AS was established under participation of many patients.

AB Objective
   To describe the dispensing of the hypnotic alimemazine to children aged 0-3years and investigate the association between dispensing of alimemazine to children and dispensed hypnotics to their parents.
   Design
   An observational cohort study linking information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Prescription Database. Hypnotics dispensed to parents in a 1-year period before pregnancy was associated with dispensed alimemazine for children aged 0-3 years.
   Patients and setting
   All children born in Norway in 2008 (N=59325) and their mothers and fathers were included.
   Main outcome measures
   Dispensed alimemazine to children during the first 3years of life.
   Results
   Three percent of children received alimemazine. Dispensed hypnotics to mothers increased the risk of the child receiving a prescription for alimemazine, OR of 2.3 (1.7-3.0) for boys and 1.7 (1.2-2.4) for girls. When both parents had been dispensed prescriptions for hypnotics, the risk increased nearly threefold. A dispensed alimemazine prescription was also associated with dispensed prescriptions for antidepressants to both mother and father, mother's smoking, the child's gender and child's prescriptions for antibiotics, respiratory drugs and dermatological steroids.
   Conclusions
   Dispensed alimemazine to children under 3 was associated with parents' previous use of hypnotics, indicating that factors other than the child's health influence the use of hypnotic drugs in infancy and toddler years. The frequent usage of alimemazine in children below 3 years and the association with parents' use of hypnotics should concern prescribing doctors.

The meeting was sponsored by the Pituitary Society and the European Neuroendocrinology Association and included experts skilled in the management of acromegaly. Complications considered included cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic, sleep apnea, bone diseases, and mortality. Outcomes in selected, related clinical conditions were also considered, and included pregnancy, familial acromegaly and invasive macroadenomas. The need for a new disease staging model was considered, and design of such a tool was proposed.

AB Dreams are thought to respond to self- and socially-relevant situations that evoke strong emotions and require rapid adaptation. First pregnancy is such a situation during which maternal mental representations (MMR) of the unborn baby, the self and significant others undergo remodeling. Some studies suggest that dreams during pregnancy contain more MMR and are more dysphoric, but such studies contain important methodological flaws. We assessed whether dreamed MMR, like waking MMR, change from the 7th month of pregnancy to birth, and whether pregnancy related themes and nonpregnancy characteristics are also transformed. Sixty non-pregnant and 59 pregnant women (37 early and 22 late 3rd trimester) completed demographic and psychological questionnaires and 14-day home dream logs. Dream reports were blindly rated according to four dream categories: (1) Dreamed MMR, (2) Quality of baby/child representations, (3) Pregnancy-related themes, (4) Non-pregnancy characteristics. Controlling for age, relationship and employment status, education level and state anxiety, women in both pregnant groups reported more dreams depicting themselves as a mother or with babies/children than did non-pregnant women (all p = 0.006). Baby/child representations were less specific in the late 3rd than in the early 3rd trimester (p = 0.005) and than in non-pregnant women (p = 0.01). Pregnant groups also had more pregnancy, childbirth and fetus themes (all p = 0.01). Childbirth content was higher in late than in early 3rd trimester (p = 0.01). Pregnant groups had more morbid elements than did the non-pregnant group (all p < 0.05). Dreaming during pregnancy appears to reflect daytime processes of remodeling MMR of the woman as a mother and of her unborn baby, and parallels a decline in the quality of baby/child representations in the last stage of pregnancy. More frequent morbid content in late pregnancy suggests that the psychological challenges of pregnancy are reflected in a generally more dysphoric emotional tone in dream content.

AB Disruption of sleep causes adverse health outcomes and poor quality of life. People with sleep disruption have higher levels than people without disrupted sleep of depression and anxiety and increased rates of cardiovascular diseases. Women have a higher incidence than men of insomnia and depression related to poor sleep. The types of complaints differ significantly between the sexes. Women are more likely than men to complain of insomnia, headache, irritability, and fatigue than the "typical" symptoms of loud snoring and breathing cessation during sleep. Hormones play an important role in sleep in women. Reproductive hormones were found to have a protective effect on sleep apnea in women of premenopausal age. Pregnancy is another period when the prevalence of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome increases from hormonal effect. Cardiovascular mortality is high in women with obstructive sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy improves outcomes in most cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and therapies for the three most common sleep disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome), along with effects of menopause, pregnancy, and social factors on sleep in women, are key considerations for clinicians caring for female patients across the adult life span.

AB IMPORTANCE Many early life risk factors for childhood obesity are more prevalent among blacks and Hispanics than among whites and may explain the higher prevalence of obesity among racial/ethnic minority children.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in adiposity and overweight are explained by differences in risk factors during pregnancy (gestational diabetes and depression), infancy (rapid infant weight gain, feeding other than exclusive breastfeeding, and early introduction of solid foods), and early childhood (sleeping <12 h/d, presence of a television set in the room where the child sleeps, and any intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or fast food).
   DESIGN Prospective prebirth cohort study.
   SETTING Multisite group practice in Massachusetts.
   PARTICIPANTS Participants included 1116 mother-child pairs (63% white, 17% black, and 4% Hispanic)
   EXPOSURE Mother's report of child's race/ethnicity.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z score, total fat mass index from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and overweight or obesity, defined as a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher at age 7 years.
   RESULTS Black (0.48 U [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64]) and Hispanic (0.43 [0.12 to 0.74]) children had higher BMI z scores, as well as higher total fat mass index and overweight/obesity prevalence, than white children. After adjustment for socioeconomic confounders and parental BMI, differences in BMI z score were attenuated for black and Hispanic children (0.22 U [0.05 to 0.40] and 0.22 U [-0.08 to 0.52], respectively). Adjustment for pregnancy risk factors did not substantially change these estimates. However, after further adjustment for infancy and childhood risk factors, we observed only minimal differences in BMI z scores between whites, blacks (0.07 U [-0.11 to 0.26]), and Hispanics (0.04 U [-0.27 to 0.35]). We observed similar attenuation of racial/ethnic differences in adiposity and prevalence of overweight or obesity.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood adiposity and obesity are determined by factors operating in infancy and early childhood. Efforts to reduce obesity disparities should focus on preventing early life risk factors.

AB Background: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas.
   Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and questions about demographics and sleep.
   Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISI >= 10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS >= 9 and 9% with EPDS <9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS >= 9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS <9 who completed measures in Spanish.
   Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e. g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research.

   FIT INDEXES; SLEEP-APNEA; LOW-INCOME
AB This study sought to determine the impact of passive smoking on the risk for depressive symptoms during pregnancy. In this prospective study, 236 pregnant women were recruited at less than 20 weeks of gestation from a university-affiliated obstetric clinic from November 2009 through July 2011. Tobacco use/exposure was measured using questionnaire and confirmed by salivary cotinine analysis. The Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was employed to capture perinatal depressive symptomatology. Traditionally, a cutoff of 13 is utilized to indicate depressive symptoms in the perinatal population. However, this approach is vulnerable to measurement errors that are inherent in assessing depression using cutoff points. Therefore, in this analysis, we apply a flexible approach (latent variable modeling) that accounts for measurement errors thereby reducing bias in the estimates of association. Significant differences were observed in the mean EPDS scores across non-smokers (mean +/- SD = 4.8 +/- 4.8), passive smokers (5.3 +/- 5.5) and active smokers (7.4 +/- 6.1) [p value = 0.02]. For each itemized response of the EPDS, passive smokers demonstrated an increased risk for depressive symptoms with the greatest risk exhibited by items 8 and 9 of the questionnaire (feeling sad or miserable and feeling unhappy [and]crying, respectively). In addition, for each item of the EPDS, a dose-response pattern was revealed with non-smokers having the least risk of depressive symptoms during pregnancy and active smokers having the greatest risk. Women who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at elevated risk for depressive symptoms during pregnancy.

AB Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is estimated to affect 5-15 percent of the U. S. population. There are few studies investigating non-pharmacological treatments for RLS, such as physical therapy and/or peripheral neural mobilization. The traction straight leg raise (tSLR) technique is one such mobilization that may affect central and peripheral neural pathways and reduce RLS symptoms. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a tSLR on the symptoms associated with RLS. A cohort of fifteen people was enrolled. Thirteen subjects (11 female) between the ages of 32-64 completed the study. Subjects completed two questionnaires to quantify their severity of RLS before treatment was initiated and at the final session. These measures included: the Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (RLSRS) 0-40, an RLS Ordinal Scale, and a Global Rating of Change (GROC) assessments (-7, 0, +7). Patients were treated with tSLR bilaterally for four total visits on days 1, 3, 8, and 15. Results indicated an RLSRS pre-treatment average of 24.8 (severe) and post-treatment average of 9.2 (mild), representing a 63% improvement from baseline (p < 0.05). Ten of 13 subjects reported a GROC of +4 or higher at the final session, indicating at least a moderate improvement in patient status from baseline. Our results indicate that following a series of tSLR treatments symptoms were reduced in individuals with idiopathic RLS. A prospective, randomized controlled trial is necessary to evaluate the potential for a tSLR to effectively manage idiopathic RLS symptoms. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The objective of this study is to determine whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with reduced fetal growth, and whether nocturnal oxygen desaturation precipitates acute fetal heart rate changes.
   Study Design: We performed a prospective observational study, screening 371 women in the second trimester for OSA symptoms. 41 subsequently underwent overnight sleep studies to diagnose OSA. Third trimester fetal growth was assessed using ultrasound. Fetal heart rate monitoring accompanied the sleep study. Cord blood was taken at delivery, to measure key regulators of fetal growth.
   Results: Of 371 women screened, 108 (29%) were high risk for OSA. 26 high risk and 15 low risk women completed the longitudinal study; 14 had confirmed OSA (cases), and 27 were controls. The median (interquartile range) respiratory disturbance index (number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas or respiratory related arousals/hour of sleep) was 7.9 (6.1-13.8) for cases and 2.2 (1.3-3.5) for controls (p<0.001). Impaired fetal growth was observed in 43% (6/14) of cases, vs 11% (3/27) of controls (RR 2.67; 1.25-5.7; p = 0.04). Using logistic regression, only OSA (OR 6; 1.2-29.7, p = 0.03) and body mass index (OR 2.52; 1.09-5.80, p = 0.03) were significantly associated with impaired fetal growth. After adjusting for body mass index on multivariate analysis, the association between OSA and impaired fetal growth was not appreciably altered (OR 5.3; 0.93-30.34, p = 0.06), although just failed to achieve statistical significance. Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations accompanied nocturnal oxygen desaturation in one fetus, subsequently found to be severely growth restricted. Fetal growth regulators showed changes in the expected direction-with IGF-1 lower, and IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 higher-in the cord blood of infants of cases vs controls, although were not significantly different.
   Conclusion: OSA may be associated with reduced fetal growth in late pregnancy. Further evaluation is warranted to establish whether OSA may be an important contributor to adverse perinatal outcome, including stillbirth.

AB Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in women in the United States, and hypertension is a major contributor to cardiovascular mortality. The incidence of hypertension in women is steadily increasing, paralleling the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Blood pressure control rates among women are suboptimal, even when secondary causes are identified and treated. There are few high-quality data describing specific hypertension-related outcomes in women. Some data comparing hypertensive women to age-matched men suggest advantages to sex-specific strategies, but further study is needed to determine optimal regimens for women throughout their lives. Pregnancy and menopause present unique, complex challenges in hypertension management.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the timing of hospital discharge, time to outpatient follow-up, and home care practices (breastfeeding initiation and continuation, tobacco smoke exposure, supine sleep position) for late-preterm (LPT; 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) and earlyterm (ET; 37 0/7-38/6/7 weeks) infants with term infants.
   METHODS: We analyzed 2000-2008 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. chi(2) Analyses were used to measure differences in maternal and infant characteristics, hospital discharge, outpatient care, and home care among LPT, ET, and term infants. We calculated adjusted risk ratios for the risk of adverse care outcomes among LPT and ET infants compared with term infants.
   RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, LPT infants were less likely to be discharged early compared with term infants, whereas there was no difference for ET infants (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.65 [0.54-0.79]; 0.95 [0.88-1.02]). LPT and ET infants were more likely to have timely outpatient follow-up (1.07 [1.06-1.08]; 1.02 [1.02-1.03]), more likely to experience maternal tobacco smoke exposure (1.09 [1.05-1.14]; 1.08 [1.06-1.11]), less likely to be initially breastfed (0.95 [0.94-0.97]; 0.98 [0.97-0.98]), less likely to be breastfed for >= 10 weeks (0.88 [0.86-0.90]; 0.94 [0.93-0.96]), and less likely to be placed in a supine sleep position (0.95 [0.93-0.97]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Given that LPT and ET infants bear an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, greater efforts are needed to ensure safe and healthy posthospitalization and home care practices for these vulnerable infants.

AB Objective: To review the literature on the association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression.
   Sources: A review of literature found on MEDLINE/PubMed database.
   Summary of findings: The literature consistently shows that breastfeeding provides a wide range of benefits for both the child and the mother. The psychological benefits for the mother are still in need of further research. Some studies point out that pregnancy depression is one of the factors that may contribute to breastfeeding failure. Others studies also suggest an association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression; the direction of this association is still unclear. Breastfeeding can promote hormonal processes that protect mothers against postpartum depression by attenuating cortisol response to stress. It can also reduce the risk of postpartum depression, by helping the regulation of sleep and wake patterns for mother and child, improving mother's self-efficacy and her emotional involvement with the child, reducing the child's temperamental difficulties, and promoting a better interaction between mother and child.
   Conclusions: Studies demonstrate that breastfeeding can protect mothers from postpartum depression, and are starting to clarify which biological and psychological processes may explain this protection. However, there are still equivocal results in the literature that may be explained by the methodological limitations presented by some studies. (C) 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

TI Anaesthetic management of emergency caesarean section in a parturient
   with systemic mastocytosis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC ANESTHESIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Pregnancy; Systemic mastocytosis; Caesarean section; General anaesthesia
AB Mastocytosis is a rare disorder caused by the proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in various organs. It has a broad variety of clinical manifestations, including cardiovascular collapse. Diverse stimuli trigger the release of vasoactive substances and parturients with systemic mastocytosis are at high risk for precipitating mast cell degranulation. As a result, women with systemic mastocytosis should have an anaesthetic plan for labour and delivery. Anxiety, stress, sleep deprivation, pain and numerous pharmacological agents are all triggers for mast cell degranulation. For pain relief in labour, epidural analgesia is recommended. Pharmacological agents with a high potential for triggering mast cell degranulation should be avoided. This is particularly important in the case of an emergency caesarean section. Resuscitation equipment must be available should life-threatening haemodynamic instability occur during surgery. We report the case of a pregnant woman with systemic mastocytosis who required emergency caesarean section. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing-related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder that is often seen in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the association between RLS and multiple sclerosis (MS) is still unclear and RLS is not considered as one of the MS symptoms. This study was conducted to assess the frequency of RLS and its associated factors in patients with MS. This was a cross-sectional study conducted during January and April 2010. A total of 205 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (164 females, 41 males, mean age 32.8 +/- A 8.9 years) were enrolled in the study and underwent a medical history interview and a neurological examination. The diagnosis of RLS was based on International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Criteria. 57 patients (27.8 %) met the RLS diagnostic criteria. In 90.1 % of the patients, the onset of RLS was simultaneous with or followed by MS onset. There was no significant difference between patients with and without RLS in respect of age, gender, disease duration, and MS pattern. There was an increased incidence of leg jerks before sleep in patients with RLS (P = 0.04). In patients suffering from RLS, there is greater complaint of insomnia (P = 0.03). Body mass index, history of anemia, excessive day-time somnolence, consuming caffeine-containing beverages, pregnancy numbers, smoking, and alcohol consumption were not associated with the presence of RLS. This study revealed high prevalence of RLS in MS patients. Screening of RLS in these patients should always be considered to improve management of MS.

AB Background: The goal of roll back malaria partnership is to achieve universal coverage for all populations at risk using appropriate interventions for prevention and case management. Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and other anti-vector measures among pregnant women in an area hyper-endemic for malaria. Materials and Methods: Questionnaires were administered to a cross-section of 832 consecutive pregnant women attending antenatal care in three hospitals in Enugu, Nigeria that have high client flow for maternity services. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics by means of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the women was 33.2 2.9 (range: 15-45) years. Three hundred and fifty nine (43.1%) women owned insecticide treated nets (ITNs), however 325(90.5%) slept under the nets during the index pregnancies; equivalent to 39.1% utilization rate among the 832 women studied. Out of the 325 (39.1%) women that used ITNs; 236 (28.4%) used it singly, while 89 (10.7%) used it in combination with other anti-vector measures. Educational status and social class of the women had strong association with the use of ITNs (P < 0.0001). Women who used ITNs were significantly less likely to have acute malaria, anaemia and babies with low birth weight than women who did not use ITNs (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The use of ITNs is poor among pregnant women in Enugu, but associated with favorable maternal and feto-neonatal outcome. Future measures to increase its use should consider improvement in educational level and social class of our women.

AB Aims This paper aimed to review how scientific knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time.
   Methods In this paper, the empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed.
   Results When MDMA was a novel psychoactive substance', it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost-benefit ratios, and voluntary cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol levels increased by 800% in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric, although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to psychomotor impairments in the children.
   Conclusions The damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA are far more widespread than was realized a few years ago, with new neuropsychobiological deficits still emerging. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy and a fairly lifelong disorder that may significantly lower a patient's expectations and potential for a full life. Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and up to 85% of patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among anticonvulsants, valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may be poorly tolerated by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant women. Alternatives have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but also topiramate, zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy may be useful or even required. One should not forget the potential aggravation induced not only by some commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, but also, in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special settings, older drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But the management of JME should also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict avoidance of sleep deprivation and the management of copathologies, including the cognitive and psychiatric problems that are often encountered. With adequate management, there will only remain a small proportion of patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its related problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician has a fair chance of significantly helping the patient with medication and counseling.

AB Oviparous species are model organisms for investigating embryonic development of endogenous physiological circadian rhythms without the influence of maternal biorhythms. Recent studies have demonstrated that heart rates and metabolic rates of embryonic turtles are not constant or always maximal and can be altered in response to the presence of embryos at a more advanced stage of development within the nest. A first step in understanding the physiological mechanisms underpinning these responses in embryonic ectothermic organisms is to develop metabolic profiles (e.g., heart rate) at different temperatures throughout incubation. Heart beat and rhythmic patterns or changes in development may represent important signals or cues within a nest and may be vital to coordinate synchronous hatching well in advance of the final stages of incubation. We developed baseline embryonic heart-rate profiles of embryos of the short-necked Murray River turtle (Emydura macquarii) to determine the stage of embryogenesis that metabolic circadian rhythms become established, if at all. Eggs were incubated at constant temperatures (26 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and heart rates were monitored at 6-h intervals over 24 h every 7-11 days until hatching. Circadian heart rate rhythms were detected at the mid-gestation period and were maintained until hatching. Heart rates throughout the day varied by up to 20% over 24 h and were not related to time of day. This study demonstrated that endogenous metabolic circadian rhythms in developing embryos in turtle eggs establish earlier in embryogenesis than those documented in other vertebrate taxa during embryogenesis. Early establishment of circadian rhythms in heart rates may be critical for communication among embryos and synchrony in hatching and emergence from the nest.

AB Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common childbirth complication, which can have negative effects on both the newly delivered woman and her family. This condition is under-diagnosed and inadequately treated, while a biological diagnostic test is not yet available. Furthermore, postpartum thyroid dysfunction is common among new mothers, and some evidence point to an association between PPD and thyroid function disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between serum levels of thyroid hormones at the time of delivery, and the later development of depressive symptoms, using data from a population based cohort of Swedish women. Blood samples were collected during delivery from 347 participating women, delivering at Uppsala University Hospital. The participating women filled in at least one of three structured questionnaires, containing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), at five days, six weeks and six months postpartum. A cut-off of 12 or more was applied on the EPDS, to identify cases of self-reported PPD and controls. Using a binary logistic regression model (adjusting for previous psychiatric contact, smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and sleep), having a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level over the clinical cut-off level of 4.0 mU/L was associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms at six months postpartum (OR 11.30, 95% CI 1.93-66.11). A ROC analysis revealed that the predictive variable (PV) had significant predictive ability for PPD at 6 months postpartum, given that the AUC was 0.764, and at a PV cut-off value of 6.33, the sensitivity and specificity were 76.2% and 69.4%, respectively. If these findings are replicated in future studies, they can have important clinical implications, since TSH determination is an inexpensive routine blood test, and its inclusion in a biological screening test for PPD involving other parameters would be tempting.

AB This study compared self-reported sleep latency (SL) and total sleep time (TST) to objective measures on polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Thirty-three women in the third trimester (T3) of pregnancy, 16 women in the first trimester (T1) of pregnancy, and 15 non-pregnant women underwent overnight PSG, and shortly after awakening reported their perceived SL and TST. Results showed that, on average, the T3 group slightly overestimated their TSTs, whereas the T1 and non-pregnant groups underestimated TSTs when compared with objective measurement. All groups overestimated SL, and perceived SL was closest to the first epoch of 10 min of uninterrupted sleep or the first epoch of slow-wave sleep, rather than the first epoch of sleep (the current definition used for diagnostic sleep studies). The wide variation in discrepancies between estimation and PSG measurement for both TST and SL shows that self-reports made by both pregnant and non-pregnant women tend to be unreliable, which has important implications both clinically and for the many studies based on self-reported sleep patterns in pregnancy.

Data from 151 Chinese mothers in the United States and 238 Taiwanese mothers were analyzed. A physical health condition checklist and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale were used. More Taiwanese mothers experienced depression. Depression scores were correlated with physical conditions. Over 50% of mothers with depression experienced physical exhaustion, sleep disturbances, interrupted sleep, and decreases in memory. Active assessments and cultural care for managing physical conditions may prevent postpartum depression.

AB This study was undertaken to determine whether altered early serotonin signaling either via gestational serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) exposure or genetic variations in the serotonin transporter promoter region (SLC6A4) alters levels of reelin, an important glycoprotein in neurodevelopment, in mothers and their neonates. Serum reelin protein expression was quantified by immunoblot from maternal and neonatal blood collected at delivery from women taking either an SRI during gestation or controls. SRI-exposed mothers had higher levels of one reelin fragment, while SRI-exposed neonates had lower total reelin levels, particularly in females and reelin levels differed with SLC6A4 genotype. Lower neonatal reelin levels predicted less time spent sleeping and more irritability during neonatal behavioral assessment on Day 6 of life. Our results suggest that prenatal SRI exposure and the SLC6A4 genotype influences reelin protein expression in both the mother and newborn and that this may be reflected in neonatal behavior.

AB Background In 2009, on the basis of promising evidence from trials in south Asia, WHO and UNICEF issued a joint statement about home visits as a strategy to improve newborn survival. In the Newhints trial, we aimed to test this home-visits strategy in sub-Saharan Africa by assessing the effect on all-cause neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and essential newborn-care practices.
   Methods The Newhints cluster randomised trial was undertaken in 98 zones in seven districts in the Brong Ahafo Region, Ghana. 49 zones were randomly assigned to the Newhints intervention and 49 to the control intervention by use of restricted randomisation with stratification to ensure comparability between interventions. Community-based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs) in Newhints zones were trained to identify pregnant women in their community and to make two home visits during pregnancy and three in the first week of life to promote essential newborn-care practices, weigh and assess babies for danger signs, and refer as necessary. Primary outcomes were NMR and coverage of key essential newborn-care practices. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00623337.
   Findings 16 168 (99%) of 16 329 deliveries between November, 2008, and December, 2009, were livebirths; the status at 1 month was known for 15 619 (97%) livebirths. 482 neonatal deaths were recorded. Coverage data were available from 6029 women in Newhints zones; of these 4358 (72%) reported having CBSV visits during pregnancy and 3815 (63%) reported having postnatal visits. This coverage increased substantially from June, 2009, after the introduction of new implementation strategies and reached almost 90% for pregnancy visits by the end of the trial and 75% for postnatal visits. The Newhints intervention significantly increased coverage of key essential newborn-care behaviours, except for four or more antenatal-care visits (5975 [76%] of 7859 vs 5988 [74%] of 8121, respectively; relative risk 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.09; p = 0.52) and baby delivered in a facility (5373 [68%] vs 5539 [68%], respectively; 0.97, 0.81-1.14; p = 0.69). The largest increase was for care-seeking, with 102 (77%) of 132 sick babies in Newhints zones taken to a hospital or clinic compared with 77 (55%) of 139 in control zones (1.43, 1.17-1.76; p = 0.001). Increases were also noted in bednet use during pregnancy (5398 [69%] of 7859 vs 5135 [63%] of 8121, respectively; 1.12, 1.03-1.21; p = 0.005), money saved for delivery or emergency (5730 [86%] of 6681 vs 5525 [80%] of 6941, respectively; 1.09, 1.05-1.12; p < 0.0001), transport arranged in advance for facility (2496 [37%] vs 2061 [30%], respectively; 1.30, 1.12-1.49; p = 0.0004), birth assistant for home delivery washed hands with soap (1853 [93%] of 1992 vs 1817 [87%] of 2091, respectively; 1.05, 1.02-1.09; p = 0.001), initiation of breastfeeding in less than 1 h of birth (3743 [49%] of 7673 vs 3280 [41%] of 7921, respectively; 1.22, 1.07-1.40; p = 0.004), skin to skin contact (3355 [44%] vs 1931 [24%], respectively; 2.30, 1.85-2.87; p = 0.0002), first bath delayed for longer than 6 h (3131 [41%] vs 2269 [29%], respectively; 1.65, 1.27-2.13; p < 0.0001), exclusive breastfeeding for 26-32 days (1217 [86%] of 1414 vs 1091 [80%] of 1371; 1.10, 1.04-1.16; p = 0.001), and baby sleeping under bednet for 8-56 days (4548 [79%] of 5756 vs 4291 [73%] of 5846; 1.09, 1.03-1.15; p = 0.002). There were 230 neonatal deaths in the Newhints zones compared with 252 in the control zones. The overall NMRs per 1000 livebirths were 29.8 and 31.9, respectively (0.92, 0.75-1.12; p = 0.405).
   Interpretation The reduction in NMR with Newhints is consistent with the reductions achieved in three trials undertaken in programme settings in south Asia. Because there is no suggestion of any heterogeneity (p = 0.850) between these trials and Newhints, the meta-analysis summary estimate of a reduction of 12% (95% CI 5-18) provides the best evidence for the likely effect of the home-visits strategy delivered within programmes in sub-Saharan Africa and in south Asia. Improvements in the quality of delivery and neonatal care in health facilities and development of innovative, effective strategies to increase coverage of home visits on the day of birth could lead to the achievement of more substantial reductions.

TI Rising Obesity-Related Hospital Admissions among Children and Young
   People in England: National Time Trends Study

AB Objective: To describe the trends in hospital admissions associated with obesity as a primary diagnosis and comorbidity, and bariatric surgery procedures among children and young people in England.
   Design: National time trends study of hospital admissions data between 2000 and 2009.
   Participants: Children and young people aged 5 to 19 years who were admitted to hospital with any diagnosis of obesity.
   Main outcome measures: Age-and sex-specific admission rates per million children.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2009, age-and sex-specific hospital admission rates in 5-19 year olds for total obesity-related diagnoses increased more than four-fold from 93.0 (95% CI 86.0 to 100.0) per million children to 414.0 (95% CI 410.7 to 417.5) per million children, largely due to rising admissions where obesity was mentioned as a co-morbidity. The median age of admission to hospital over the study period was 14.0 years; 5,566 (26.7%) admissions were for obesity and 15,319 (73.3%) mentioned obesity as a comorbidity. Admissions were more common in girls than boys (56.2% v 43.8%). The most common reasons for admission where obesity was a comorbid condition were sleep apnoea, asthma, and complications of pregnancy. The number of bariatric surgery procedures has risen from 1 per year in 2000 to 31 in 2009, with the majority were performed in obese girls (75.6%) aged 13-19 years.
   Conclusions: Hospital admission rates for obesity and related comorbid conditions have increased more than four-fold over the past decade amongst children and young people. Although some of the increase is likely to be due to improved case ascertainment, conditions associated with obesity in children and young people are imposing greater challenges for health care providers in English hospitals. Most inpatient care is directed at dealing with associated conditions rather than primary assessment and management of obesity itself.

AB Background: Pregnancy-induced rhinitis (PIR) is often misclassified and under-diagnosed. There is currently no cure or optimum symptomatic treatment.
   Objective: To summarize current knowledge of PIR and assess evidence supporting treatment options.
   Type of review: Structured literature search.
   Search strategy and evaluation method: Review of English-language articles addressing evidence for aetiology, classification, differential diagnosis or treatment options for PIR. Comparisons to management of other types of rhinitis in pregnancy are also considered.
   Results: Incidence and prevalence of PIR vary widely between studies. Hormonal changes have a presumed aetiological role, although present evidence is scanty. Smoking appears to be the only agreed identifiable risk factor. Distinction between PIR and other types of rhinitis in pregnancy, especially allergic rhinitis, is important as effective treatments differ. Management of PIR focuses on minimal intervention required for symptom relief.
   Conclusions: Although PIR is temporary, its impact on patients' quality of life can be profound. Advice and conservative treatment provide the mainstay of clinical management. None of the currently available medical options offer an ideal solution. Any potential benefit gained should be balanced against risks to the foetus. Clarifying the definition of this separate category of rhinitis will lead to better recognition, with prompt and appropriate treatment.

AB Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed.

AB Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and highly burdensome sleep disorder. While relaxation therapies, including yoga, are often recommended for RLS management, rigorous supporting research is sparse. The goal of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of yoga on RLS symptoms and related outcomes in women with RLS.
   Methods: Participants were 13 nonsmoking women with moderate to severe RLS, who did not have diabetes, sleep apnea, or other serious concomitant chronic conditions, and who were not pregnant. The intervention was a gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire regarding their experience with the study.
   Results: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66 years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4 +/- 0.5 (of 16 possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1 +/- 0.3 (of 5 possible) homework sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice per session (r = 0.70, p = 0.025) and total homework minutes (r = 0.64, p < 0.05), suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's <= 0.02), with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6.
   Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in women with RLS.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar.
   Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p=0.029) compared to women without maternal complications.
   Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

AB Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences.

AB Objective: To assess sleep practices, and investigate their relationship with maternal and fetal outcomes, among pregnant Ghanaian women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana, between June and July 2011, postpartum women were interviewed within 48 hours of delivery about sleep quality and practices during pregnancy. Interviews were coupled with a systematic review of participants' medical charts for key outcomes including maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Results: Most women reported poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Snoring during pregnancy was independently associated with pre-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.5; P=0.007). The newborns of women who reported supine sleep during pregnancy were at increased risk of low birth weight (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 12-20.2; P=0.025) and stillbirth (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.5-43.2; P=0.016). Low birth weight was found to mediate the relationship between supine sleep and stillbirth. Conclusion: The present findings in an African population demonstrate that maternal sleep, a modifiable risk factor, has a significant role in pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, and subsequently stillbirth.

   PRONE; AGE; CLASSIFICATION; VICTIMS
AB OBJECTIVE: In 1987, the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rate in the United States was 1.2 per 1000 live births. By the year 2005, the SIDS rate had dropped more than half to approximately 0.5 per 1000 live births. In 1987, the risk of SIDS was 2.32 times greater for extremely premature infants compared with term infants. The objective of this analysis was to determine if with the falling SIDS rate there has been a change in the risk for SIDS among preterm infants.
   STUDY DESIGN: Data were obtained from the United States Linked Infant Birth and Death Certificate Public User Period files for the years 2005 to 2007. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for postneonatal out-of-hospital death by gestational age were determined by logistic regression modeling.
   RESULT: Over the 3-year period, there were 5203 postneonatal out-of-hospital deaths attributable to SIDS; 2010 attributable to other sudden deaths; 1270 attributable to suffocation in bed; and 3681 attributable to other causes. The adjusted OR for SIDS among the most preterm infants (24 to 28 weeks gestation) was significantly increased compared with term infants, ORadj = 2.57 (95% confidence interval = 2.08, 3.17), as were the adjusted ORs for the other causes of sudden infant death.
   CONCLUSION: Despite the marked drop in the incidence of SIDS since 1987, the risk for SIDS among preterm infants remains elevated. Other causes of sudden infant death for which SIDS is often mistaken reflect similar levels of increased risk among preterm infants.

AB The impact of fibromyalgia on the course of pregnancy is not clearly defined. We evaluate the frequency of FMS symptoms among full-term healthy pregnant women and the impact on the course of delivery. The 2011 modification of the ACR 2010 criteria for FMS diagnosis was used as well as the FIQ, SF-36 and AIMS questionnaires. The 1990 ACR classification criteria were documented. Data were collected relating to course of the delivery, induction, length of stage 1, 2 and 3 of delivery, epidural anesthesia, artificial rupture of membranes, instrumental delivery and cesarean section. A VAS recording pain intensity during delivery was documented. Out of 100 women recruited, 27 (27 %) fulfilled Modified FMS criteria. Only one of these women fulfilled ACR 1990 criteria, women who fulfilled the ACR criteria differed significantly from women who did not fulfill these criteria on a broad range of parameters including widespread pain and fatigue, social functioning, emotional well-being, role limitation and physical functioning. A significant correlation was found between length of stage 2 and results of the FIQ as well as with components of the SF-36. The intensity of pain during birth however was not correlated with the presence of FMS criteria. FMS symptoms were highly prevalent among healthy pregnant women at term. The presence of such symptoms may impact on the course of delivery and the need for anesthesia. Evaluating for features of centrally mediated pain may be of clinical relevance for physicians involved in the treatment of pregnant women.

AB Background: Postpartum sleep disorders are a significant problem for postnatal women. Although factors predisposing postnatal women to sleep disorders have been identified, few sleep quality assessment instruments adequately address these factors.
   Purpose: This study aimed to develop a Postpartum Sleep Quality Scale (PSQS) and test its psychometric properties.
   Methods: Sixteen PSQS items were generated from clinical practice, a literature review, and expert recommendations. Two hundred two postpartum women were recruited from a medical center and an obstetric clinic in southern Taiwan in 2010-2011 to assess the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and convergent validity of the developed PSQS.
   Results: Item analysis removed two of the initial PSQS items. The resultant 14-item PSQS showed good internal consistency (alpha = .81) and acceptable 5-day test-retest reliability (r = .81). Construct validity was confirmed using exploratory factor analysis, which extracted and defined "Infant night care-related daytime dysfunction'' and "Physical symptoms-related sleep inefficiency'' as the two main categories of postpartum sleep quality. These two factors explained 44.49% of total variance, with factor loadings between .43 and .76. Significant correlation (r = .67) with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index showed convergent validity.
   Conclusion: The 14-item PSQS is a reliable, valid, and useful scale for measuring postpartum sleep quality and examining intervention protocols in Taiwanese postpartum women with sleep disturbance.

AB This study investigated episodic and procedural memory retention in early and late pregnancy and whether memory retention was related to sleep disruption. Twenty-six women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 20 women in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 24 non-pregnant controls were administered a battery of verbal and visual episodic memory tasks and two procedural memory tasks before undergoing an overnight sleep study. Memory retention was assessed the following morning. Results indicated that as compared with controls, both pregnant groups had reduced retention in verbal episodic memory but were unimpaired on visual and procedural memory tasks. The pregnant women also demonstrated significant disruption of sleep patterns. Reduced verbal memory retention during pregnancy was not attributable to any measure of sleep; however, small correlations between some indices of sleep and memory do not allow full dismissal of the sleep-dependent memory consolidation hypothesis.

AB Over 25,000 epileptic women deliver viable pregnancies each year in the United States. Although medical management is the first line of treatment, many physiological changes associated with pregnancy can make optimal treatment challenging. Medication dosage is adjusted based on side effects and seizure frequency, with the goal being no seizures with the lowest medication dosage(s) and side-effect profile possible. Whenever possible, monotherapy is preferred. Many antiepileptic drugs have teratogenic potential, so preconceptional optimization of medication dosage(s) is recommended. Epilepsy has associated neurological comorbidities, the most common being migraines and sleep disorders.

AB Background: Chronic noise is an environmental pollutant and well-known to cause annoyance and sleep disturbance. Its association with clinical and subclinical adverse health effects has been discussed.
   Objectives: This systematic review aimed to examine associations between chronic noise exposure during pregnancy or childhood and health outcomes in early and late childhood.
   Methods: Following a systematic electronic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE), an additional hand search and a critical evaluation of potential articles by 2 independent reviewers, 29 studies were included: 12 on pregnancy/birth outcomes with samples ranging from 115 to 22,761 and 17 on cardiovascular and immune-mediated health outcomes in childhood with samples ranging from 43 to 1542. Evidence levels (3 to 2++) were rated according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.
   Results: Chronic noise exposure during pregnancy was not associated with birth weight, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, perinatal and neonatal death based on 6 cohort, 4 case-control, and 2 cross-sectional studies (highest evidence level 2+). There was some evidence supporting an association of chronic noise exposure with increased systolic blood pressure and stress hormone levels in urine and saliva in children evaluating 2 cohort and 15 cross-sectional studies (highest evidence level 2-).
   Conclusions: There seemed to be no associations between chronic noise and pregnancy outcomes based on studies with evidence levels up to 2+. Associations between chronic noise and health in children were based mainly on cross-sectional studies. However, the studies included in this comprehensive systematic review showed a high variation in study design, outcome, exposure and confounder assessments. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Nutritional state in the gestation period influences fetal growth and development. We hypothesized that undernutrition during gestation would affect offspring sleep architecture and/or homeostasis. Pregnant female mice were assigned to either control (fed ad libitum; AD) or 50% dietary restriction (DR) groups from gestation day 12 to parturition. After parturition, dams were fed AD chow. After weaning, the pups were also fed AD into adulthood. At adulthood (aged 8-9 weeks), we carried out sleep recordings. Although offspring mice displayed a significantly reduced body weight at birth, their weights recovered three days after birth. Enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was observed in the DR mice over a 24-hour period without changing the diurnal pattern or amounts of wake, NREM, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, DR mice also displayed an enhancement of EEG-SWA rebound after a 6-hour sleep deprivation and a higher threshold for waking in the face of external stimuli. DR adult offspring mice exhibited small but significant increases in the expression of hypothalamic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Ppar alpha) and brain-specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1c) mRNA, two genes involved in lipid metabolism. Undernutrition during pregnancy may influence sleep homeostasis, with offspring exhibiting greater sleep pressure.

AB Background: Physical activity is reduced during the post-partum period. Facebook is frequently used by Australian mothers, and offers flexibility, high levels of engagement and the ability to disseminate information and advice via social contacts. The Mums Step it Up Program is a newly developed 50 day team-based physical activity intervention delivered via a Facebook app. The program involves post-partum women working in teams of 4-8 friends aiming to achieve 10,000 steps per day measured by a pedometer. Women are encouraged to use the app to log their daily steps and undertake social and supportive interactions with their friends and other participants. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Mums Step it Up Program.
   Method/design: A sample of 126 women up to 12 months post-partum will be recruited through community-based health and family services. Participants will be randomly allocated into one of three groups: control, pedometer only and the Mums Step it Up Program. Assessments will be completed at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome (objective physical activity) and the secondary outcomes (sleep quality and quantity, depressive symptoms, weight and quality of life) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the Mums Step it Up Program compared with the control and pedometer only groups. Analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat-basis using random effects mixed modeling. The effect of theorized mediators (physical activity attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control) will also be examined.
   Discussion: This study will provide information about the potential of a Facebook app for the delivery of health behavior interventions. If this intervention proves to be effective it will be released on a mass scale and promoted to the general public.

   POLICY; TRIAL; AREA
AB Background: Malaria is a public health problem in Uganda; affecting mainly women and children. Effective treatment has been hampered by over-diagnosis and over-treatment with anti-malarial drugs among patients presenting with fever. In order to understand the effect of drug pressure on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in pregnancy, a sample of pregnant women presenting with fever in out-patient clinics was studied. The main objective was to assess prescription patterns and drug use in pregnancy especially SP; and draw implications on the efficacy of SP for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp).
   Methods: A total of 998 pregnant women with a history of fever were interviewed and blood samples taken for diagnosis of malaria and HIV infections. Data were captured on the drugs prescribed for the current febrile episode and previous use of drugs especially SP, anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) and cotrimoxazole.
   Results: Few pregnant women, 128 (12.8%) were parasitaemic for P. falciparum; and of these, 72 (56.3%) received first-line treatment with Artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem (R)) 14 (10.9%) SP and 33 (25.8%) quinine. Of the parasite negative patients (non-malarial fevers), 186 (21.4%) received Coartem, 423 (48.6%) SP and 19 (2.1%) cotrimoxazole. Overall, malaria was appropriately treated in 35.5% of cases. Almost all febrile pregnant women, 91.1%, were sleeping under a mosquito net. The majority of them, 911 (91.3%), accepted to have an HIV test done and 92 (9.2%) were HIV positive. Of the HIV positive women, 23 (25.0%) were on ARVs, 10 (10.9%) on cotrimoxazole and 30 (32.6%) on SP. A significant proportion of women, 40 (43.5%), were on both SP and cotrimoxazole. Age and occupation were associated with diagnosis and treatment of malaria and HIV infections.
   Conclusion: There is inappropriate treatment of malaria and non-malarial fevers among pregnant women in these facilities. This is due to non-adherence to the guidelines. Over-prescription and use of anti-malarial drugs, especially SP may have implications on resistance against SP for malaria prevention in pregnancy. The policy implications of these findings are to evaluate SP efficacy as IPTp; and the need to enforce adherence to the current clinical treatment guidelines.

AB Background: Malaria remains a substantial public health problem in Togo. An integrated child health campaign was conducted in Togo in October 2011. This campaign included a component of free distribution of 2,799,800 long-lasting, insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to households throughout Togo. This distribution marked the first effort in Togo at universal LLIN coverage and was not targeted specifically to children under five years and pregnant women, but to all household members. This study reports the results of the LLIN distribution campaign in terms of bed net possession and utilization.
   Methods: A representative household survey was implemented during the rainy season nine months after the LLIN distribution component of the campaign. Some 6,015 households selected through two stages of probability proportion to size stratified random sampling were interviewed using a brief questionnaire that included a demographic section with questions on the number of household members and sleeping spaces, and a campaign participation section with questions used to evaluate non-LLIN aspects of the campaign. A net roster listed all nets and their characteristics, and a household roster listed all members and visitors with information about bed net use. The questions addressed different aspects of bed net and LLIN possession and utilization. Crude weighted frequencies, percentages, and t-tests of association were calculated using the Stata 12.0 Survey features.
   Results: Possession of at least one bed net and/or LLIN increased from 41.3% to 96.7% (P <0.001). Household possession of at least one campaign LLIN was 93.3%. Report LLIN among pregnant women was 77.5% and 79.3% for children under five. For the general population LLIN use was 68.3%.
   Conclusions: Due to the gap in LLIN possession and use and the significant number of individuals reporting a lack of nets as a reason for non-use, additional national LLIN distribution campaigns with a stronger educational component need to be implemented in order increase the use of available LLINs and to reach and maintain universal coverage of LLINs in Togo. The LLIN distribution campaign focusing on universal coverage of the general population in Togo was more successful at increasing LLIN possession and use of children under five years and pregnant women than other campaigns focusing only on these target groups.

   POPULATION; IMPAIRMENT
AB Background: Depression is frequently observed in patients with untreated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the general population. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable since pregnancy increases the risk of both SDB and depressive symptoms. However, no study has investigated whether SDB symptoms prior to or in early pregnancy are associated with such mood problems.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review of pregnant women. Women were included if they attended prenatal clinics between June 2007 and July 2010, were >= 18 years old, pregnant with a single fetus, and had been screened for habitual snoring as well as depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS).
   Results: In total, 362 women were included and 32.3% reported habitual snoring. Twenty-nine percent of women had an EPDS score >= 10. Significantly more snoring women, compared to non-snorers, had an EPDS score >= 10 (42.7% vs. 22.9%, p < 0.001) despite the mean EPDS values not reaching statistical significance (6.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 5.4 +/- 5.0, p = 0.2). In a logistic regression model controlling for parity, the presence of pre-pregnancy obesity, presence of a partner, sleep quality, African American race, maternal educational level, pre-eclampsia, and diabetes, snoring was independently associated with a prenatal EPDS score >= 10 (O.R. 2.0, 95% CI 1.13-3.46; p = 0.023).
   Conclusion: Maternal snoring may be a risk factor for prenatal depressive symptoms. Further investigation of the temporal relationship between maternal snoring and depressive symptoms is warranted.

AB A growing body of evidence suggests that immune alterations, especially those related to inflammation, are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related brain alterations. Much of this work has focused on the prenatal period, because infections during pregnancy have been repeatedly (albeit inconsistently) linked to risk of schizophrenia. Given that most infections do not cross the placenta, cytokines associated with inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) have been targeted as potential mediators of the damaging effects of infection on the fetal brain in prenatal studies. Moreover, additional evidence from both human and animal studies suggests links between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, immune-related genes, and schizophrenia as well as brain alterations associated with the disorder. Additional support for the role of altered immune factors in the etiology of schizophrenia comes from neuroimaging studies, which have linked proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms with some of the structural and functional abnormalities repeatedly found in schizophrenia. These findings are reviewed and discussed with a life course perspective, examining the contribution of inflammation from the fetal period to disorder presentation. Unexplored areas and future directions, such as the interplay between inflammation, genes, and individual-level environmental factors (e.g., stress, sleep, and nutrition), are also discussed.

AB DHA (22:6n-3) supplementation during infancy has been associated with lower heart rate (HR) and improved neurobehavioral outcomes. We hypothesized that maternal DHA supplementation would improve fetal cardiac autonomic control and newborn neurobehavior. Pregnant women were randomized to 600 mg/day of DHA or placebo oil capsules at 14.4 (+/-4) weeks gestation. Fetal HR and HRV were calculated from magnetocardiograms (MCGs) at 24, 32 and 36 weeks gestational age (GA). Newborn neurobehavior was assessed using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). Post-partum maternal and infant red blood cell (RBC) DHA was significantly higher in the supplemented group as were metrics of fetal HRV and newborn neurobehavior in the autonomic and motor clusters. Higher HRV is associated with more responsive and flexible autonomic nervous system (ANS). Coupled with findings of improved autonomic and motor behavior, these data suggest that maternal DHA supplementation during pregnancy may impart an adaptive advantage to the fetus.

AB Mounting evidence implicate habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, as an important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Little, however, is known about the determinants of habitual snoring among pregnant women. We sought to assess its prevalence and to identify maternal characteristics associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy.
   Pregnant women (N = 1,303) receiving prenatal care provided information about habitual snoring before and during pregnancy in in-person interviews completed in early pregnancy. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) from multivariable models designed to identify factors associated with snoring during pregnancy.
   Approximately 7.3 % of pregnant women reported habitual snoring during early pregnancy. The odds of habitual snoring during pregnancy was strongly related with maternal reports of habitual snoring prior to the index pregnancy (aOR = 24.32; 95 % CI, 14.30-41.51). Advanced maternal age (a parts per thousand yen35 years) (aOR = 2.02; 95 % CI, 1.11-3.68), history of pregestational diabetes (aOR = 3.61; 95 % CI, 1.07-12.2), history of mood and anxiety disorders (aOR = 1.81; 95 % CI, 1.02-3.20), and prepregnancy overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) (aOR = 2.31; 95 % CI, 1.41-3.77) and obesity (a parts per thousand yen30 kg/m(2)) (aOR = 2.81; 95 % CI, 1.44-5.48) status were statistically significant risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy (aOR = 2.70; 95 % CI, 1.17-6.26) was associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy.
   Identification of risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy has important implications for developing strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, promoting improved sleep hygiene and improved pregnancy outcomes among reproductive-age women.

AB Many changes that normally occur during pregnancy disrupt sleep and may lead to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). However, given that pregnancy may also predispose to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), we sought to investigate whether EDS may be associated with snoring, gasping, or apneas, further suggesting SDB.
   A cross-sectional survey of women in the immediate postpartum period was conducted. Participants answered questions from the multivariable apnea prediction index regarding snoring, gasping, and witnessed apneas in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Participants were also asked to answer Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questions, and a score 0-24 was calculated (> 10 considered abnormal). Medical history and medication use were obtained both by history and review of the medical record.
   Out of 1,000 women recruited, 990 women answered the ESS questionnaire completely. Mean prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 +/- 6.2 with 21.7 % of the sample having a prepregnancy BMI a parts per thousand yen30. Mean ESS score was 7.1 +/- 3.9, and 1.7 % of the total sample scored 16 or greater. ESS increased significantly with age, BMI, and neck circumference. All three symptoms of SDB were associated with higher mean ESS scores. In a multiple linear regression analysis, loud snoring, gasping, and apneas were statistically significant independent predictors of mean ESS score.
   EDS measured by ESS is a common finding in pregnancy. Snoring, gasping, and apneas appear to be independent predictors of mean ESS scores.

AB Background: Morbidity and mortality in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants during their hospital stay have been well described. However, there are insufficient data regarding health problems after discharge.
   Study design: In a multicenter study performed between January 2009 and December 2010 including 2493 VLBW infants, questionnaires were sent out to all participating parents in the first year of life. We compared the parental reported health of VLBW infants with a national cohort (KIGGS).
   Results: The reported health of VLBW infants born after 29 weeks of gestation was identical to term infants. Even in the group of infants born before 24 weeks of gestation health was regarded as very good or good in >70% of cases. However, parents described a delayed development in >50% increasing to >70% with lower gestational age. In the first year of life VLBW infants have an increased risk of visual and hearing problems. Bronchitis was more frequent in VLBW infants but there were no differences in other infections typical for that age group. VLBW infants had less sleeping problems. No gender differences were described.
   Conclusion: VLBW infants in our study require slightly more medical care compared to their peers. However, medical problems are relatively small compared to the developmental needs as perceived by their parents. Therefore, close follow-up and advice by specialists in infant development are needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal smoking is detrimental to the development of fetuses and neonates. This meta-analysis was performed to measure the accumulated association of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) risk with both prenatal and postnatal maternal smoking. The odds ratio (OR) corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (Cl) was used to assess the associations between maternal smoking and SIDS risk. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and I-2 statistics. The data for this meta-analysis were available from 35 case-control studies. The prenatal and postnatal maternal smoking was associated with a significantly increased risk of SIDS (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 2.03-2.50 for prenatal maternal smoking analysis, and OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.77-2.19 for postnatal maternal smoking analysis, respectively) by random effects model. After stratified analyses, regardless of prenatal or postnatal smoking, heavy cigarette consumption increased the risk of SIDS and significantly elevated SIDS risk was found to be associated with co-sleeping with postnatal smoking mothers. Our results suggested that maternal smoking were associated with elevated SIDS risk, the effects were dose-dependent. In addition, SIDS risk was significantly increased in infants co-sleeping with postnatal smoking mothers. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context: The rise of cortisol concentrations after awakening is well documented in adults and children and commonly used as easily accessible marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) reactivity.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the existence of a salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR) in infants, and to estimate its association with birth outcome.
   Setting: The study was conducted in the general community.
   Participants: Healthy infants up to six months age (N = 64).
   Main outcome measures: Mothers were instructed to collect their infant's saliva immediately and 30 min after awakening on two days within 45 days, irrespective of awakening time. Information on birth outcome was collected from medical records and questionnaires.
   Results: Linear mixed models analysis revealed a significant rise of infant salivary cortisol concentrations within 30 min after awakening (b = 0.128, SE = 0.024, t(61) = 5.31, p < 0.001), which was quite stable across the two sampling days (r = 0.40, p = 0.002). The infant CAR was predicted by length of gestation (t(58) = 2.44, p = 0.018).
   Conclusions: The current data demonstrate the existence of a CAR in infants as early as during the first six postnatal months; its relationship with length of gestation supports its usefulness for questions related to developmental neuroscience. Therefore, the infant CAR emerges as non-invasive biomarker of HPA axis dynamics at this early stage of life, with relevance for future research and potential clinical applications.

Method The PSS package responded to increased risk to babies from disrupted living and sleeping conditions in families. Door-to-door' distribution offered easy access to those in need. A subgroup of recipients gave feedback via a survey. Results From 642 families who received PSSs between March and August, 139 were invited to complete a survey on usage and 100 (72%) responded. Risks identified were earthquake related' (82%), bed-sharing (41%), smoking in pregnancy (26%) and prematurity or low birthweight (11%). PSSs were used for same-bed co-sleeping by 87%. They were used even though most families (96%) also had a cot or bassinet. Features most appreciated were having baby close' (90%), peace of mind' (88%) and portability (74%). Conclusion PSSs were acceptable to parents and used as instructed. Enabling physical protection of babies when same-bed co-sleeping, they gave peace of mind to parents. PSSs could be considered in ordinary times for protecting babies from sudden infant death.

FX Many people from across New Zealand gave their support to this project
   in a variety of ways. Its success is shared with those who supplied
   goods and services at subsidised or no cost, organised sewing bees,
   sewed covers and sheet sets, assisted with the door to door blitz in the
   eastern suburbs, identified babies in need, promoted PSSs to families,
   delivered PSSs to homes, acted as distributing agencies to extend access
   and gave feedback along the way. Most importantly we acknowledge the
   more than 1000 families who used PSSs (called pepi-pods) in 2011 and
   their babies who slept safely in them. The project was partially funded
   by the New Zealand Ministry of Health.

TI Sleep Disordered Breathing and Gestational Hypertension: Postpartum
   Follow-up Study
SO SLEEP
LA English
DT Article
DE Gestational hypertension; postpartum; preeclampsia; sleep disordered
   breathing
AB Background: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a newly recognized risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events later in life. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum state.
   Objective: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of pregnancy resolve.
   Methods: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed.
   Results: Eighteen subjects (11 GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum (12.0 +/- 12.3 vs 2.9 +/- 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the same change (2.8 +/- 5.3 vs 2.1 +/- 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of healthy women (P = 0.75).
   Conclusions: SDB in women with gestational hypertension improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

AB Background: Detailed associations between physical activity (PA) subcomponents, sedentary time, and body composition in preschoolers remain unclear.
   Objective: We examined the magnitude of associations between objectively measured PA subcomponents and sedentary time with body composition in 4-y-old children.
   Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 398 preschool children recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. PA was measured by using accelerometry, and body composition was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between light physical activity, moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity; sedentary time; and body composition were analyzed by using repeated-measures linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, birth weight, maternal education, maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sleep duration. Sedentary time and PA were also mutually adjusted for one another to determine whether they were independently related to adiposity.
   Results: VPA was the only intensity of PA to exhibit strong inverse associations with both total adiposity [P < 0.001 for percentage of body fat and fat mass index (FMI)] and abdominal adiposity (P = 0.002 for trunk FMI). MVPA was inversely associated with total adiposity (P = 0.018 for percentage of body fat; P = 0.022 for FMI) but only because of the contribution of VPA, because MPA was unrelated to fatness (P >= 0.077). No associations were shown between the time spent sedentary and body composition (P >= 0.11).
   Conclusions: In preschoolers, the time spent in VPA is strongly and independently associated with lower adiposity. In contrast, the time spent sedentary and in low-to-moderate intensity PA was unrelated to adiposity. These results indicate that efforts to challenge pediatric obesity may benefit from prioritizing VPA. An J Clin Nutr 2013;97:1020-8.

AB Using repeated-measures pre-/posttest design, the effects of guided imagery on maternal stress in 19 hospitalized pregnant women were examined. Mean stress and systolic blood pressure measurements postintervention were significantly lower than mean levels before listening to the guided imagery CD. All participants identified benefits of this holistic intervention. The study provides preliminary evidence that a guided imagery intervention may be effective in reducing maternal stress in hospitalized pregnant women and supports the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial to further support incorporating this intervention into care.

AB Objective: to explore the role of anxiety and other factors in predicting postnatal fatigue from birth to 6 months.
   Design: a prospective longitudinal correlational survey design.
   Setting: Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.
   Participants: 504 well women, 233 primipara and 271 multipara, aged 20-40 years who gave birth during the study period.
   Measurement: the Postpartum Fatigue Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the Support Behavior Inventory were used to measure the relationship between the predictive factors and the intensity of fatigue at the various time points.
   Findings: an explanatory model of fatigue development was applied to all participants, and then to primiparas and multiparas, explaining 27-44% of the variance in fatigue from 1 to 24 weeks in the total sample (p > .001). State anxiety was a consistently strong predictor of fatigue intensity across time and group.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: the contribution that state anxiety made to the development of fatigue in this group of low risk women highlights the importance of assessing symptoms of anxiety in all childbearing women. Focusing on depressive symptoms limits the extent to which anxiety symptoms, which occur in parallel with depressive symptoms, are addressed. Anxiety is a normal response to the changes in roles and responsibilities that occur following birth. However the belief that all new mothers worry excessively and that anxiety is not as harmful as depression may have influenced the way midwives and maternal child health nurses view postnatal anxiety. Assessment of anxiety, and use of interventions such as cognitive and behavioural strategies and self-care practices, can be used to assist women to reduce anxiety levels. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study aim was to compare sleep, sleepiness, fatigue, and neurobehavioral performance among first-time mothers and fathers during their early postpartum period. Participants were 21 first-time postpartum motherfather dyads (N=42) and seven childless control dyads (N=14). Within their natural environment, participants completed 1 week of wrist actigraphy monitoring, along with multi-day self-administered sleepiness, fatigue, and neurobehavioral performance measures. The assessment week was followed by an objective laboratory-based test of sleepiness. Mothers obtained more sleep compared to fathers, but mothers' sleep was more disturbed by awakenings. Fathers had greater objectively measured sleepiness than mothers. Mothers and fathers did not differ on subjectively measured sleep quality, sleepiness, or fatigue; however, mothers had worse neurobehavioral performance than fathers. Compared to control dyads, postpartum parents experienced greater sleep disturbance, sleepiness, and sleepiness-associated impairments. Study results can inform social policy, postpartum sleep intervention development, and research on postpartum family systems and mechanisms that propagate sleepiness. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that could prevent preterm delivery (PTD, < 37 weeks gestation). We examined the individual and joint associations of pre-pregnancy BMI, second trimester exercise and sleep on PTD. We conducted a nested, population-based case-control study interviewing postpartum 344 cases delivering at < 37 weeks, as identified by clinical estimate of gestational age from prenatal screening records, and 698 term controls, excluding term low birthweight. Eligible women participated in California's statewide Prenatal Screening Program, worked during pregnancy, and delivered a singleton birth in Southern California in 2002-2003. Modeled separately, moderate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.96-per hour/week) and vigorous (OR = 0.67; 95 % CI = 0.46-0.98 for yes vs. no) exercise during the second trimester were associated with a reduced odds of PTD, and sleep duration was not (OR = 1.09, 95 % CI = 0.80-1.48 for < 7 h; OR = 0.88, 95 % CI = 0.57-1.48 for > 8 h vs. 7-8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85-0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m(2) (OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79-0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both pre-conceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States.

AB Knowledge translation has relied on research products that take years to disseminate, losing relevance for intended users. We used a mixed-methods approach to determine women's preferences for research results and format, intention to share results, and potential benefits. We sampled healthy, pregnant women who completed survey data during their third trimesters and wanted access to results. Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared. Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational contacts increased dissemination of the women's preferred information to nonstudy participants.

AB Several studies show that a high proportion of women of childbearing age use drugs, including alcohol.
   The dangers of prenatal alcoholization have been particularly well studied, unlike those related to neonatal alcoholization, via breastfeeding.
   Epidemiological data and results obtained with animal models show that alcoholization via breastfeeding has a multifactorial impact which, in addition to causing neuronal losses, disrupts the physiology of the mother, including her hormonal balance, impacting on sleep, behavior and the children's development.
   Alcohol consumption is not formally contraindicated during lactation, while it is during pregnancy.

AB Objective: The aim of the current study was to verify whether maternal orientation differences are associated with specific care-giving practices and maternal subjective well-being in accordance with theory. Background: The facilitator orientation, characterised by infant-led care-giving, is proposed to promote immediate responsiveness to the infant coupled with a maternal desire to nurture, whereas the regulator orientation, typified by a mother-led care regime, is proposed to prioritise infant socialisation and maternal needs. However, empirical research linking maternal orientation to maternal care-giving practices and satisfaction in the mothering role is limited. Method: Two hundred and seventy-four mothers of infants 4-7 months old answered an online questionnaire to classify maternal orientation, explore care-giving practices specific to infant sleep, and assess each woman's current experience of mothering. Results: As predicted, more facilitator tendencies were associated with more frequent hands-on infant settling, more flexible timing for infant sleeps, and a closer mother-infant proximity at night, even after controlling for demographic influences and feeding type (breast milk and/or formula). In contrast, maternal orientation did not explain differences in maternal subjective well-being. Those with more facilitator or more regulator tendencies were equally satisfied with their mothering role. Conclusions: A need to tailor support services to each mother's philosophy to baby care is implicated.

TI Safety Profile of Modafinil Across a Range of Prescribing Indications,
   Including Off-Label Use, in a Primary Care Setting in England
SO DRUG SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS;
   NARCOLEPSY
AB Modafinil (Provigil) was marketed in the UK in 1998 to promote wakefulness in the treatment of narcolepsy. In April 2004, the licence was extended to include chronic pathological conditions; 2 years later, the prescription of modafinil was restricted to patients with shift work sleep disorder, narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Following a recent review of the safety data, the licence has been further restricted to only treat patients with narcolepsy. The review highlighted the degree of off-label usage of modafinil, including patients with multiple sclerosis.
   The aim of this study was to examine the safety profile of modafinil in real-world clinical usage and across a range of prescribing indications, including multiple sclerosis.
   The study was conducted using the observational cohort technique of Modified Prescription-Event Monitoring. Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions issued by primary care physicians from July 2004 to August 2005. Patient demographics and information on prescribing behaviour were included in the questionnaire sent to the prescribing general practitioner (GP) 6 months after the initial prescription for each patient. The questionnaire sought data on any events that patient may have experienced during that time, reasons for stopping treatment with modafinil, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), potential interaction with contraceptives, and pregnancies. Incidence densities (IDs) were calculated for all events, and stratified according to indication and dose. Specific events were evaluated by requesting further information.
   Of the 4,023 questionnaires sent to GPs, 2,416 were returned (response rate 60.1 %). Of these, only those patients issued modafinil after April 2004 (with the associated broadening of the indications for treatment) were included in the study, resulting in a final cohort of 1,096 patients: 497 (45.3 %) male, median age of 52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41-63), and 599 (54.7 %) female, median age of 47 years (IQR 38-57). Nine patients were aged 16 years or younger; no serious skin reactions were reported in this group. Thirty-four percent of the cohort had an indication of multiple sclerosis. In this study, the majority of the clinical events that were most frequently reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping or that occurred in month 1 have been previously documented with modafinil. The results of the study show that less than half of the women of child-bearing potential were established on a recommended contraceptive programme; three women became pregnant whilst taking modafinil and the oral contraceptive pill. Stratification of IDs by dose revealed certain additional events occurred during month 1 of treatment at the higher dose only. Assessment of individual cases of cardiac, psychiatric and skin events indicated causal associations with modafinil.
   This study provides important additional safety data on the use of modafinil in patients in 'real-world' use, including those for whom the prescribing indication is outside the terms of licence, as per recent changes to the licensed indications for treatment. In addition to safety data, our study provides useful utilization data. Results from this study indicate that a significant number of women of child-bearing potential had not been commenced on appropriate contraceptive programmes prior to starting modafinil. There were three pregnancies that occurred whilst taking contraception, highlighting the necessity of ensuring effective contraceptive cover for women during and after stopping treatment with modafinil. Analysis of the data showed that the majority of events reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping and ranked events during the first month of treatment had been previously documented with the use of modafinil. Stratification of events according to dose revealed a number of events that occurred at the higher dose only, including serious events such as psychosis. The targeted events for which causality assessments were undertaken confirmed the potential of modafinil to induce certain types of events in individual patients, including cardiac and psychiatric events.

AB Background: The management of pregnancy in patients with narcolepsy poses many questions regarding therapy, including the risk to the mother and fetus related to the disease, potential risks at the time of conception, the risk to both the mother and the fetus of the medications used to treat narcolepsy, and the risk to the infant from medications that might be secreted in breast milk. There are no detailed practice parameters on the treatment of narcolepsy patients during pregnancy. We surveyed narcolepsy specialists from around the world to determine their clinical approach to the management of patients with narcolepsy at the time of conception, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.
   Methods: Survey invitations were sent via e-mail to 75 clinicians worldwide between 2/2011 and 3/2011 with 34 responses (USA, n = 10; Brazil, n = 3; Czech Republic, n = 2; France, n = 2; Italy; n = 2; Netherlands, n = 2; Canada, n = 1; Denmark, n = 1; Finland, n = 1; Germany, n = 1; Japan, n = 1; Spain, n = 1; unknown n = 7). Responders who completed the survey had 20 years (median range, 5-35) of experience in sleep medicine practice with a median number of five narcolepsy patients seen per week. The number of pregnant narcoleptic patients followed per physician was five (median range 1-40).
   Results: The survey results indicated that the management of patients with narcolepsy varies greatly from clinician to clinician and from country to country. The majority of the clinicians stopped the narcolepsy medications at the time of conception, during pregnancy, and during breastfeeding some reduced the dose and others did not change the dosage, depending on the particular medication.
   Conclusions: The findings from our survey and literature review suggest that the perceived risks of narcolepsy medication during pregnancy to the mother and the fetus usually are overestimated, as the risk for teratogenic effects from narcolepsy medications in therapeutic doses is essentially nonexistent. However, the potential for rare complications during pregnancy and congenital abnormalities cannot be excluded. Most narcolepsy patients have vaginal delivery without complications. In rare cases patients had cataplexy that interfered with delivery, but if caesarian is required there appears to be no increased anaesthetic or surgical risks. Further prospective information for the appropriate treatment of narcolepsy patients during pregnancy is needed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To assess the current state of knowledge regarding sleep disorders and their relationship to obstetric outcomes.
   Study Design A systematic literature review of the previous two decades (1991 to 2010) was conducted. The exposure was sleep disorders during pregnancy, and the outcomes of interest were feto-infant morbidity and maternal complications.
   Results Sleep apnea, snoring, and sleep quantity/duration were identified as the most frequently examined sleep disorders among pregnant women. Although our review found that studies examining the impact of sleep disorders on feto-infant outcomes were lacking, previous research indicates that such disorders may enhance the risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the current body of evidence suggests that sleep disorders adversely impact maternal health, increasing the likelihood of preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes.
   Conclusion Existing research points to the potentially harmful effects of sleep disorders on obstetric outcomes. The limited research in this arena highlights the need for further studies regarding the nature and strength of this relationship. Given the multiple dimensions of sleep and pregnancy, multivariate research approaches that incorporate biological and psychosocial factors are warranted.

AB Dysfunction of the circadian clock genes is involved in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and T2D share common genetic and phenotypic features, in the present study, we investigated the status of the circadian clock in a cohort of 40 Greek pregnant women with GDM, four with T2D and 20 normal controls. Peripheral blood mRNA transcript levels of 10 clock genes (CLOCK1, BMAL1, PERI, PER2, PER3, PPARA, PPARD, PPARG, CRY1 and CRY2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. GDM patients expressed significantly lower transcript levels of BMAL1, PER3, PPARD and CRY2 compared to control women (p < 0.05). No significant difference was documented between GDM women maintained either under insulin treatment or diet. A positive correlation was found between the expression of BMAL1 versus CRY2 (r = 0.45, p = 0.003) and BMAL1 versus PPARD (r = 0.43, p = 0.004). Further investigation on the functional relevance of these clock genes, disclosed that expression of PER3 correlated negatively with HbA(1c) levels (r = -0.36, p = 0.022). These data document for the first time that the expression of BMAL1, PER3, PPARD and CRY2 genes is altered in GDM compared to normal pregnant women and support the notion that deranged expression of clock genes may play a pathogenic role in GDM.

AB Aim The major advantage of salivary cortisol sampling is that it is considerably less invasive than taking a blood sample. However, previous methods of obtaining saliva in premature infants have been poorly tolerated and inaccurate. We describe a simple, non-distressing technique for obtaining saliva samples to assess extremely premature infants' salivary cortisol status. Methods We prospectively obtained early morning saliva samples from extremely premature infants. Their gestational age ranged between 23 and 27weeks. Saliva was obtained using four standard universal swabs by placing one swab at a time in the infant's mouth for 12min. No salivary stimulants were used. Results There were 65 infants (36 males). Mean gestation was 25.3 +/- 1.3weeks. This technique had a success rate of 85% in obtaining a mean of 150L of saliva (range 50350L) by trained staff. No adverse events were recorded. Conclusion We describe a novel, safe, non-distressing and effective method of saliva collection for salivary cortisol measurement in extremely premature infants.

AB Aim To investigate whether or not infants exposed to methamphetamine prenatally have impaired arousal responses from sleep. Methods The polygraphic nap studies involved 42 infants aged 3months exposed to methamphetamine in utero and a comparison group of 57 infants. A proportion of mothers in both groups smoked cigarettes and/or marijuana and drank alcohol during pregnancy. White noise from 50 to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10dB intervals twice within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and arousal thresholds measured. Results Combining groups, 306 tests were completed (128 and 178 within REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more likely to wake at lower thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95% CI, 3.788.23 p<0.0001). No significant differences in arousal threshold were found between methamphetamine and comparison groups, before or after controlling for other substance use (NREM sleep; 0.98, 95% CI, 0.601.59 and REM sleep; 1.03, 95% CI, 0.561.89). Conclusions These findings suggest that arousal responses of methamphetamine-exposed infants remain intact, providing no support for the hypothesis that prenatal exposure could increase their vulnerability to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) through arousal deficits.

AB Phadke CP, Balasubramanian CK, Ismail F, Boulias C: Revisiting physiologic and psychologic triggers that increase spasticity. Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2013;92:357-369. Objective: The aims of this study were to systematically identify and summarize the literature examining the impact of physiologic and psychologic triggers on spasticity and discuss the evidence supporting various types of triggers.
   Design: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases were searched using specific keyword combinations. Only studies using clinical tests or self-reports of spasticity were included.
   Results: A total of 1152 articles were scanned for relevance, and of 44 relevant articles, 24 were reviewed. Pregnancy, posture, cold, circadian rhythm, and skin conditions increased spasticity and were measured using objective clinical tests. Self-reports of spasticity suggest that triggers such as bowel-and bladder-related issues, menstrual cycle, mental stress, and tight clothing can all increase spasticity. No literature evidence of increase in spasticity in response to heterotopic ossification, hemorrhoids, deep vein thrombosis, fever, and sleep patterns was found.
   Conclusions: Although self-reports indicate a strong possibility of increasing spasticity, without objective examination, the true effects of these triggers on spasticity remain inconclusive. Most studies reviewed here were performed in the spinal cord injury population; therefore, it is not known whether these triggers induce similar effects in persons with other neurologic etiologies.

AB Objective To describe the prevalence of, reasons given for, and factors associated with sick leave during pregnancy. Design Longitudinal, population-based descriptive study. Setting Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Population All women scheduled to give birth at the hospital (November 2008 to April 2010). Methods Consenting women were handed a questionnaire at the routine ultrasound check at 17weeks of gestation. Women returning this questionnaire received a second questionnaire at 32weeks of gestation. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations with somatic, psychiatric and social factors. Main outcome measures Rates and duration of sick leave. Results By 32weeks of gestation, 63.2% of the 2918 women included were on sick leave, and 75.3% had been on sick leave at some point during their pregnancy. Pelvic girdle pain and fatigue/sleep problems were the main reasons given for sick leave. Being on sick leave in all trimesters was strongly associated with hyperemesis, exercising less than weekly, chronic pain before or during pregnancy, infertility treatment (all P<0.001); younger maternal age, conflicts in the workplace (both P<0.01); multiparity, previous depression, insomnia and lower education (all P<0.05). Sick leave was associated with elective caesarean section and higher infant birthweight (P<0.01). Adjustment of the work situation was associated with 1week shorter duration of sick leave. Conclusions Most women receive sick leave during pregnancy, but sick leave might not be caused by pregnancy alone. Previous medical and psychiatric history, work conditions and socio-economic factors need to be addressed to understand sick leave during pregnancy.

AB Circadian clocks have been described in each tissue of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. Although a role for the clock in the timing of ovulation is indicated, the impact of diseases that disrupt fertility on clock function or the clocks' role in the etiology of these pathologies has yet to be fully appreciated. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a particularly devastating endocrinopathy, affecting approximately 10% of women at childbearing age. Common features of PCOS are a polycystic ovary, amenorrhea, and excess serum androgen. Approximately 40% of these women have metabolic syndrome, including hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperleptinemia. It has been suggested that excess androgen is a critical factor in the etiology of PCOS. We have examined the effects of androgen excess during puberty on the phase of circadian clocks in tissues of the metabolic and hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axes. Female period1-luciferase (per1-luc) rats were exposed to androgen (5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) or placebo for 4-6 weeks (short term) or 9-15 weeks (long term). As expected, DHT-treated animals gained more weight than controls and had disrupted estrous cycles. At the end of treatment, tissues, including the liver, lung, kidney, white adipose, cornea, pituitary, oviduct, and ovarian follicles, were cultured, and per1-luc expression in each was recorded. Analysis of per1-luc expression revealed that DHT exposure increased phase distribution of multiple oscillators, including ovarian follicles, liver, and adipose, and altered phase synchrony between animals. These data suggest that excess androgen during puberty, a common feature of PCOS, negatively affects internal circadian organization in both the reproductive and metabolic axes.

LA English
DT Article
DE Sleep-disordered breathing; Pregnancy; Preeclampsia
AB Objective: To determine whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is more prevalent among women with preeclampsia than among normotensive controls.
   Study design: Preeclamptic patients admitted to the hospital for observation and normotensive, gestational age matched controls hospitalized for obstetrical indications other than preeclampsia were recruited for an overnight sleep evaluation. Watch-PAT100, a validated wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SDB, was used to complete all sleep studies.
   Results: Twenty preeclamptic patients and 20 controls were recruited. Preeclamptic subjects had a higher mean BMI (32.6 +/- 9.5 vs. 24.5 +/- 3.5, P = 0.001). Preeclamptic subjects had higher mean respiratory disturbance (RDI, mean difference 4.9 events/hour of sleep), apnea hypopnea (AHI, mean difference 5.7 events/hour of sleep) and oxygen desaturation (ODI, mean difference 4.5 events/hour of sleep) indices, however these differences did not reach statistical significance. Preeclamptic subjects were more likely to have more severe forms of SDB compared to controls (ODI >= 5, 20% vs. 0%, p = .047).
   Conclusion: Compared to normotensive controls, preeclamptic subjects experience more SDB events and a greater degree of nocturnal hypoxemia. Further research is needed to determine if SDB, independent of BMI, is a significant contributing factor to the risk of developing preeclampsia.

   The following summary reflects the most recent findings in CGM and provides an overall review of who would most benefit from CGM use. Benefits of CGM may vary based on age, type of diabetes, pregnancy, health, sleep, or heart rate. Accuracy and reliability are critical in current uses of CGM and especially for new and future systems that automate insulin partially (e.g., low glucose suspend) or entirely (e. g., 'fully closed-loop' artificial pancreas). Clinicians are simultaneously testing available products in new patient groups such as the critically ill and type 2 diabetes patients not using mealtime insulin.
   Summary
   In a widening set of circumstances, use of CGM has been shown to promote safer and more effective glycemic control than self-monitoring of blood glucose. Imperfections remain in certain scenarios such as hypoglycemia and in certain populations such as young children. Ongoing research on sensors and calibration software should translate to better systems.

AB Background: Hormonal treatment might affect the immune response to tumor antigens induced in cancer patients who are being vaccinated.
   Case presentation: A 33 years-old woman was diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma in May 2009. Her melanoma was located in the intermammary sulcus, had a Breslow thickness of 4 mm, a Clark's level IV, it was ulcerated and highly melanotic. The bilateral sentinel node biopsy was negative. She entered into a randomized Phase II/III clinical study comparing a vaccine composed of irradiated melanoma cells plus BCG plus GM-CSF versus IFN-alpha 2b and she was assigned to the vaccine arm. During the two years treatment she remained disease-free; the final CAT scan being performed in August 2011. Between November and December 2011, her gynecologist treated her with three cycles of 200 mg progesterone/day for ten days, every two weeks, for ovary dysfunction. In November 2011 the patient returned to the Hospital for clinical and imaging evaluation and no evidence of disease was found. At the next visit in March 2012 an ultrasound revealed multiple, large metastases in the liver. A CAT scan confirmed the presence of liver, adrenal glands and spleen metastases. A needle biopsy of a liver lesion revealed metastatic melanoma of similar characteristics to the original tumor. We suggest that progesterone treatment triggered proliferation of so far dormant micrometastases that were controlled during CSF470 vaccine treatment.
   Conclusion: The use of progesterone in patients with melanoma that are under immunological treatments should be carefully considered, since progesterone could modify the balance of pro-inflammatory and Th1 functions to a regulatory and anti-inflammatory profile of the immune system that could have an impact in tumor progression.

AB Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioural-educational sleep intervention delivered in the early postpartum in improving maternal and infant sleep.
   Design Randomised controlled trial.
   Setting Postpartum units of two university affiliated hospitals.
   Participants 246 primiparous women and their infants randomised while in hospital with an internet based randomisation service to intervention (n=123) or usual care (n=123) groups.
   Interventions The behavioural-educational sleep intervention included a 45-60 minute meeting with a nurse to discuss sleep information and strategies to promote maternal and infant sleep, a 20 page booklet with the content discussed, and phone contacts at one, two, and four weeks postpartum to reinforce information, provide support, and problem solve. The usual care group received calls at weeks one, two, and four to maintain contact without provision of advice.
   Main outcome measures Primary outcome was maternal nocturnal (9 pm to 9 am) sleep (minutes) and secondary outcome was longest stretch of infant nocturnal sleep (minutes) measured at six and 12 weeks postpartum by actigraphy. Other outcomes measured at six and 12 weeks were number of maternal and infant night time awakenings by actigraphy, fatigue visual analogue scale, general sleep disturbance scale, and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale. Rates of exclusive breast feeding were measured at 12 weeks postpartum only.
   Results All women who completed any outcome measures at six or 12 weeks were included in analysis. Sleep outcomes were completed at one or both of six and 12 weeks postpartum for 215 of 246 (87%) women (110/123 intervention and 105/123 usual care). Longitudinal mixed effects model analyses indicated no significant differences between the groups on any of the outcomes. The estimated mean difference in maternal nocturnal sleep between the intervention and usual care groups was 5.97 minutes (95% confidence interval -7.55 to 19.5 minutes, P=0.39). No differences in any outcomes were noted based on the specific nurse delivering the intervention or the number of phone contacts received.
   Conclusion A behavioural-educational intervention delivered in the early postpartum, in hospital, and in the first weeks at home, was ineffective in improving maternal and infant sleep or other health outcomes in the first months postpartum.

TI Design, implementation and evaluation of a national campaign to deliver

   spaces in Tanzania
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Malaria; Vector control; Insecticide-treated nets; Long-lasting
   insecticidal nets; Distribution campaign; Tanzania
ID MALARIA CONTROL; TREATED NETS; SUBSIDY
AB Background: Since 2004, the Tanzanian National Voucher Scheme has increased availability and accessibility of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) to pregnant women and infants by subsidizing the cost of nets purchased. From 2008 to 2010, a mass distribution campaign delivered nine million long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) free-of-charge to children under-five years of age in Tanzania mainland. In 2010 and 2011, a Universal Coverage Campaign (UCC) led by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) was implemented to cover all sleeping spaces not yet reached through previous initiatives.
   Methods: The UCC was coordinated through a unit within the National Malaria Control Programme. Partners were contracted by the MoHSW to implement different activities in collaboration with local government authorities. Volunteers registered the number of uncovered sleeping spaces in every household in the country. On this basis, LLINs were ordered and delivered to village level, where they were issued over a three-day period in each zone (three regions). Household surveys were conducted in seven districts immediately after the campaign to assess net ownership and use.
   Results: The UCC was chiefly financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria with important contributions from the US President's Malaria Initiative. A total of 18.2 million LLINs were delivered at an average cost of USD 5.30 per LLIN. Overall, 83% of the expenses were used for LLIN procurement and delivery and 17% for campaign associated activities. Preliminary results of the latest Tanzania HIV Malaria Indicator Survey (2011-12) show that household ownership of at least one ITN increased to 91.5%. ITN use, among children under-five years of age, improved to 72.7% after the campaign. ITN ownership and use data post-campaign indicated high equity across wealth quintiles.
   Conclusion: Close collaboration among the MoHSW, donors, contracted partners, local government authorities and volunteers made it possible to carry out one of the largest LLIN distribution campaigns conducted in Africa to date. Through the strong increase of ITN use, the recent activities of the national ITN programme will likely result in further decline in child mortality rates in Tanzania, helping to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 6.

AB Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine the influences of hormones and menstrual cycle on the severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in reproductive women.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 381 volunteered women (aged 1453 years) were interviewed using a validated diagnostic questionnaire to determine the presence of the disease. Volunteers were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics. 54 women who fulfilled the disease criteria were administered the International RLS Severity Scale. The patients were also assessed by using the Short Form-36 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in order to evaluate the quality of life. Blood samples were drawn on the days 3, 13 and 23 of the menstrual cycle to determine hormone levels.
   Results: There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of the 381 women surveyed, 14.2% were positive for the disease. Severity of the disease symptoms were not correlated with hormone levels. We found no association of RLS with educational level, smoking, marital status and number of parity. However, a significant difference was found in alcohol intake and caffeine consumption between patients and controls (p<0.05). Perceived RLS severity was increased significantly in the follicular phase. The severity of the disease symptoms affected sleep quality and quality of life. No correlation was observed between hormone levels and SF-36 scores.
   Conclusion: RLS is a common disease, affecting women in reproductive ages more often than in post-menopausal ages. Female hormonal changes do not correlate with the severity of RLS symptoms. RLS is perceived more severely in the follicular phase. Estradiol levels do not affect SF-36 scores in reproductive ages as it does in post-menopausal ages. Turk J Phys Med Rehab 2013;59:45-51.

AB Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinal cause of vision loss. This review surveys the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, natural history and pathophysiology of CSCR. Studies suggest an annual incidence rate of 10 per 100 000 in men, with CSCR occurring six times more commonly in men compared with women. Most acute CSCR cases resolve spontaneously within 23 months. Prognosis is highly dependent on presenting visual acuity; patients with initial visual acuities of 6/6 remain at that level, while patients with initial visual acuities of less than 6/9 recover on average two to three Snellen lines over the next few years. The main risk factors for CSCR are systemic corticosteroid use, type A personality, pregnancy and endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The pathophysiology of CSCR remains obscure, although disorders in both the choroidal circulation and retinal pigment epithelium are implicated.

AB Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of children under the age of 15, making it a very common neurological disorder in the pediatric population (Russ et al., 2012 [1]). In addition, similar to 0.4-0.8% of all pregnant women have some form of epilepsy (Hauser et al., 1996a,b; Borthen et al., 2009; Krishnamurthy, 2012 [2-5]). Despite the potential deleterious effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the developing brain, their use is still required for seizure control in pregnant women (Krishnamurthy, 2012 [5]), and they represent the standard approach for treating children with epilepsy (Chu-Shore and Thiele, 2010; Quach et al., 2010; Verrotti et al., 2011 [6-8]). Even when AEDs are effective, there are potential side effects, including cognitive and affective changes or altered sleep and appetite. The consequences of AED exposure in development have been studied extensively (Canger et al., 1999; Modi et al., 2011a,b; Oguni, 2011 [9-12]). Despite intensive study, there is still debate about the long-term consequences of early life AED exposure. Here, we consider the evidence to date that AED exposure, either prenatally or in early postnatal life, has significant adverse effects on the developing brain and incorporate studies of laboratory animals as well as those of patients. We also note the areas of research where greater clarity seems critical in order to make significant advances. A greater understanding of the impact of AEDs on somatic, cognitive and behavioral development has substantial value because it has the potential to inform clinical practice and guide studies aimed at understanding the genetic and molecular bases of comorbid pathologies associated with common treatment regimens. Understanding these effects has the potential to lead to AEDs with fewer side effects. Such advances would expand treatment options, diminish the risk associated with AED exposure in susceptible populations, and improve the quality of life and health outcomes of children with epilepsy and children born to women who took AEDs during pregnancy.

AB Compromised pregnancies such as those associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, intrauterine growth retardation, preeclampsia, maternal undernutrition, and maternal stress may negatively affect fetal development. Such pregnancies may induce oxidative stress to the fetus and alter fetal development through the epigenetic process that may affect development at a later stage. Melatonin is an oxidant scavenger that reverses oxidative stress during the prenatal period. Moreover, the role of melatonin in epigenetic modifications in the field of developmental programming has been studied extensively.

AB Background Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Results Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. Conclusions This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested. (BIRTH 40:1 March 2013)

J Appl Physiol 114: 637-646, 2013. First published January 10, 2013; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00599.2012.-Current knowledge suggests that laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are involved in the occurrence of certain neonatal apneas/bradycardias, especially in the preterm newborn. While caffeine and/or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) are the most frequent options used for treating apneas in preterm newborns, their effects on LCR-related apneas/bradycardias are virtually unknown. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that caffeine and/or nCPAP decreases LCR-related cardiorespiratory inhibition in a preterm ovine model. Seven preterm lambs were born vaginally on gestational day 133 (normal gestation: 147 days) after intramuscular injections of betamethasone and mifepristone. Five days after birth, a chronic surgical instrumentation was performed to record states of alertness, electrocardiogram, systemic arterial pressure, and electromyographic activity of a laryngeal constrictor muscle, as well as to insert a transcutaneous supraglottal catheter. LCR were induced in quiet sleep under four conditions: 1) control (without caffeine or nCPAP); 2) nCPAP (5 cmH(2)O, without caffeine); 3) caffeine (10 mg/kg infused intravenously for 30 min, without nCPAP); and 4) nCPAP + caffeine. Our results showed that nCPAP consistently blunted LCR-related cardiorespiratory inhibition vs. control condition, contrary to caffeine whose overall effect was nonsignificant. In addition, nCPAP condition was characterized by a more consistent and rapid arousal after HCl injection. No significant differences were observed between all tested conditions with regard to swallowing and cough. It is concluded that nCPAP should be further assessed for its usefulness in treating neonatal apneas linked to LCR.

AB Objective: To determine childless men's knowledge about fertility and assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments and family building options, compared to knowledge of a sample of childless women.
   Design: Self-report questionnaire comprising 2 self-ratings and 20 knowledge questions related to later childbearing and ART.
   Setting: Online survey.
   Patient(s): A total of 599 presumed fertile, childless men between the ages of 20 and 50 years.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Knowledge of fertility and ART as measured by the male version of the Fertility Awareness Survey.
   Result(s): The majority of participants rated themselves as having some knowledge or being fairly knowledgeable about fertility and ART. However, on the 20 knowledge questions, overall knowledge was limited, with more than 50% of the sample answering correctly only 4 of 20 knowledge questions. The men demonstrated even less knowledge of fertility and ART than childless women.
   Conclusion(s): Given that the childless men in our study had no coherent body of knowledge regarding age-related fertility and ART treatment and family-building options, men may be contributing to the trend to delay childbearing. If they are to be effective in supporting informed fertility and childbearing decisions, education programs must target both women and men. (Fertil Steril (R) 2013;99:839-46.

AB Background: Napping is highly prevalent in pregnant women, but the relation between nighttime sleep and daytime naps in pregnant women is poorly understood.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the temporal association of nighttime sleep quality and quantity with subsequent daytime naps and the temporal association of daytime naps with sleep quality and quantity the following night in women during the third trimester of pregnancy in Taiwan.
   Methods: Sleep was assessed in 80 Taiwanese nulliparous women aged 31.70 years (SD = 4.58 years) using actigraphy and diaries for 7 consecutive days. Subjective sleep quality was examined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multiple linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were used to examine the temporal associations of nighttime sleep and daytime naps.
   Results: All women napped sometime during the study week, and mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score was 6.6, indicating poor sleep quality. Fewer weekly work hours and shorter sleep duration the preceding night were associated with longer nap duration the next day. More work hours, longer nap duration, and more intense fatigue were associated with shorter sleep duration the following night.
   Discussion: Naps during pregnancy might indicate insufficient nighttime sleep, and longer daytime naps could compromise subsequent nighttime sleep. Further research is needed to determine if short sleep duration and longer daytime naps are associated with negative pregnancy outcomes.

AB Purpose: This study examined the patterns and psychosocial predictors of sleep quality in Taiwanese pregnant women.
   Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used. A convenience sample of 400 pregnant women from two urban hospitals in Taiwan participated in this study. Data were collected using six self-report measures: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Attitude to Body Image Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List.
   Results: Our findings revealed that the prevalence of pregnancy-associated sleep disturbance (PSQI score >5) was 65.5%. The mean score of the global PSQI was 7.25 +/- 3.43, indicating that participant pregnant women in general reported mild sleep disturbance. Trend analyses of PSQI score indicated a linear trend, with a gradual decline in the sleep quality as the pregnancy progressed. Sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality scores differed significantly by trimesters. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the best subsets to predict sleep quality were prenatal depression, prepregnancy sleep quality, current body image, and week of gestation for Taiwanese pregnant women.
   Clinical Implications: These findings offer evidence that healthcare professionals should provide sleep counseling to pregnant women, and incorporate depression and body image into a supportive model of sleep-related prenatal care.

DE Obstructive sleep apnea; Pregnancy; Korean; Pregnancy outcome
ID RISK
AB This study was intended to evaluate the attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by a sleep questionnaire to adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant women. Berlin questionnaire was employed for symptom-based OSA screening during the third trimester and obstetric outcome data were obtained in 276 deliveries. The relationship between symptom-based OSA and outcomes were explored using SPSS version 18.0 and stratified by obesity (BMI strata < 30 and a parts per thousand yen30). Our primary outcome was the compound occurrence of SGA (fetal) or preeclampsia (maternal). Multivariate models were applied in controlling for potential confounders.
   The overall prevalence of OSA was 32.2 % and it was significantly related with the higher maternal BMI, more body weight at delivery, and weight gain during pregnancy (p = 0.007, p = 0.003, p = 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences in the primary outcomes according to the positivity of OSA by screening, regardless of the stratification by obesity. The cesarean delivery rate was significantly higher in the OSA positive group (36.0 vs 22.5 %, p = 0.018), but it was not significant in the each strata of obesity. In multivariate analysis, the outcomes of birth weight, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and small for gestational age were also not different according to the positivity of OSA.
   It seems that the prevalence of OSA by a sleep questionnaire is overestimating OSA in Korean pregnant women. Polysomnography might be needed to diagnose OSA and to evaluate the relationship between OSA and the occurrence of SGA or preeclampsia.

AB Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant acting as an MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. Because of its peculiar pharmacological profile, this drug caters the potential to correct the abnormalities of circadian rhythms associated with mood disorders, including abnormalities of the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we examined the effect of chronic agomelatine treatment on sleep architecture and circadian rhythms of motor activity using the rat model of prenatal restraint stress (PRS) as a putative 'aetiological' model of depression. PRS was delivered to the mothers during the last 10 d of pregnancy. The adult progeny ('PRS rats') showed a reduced duration of slow wave sleep, an increased duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increased number of REM sleep events and an increase in motor activity before the beginning of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. In addition, adult PRS rats showed an increased expression of the transcript of the primary response gene, c-Fos, in the hippocampus just prior to the beginning of the dark phase. All these changes were reversed by a chronic oral treatment with agomelatine (2000 ppm in the diet). The effect of agomelatine on sleep was largely attenuated by treatment with the MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor antagonist, S22153, which caused PRS-like sleep disturbances on its own. These data provide the first evidence that agomelatine corrects sleep architecture and restores circadian homeostasis in a preclinical model of depression and supports the value of agomelatine as a novel antidepressant that resynchronizes circadian rhythms under pathological conditions.

TI Bed-sharing and risk of hospitalisation due to pneumonia and diarrhoea

AB Objective To investigate the association between bed-sharing with the mother at 3 months of age and incidence of hospitalisation due to pneumonia and diarrhoea between 3 and 12 months.
   Methods The 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort included all live births to mothers living in Pelotas, Brazil, in 2004. Information on bed-sharing was obtained at the 3-month follow-up visit, and on hospitalisations at the 12-month visit, both based on mothers' reports. Only singleton infants with complete information on hospitalisation were analysed.
   Results 3906 infants were included. The bed-sharing prevalence at 3 months was 46.4% (95% CI 44.9 to 48.0%). The incidence of pneumonia admissions between 3 and 12 months was 3.6% (95% CI 3.3 to 4.2%) and diarrhoea, 0.9% (95% CI 0.6 to 1.2%). In crude analyses, bed-sharing with the mother was associated with higher incidence of hospitalisation due to both pneumonia and diarrhoea. There was interaction between bed-sharing and duration of breastfeeding regarding the chance of admission due to pneumonia. Among infants breastfed for 3 months or less, the chance of hospitalisation due to pneumonia among bed-sharers was almost twice as high as among non-bed-sharers (adjusted OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.55). There was no association between bed-sharing and hospitalisation due to pneumonia among infants breastfed for longer than 3 months in crude or adjusted analyses. The association between bed-sharing and admissions due to diarrhoea lost statistical significance after allowing for confounders.
   Conclusions The effect of bed-sharing in infancy on the risk of hospitalisation due to pneumonia depends on breastfeeding, such that weaned children present higher risk.

AB Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy is a key contributor to offspring diseases that develop in adult life. To explore the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy in primates, we exposed pregnant capuchin monkeys to constant light (eliminating the maternal melatonin rhythm) from the last third of gestation to term. Maternal temperature and activity circadian rhythms were assessed as well as the newborn temperature rhythm. Additionally we studied the effect of daily maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy on these rhythms. Ten pregnant capuchin monkeys were exposed to constant light from 60% of gestation to term. Five received a daily oral dose of melatonin (250 mu g kg/body weight) at 1800 h (LL+Mel) and the other five a placebo (LL). Six additional pregnant females were maintained in a 14:10 light: dark cycles and their newborns were used as controls (LD). Rhythms were recorded 96 h before delivery in the mother and at 4-6 days of age in the newborn. Exposure to constant light had no effect on the maternal body temperature rhythm however it delayed the acrophase of the activity rhythm. Neither rhythm was affected by melatonin replacement. In contrast, maternal exposure to constant light affected the newborn body temperature rhythm. This rhythm was entrained in control newborns whereas LL newborns showed a random distribution of the acrophases over 24-h. In addition, mean temperature was decreased (34.0 +/- 0.6 vs 36.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C, in LL and control, respectively P<0.05). Maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy re-synchronized the acrophases and restored mean temperature to the values in control newborns. Our findings demonstrate that prenatal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the newborn temperature rhythm and supports normal body temperature maintenance. Altogether these prenatal melatonin effects highlight the physiological importance of the maternal melatonin rhythm during pregnancy for the newborn primate.

AB Night work involving disruption of circadian rhythm was suggested as a possible cause of breast cancer. We examined the role of night work in a large population-based case-control study carried out in France between 2005 and 2008. Lifetime occupational history including work schedules of each night work period was elicited in 1,232 cases of breast cancer and 1,317 population controls. Thirteen percent of the cases and 11% of the controls had ever worked on night shifts (OR = 1.27 [95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.64]). Odds ratios were 1.35 [1.01-1.80] in women who worked on overnight shifts, 1.40 [1.01-1.92] in women who had worked at night for 4.5 or more years, and 1.43 [1.01-2.03] in those who worked less than three nights per week on average. The odds ratio was 1.95 [1.13-3.35] in women employed in night work for >4 years before their first full-term pregnancy, a period where mammary gland cells are incompletely differentiated and possibly more susceptible to circadian disruption effects. Our results support the hypothesis that night work plays a role in breast cancer, particularly in women who started working at night before first full-term pregnancy.

AB Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in pregnancy. The cause is multifactorial, including a decreased or transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and gastrointestinal motility disturbances.
   Aims: Evaluate the incidence of GERD in pregnancy and assess predictors and predisposing factors.
   Method: This is a secondary analysis of a survey of postpartum women regarding symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and GERD performed at a large tertiary care center. Patients rated heartburn frequency during pregnancy as either never, occasionally/sometimes, or frequently/always. Pregnancy outcomes and newborn information was collected. Categorical variables were compared by Fisher's exact test and continuous variables were compared by Anova or Kruskal-Wallis test. Multinominal logistic regression was also performed.
   Results: Information regarding 1000 mothers and 1025 newborns was reviewed. The majority of mothers were Caucasian (68.8%) with mean age 29 +/- 6.1 years. A total of 56.7% had GERD frequently/always; and 25.5% had none. GERD symptoms correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), BMI at delivery, maternal age, smoking and symptoms of SDB. There was no significant correlation between fetal weight and maternal weight gain with GERD symptoms. Symptoms were more frequent in white non-Hispanic women than in other racial groups.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that GERD symptoms correlate with pre-pregnancy BMI and BMI at delivery, but not with the amount of weight gain during pregnancy. Maternal age, smoking, race, and SDB are also associated with GERD. Interestingly, fetal weight/uterine size did not seem predictive of developing GERD in pregnancy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

ID COMPRESSION; ANTERIOR; VEIN
AB Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the morphology of the common iliac artery and vein (CIA&V) comparing right and left sides in females versus males. Pregnant women favour lying on one side at rest and during sleep. The reason for this may be due to the morphology and orientation between the CIA&V. Virtually all women during their pregnancy suffer from lower limb swelling. This study provides an anatomical explanation for the propensity to lie consistently on one side, for lower limb swelling, and offers prevention measures.
   Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted on anatomical texts, atlases, journals, and websites regarding the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA&V, lower limb oedema, and sleeping positions during pregnancy. Measurements from 15 dissected cadavers were conducted on the right and left CIA&V.
   Results: The literature search revealed very limited studies on the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA&V with no studies relating this orientation to lower limb oedema or sleeping positions during pregnancy. Cadaver dissection revealed a relatively direct anterior to posterior orientation left CIA&V and an oblique lateral to medial right CIA&V.
   Conclusions: This study suggests an explanation of why women lie on their left side when resting and sleeping during the third trimester due to the clinically relevant anatomy between the CIA&V. (Folia Morphol 2013; 72, 1:67-71)

AB The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a transgenerational prospective observational study investigating influences on health and development across the life course. It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of health, social and developmental outcomes. Recruitment sought to enrol pregnant women in the Bristol area of the UK during 1990-92; this was extended to include additional children eligible using the original enrolment definition up to the age of 18 years. The children from 14 541 pregnancies were recruited in 1990-92, increasing to 15 247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years. This cohort profile describes the index children of these pregnancies. Follow-up includes 59 questionnaires (4 weeks-18 years of age) and 9 clinical assessment visits (7-17 years of age). The resource comprises a wide range of phenotypic and environmental measures in addition to biological samples, genetic (DNA on 11 343 children, genome-wide data on 8365 children, complete genome sequencing on 2000 children) and epigenetic (methylation sampling on 1000 children) information and linkage to health and administrative records. Data access is described in this article and is currently set up as a supported access resource. To date, over 700 peer-reviewed articles have been published using ALSPAC data.

AB In developed countries, rising rates of union disruption have induced an increase in the share of people experiencing several fertile partnerships during their fertile life-span. However, from the large-scale 1999 French Family Survey, in the 1939-1954 birth cohorts it appears that completed fertility of repartnered men is slightly higher than that of never-separated men while repartnered women have fertility levels similar to those who remain in a first intact partnership. Following this observation, this article aims to study whether people, and especially women, have enough time to have children in the context of second union before they become limited by the "biological clock". Using a cure model, we find that once age-related sterility is controlled for, the decrease in risk of having children with age is not visible anymore up to age 40. This offers some evidence that people in their second partnership, especially women, are constrained in their childbearing by the decline in fecundity with age. Additionally, childless women seem to respond proactively to the decline in fecundity with age by accelerating childbearing.

DT Article

AB Objective: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep.
   Methods: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen.
   Results: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS >20 and 100% had a PSQI >5. Hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS.
   Conclusion: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy. Neurology (R) 2013; 80: 738-742

AB The Early Growth and Development Study is a prospective adoption study of birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted children recruited in two cohorts (N = 561 triads). The primary study aims are to examine how family, peer, and contextual processes affect children's adjustment, and to examine their interplay (mediation, moderation) with genetic influences. Participants were recruited through adoption agencies located throughout the United States following the birth of a child. Assessments are ongoing, in 9-month intervals until the child reaches 3 years of age and in 1-year intervals thereafter through age 9. Data collection includes the following primary constructs: child temperament, social behavior, school performance, mental health, and health; birth and adoptive parent personality characteristics, mental health, competence, stress, health, context, substance use, parenting, and marital relations; and pregnancy use of drugs and maternal stress during pregnancy. DNA and salivary cortisol samples have also been collected. Analyses have indicated evidence for genotype-environment interactions during early childhood. Study procedures, sample representativeness (including tests of potential confounds in the adoption design), and an overview of findings to date are summarized, and future plans are described.

AB Background: A safe and effective vaginal microbicide could substantially reduce HIV acquisition for women. Consistent gel use is, however, of great importance to ensure continued protection against HIV infection, even with a safe and effective microbicide. We assessed the long-term correlates of consistent gel use in the MDP 301 clinical trial among HIV-negative women in sero-discordant couples in south-west Uganda.
   Methods: HIV-negative women living with an HIV-infected partner were enrolled between 2005 and 2008, in a three-arm phase III microbicide trial and randomized to 2% PRO2000, 0.5% PRO2000 or placebo gel arms. Follow-up visits continued up to September 2009. The 2% arm was stopped early due to futility and the 229 women enrolled in this arm were excluded from this analysis. Data were analyzed on 544 women on the 0.5% and placebo arms who completed at least 52 weeks of follow-up, sero-converted or became pregnant before 52 weeks. Consistent gel use was defined as satisfying all of the following three conditions: (i) reported gel use at the last sex act for at least 92% of the 26 scheduled visits or at least 92% of the visits attended if fewer than 26; (ii) at least one used applicator returned for each visit for which gel use was reported at the last sex act; (iii) attended at least 13 visits (unless the woman sero-converted or became pregnant during follow-up). Logistic regression models were fitted to investigate factors associated with consistent gel use.
   Results: Of the 544 women, 473 (86.9%) were followed for at least 52 weeks, 29 (5.3%) sero-converted and 42 (7.7%) became pregnant before their week 52 visit. Consistent gel use was reported by 67.8%. Women aged 25 to 34 years and those aged 35 years or older were both more than twice as likely to have reported consistently using gel compared to women aged 17 to 24 years. Living in a household with three or more rooms used for sleeping compared to one room was associated with a twofold increase in consistent gel use.
   Conclusion: In rural Uganda younger women and women in houses with less space are likely to require additional support to achieve consistent microbicide gel use.

AB Background: Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not always been assessed.
   Aims: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy.
   Study design: Exposed and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and neurobehavioral factors and exposure status.
   Subjects: 67 infants (61 controls and 6 exposed to SRIs).
   Outcome measures: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale, APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference.
   Results: Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development, lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to unexposed infants.
   Conclusion: Results of this study show differences in autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness. Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and unexposed infants of depressed mothers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Depression is prevalent among women of childbearing age and is frequently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). As some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Flx), can cross the placenta, it is possible that the neurodevelopment of the fetus may be affected, leading to altered behavior in adulthood.
   In this study, we examined the effects of perinatal Flx exposure on the subsequent expression of circadian rhythms in adult mice.
   Dams were treated with 25 mg/kg/day Flx in their drinking water from embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 12. Circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed in the offspring starting at 6 weeks of age.
   We found that perinatal Flx exposure led to larger light-induced phase advances (1.19 +/- 0.51 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.25 h), smaller phase advances to the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the mid-subjective day (0.44 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.17 h), and a shorter free-running period in constant darkness (23.47 +/- 0.13 vs. 23.64 +/- 0.13 h).
   These results suggest that perinatal exposure to SSRIs may have consequences for the functioning of the circadian system later in life.

Few studies have attempted to quantify either changes in the association between risk factors and BMI or the contribution of changes in the risk factors to increases in BMI over a generation. What this study adds The magnitude of the association between most risk factors and children's BMIs has not changed over a 29-year period. Increases in the population level of mothers body mass index (BMI) explains 20% of the increase in children's BMI whereas the smaller increase in fathers BMI contributes only 6%. Maternal smoking, despite the decrease in prevalence, contributes 17%. Objective Using two cohorts born 29 years apart in Dunedin, New Zealand we aim to examine changes in risk factors and their associations with body mass index (BMI) at ages 3 and 7 years, and estimate their contribution to the secular changes in BMI at age 7 years. Methods Birth weight and anthropometric measures at ages 3, 5 and 7 years were obtained for 974 participants in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS), born in 19721973, and 241 in the Family Lifestyle, Activity, Movement and Eating Study (FLAME), born in 20012002. Information about maternal age, education and smoking in pregnancy, as well as breastfeeding, children's television time and time in bed, was obtained by questionnaire. Results The increase in BMI over the 29-year period was 0.84 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06) kg?m-2 at age 7. A 1-unit difference in the mother's BMI was associated with a 0.06 (0.03, 0.08) kg?m-2 difference in offspring in both studies; the 3.4 (2.8, 4.0) kg?m-2 increase in the mothers BMIs accounts for a change of 0.19?kg?m-2 in the children's BMI. The much smaller generational increase in fathers BMI (0.7?kg?m-2) correspondingly had a more limited effect on change in child BMI over time (0.06?kg?m-2). Although smoking in pregnancy decreased by 15% (8, 21) its association with BMI increased from 0.20 (-0.01, 0.42) in the DMHDS cohort to 1.24 (0.76, 1.71) kg?m-2 in the FLAME cohort, contributing 0.18?kg?m-2 to the increase in children's BMI. Conclusions Societal factors such as higher maternal BMI and smoking in pregnancy contribute most to the secular increase in BMI, with changes in behavioural factors, including sleep and television viewing, having little effect in this setting.

TI Antenatal Mental Health and Retinal Vascular Caliber in Pregnant Women
SO TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE antenatal mental health; retinal vascular caliber; pregnancy; antenatal
   depression; poor sleep quality
AB Purpose: Depression, anxiety, and poor sleep are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between negative emotion and retinal microvascular changes among adults, yet no study has been done in pregnant women so far. This study aims to examine the association of antenatal mental health and retinal vascular caliber among Asian pregnant women.
   Methods: Nine hundred and fifty two Asian pregnant women aged 18 to 46 years were included in this study, who were recruited from two Singapore cohort studies, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study and the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) study conducted from 2009 onwards. A total of 835 Asian pregnant women underwent retinal photography at 26 weeks follow up, of whom 800 had gradable photographs. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality were assessed with self-administered questionnaires.
   Results: In multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, ethnicity, household income, pregnancy outcome history, means of conception, hypertension history, diabetes history, cigarette smoking history, mean arterial blood pressure, body mass index, and spherical equivalent, each standard deviation (SD) increase in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (4.49 scores) and in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (2.90 scores) was associated with a 0.80 mu m (P = 0.03) and a 1.22 mu m (P = 0.01) widening in retinal arteriolar caliber, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates relationships of antenatal depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality with retinal arteriolar widening in pregnant women.
   Translational Relevance: We speculate that this might possibly indicate an effect of antenatal depression and poor sleep on the microcirculation during pregnancy.

AB Background: The modern phenomenon of delayed parenthood applies not only to women but also to men, but less is known about what characterises men who are expecting their first child at an advanced age. This study investigates the sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviour, health problems, social relationships and timing of pregnancy in older first-time fathers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 14 832 men who were expecting their first child, based on data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) carried out by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Data were collected in 2005-2008 by means of a questionnaire in gestational week 17-18 of their partner's pregnancy, and from the Norwegian Medical Birth Register. The distribution of background variables was investigated across the age span of 25 years and above. Men of advanced age (35-39 years) and very advanced age (40 years or more) were compared with men aged 25-34 years by means of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
   Results: The following factors were found to be associated with having the first child at an advanced or very advanced age: being unmarried or non-cohabitant, negative health behaviour (overweight, obesity, smoking, frequent alcohol intake), physical and mental health problems (lower back pain, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, sleeping problems, previous depressive symptoms), few social contacts and dissatisfaction with partner relationship. There were mixed associations for socioeconomic status: several proxy measures of high socioeconomic status (e. g. income >65 000 (sic), self-employment) were associated with having the first child at an advanced or very advanced age, as were several other proxy measures of low socioeconomic status (e. g. unemployment, low level of education, immigrant background). The odds of the child being conceived after in vitro fertilisation were threefold in men aged 34-39 and fourfold from 40 years and above.
   Conclusions: Men who expect their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age constitute a socioeconomically heterogeneous group with more health problems and more risky health behaviour than younger men. Since older men often have their first child with a woman of advanced age, in whom similar characteristics have been reported, their combined risk of adverse perinatal outcomes needs further attention by clinicians and researchers.

AB According to the Barker hypothesis, the period of pregnancy and the intrauterine environment are crucial to the tendency to develop diseases like hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, metabolic disorders, pulmonary, renal and mental illnesses. The external environment affects the development of a particular phenotype suitable for an environment with characteristics that closely resemble intrauterine conditions. If the extra-uterine environment differs greatly from the intra-uterine one, the fetus is more prone to develop disease. Subsequent studies have shown that maternal diseases like depression and anxiety, epilepsy, asthma, anemia and metabolic disorders, like diabetes, are able to determine alterations in growth and fetal development. Similarly, the maternal lifestyle, particularly diet, exercise and smoking during pregnancy, have an important role in determining the risk to develop diseases that manifest themselves both during childhood and particularly in adulthood. Finally, there are abundant potential sources of pollutants, both indoor and outdoor, in the environment in which the child lives, which can contribute to an increased probability to the development of several diseases and that in some cases could be easily avoided.

AB Background: A huge discrepancy was reported between ownership versus utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs). To acquire the benefits of ITNs, households need to use and not merely own them. The objective of this study was to characterize the pattern of, and assess factors related to ITN use in one village in south Ethiopia.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study involving 8,121 residents (in 1,388 households) was carried out from April 2009 to April 2011 (101 weeks). Every week, individuals were asked whether they slept under an ITN the night before the interview. Descriptive statistics was used to report the availability and use of ITN. A negative, binomial, probability, distribution model was fitted to find out significant predictors of ITN use. Reasons for not using ITN were summarized.
   Results: The total number of ITNs available at the beginning of the study was 1,631 (1.68 ITNs per household). On week 48, 3,099 new ITNs (PermaNet2.0) were distributed freely (2.3 ITNs per household). The number of households who received at least one new ITN was 1,309 (98.4%). The percentage of children <5 years and pregnant women not using ITNs exceeded that of other adults. The mean (range; SD) ITN use fraction before and after mass distribution was 0.20 (0.15-0.27; 0.03) and 0.62 (0.47-0.69; 0.04), respectively. Before mass ITN distribution, the most frequent reason for not using ITN was having worn out bed nets (most complained the bed nets were torn by rats); and after mass ITN distribution, it was lack of convenient space to hang more than one ITN. Males, younger age groups (mainly 15-24 years) and those living away from the vector-breeding site were less likely to use ITN.
   Conclusions: The ITN use fraction reached to a maximum of 69% despite near universal coverage (98.4%) was achieved. Gender, age differences and distance from vector breeding site were associated with ITN use. Strategies may need to be designed addressing disproportions in ITN use, lack of convenient space to hang more than one ITN (for those receiving more than one), and measures to prolong usable life of ITNs.

DE Checklist; Inventory; Pregnancy symptoms; Questionnaire; Survey
ID BACK-PAIN; NAUSEA; INCONTINENCE; QUALITY; WOMEN
AB Background: Physical symptoms are common in pregnancy and are predominantly associated with normal physiological changes. These symptoms have a social and economic cost, leading to absenteeism from work and additional medical interventions. There is currently no simple method for identifying common pregnancy related problems in the antenatal period. A validated tool, for use by pregnancy care providers would be useful. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory for use by health professionals.
   Methods: A list of symptoms was generated via expert consultation with health professionals. Focus groups were conducted with pregnant women. The inventory was tested for face validity and piloted for readability and comprehension. For test-re-test reliability, the tool was administered to the same women 2 to 3 days apart. Finally, midwives trialled the inventory for 1 month and rated its usefulness on a 10cm visual analogue scale (VAS).
   Results: A 41-item Likert inventory assessing how often symptoms occurred and what effect they had, was developed. Individual item test re-test reliability was between .51 to 1, the majority (34 items) scoring >= 0.70. The top four "often" reported symptoms were urinary frequency (52.2%), tiredness (45.5%), poor sleep (27.5%) and back pain (19.5%). Among the women surveyed, 16.2% claimed to sometimes or often be incontinent. Referrals to the incontinence nurse increased > 8 fold during the study period.
   Conclusions: The PSI provides a comprehensive inventory of pregnancy related symptoms, with a mechanism for assessing their effect on function. It was robustly developed, with good test re-test reliability, face validity, comprehension and readability. This provides a validated tool for assessing the impact of interventions in pregnancy.

AB Disrupting maternal circadian rhythms through exposure to chronic phase shifts of the photoperiod has lifelong consequences for the metabolic homeostasis of the fetus, such that offspring develop increased adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia and poor glucose and insulin tolerance. In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by which these poor metabolic outcomes arise, we investigated the impact of chronic phase shifts (CPS) on maternal and fetal hormonal, metabolic and circadian rhythms. We assessed weight gain and food consumption of dams exposed to either CPS or control lighting conditions throughout gestation. At day 20, dams were assessed for plasma hormone and metabolite concentrations and glucose and insulin tolerance. Additionally, the expression of a range of circadian and metabolic genes was assessed in maternal, placental and fetal tissue. Control and CPS dams consumed the same amount of food, yet CPS dams gained 70% less weight during the first week of gestation. At day 20, CPS dams had reduced retroperitoneal fat pad weight (-15%), and time-of-day dependent decreases in liver weight, whereas fetal and placental weight was not affected. Melatonin secretion was not altered, yet the timing of corticosterone, leptin, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations were profoundly disrupted. The expression of gluconeogenic and circadian clock genes in maternal and fetal liver became either arrhythmic or were in antiphase to the controls. These results demonstrate that disruptions of the photoperiod can severely disrupt normal circadian profiles of plasma hormones and metabolites, as well as gene expression in maternal and fetal tissues. Disruptions in the timing of food consumption and the downstream metabolic processes required to utilise that food, may lead to reduced efficiency of growth such that maternal weight gain is reduced during early embryonic development. It is these perturbations that may contribute to the programming of poor metabolic homeostasis in the offspring.

AB Background: Exhaustion and fatigue are commonly experienced by parents during the post-partum period, and can have implications for daily functioning, mental health and parenting practices. There is a need for the development of effective interventions to assist parents with the management of fatigue. This paper outlines the procedure for a randomised controlled study which aims to test the efficacy of Wide Awake Parenting, a program for the management of fatigue in the postnatal period.
   Methods/design: Parents with an infant less than 6 months of age, and from seven Local Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia were invited to participate in this study. Parents were randomised to receive the Wide Awake Parenting program (intervention groups) or usual care (control group) offered by health services. The Wide Awake Parenting program provides parents with psycho-education and information about fatigue, and strategies to reduce its effects either via a self-directed method, or professionally led with a home visit and telephone support. Baseline data will be collected prior to randomisation, and further data will be collected at 2- and 6-weeks post intervention.
   Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial of a program which compares the efficacy of a self-management approach and health professional assistance for the management of fatigue in the early post-partum period. If effective, it could offer an important, universal public health management approach to this common health concern.

AB Background: Pregnant women living in an area of stable malaria transmission such as Lagos, Nigeria, have been identified as being at an increased risk of the effects of malaria infection. In this area, most of the infections are asymptomatic which means they are overlooked and untreated much to the detriment of the mother and her foetus. The reality of scaled-up malaria interventions with long-lasting insecticide treated nets, vector control, artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria pregnancy (IPTp) using sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) is that it is also essential to determine the risk factors at play in these kinds of circumstances. This study was aimed at identifying the factors associated with risk of malaria infection in pregnant women in Lagos, Southwest Nigeria.
   Methods: Demographic information and malaria prevention practices of the pregnant women studied were captured using structured questionnaire. Microscopy was used to establish malaria infection, species identification and parasite density. Relative risk and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to compare factors associated with malaria in pregnant women.
   Results: Malaria microscopy details, demographic information and malaria prevention practices of the pregnant women were obtained using a structured questionnaire. The prevalence of malaria using peripheral blood from 1,084 pregnant women that participated in the study was 7.7%. Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) was seen in 95.2% of the cases as either mixed infection with P. malariae (3.6%) or as a mono infection (91.6%). Malaria preventive practices associated with a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the malaria infection was the use of insecticide sprays (RR = 0.36, 95 C.I. 0.24-0.54), and the combined use of insecticide spray and insecticide-treated nets (ITN) (RR = 6.53, 95% C.I. 0.92-46.33). Sleeping under ITN alone (RR = 1.07, 95% C.I. 0.55-2.09) was not associated with significant reduction in malaria infection among the study participants with malaria parasitaemia. Young maternal age (<20years) (RR = 2.86, 95% C.I. 1.48 - 5.50), but not primigravidity (RR = 1.36, 95% C.I. 0.90-2.05), was associated with an increased risk of malaria infection during pregnancy. After a multivariate logistic regression, young maternal age (OR = 2.61, 95% C.I. 1.13 - 6.03) and the use of insecticide spray (OR = 0.38, 95% C.I. 0.24-0.63) were associated with an increase and a reduction in malaria infection, respectively.
   Conclusion: Malaria prevalence was low among the pregnant women studied. Young maternal age and non-usage of insecticidal spray were the main factors associated with an increased risk of malaria infection among pregnant women in Lagos, Nigeria.

AB BACKGROUND: This study assessed potential early-life factors and their interrelationships with obesity among young Canadian children.
   METHODS: Data from a nationally representative sample of children aged 6 to 11 years in the Canadian Health Measures Survey were analyzed. The associations of perinatal and early childhood behaviours and socio-economic factors with overweight or obesity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PARFs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models.
   RESULTS: Of 968 term-born children, 21% were overweight and another 13% were obese. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.15) was positively associated with obesity. This association was mediated by birth weight (suppression effect); once controlled, the strength of the association between smoking and child obesity increased by 12%. Birth weight per 100 g (1.05; 1.005-1.09) was significantly associated with obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (0.44; 0.31-0.61), adequate sleep hours (0.39; 0.16-0.94) and being physically active (0.50; 0.26-0.93) were found to be protective. Breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, significantly reduced obesity risk among children whose mothers never smoked in pregnancy. PARFs indicated that 24.4%, 11.5%, 11.3% and 6.0% prevalent cases of child obesity might be prevented by exclusive breastfeeding, smoking cessation during pregnancy, adequate sleep during childhood, and avoiding high birth weight, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identified multiple perinatal and childhood factors associated with obesity in young Canadian children. Effective prevention strategies targeting four modifiable maternal and child risk factors may reduce childhood obesity by up to 54% in Canada.

AB Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem in developing countries. We investigated possible risk factors for cervical cancer in rural areas of Wuhan China using a matched case-control study with 33 women diagnosed with cervical cancer and 132 healthy women selected from the same area as matched controls. A questionnaire, which included questions about general demography conditions, environmental and genetic factors, the first sexual intercourse, first marriage age, age at first pregnancy, pregnancy first child's age, female personal health history, social psychological factors, dietary habits, smoking and alcohol status and other living habits was presented to all participants. At the same time, HPV infection of every participant was examined in laboratory testing. Results showed HPV infection (P<0.000, OR=23.4) and pregnancy first child's age (P<0.000, OR=13.1) to be risk factors for cervical cancer. Menopause (P=0.003, OR=0.073) was a protective factor against cervical cancer. However, there was no indication of associations of environmental (drinking water, insecticide, disinfectant) genetic (cancer family history), or life-style factors (smoking status, alcohol status, physical training, sleep quality), including dietary habits (intake of fruit and vegetable, meat, fried food, bean products and pickled food) or social psychological factors with cervical cancer. The results suggest that the risk of cervical cancer in Chinese rural women may be associated with HPV infection, menopause and the pregnancy first child's age.

AB OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the effect of chronic melatonin treatment on human reproductive function. We report here on the effect of 10 months treatment with a controlled-release melatonin preparation (Circadin (R), 2 mg) on spermatogenesis and gonadotropic hormone status in a pinealectomised patient whose melatonin secretion was abolished.
   METHODS: Semen analysis, hormone (Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), inhibin B, prolactin, testosterone and estradiol) and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHB G) concentrations were determined before and at the end of 4 and 10 months of, treatment.
   RESULTS: At the end of treatment, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, prolactin and inhibin B levels did not display significant variation with time, whereas FSH and LH levels showed a tendency to a decrease, but remained in the normal range. Sperm concentration and total spermatozoa count dropped below the lower limit of the reference range during melatonin treatment, whereas motility and normal form percentages remained in the normal range. Fertility was preserved, since the patient's wife became pregnant during month 10 of melatonin treatment and gave birth to a healthy female baby.
   CONCLUSIONS: this isolated clinical observation shows that more investigations in large patient series are needed to document possible side-effects of melatonin administration on male reproductive function. One should therefore be cautious about melatonin prescription for circadian rhythm sleep disorders in young males.

DE restless legs syndrome; pregnancy; women; prevalence
ID GENERAL-POPULATION; RISK-FACTOR; QUESTIONNAIRE; WOMEN
AB BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological disorder which predominantly affects women. Pregnancy is one of the most common conditions leading to secondary RLS. Severe symptoms of RLS may lead to complications of pregnancy and/or labor. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in pregnant women.
   METHODS: Women in the third trimester of gravidity filled out a simple questionnaire based on the official diagnostic criteria for RLS. Positive responders were interviewed in order to further characterize their symptoms. Afterwards information on changes in frequency and/or intensity of the symptoms after delivery was obtained by a telephone follow-up. All data were statistically analysed.
   RESULTS: A total of 300 questionnaires were completed. All 94 RLS-positives met the four diagnostic criteria (31.33%). There was no difference in age, body mass index, or the number of previous pregnancies between RLS-positives and RLS-negatives, but weight gain during pregnancy was significantly higher in RLS-positives. More than 30% of positives had clinically significant symptoms, and 50% reported sleep disturbances. Almost 75% of the cases of RLS were secondary, i.e., symptoms occurred only during pregnancy (with a peak in the third trimester). More complications of pregnancy or labor occurred in women with RLS, but this was only marginally significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the relatively high prevalence of RLS in pregnant women compared with the general population. Although almost three-fourths of the symptoms were only transient throughout pregnancy, the impact of the severe symptoms and sleep deprivation on the course of pregnancy and delivery was not negligible. Early detection and adequate treatment of severe RLS are necessary to prevent maternal discomfort and possible health risks. The questionnaire method is a simple, reliable diagnostic tool.

AB Objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is related with cardiovascular risk factors. Non-dipping blood pressure pattern and high mean platelet volume, which is an indicator of increased platelet activation, are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and inortality. The aim of our study is to determine circadian variation of blood pressure and to study the impact of hematological indices on blood pressure dipping and non-dipping patterns in patient with GDM.
   Material and methods: A total of 42 patients who were diagnosed with GDM and 33 patients with healthy pregnancies were included into the study. Patients' blood pressures were monitored and were grouped due to their blood pressure circadian pattern. If the blood pressure while sleeping decreased more than 10% from the blood pressure while awake, the patient was classified as a "dipper". If the decrease was less than 10%. the patient was classified as a "non-dipper". Biochemical and hematological parameters were measured and clinical features were recorded for all study groups.
   Results: Ambulatory blood pressures monitoring of two groups revealed that average systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as the day-phase diastolic and night-phase systolic and diastolic blood pressures of GDM patients were significantly increased than those of the control group. Besides, control patients had a more significant decrease in night-phase systolic and diastolic blood pressures than GDM patients (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between hematological indices and dipping status, except for mean platelet volume (MPV). MPV in non-dippers was significantly higher than dippers one (p<0.001). Step-wise multivariate linear regression demonstrated that MPV and GDM can be used as independent predictors of non-dipping status.
   Conclusion: According to our results the circadian variation of blood pressure is impaired and MPV is increased in GDM patients. Increasing in MPV is associated with non-dipping status of blood pressure. It is possible that non-dipping status and increased MPV levels may be additional risk factors for increased cardiovascular disease events in gestational diabetes patients.

AB Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects not only mothers, but also entire families. Postpartum follow-up should address emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and child-related factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother's lack of satisfaction with the baby's sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD.

AB Objective: The population-based University of Washington Twin Registry (UWTR) was used to examine (1) genetic influences on chronobiology and (2) whether these genetic factors influence alcohol-use phenotypes.
   Methods: We used a reduced Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) to survey UWTR participants for diurnal preference. Frequency and quantity of alcohol use, as well as binge drinking (6+drinks per occasion), were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale. Both diurnal preference and alcohol use were self-reported. Twin data were analyzed by using structural equation models.
   Results: The sample consisted of 2,945 participants (mean age = 36.4 years), including 1,127 same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs and 691 individual twins. The rMEQ range was 4-25, with a mean score of 15.3 (SD 4.0). Diurnal "morning types" comprised 30.7% (N = 903) of participants, while 17.4% (N = 513) were "evening types." Regarding alcohol use, 21.2% (N = 624) reported never drinking. Among drinkers, 35.7% (N = 829) reported = 3 drinks per occasion and 48.1% (N = 1,116) reported at least one instance of binge drinking. Genetic influences accounted for 37% of the variance in diurnal preference, with the remaining 63% due to non-shared environmental influences. Genetic propensities toward diurnal eveningness were significantly associated with increased alcohol quantity (beta = -0.17; SE = 0.05, p < 0.001) and increased binge drinking (beta = -0.19; SE = 0.04, p < 0.001), but not with frequency of alcohol use. Environmental paths between diurnal preference and alcohol use phenotypes were not significant.
   Conclusions: Genetic influences on diurnal preference confer elevated risk for problematic alcohol use, including increased quantity and binge drinking. Differences in circadian rhythm may be an important and understudied pathway of risk for genetic influences on alcohol use.

   FACTORS
AB Sleep disturbances in the general population are associated with elevated blood pressure. This may be due to several mechanisms, including sympathetic activation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbance. Elevated blood pressure in pregnancy can have devastating effects on both maternal and fetal health and is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia and poor delivery outcomes. Preliminary evidence suggests that mechanisms linking sleep and blood pressure in the general population may also hold in the pregnant population. However, the effects of disturbed sleep on physiologic mechanisms that may directly influence blood pressure in pregnancy have not been well studied. The role that sleep disturbance plays in gestational blood pressure elevation and its subsequent consequences warrant further investigation. This review evaluates the current literature on sleep disturbance and elevated blood pressure in pregnancy and proposes possible treatment interventions.

AB Background: The aetiology of uremic restless legs syndrome (RLS) remains unclear. Our research investigated whether an elevated plasma concentration of the excitatory amino acid homocysteine might be associated with RLS occurrence in patients with chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis. Methods: Total plasma homocysteine as well as creatinine, urea, folate, parathyroid hormone, hemoglobin, iron, ferritin, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and albumin levels were compared between 26 RLS-affected (RLSpos) and 26 non-affected (RLSneg) patients on chronic hemodialysis. We further compared subjective sleep quality between RLSpos and RLSneg patients using the Pittsburgh-Sleep-Quality-Index and investigated possible relationships between laboratory parameters and sleep quality. Results: Taking individual albumin concentrations into account, a significant positive correlation between total plasma homocysteine and RLS occurrence was observed (r= 0.246; p=0.045). Sleep quality was significantly more reduced in RLSpos compared to RLSneg patients and RLS severity correlated positively with impairment of sleep quality. Bad sleep quality in all patients was associated with higher concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Conclusion: Our results suggest a possible aetiological role of homocysteine in uremic RLS. They confirm that uremic RLS is an important factor causing sleep impairment in patients on hemodialysis. Higher parathyroid hormone levels might also be associated with bad sleep quality in these patients. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background
   Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for their newborns during this time.
   Objectives
   The primary objective was to assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered to an individual or group related to infant general health or care and parent-infant relationships.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013).
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post-birth related to the health or care of an infant or parent-infant relationships.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors (JB, CTB) assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports.
   Main results
   Of the 27 trials (3949 mothers and 579 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) reported useable data. Educational interventions included: five on infant sleep enhancement, 12 on infant behaviour, three on general post-birth health, three on general infant care, and four on infant safety. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only 13 were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these 13 meta-analyses, only four were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education about sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more night-time minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours at six weeks of age (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. However, it had no significant effect on the mean difference in minutes of crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age. Education related to infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91).
   Authors' conclusions
   The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education related to sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep but appears to have no effect on infant crying time. Education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB Night shift work has been thought to play a role in the etiology of chronic diseases through a disruption of the circadian rhythm, decreased synthesis of melatonin and sleep deprivation. Our aim was to review the epidemiological studies on the association between night shift work and some pathologies in nurses and midwives. We reviewed publications available in the MEDLINE database and published before June 2012, describing the cross-sectional (almost two thirds of all papers) and cohort studies. In total, we identified 26 original papers, including 5 epidemiological studies addressing diseases or disorders of the digestive system, 3-metabolic syndrome, 2-type 2 diabetes, 9-cardiovascular diseases and (CVD risk factors, 5-obesity/overweight, 2-menstrual disorders and 3-poor pregnancy outcomes. The analysis of the literature indicates that night shift work of nurses and midwives is most strongly associated with a higher risk ofobesity/overweight. In each of the five studies, which we identified this association was observed (confirmed by the statistical significance of the results), also after adjustment for confounders. The results for type 2 diabetes and disorders of the menstrual cycle are also suggestive. Epidemiological data on the other disorders or pathologies discussed in this article seem to be less certain - their results are inconsistent or their number is too small to draw definite conclusions. Further epidemiological studies of nurses and midwives working on night shifts and prospective observations in particular are recommended to find out whether potential association between the night work and discussed health issues is causal.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the effect of artificially extended daylight applied during pregnancy on reproductive performance in farmed mink. The material consisted of 536 female Black (or "short NAP") mink aged 2 years. To analyse the reproductive performance, we selected females mated twice during the period 13 to 17 March. Energy-saving bulbs of 11 watts each (equivalent to traditional 60-watt bulbs) were placed above the cages of the females. The experiment involved two groups of females: the control group (n = 258) were females kept under natural daylight throughout pregnancy; the females of the treatment group (n = 278) were additionally subjected to extended photoperiod - up to 16 hours of light per day, applied from 20 March to 15 April. Selected reproduction indicators were analysed among the groups. The extended daylight applied during pregnancy of mink positively influenced many of the analysed indices. The duration of diapause and related total length of gestation decreased, the litter size - both at birth and at weaning - significantly increased. Pre-weaning mortality of young and the proportion of non-breeding females slightly decreased as a result of the treatment, which from the practical point of view might be seen as a beneficial effect; however, these parameters are shaped by other factors than photoperiod. The whelping season was both commenced and completed earlier among females subjected to extra light during pregnancy, which improved the organization of work on the farm. Artificial illumination of pregnant mink in Poland's climate can be applied with great success and introducing this treatment to the mink breeding technology on a permanent basis should be seriously considered.

AB distressing sensorimotor disorder of unknown etiology. While the epidemiology of RLS has been examined in several North American and European studies, research on RLS and RLS burden in poor, rural populations, including those residing in Appalachia, remains sparse. In this study, we investigated RLS prevalence in an Appalachian primary care population and examined the association of RLS to demographic factors, lifestyle characteristics, sleep quality, and mood disorders.
   Methods: Participants of this anonymous survey study were community-dwelling adults aged >= 18 years visiting one of 4 West Virginia primary care clinics. Data gathered included detailed information on sleep patterns, demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and health/medical history; the survey also included questions specific to RLS diagnosis and severity. Response rates were excellent, with 68% of eligible adults contacted returning completed surveys (N = 1,424/2,087). Pregnant women (N = 65) and those with missing data on key variables (N = 142) were excluded from the analyses.
   Results: Of the 1,217 participants included in the final analytic sample, 19.6% (18.2% with symptoms at least once/month) met the 4 IRLSSG diagnostic criteria in the absence of positional discomfort or leg cramps; 14.5% reported RLS symptoms at least once/week and 10.1% indicated symptoms >= 3x/week. Excluding respondents with diabetes, kidney disease, or anemiareduced these rates only slightly. Those with RLS were more likely to be older, female, lower income, unemployed, disabled, non-Hispanic white, and less likely to be college educated than those without RLS. Mood and sleep impairment were significantly elevated in those with RLS; after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle characteristics, health history, and other factors, those with RLS remained significantly more likely to indicate a history of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.6) and anxiety (OR = 1.6, CI 1.1, 2.2), to report sleep impairment both 4 (OR = 2.4, CI 1.6, 3.7) and 7 days/week (OR = 1.8, CI 1.3, 2.4), and a mean sleep duration < 5 h/night (OR = 1.7, CI 1.2, 2.3). These associations increased in both strength and magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (p's for trend = 0.01).
   Conclusions: Findings of this preliminary anonymous survey study suggest that RLS prevalence is high in this Appalachian primary care population and that RLS is associated with significant burden in terms of both mood and sleep impairment.

TI Determining the association between Turkish women's menopausal symptoms
   and their marital adjustment

DE Menopause; menopause symptoms; marital adjustment
ID DYADIC ADJUSTMENT; HOT FLASHES; ATTITUDES; COMMUNITY; QUALITY; SLEEP
AB Aim: To determine the association between women's menopausal symptoms and their marital adjustment.
   Materials and methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 263 Turkish women chosen using an improbable randomized sampling method. A questionnaire, the Menopause Symptom Rating Scale (MSRS), and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) were used to collect data. Percentage distributions, the t-test in independent groups, the one-way ANOVA test, Pearson correlation analysis, and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used in the evaluation of the data.
   Results: The mean of the overall MSRS score for women was 22.67 +/- 8.06 and the mean of the overall DAS score for women was 105.93 +/- 16.60. There was a significantly negative relationship between menopausal symptoms and marital adjustment (r: -0.357, P < 0.001), while the differences between MSRS total point averages according to women's age at marriage and total number of pregnancies were found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). According to the comparison of the subscale mean score and the overall mean score obtained from the MSRS and DAS based on how women entered menopause, the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The level of marital adjustment decreased in line with the increase in menopausal symptoms suffered by women. It was determined that women whose age at marriage was 20 and over, according to MSRS total point averages, suffered from menopausal symptoms less. It was seen that women who had 6 or more pregnancies had more menopausal complaints. Women who entered menopause due to surgery experienced more menopausal complaints than those who entered menopause naturally, and women who entered menopause due to surgery had a better level of marital adaptation.

AB Current research suggests that mood varies from season to season in some individuals, in conjunction with light-modulated alterations in chronobiologic indices such as melatonin and cortisol. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations in darkness on mood in depressed antepartum women, and to determine the relationship of seasonal mood variations to contemporaneous blood melatonin and cortisol measures; a secondary aim was to evaluate the influence of seasonal factors on measures of melancholic versus atypical depressive symptoms. We obtained measures of mood and overnight concentrations of plasma melatonin and serum cortisol in 19 depressed patients (DP) and 12 healthy control (HC) antepartum women, during on-going seasonal variations in daylight/darkness, in a cross-sectional design. Analyses of variance showed that in DP, but not HC, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD) scores were significantly higher in women tested during seasonally longer versus shorter nights. This exacerbation of depressive symptoms occurred when the dim light melatonin onset, the melatonin synthesis offset, and the time of maximum cortisol secretion (acrophase) were phase-advanced (temporally shifted earlier), and melatonin quantity was reduced, in DP but not HC. Serum cortisol increased across gestational weeks in both the HC and DP groups, which did not differ significantly in cortisol concentration. Nevertheless, serum cortisol concentration correlated positively with HRSD score in DP but not HC; notably, HC showed neither significant mood changes nor altered melatonin and cortisol timing or quantity in association with seasonal variations. These findings suggest that depression severity during pregnancy may become elevated in association with seasonally related phase advances in melatonin and cortisol timing and reduced melatonin quantity that occur in DP, but not HC. Thus, women who experience antepartum depression may be more susceptible than their nondepressed counterparts to phase alterations in melatonin and cortisol timing during seasonally longer nights. Interventions that phase delay melatonin and/or cortisol timing-for example, increased exposure to bright evening light-might serve as an effective intervention for antepartum depressions whose severity is increased during seasonally longer nights.

AB Background
   More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain (LBP) and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. Pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic or back pain in pregnancy.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Quality of the evidence for outcomes was assessed using the five criteria outlined by the GRADE Working Group.
   Main results
   We included 26 randomised trials examining 4093 pregnant women in this updated review. Eleven trials examined LBP (N = 1312), four examined pelvic pain (N = 661), and 11 trials examined lumbo-pelvic (LBP and pelvic) pain (N = 2120). Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to the results of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and unless noted, were compared to usual prenatal care.
   For LBP, there was low-quality evidence that in general, the addition of exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.53; six RCTs, N = 543), and disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.8(to -0.23; two RCTs, N = 146); and water-based exercise significantly reduced LBP-related sick leave (risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; one RCT, N = 241). Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested no significant difference in pain or function between two types of pelvic support belt, between osteopathic manipulation (OMT) and usual care or sham ultrasound (sham US). Very low-quality evidence suggested that a specially-designed pillow may relieve night pain better than a regular pillow.
   For pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced evening pain better than exercise; both were better than usual care. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that adding a rigid belt to exercise improved average pain but not function; acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture for improving evening pain and function, but not average pain; and evening pain relief was the same following either deep or superficial acupuncture.
   For lumbo-pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that an eight-to 20-week exercise program reduced the risk of women reporting lumbo-pelvic pain (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; four RCTs, N = 1344); but a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual care at preventing pelvic pain (one RCT, N = 257). Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced lumbo-pelvic-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, two RCTs, N = 1062), and improved function. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that OMT significantly reduced pain and improved function; either a multi-modal intervention that included manual therapy, exercise and education (MOM) or usual care significantly reduced disability, but only MOM improved pain and physical function; acupuncture improved pain and function more than usual care or physiotherapy; pain and function improved more when acupuncture was started at 26-rather than 20-weeks' gestation; and auricular (ear) acupuncture significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture.
   When reported, adverse events were minor and transient.
   Authors' conclusions
   Moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16-to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP.
   There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out.
   Physiotherapy, OMT, acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone. Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was started at 26-rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were small.
   There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture.
   Very low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time LBP.
   Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. Future research would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms.

AB There is evidence for the reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillation and reproduction, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with impaired menstrual functions and reduced fertility in women. However, only little information is available on the relationship between reproduction and chronotype. The aim of the present study is to better assess this relationship. The participants (aged 25 to 74 yrs) were selected randomly from the Finnish Population Information System. The data from 2672 female participants of the National FINRISK Survey 2007 were analyzed to test the associations between chronotype (morning, intermediate, or evening) and reproductive features. Of the participants, 139 (5.6%) were evening, 1217 (48.7%) intermediate, and 1145 (45.8%) morning chronotypes. Among the participants aged 25 to 54 yrs, the duration of menstrual cycle was longer among evening chronotypes (28.8 +/- 4.4 d) than among morning (27.7 +/- 2.6 d; p < 0.01) and intermediate (27.8 +/- 3.3 d; p < 0.05) chronotypes. Significant correlations were found between the higher morningness-eveningness scores (the more of morning chronotype) and the shorter durations of menstrual bleeding, both in the whole sample (p < 0.001) and after limiting the analyses to women younger than 55 yrs (p < 0.05). In multivariable analyses on the whole sample, as compared with morning chronotypes, intermediate chronotypes had a significantly longer duration of menstrual bleeding (B = 0.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.044 to 0.276; p < 0.01) as well as a higher odds for difficulties in getting pregnant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.464, 95% CI = 1.118 to 1.917; p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that chronotype is related to the reproductive function in women.

AB In mammals, clock-gene proteins are expressed in the neurons of hypot halamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and that of other CNS structures, in the muscles, visceral organs and vessels, thus forming circadian rhythms of many functions. Little is known about the factors of formation of the circadian mechanism at the prenatal period. In the rats, E20 stage is characterized by a high level of oxytocin and selective expression of the first protein of clock-genes PER1. The goal of present study was to check the suggestion on the positive feedback between PER1 and oxytocin at the prenatal period, as well as to elucidate a possible role of PER1 in the regulation of oxytocin and GABA interactions at the period of formation of the cerebral circadian mechanism of clock-genes. With aid of western-blotting, we analyzed the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of anterior hypothalamus homogenate from the pregnant females and rat embryos (E20). Retinol metabolites through their nuclear receptor RORa are known to be bound to promoters of oxytocin and per 1 genes. Next day after administration of retinol to the females, a rise in PER1 content was noted in their cytoplasm, whereas in their embryos PER1 content was elevated in the nucleus. In the embryo cytoplasm there was a significant rise in production of oxytocin receptors and a decrease in the level of enzymes of GABA synthesis (glutamate decarboxylases 67 and 65). The results indicate the oxytocin-and retinol-dependent increase in the PER1 expression and the subsequent change in the ratio of oxytocin and GABA efficiency at the prenatal stage of formation of the circadian clock-mechanism in the rat embryo anterior hypothalamus.

AB Objective: Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension (GH) have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and treatment for even marginal SDB may improve blood pressure control in women with GH. We assessed whether the application SDB treatment could improve blood pressure in women with GH.
   Methods: This was a single-center randomized study. Subjects underwent an unattended home-based diagnostic sleep study. The study was then repeated with subjects wearing one of two randomly assigned treatments: auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (auto-CPAP) or mandibular advancement device (MAD) + nasal strip. First morning blood pressure and blood for standard GH measures plus inflammatory markers were taken after each study. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and tolerance of assigned therapy.
   Results: Twenty-four women completed the protocol-13 in the MAD group and 11 in auto-CPAP. The overall rate of SDB was 38%. Auto-CPAP was more effective at treating SDB than MAD + nasal strip, although the women randomized to MAD + nasal strip reported the greater comfort with therapy. First morning blood pressure was not consistently improved with either therapy. When subjects were stratified according to those whose blood pressure increased or decreased with therapy, an association was suggested between blood pressure improvement and reduced levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated that 38% of women with GH had concurrent SDB. We did not find an improvement in blood pressure or inflammatory markers with a single night of either the auto-CPAP or MAD + nasal strip interventions. However important lessons from this study may guide future investigations in this area.

AB Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John's wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.

AB This paper describes the importance of diabetic retinopathy in the loss of visual function. We exposed the most important risk factors, such as diabetes duration, poor metabolic control, pregnancy, puberty, hypertension, poor control of blood lipids, renal disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. We describe the pathogenesis of the disease, small retinal vessel microangiopathies which produce extravasation, edema and ischemia phenomena. We put special emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its pathogenic importance.
   They are also described the main clinical symptoms as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard and soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), venous disorders, formation of new vessels and diabetic macular edema (the latter being the most common cause of vision loss).
   Finally we describe the latest diagnostic techniques and eye treatment, with special emphasis on obesity surgery importance as more important preventive factor to eliminate the predisposing and precipitating disease symptoms. (Nutr Hosp 2013; 28 (Supl. 2):53-56)

AB Data about circadian blood pressure (BP) in normotensive patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are lacking. Thus, we sought to compare dipper and nondipper circadian variation of BP profile between normotensive women complicated with GDM and normal pregnant women. Forty-two women with GDM and 33 normal uncomplicated pregnant women who met the entry criteria for the study were enrolled in the study. Twenty-four-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography to measure the left ventricle mass index and diastolic parameters were performed. Nocturnal blood pressure dipping was calculated as follows: (awake BP - sleep BP) x 100/awake BP. Patients with a nocturnal reduction in average daytime systolic BP and diastolic BP of less than 10% were classified as nondippers. Left ventricle mass index was higher in normotensive pregnant women with GDM group than in normal pregnant subjects (101.98 +/- 24 g/m(2) vs. 90.67 +/- 15 g/m(2), P < .018). Significant nocturnal systolic and diastolic nondippings were observed in GDM groups compared with normal subjects. From diastolic variables, the mitral E velocity and isovolumetric relaxation time were compatible with diastolic dysfunction relaxation abnormalities (P = .003 and P = .015, respectively) in nondipper group. From all confounding factors, only E velocity (P = .002) and diagnosis of GDM (P < .001) were predictive of nondipper circadian variation. This study shows that (i) circadian BP is impaired in normotensive pregnant subjects with GDM, (ii) the left ventricle mass index is higher in pregnant subjects with GDM than in normal pregnant subjects who despite a 24-hour BP are within normal limits, and (iii) in nocturnal nondipper group, the tendency to having diastolic relaxation abnormalities is noted.

TI Morning versus evening induction of labour for improving outcomes
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
LA English
DT Review
ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MATERNAL CIRCADIAN SYSTEM; DELIVERY; WOMEN
AB Background
   Induction of labour is a common intervention in obstetric practice. Traditionally, inmost hospitals induction of labour with medication starts early in the morning, with the start of the working day for the day shift. In human and animal studies spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm with a preference for start of labour in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous labour starts in the evening, the total duration of labour and delivery shortens and fewer obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one might assume that starting induction of labour in the evening, in harmony with the circadian rhythm of natural birth, is more beneficial for both mother and child.
   Objectives
   To assess whether induction of labour starting in the evening, coinciding with the endogenous circadian rhythm, improves the outcome of labour compared with induction of labour starting in the early morning, organised to coincide with office hours.
   Search methods
   We contacted the Trials Search Co-ordinator to search the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to 16 February 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 16 February 2012).
   Selection criteria
   We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We excluded trials that employed quasi-random methods of treatment allocation.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information.
   Main results
   The search resulted in 2693 articles that we screened on title and abstract for eligibility. Thirteen studies were selected for full text assessment. We included three randomised trials involving 1150 women. Two trials compared the administration of prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening in women with an unfavourable cervix, and one trial compared induction of labour in the morning versus the evening in women with a favourable cervix and/or ruptured membranes with intravenous oxytocin. Because of the different mechanism, we have reported results for these two comparisons separately.
   In the two trials comparing prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening there were few clinically significant differences between study groups for maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a statistically significant preference by women to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the morning.
   In the trial examining induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin, the number of neonatal admissions was statistically significantly increased in the group of women that started induction in the morning. This finding was unexpected, and while the trial authors offered some possible explanations for this, it is important that any future trials examine neonatal outcomes.
   Authors' conclusions
   Taking into account women's preferences that favoured administration of prostaglandins in the morning, we conclude that caregivers should preferably consider administering prostaglandins in the morning.
   There is no strong evidence that induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is more or less effective than induction in the morning. Consideration may be given to start induction of labour with oxytocin in the evening when indicated.

AB Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are major contributors to perinatal morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of gestational hypertension still relies on conventional clinic blood pressure (BP) measurements and thresholds of >= 140/90 mm Hg for systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) BP. However, the correlation between BP level and target organ damage, cardiovascular disease risk, and long-term prognosis is greater for ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) than clinic BP measurement. Accordingly, ABPM has been suggested as the logical approach to overcoming the low sensitivity and specificity of clinic BP measurements in pregnancy. With the use of ABPM, differing predictable BP patterns throughout gestation have been identified for clinically healthy and hypertensive pregnant women. In normotensive pregnancies, BP steadily decreases up to the middle of gestation and then increases up to the day of delivery. In contrast, women who develop gestational hypertension or preeclampsia show stable BP during the first half of pregnancy and a continuous linear BP increase thereafter until delivery. Epidemiologic studies have also consistently reported sex differences in the 24-h patterns of ambulatory BP and heart rate. Typically, men exhibit a lower heart rate and higher BP than women, the differences being larger for SBP than DBP. Additionally, as early as in the first trimester of gestation, statistically significant increased 24-h SBP and DBP means characterize women complicated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies. However, the normally lower BP in nongravid women as compared with men, additional decrease in BP during the second trimester of gestation in normotensive but not in hypertensive pregnant women, and significant differences in the 24-h BP pattern between healthy and complicated pregnancies at all gestational ages have not been taken into consideration when establishing reference BP thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy. Several studies reported that use of the 24-h BP mean is not a proper test for an individualized early diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy defined on the basis of cuff BP measurements, thus concluding that from such an awkward approach ABPM is not useful in pregnancy. The 24-h BP pattern that characterizes healthy pregnant women at all gestational ages suggests the use for diagnosis of a time-specified reference limit reflecting that mostly predictable BP variability. Once the time-varying threshold, given, for instance, by the upper limit of a tolerance interval, is available, the hyperbaric index (HBI), as a determinant of BP excess, can be calculated as the total area of any given subject's BP above the threshold. This tolerance-hyperbaric test, where diagnosis of gestational hypertension is based on the HBI calculated with reference to a time-specified tolerance limit, has been shown to provide high sensitivity and specificity for the early identification of subsequent hypertension in pregnancy, as well as a valuable approach for prediction of pregnancy outcome. ABPM during gestation, starting preferably at the time of the first obstetric check-up following positive confirmation of pregnancy, provides sensitive endpoints for use in early risk assessment and guide for establishing prophylactic or therapeutic intervention, and should thus be regarded as the required standard for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy.

AB Background/Aims:The aim of this longitudinal case-control study was to investigate variables associated with caries development from birth to 36 months. Methods: Children (n = 1,017) who were followed up every 6 months from birth to 36 months were grouped into those that developed caries by age 30 and 36 months, respectively, and compared with children without caries. Results: By 30 months (n = 608) there were 24 children (4%) who had caries and an additional 23 developed first caries at 36 months (n = 552), giving a total prevalence of 47 children with caries (9%) at 36 months. Children who showed caries by 30 months were more likely to be nnutans streptococci (MS) colonised by 18 months (p = 0.001) compared to those who developed caries at 36 months, and showed the following variables: MS counts of >10(5) CFU/ml at 12 months (p = 0.005), missing enamel (p = 0.001), sugar in pacifier at 18 months (p = 0.02), child sleeping next to mother at 6, 18 and 24 months (p = 0.001 to p = 0.02), and exposure to household cigarette smoke at 24 months (p = 0.02). Caries at 36 months was associated with pregnancy problems (p = 0.024), mother having dental cavitations (p = 0.001) and MS presence at 36 months (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 0.1, p = 0.01 for counts <10(5) CFU/ml). Caries at both 30 and 36 months was associated with MS presence at 18 months (AOR = 6.3, p = 0.005 and AOR = 4.9, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Children who developed caries by 30 months are colonised by MS at younger ages and with higher MS counts compared with children who develop caries at 36 months. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

AB Air travel is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. The average risk in all travellers is not particularly high, but high-risk groups have been identified. One such high risk group could be pregnant women but no data are available on the exact magnitude of their risk. In this review we use results from studies performed in air travellers and pregnant women separately to estimate the risk of the combination, which leads to an estimated risk of 0.03-0.1%. Until real data are available, physicians will need to decide on a case-to-case basis how to prevent thrombosis in these women. In most passengers, prevention can be limited to encouraging exercise, and avoid prolonged immobilization through sleeping or taking a window seat. Women perceived to be at high risk (history of venous thrombosis, known thrombophilia or other risk factors for thrombosis) may benefit from a short period of LMWH therapy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB PURPOSE: To comparatively study the efficacy and maternal and fetal side-effects of two doses of bupivacaine associated with morphine and clonidine, administered by the subarachnoid route for cesarean section.
   METHODS: The study included 66 pregnant women at term, distributed into two groups. GI: bupivacaine 8.0 mg (1.6mL) + clonidine 75 mu g (0.5mL) + morphine 100 mu g (1.0mL) and GII: bupivacaine 10mg (2.0mL) + clonidine 75 mu g (0.5mL) + morphine 100 mu g (1.0mL). The following parameters were assessed: onset and maximum level of sensory block; quality of intraoperative and postoperative analgesia; degree and duration of motor block; maternal repercussions and Apgar score.
   RESULTS: The onset of sensory block, quality of intraoperative analgesia and total duration of analgesia were similar in both groups; maximum extent of sensory block predominated in T4; maximum degree of motor block (Bromage 3); time motor block regression was significantly longer in GII; Hemodynamic, respiratory repercussions, adverse maternal effects and Apgar scores were similar between groups. In both groups, there was a predominance of drowsy or sleeping patients.
   CONCLUSION: The addition of morphine and clonidine to low doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine produced adequate anesthesia for cesarean section and good postoperative analgesia, without any maternal and fetal repercussions.

AB Carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors transduce low arterial O-2 tension into increased action potential activity on the carotid sinus nerves, which contributes to resting ventilatory drive, increased ventilatory drive in response to hypoxia, arousal responses to hypoxia during sleep, upper airway muscle activity, blood pressure control and sympathetic tone. Their sensitivity to O-2 is low in the newborn and increases during the days or weeks after birth to reach adult levels. This postnatal functional maturation of the CB O-2 response has been termed "resetting" and it occurs in every mammalian species studied to date. The O-2 environment appears to play a key role; the fetus develops in a low O-2 environment throughout gestation and initiation of CB "resetting" after birth is modulated by the large increase in arterial oxygen tension occurring at birth. Although numerous studies have reported age-related changes in various components of the O-2 transduction cascade, how the O-2 environment shapes normal CB prenatal development and postnatal "resetting" remains unknown. Viewing CB "resetting" as environment-driven (developmental) phenotypic plasticity raises important mechanistic questions that have received little attention. This review examines what is known (and not known) about mechanisms of CB functional maturation, with a focus on the role of the O-2 environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders. Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population.
   Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women's Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS.
   Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
   Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach's alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1 alpha = .754; Factor 2 alpha = .524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established.
   Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to induce fetal brain growth deficits at different embryonic stages. We focused this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis at midgestation using activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)-9, a peptide (SALLRSIPA) derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, and NAP, a peptide (NAPVSIPQ) derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein. We used an established fetal alcohol exposure mouse model. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) group with 25 % (4.49 %, v/v) ethanol-derived calories, (2) pair-fed (PF) control group, (3) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9) group, (4) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of NAP (ALC/NAP) group, (5) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of ADNF-9 (PF/ADNF-9) group, and (6) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of NAP (PF/NAP) group. On day 15 (E15), fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ADNF-9 or NAP was administered daily from E7 to E15 alongside PF or ALC liquid diet exposure. Our results show that NAP and ADNF-9 significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of fetal brains. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP or ADNF-9 administration alongside alcohol exposure significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium of the cingulate cortex and ganglionic eminence. These findings may pave the path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during pregnancy stages.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the degree of association between body mass index (BMI) and some of the most common adverse outcomes and conditions in obstetrics and gynecology, and to compare it with the traditional descriptors such as age, gravidity, parity, history of preterm births, history of abortions or miscarriages, and race and ethnic status.
   METHODS: Using a PubMed search, abstracts were identified that dealt with the associations between each of the descriptors (age, gravidity, parity, history of preterm births, history of abortions, racial and ethnic identification, and BMI) and a variety of adverse outcomes and conditions in both obstetrics and in gynecology.
   RESULTS: Body mass index had the highest association with the most common adverse outcomes and conditions in obstetrics and in gynecology (53 of 57 [93%]) as compared with the traditional descriptors (age, 39 of 57 [88%]; gravidity, 19 of 57 [33%]; parity, 24 of 57 [42%]; previous preterm births, 22 of 57 [39%]; abortions, 14 of 57 [25%]; and race and ethnic status, 26 of 57 [46%]).
   CONCLUSION: This study underscores the prominence BMI plays regarding its frequently cited associations with an array of obstetric and gynecologic conditions. Body mass index should be included in the opening statement of the history of present illness and in all communications of health care providers regarding obstetric and gynecologic patients.

AB Study Objectives: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP.
   Intervention: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure.
   Measurements and Results: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively).
   Conclusions: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

AB Aim To describe the prevalence of paediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms in extremely low gestational age infants and identify neonatal risk factors, including early exposure to hypoxia and hyperoxia. Methods Patients <28 weeks gestation were monitored with high-resolution pulse oximetry. Hypoxia/hyperoxia variables were defined as percentage time of first 4 weeks of life that SaO2 < 80% or SaO2 > 98%, respectively. Parents completed part of the OSA-18 questionnaire for symptoms of SDB at 1822 months. Logistic regression was used to test the association between risk factors and sleep symptoms. Results Of 182 patients recruited, 138 (76%) completed the questionnaire. The mean gestation was 26 weeks, and mean birth weight 887 grams. Loud snoring (21%) and restless sleep (24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of loud snoring (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.136.5). Prolonged mechanical ventilation, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged caffeine use, however, were inversely correlated with loud snoring. Neither neonatal hypoxia nor hyperoxia were associated with sleep symptoms. Conclusions While the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms is similar to reported rates, we found a sex difference not previously reported. Interestingly, markers for severity of illness show a pattern of being protective against loud snoring.

   INCONTINENCE; SLEEP; BOYS; SCHOOLCHILDREN
AB This review aims to provide researchers and clinicians involved with the adult lower urinary tract with background knowledge regarding the early development of bladder function and its most common disturbances in childhood. Bladder development begins in weeks 46 and the detrusor muscle is formed during weeks 912 of gestation. Higher CNS centres are involved in micturition at birth, and the infant usually wakes up, at least briefly, to void. Voiding during the first years of life is often incomplete, owing to detrusor-sphincter dyscoordination, but this disappears when bladder control is attained. Approximately 510% of 7-year-old children suffer from daytime incontinence and/or nocturnal enuresis, and a few per cent of them will not outgrow it. Daytime incontinence in childhood is usually attributable to detrusor overactivity, although it is unclear to what extent it is the detrusor or the micturition reflex per se that is overactive. Enuresis nocturnal incontinence is caused by either nocturnal polyuria and/or nocturnal detrusor overactivity, in both cases combined with high arousal thresholds. Bladder problems in childhood constitute a risk factor for the development or persistence of bladder problems in adulthood.

ID RATE-VARIABILITY
AB Fetal heart rate patterns provide valuable information about normal fetal maturation. For heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to be successful in prenatal diagnosis the selection of appropriate HRV indices is required. Those indices were organized according to universal principles of developmental biology. Key characteristics of evolution and self-organization are increasing fluctuation amplitude, increasing complexity and pattern formation. Related HRV indices were used to propose a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS). We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet (n=113, 63 females) and active sleep (n=286, 145 females) by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. fABAS explained 66/63% (training / validation set) of the variance by age in quiet and 51/50% in active sleep. We conclude that functional autonomic brain age can be assessed based on universal developmental indices obtained from fetal heart rate patterns.

This qualitative study explored pregnant and parenting teenagers' child safety beliefs and practices related to 4 topics: preventing accidental suffocation via safe sleeping practices, motor vehicle collision safety, prevention of inflicted head trauma, and drowning prevention. Twenty-four focus groups were held with 93 pregnant and/or parenting teenagers. Participants reported variation in their sleeping arrangements, transportation methods, caregivers, and childcare settings. Confusion over safety information was common. Child safety practices were influenced by boyfriends/husbands, parents, grandparents, and teachers.

AB Background: Women in low-income countries are generally considered to have a high physical workload which is sustained during pregnancy. Although most previous studies have been based on questionnaires a recent meta-analysis of doubly labeled water data has raised questions about the actual amount of physical activity performed. In this study we report objectively assessed levels of physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness among pregnant urban Ethiopian women, and their association with demographic characteristics and anthropometric measures.
   Methods: Physical activity was measured for seven consecutive days in 304 women using a combined uniaxial accelerometer and heart rate sensor. Activity energy expenditure was determined using a group calibration in a branched equation model framework. Type and duration of activities were reported using a 24-hour physical activity recall and grip strength was assessed using a dynamometer.
   Results: Median (interquartile-range, IQR) activity energy expenditure was 31.1 (23.7-42.0) kJ/kg/day corresponding to a median (IQR) physical activity level of 1.46 (1.39-1.58). Median (IQR) time in sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity was 1100 (999-1175), 303 (223-374) and 40 (22-69) min/day, respectively. Mean (standard deviation) sleeping heart rate was 73.6 (8.0) beats/min and grip strength was 21.6 (4.5) kg. Activity energy expenditure was 14% higher for every 10 cm(2) difference in arm muscle area and 10% lower for every 10 cm2 difference in arm fat area and 10-week difference in gestational age.
   Conclusion: The level and intensity of physical activity among pregnant women from urban Ethiopia is low compared to non-pregnant women from other low income countries as well as pregnant European women from high-income countries.

AB Background: There is a high association between disturbed (poor quality) sleep and depression, which has lead to a consensus that there is a bidirectional relationship between sleep and mood. One time in a woman's life when sleep is commonly disturbed is during pregnancy and following childbirth. It has been suggested that sleep disturbance is another factor that may contribute to the propensity for women to become depressed in the postpartum period compared to other periods in their life. Post Natal Depression (PND) is common (15.5%) and associated with sleep disturbance, however, no studies have attempted to provide a sleep-focused intervention to pregnant women and assess whether this can improve sleep, and consequently maternal mood post-partum. The primary aim of this research is to determine the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational sleep intervention compared with a control group to improve sleep management, with a view to reduce depressive symptoms in first time mothers.
   Method: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 214 first time mothers during the last trimester of their pregnancy. Participants will be randomised to receive either a set of booklets (control group) or a 3hour psychoeducational intervention that focuses on sleep. The primary outcomes of this study are sleep-related, that is sleep quality and sleepiness for ten months following the birth of the baby. The secondary outcome is depressive symptoms. It is hypothesised that participants in the intervention group will have better sleep quality and sleepiness in the postpartum period than women in the control condition. Further, we predict that women who receive the sleep intervention will have lower depression scores postpartum compared with the control group.
   Discussion: This study aims to provide an intervention that will improve maternal sleep in the postpartum period. If sleep can be effectively improved through a brief psychoeducational program, then it may have a protective role in reducing maternal postpartum depressive symptoms.
   Registration details: This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register under the registration number ACTRN12611000859987

AB Background: Sleep disturbances in late pregnancy are common. This study aimed to survey sleep problems in third trimester pregnant women and to compare sleep in the pre-pregnancy period with the third trimester.
   Methods: Third-trimester women (n=650) were sent a postal survey containing questions relating to sleep experience, including perceived sleep quality, sleep difficulties, night waking, sleep environment, snoring, daytime tiredness and daytime napping. Time periods reported on were before pregnancy and in the last week.
   Results: Respondents numbered 244 (38%). Before pregnancy, the mean reported duration of night-time sleep was 8.1 (SD 1.1) hours; in the last week this had decreased to 7.5 (SD 1.8) hours (p<.0001). Only 29% rated their sleep quality in the last week as very good or fairly good, compared with 82% rating their sleep this way before the pregnancy. The main reasons for sleeping difficulties were discomfort (67%) and pain (36%). Snoring increased significantly over the course of the pregnancy, with 37% reporting snoring often or every night in the last week. Those with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of greater than 25 were significantly more likely to snore (p=.01). Only 4% of women had an abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (i.e. >10) prior to pregnancy, whereas in the last week 33% scored in the abnormal range. Likewise, 5% had regularly napped during the daytime before pregnancy, compared with 41% in the last week.
   Conclusions: Sleep problems are common in women in late pregnancy, and increase markedly compared with before pregnancy.

AB This narrative review explains the development of excess weight gain in babies and children. It takes a life course approach which includes genetics, pre-conception, pregnancy, infancy and childhood. The paper focuses on feeding behaviours, physical activity, parental influences and the wider social and environmental context. Risk factors which can cumulatively lead to excess childhood weight gain include: under- or overweight during pregnancy; the presence of diabetes during pregnancy; low or high birth weight; having obese parents; early weaning; prolonged formula feeding; rapid weight gain in the first year; disinhibited eating patterns and the consistent availability of energy dense food at home; feeding practices which are not responsive to the child's cues; insufficient sleep among preschool children; sedentary parents; low parental education; living in poor socio-economic circumstances; absence, or perceived absence, of safe play areas; parents who lack time or confidence to authoritatively parent; environments where there is poor access to affordable lower energy dense foods; and parents who do not accept that excess weight is a health problem. Recommendations for health professionals are made.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Overweight and obesity are becoming increasingly prevalent problems worldwide. A number of factors in early life have been found to be associated with body composition of neonates or young children but there is limited follow-up data for adolescents. This study aims to describe associations between early nutrition and body composition in adolescents.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Birth cohort study of 415 pregnant women and their offspring (mean age 16 years). Body composition including fat mass (FM) and lean body mass (LBM) of adolescents at 16 years of age was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on maternal food and nutrients intake during the third trimester of pregnancy and breastfeeding was collected by questionnaires soon after birth.
   RESULTS: A total of 264 mother-adolescents pairs were studied. Maternal antenatal meat intake was positively associated with FM of adolescents (an increase of 0.9%/portion, P<0.01). There were also positive associations between maternal energy intake (per 1000 kJ/day), fat (per 10 g/d) and protein (per 10 g/day) intake and offspring's FM (an increase of 1.3%), but these became borderline after adjustment for confounders. Breastfeeding >25 days was negatively associated with FM in adolescents (a decrease of 14%, P=0.01). These associations were independent of the significant association between maternal energy and macronutrient intakes during pregnancy and adolescent intakes at 16 years of age. No significant association was found between maternal dietary intake and lean mass in adolescents.
   CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding may have a biological effect that is beneficial for the prevention of obesity. Conversely, higher maternal meat intake during pregnancy may increase FM in adolescents.

AB Acupuncture for tension-type headache in pregnancy: a prospective, randomized, controlled study.
   Aim: This study was undertaken to test, under real-life conditions, the effects of acupuncture on headaches during pregnancy and compare this with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone.
   Methodology: Forty-three conventionally treated (lifestyle modifications and stretching) pregnant women were randomly allocated into two groups to routine care or acupuncture. The severity and disability caused by this pain and its affect on mood, sleep and work were assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The main end-point was the mean difference between the first and the last interview after eight weeks of treatment. Secondary end points were the changes over time in the NRS assessments of pain intensity, disturbances in mood, sleep and working and the use of medications.
   Differences between initial and final sessions were analyzed by a two-sample test. Changes over time in the NRS assessment were analyzed by the Fisher exact test. Mood's test for medians was used and a p-value < 0.05 indicated a significant difference.
   Results: All women completed the treatment. No important adverse effects related to acupuncture treatment or to pregnancy's outcome were reported. Significant improvements were demonstrated for pain at the end of the trial in the study group, 3.9 vs 1.7 difference in favor to acupuncture group (p < 0.05). This group also used less medication and had a greater improvement in mood and sleep when compared with the control group.
   Conclusions: This study suggests acupuncture alleviates tension-type headaches during pregnancy. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI Brief Scales to Detect Postpartum Depression and Anxiety Symptoms
SO JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY; VALIDATION; INVENTORY; VALIDITY; IDAS
AB Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders in the postpartum period cause significant suffering for women. State public health officials across the country use the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) to assess health behaviors and conditions, including depression and anxiety, that occur around the time of pregnancy. The purpose of the present study was to validate two to three items that could be included on the PRAMS questionnaire to detect depression and anxiety among postpartum women in a surveillance system.
   Methods: A comprehensive set of 16 depression and anxiety items was developed and tested in a final sample of 1077 postpartum women, 353 of whom completed Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) interviews to determine the presence of a major depressive episode (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Regression analyses reduced candidate items to 5 each for MDE and GAD. Responses were scored on a 5-point scale ranging from never (1) to always (5), and 2 and 3 item combinations of these items were examined for their psychometric properties as indicators of MDE and GAD.
   Results: Item sets varied in their psychometric properties. The combination of depressed mood, felt hopeless, and slowed down > 9 (out of a possible total of 15) yielded the highest positive predictive value (PPV = 60) and estimated MDE prevalence most accurately (24.4% vs. 25.4% true prevalence). The combination of felt panicky, felt restless, and problems sleeping >9 estimated GAD prevalence most accurately (20.2% vs. 15.7% true prevalence) and had high specificity (83%).
   Conclusions: Depression and anxiety can be detected using very few items, which makes assessment feasible in surveillance systems, such as PRAMS, and in primary care settings that have severe limits on time for depression and anxiety screening.

AB Objective: To examine the continuity and discontinuity of trouble sleeping behaviors (TSB) from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood in a community-based prospective birth cohort study.
   Methods: The original study comprised 7223 mother-offspring pairs who were followed prospectively at pregnancy, 6 months, 5, 14 and 21 years post-delivery. Participant numbers differ by follow-up stages. There were 3184 offspring for whom we have consistently collected information on TSB retrospectively at 2-4 years, and prospectively at 14 and 21 years of age.
   Results: These comprised maternal-reported offspring TSB at 2-4 years and 14 years, and offspring-reported trouble sleeping at 14 and 21 years. One in two children had persistent trouble sleeping from 2-4 to 14 years and two-thirds from 14 to 21 years. In the adjusted analysis, compared with 2-4-years-old children with no trouble sleeping, those who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.44) times more likely to have trouble sleeping at 21 years. Similarly, adolescents who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.27) times more likely to experience trouble sleeping at 21 years.
   Conclusions: There is a continuity of TSB from early childhood through adolescence and young adulthood, although the persistence of TSB is strongest from adolescence to young adulthood. Interventions improving sleep in young children may prevent longer term difficulties in adolescents and young adults. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to prospectively examine the impact of chronic vs pregnancy-onset habitual snoring on gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes.
   STUDY DESIGN: Third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a large, tertiary medical center from March 2007 through December 2010 and screened for the presence and duration of habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep-disordered breathing. Clinical diagnoses of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes were obtained.
   RESULTS: Of 1719 pregnant women, 34% reported snoring, with 25% reporting pregnancy-onset snoring. After adjusting for confounders, pregnancy-onset, but not chronic, snoring was independently associated with gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-3.77; P < .001) and preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.37; P = .024) but not gestational diabetes.
   CONCLUSION: New-onset snoring during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In view of the significant morbidity and health care costs associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, simple screening of pregnant women may have clinical utility.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations.
   STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P < .05 considered significant.
   RESULTS: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P < .003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P < .003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1 beta were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups.
   CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

AB Objective: Fetal Movement Acceleration Measurement (FMAM) recorder was developed to facilitate gross fetal movement counting. The aim was to assess its reliability. Methods: Using the recorder, six pregnant women recorded fetal movements by themselves when they slept at their home weekly from 30 weeks to term. The recorder has 2 acceleration sensors; 1 for fetal movement (FM sensor) and another for maternal movement (MM sensor). Before sleeping, each subject attached the FM sensor to her abdomen, and the MM sensor to her thigh. All the recorded data were divided into 10-sec epochs, and presence of fetal movements was judged for all epochs (total epoch). The epoch was judged as positive for movement (positive epoch) when the FM sensor detected abdominal wall oscillations and the MM sensor did not detect maternal movements. The percentage of positive epoch number to total epoch and the maximum consecutive negative epoch number was calculated. Results: The mean percentage was approximately 20-25% at 30-34 weeks and 10-15% at 35-38 weeks. The negative epoch number linearly increased after approximately 33-34 weeks of gestation. Conclusions: The FMAM recorder was reliable for long-duration recording of gross fetal movements at home.

AB Purpose of review
   This article aims to draw together recent thinking on pregnancy and obesity, with a particular emphasis on prevention strategies and emerging clinical complications.
   Recent findings
   New studies including a large meta-analysis have highlighted that weight reduction strategies are not associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes, and there are suggestions that an approach of dietary modification alone may be associated with reduction in gestational weight gain. These findings are critically discussed with reference to future planned trials. New literature regarding hitherto under-reported complications of obesity in pregnancy such as ischaemic heart disease, schizophrenia and sleep disorders is highlighted.
   Summary
   There will be a need to focus on obesity prevention in the pregnant population as resources will not be adequate to the increasing incidence of the problem.

AB Background: Placental malaria is a complication of malaria in pregnancy and is associated with adverse outcomes. Its burden is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, but despite this, data based on histological analysis are scarce from this region.
   Methods: Questionnaires administered by the researchers were used to obtain information from parturients at a university teaching hospital in southeastern Nigeria between April and November 2010. Maternal blood and placental blood were collected for analysis. Placental blocks were taken for histological analysis. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS v. 17.
   Results: Three hundred and sixty-five placentas were analyzed, out of which 254 showed histological evidence of malaria parasitization, giving a prevalence of 69.6%. Of the 254 placentas, 23 (9.0%) showed active infection and 196 (77.2%) showed active-on-past infection, while 35 (13.8%) showed past infection. Rural residence, hemoglobin genotype AA, not receiving intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), and not sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) were significantly associated with placental malaria. Placental parasite density was inversely related to parity.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the prevalence of placental malaria in southeastern Nigeria is high, and demonstrated that the mean parasite density was inversely related to parity. Significant factors associated with placental malaria were also identified. Appreciation of these significant factors will assist program managers in implementing the strategies for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is underdiagnosed and poorly understood by clinicians and the general public alike; accordingly, a broad literature review with information most relevant to general practice is needed to help dispel misconceptions and improve level of care.
   Specifically, this review comprehensively provides an epidemiological analysis of RLS and examines the risk factors and treatment options for RLS by compiling the findings of past RLS studies. These RLS studies were identified through a retrospective PubMed search. The epidemiological analysis was conducted by calculating a weighted mean average of all the relevant general population RLS prevalence studies, separated into geographical/racial categories.
   A comprehensive analysis of RLS epidemiological studies finds the prevalence rate of RLS to be 5-15% in the general population with 2.5% of adults having symptoms severe enough to require medical intervention. Some of the risk factors for RLS include female gender, pregnancy, low iron levels, lower socioeconomic status, poor health, elderly age, comorbidity with Parkinson's disease, positive family history of RLS, and comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. A wide array of treatment options exist for RLS including pharmacological and nonpharmacologic interventions.
   Clinicians' understanding of RLS enigma has recently improved due to the increased intensity of RLS research over the past decade. This review summarizes the current findings in the RLS field as well as providing guidelines for future RLS-related research.

AB This study investigated the relationship between marital satisfaction and time spent bed sharing with infants in a community sample of 81 bed sharing mothers. Time spent bed sharing did not significantly predict variance in marital satisfaction when considering bed sharers as a whole. Moderation analysis, however, showed the interaction between time spent bed sharing and group classification either as intentional, defined as parents who endorse the ideology of bed sharing, or reactive, defined as parents who do not plan to bed share but bed share as a reaction to infant nighttime problems, explained a significant increase in variance in marital satisfaction, ?R2 = .075, F(1, 75) = 7.31, p = .008. None of the intended mediator variables (satisfaction with bed sharing, fatigue, and sexual satisfaction) were significantly correlated with time spent bed sharing. Results highlight the importance of recognizing the differences between intentional bed sharers and reactive bed sharers.

AB The objective of this study was to examine which factors during pregnancy and postpartum predict pelvic girdle pain (PGP) at 12 weeks postpartum among working women. A total of 548 Dutch pregnant employees were recruited in 15 companies, mainly health care, child care, and supermarkets. The definition of PGP was any pain felt in the pelvic girdle region at 12 weeks postpartum. Participants received questionnaires at 30 weeks of pregnancy and at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum with demographic, work-related, pregnancy-related, fatigue, psychosocial, PGP-related and delivery-related questions. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Almost half of the women experienced pain in their pelvic girdle at 12 weeks postpartum. However, the level of pain and the degree of disability due to postpartum PGP was low. Pregnancy-related predictors for PGP at 12 weeks were history of low back pain, higher somatisation, more than 8 hours of sleep or rest per day, and uncomfortable postures at work. The pregnancy and postpartum-related predictors were: more disability at 6 weeks, having PGP at 6 weeks, higher mean pain at 6 weeks, higher somatisation during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum, higher birth weight of the baby, uncomfortable postures at work and number of days of bed rest. Based on these results, it is concluded that extra attention should be given to women who experience PGP during pregnancy to prevent serious PGP during late pregnancy and postpartum. More research is needed to confirm the roles of hours of sleep, somatisation, and bed rest in relation to PGP. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Inhibition of self-grooming induced by sleep restriction in dam rats
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Grooming; maternal behavior; pregnancy; sleep restriction
AB Background & objectives: Sleep restriction is a common feature of modern lifestyle and its effects can be extended to pregnancy. Several neurobehavioural consequences of sleep restriction during pregnancy have been reported, among which stand out perinatal depression and maternal fatigue, however, its effects over mother-infant relationship warrant further investigation. Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy over maternal behaviour and maternal aggression through animal models.
   Methods: Eighteen 90-day-old female Wistar rats were distributed in two groups: (i) Control - not submitted to any manipulation during pregnancy, and (ii) Sleep restriction - submitted to sleep restriction during the entire pregnancy (21 days) through the multiple platforms technique. In the postpartum day 5, resident-intruder paradigm and the latencies test were performed to assess both maternal behaviour and maternal aggression.
   Results: The sleep-restricted females displayed grooming in less frequency and duration, and with higher latency when compared to normal animals, while maternal aggression and maternal behaviour parameters remained equivalent between groups.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Considering the maintenance of maternal behavioural parameters, the inhibition of grooming seems to exert an adaptive mechanism, enabling sleep-restricted rats to display maternal behaviour properly.

AB Obesity in men is associated with infertility in numerous studies, and the temporal trend for a decline in semen parameters parallels the increasing prevalence of obesity in the developed world. In addition to impaired semen quality, fertility among obese men may be affected by decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. This spectrum of expression of hypogonadism among obese men originates from multiple interacting factors including reduced levels of gonadotropins and testosterone, altered androgen-to-estrogen ratios, insulin resistance, and sleep apnea. No evidence-based treatment that increases the likelihood of pregnancy for the infertility associated with male obesity has been demonstrated to date. Interventions associated with improvement of intermediate outcomes that include the endocrine profile, semen parameters, and sexual function may be appropriately selected based on history, physical findings, as well as endocrine and metabolic evaluation. Among these interventions are weight loss through lifestyle change, relief from sleep apnea, use of aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin administration, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and insulin-sensitizing agents.

AB Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Active fragments of neurotrophic factors release by astrocyte under the stimulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) respectively, have shown therapeutic potential for developmental delay and learning deficits. Previous work demonstrated that NAP+SAL prevent developmental delay and glial deficit in Ts65Dn that is a well-characterized mouse model for Down syndrome. The objective of this study is to evaluate if prenatal treatment with these peptides prevents the learning deficit in the Ts65Dn mice. Pregnant Ts65Dn female and control pregnant females were randomly treated (intraperitoneal injection) on pregnancy days 8 through 12 with saline (placebo) or peptides (NAP 20 mu g + SAL 20 mu g) daily. Learning was assessed in the offspring (8-10 months) using the Morris Watermaze, which measures the latency to find the hidden platform (decrease in latency denotes learning). The investigators were blinded to the prenatal treatment and genotype. Pups were genotyped as trisomic (Down syndrome) or euploid (control) after completion of all tests. Statistical analysis: two-way ANOVA followed by Neuman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons, P<0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. Trisomic mice who prenatally received placebo (Down syndrome -placebo; n = 11) did not demonstrate learning over the five day period. DS mice that were prenatally exposed to peptides (Down syndrome-peptides; n = 10) learned significantly better than Down syndrome -placebo (p<0.01), and similar to control-placebo (n = 33) and control-peptide (n = 30). In conclusion prenatal treatment with the neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) prevented learning deficits in a Down syndrome model. These findings highlight a possibility for the prevention of sequelae in Down syndrome and suggest a potential pregnancy intervention that may improve outcome.

AB Background: Approximately 80 percent of pregnant women suffer by some degree of nausea and vomiting. But the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is rarely successful.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was evaluation the effect of mint on nausea and vomiting during pregnancy that its treatment in some recent research has been effective.
   Materials and Methods: In this double blind RCT, 60 pregnant women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were sampled and divided into two groups with Block-randomized method. mint group, in addition to giving the routine training, for four consecutive nights, before sleeping, a bowel of water whit four drops of pure mint essential oil placed on the floor near their beds and in control groups were used four drops of normal saline. The severity of nausea by using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and severity of vomiting by counting the number of its in 7 days prior, 4 days during, and 7 days after intervention were assessed.
   Results: The results showed that the severity of nausea and vomiting did not differ between the two groups in 7days before and after intervention by using repeated measurement test. But during intervention, the severity of nausea showed a decreasing trend (especially in 4th night) in the mint and an increasing trend in the control group. The severity of nausea within 7 days after the intervention had a decreasing trend in both groups; however, the intensity was lower in the mint than saline group but not statically significant. No meaningful relationship has been detected during and after intervention for the intensity of vomiting.
   Conclusions: The results of study showed that peppermint essential oil hasn't the effect on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

TI In-Hospital Safety in Field Conditions of Nifurtimox Eflornithine
   Combination Therapy (NECT) for T. b. gambiense Sleeping Sickness
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID HUMAN AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS; BRUCEI-GAMBIENSE; MELARSOPROL; STAGE;
   UGANDA; TRIAL; SCHEDULE; CONGO
AB Background: Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) gambiense Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT; sleeping sickness) is a fatal disease. Until 2009, available treatments for 2nd stage HAT were complicated to use, expensive (eflornithine monotherapy), or toxic, and insufficiently effective in certain areas (melarsoprol). Recently, nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) demonstrated good safety and efficacy in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and was added to the World Health Organisation (WHO) essential medicines list (EML). Documentation of its safety profile in field conditions will support its wider use.
   Methodology: In a multicentre, open label, single arm, phase IIIb study of the use of NECT for 2nd stage T.b. gambiense HAT, all patients admitted to the trial centres who fulfilled inclusion criteria were treated with NECT. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients discharged alive from hospital. Safety was further assessed based on treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring during hospitalisation.
   Principal Findings: 629 patients were treated in six HAT treatment facilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), including 100 children under 12, 14 pregnant and 33 breastfeeding women. The proportion of patients discharged alive after treatment completion was 98.4% (619/629; 95% CI [97.1%; 99.1%]). Of the 10 patients who died during hospitalisation, 8 presented in a bad or very bad health condition at baseline; one death was assessed as unlikely related to treatment. No major or unexpected safety concerns arose in any patient group. Most common AEs were gastro-intestinal (61%), general (46%), nervous system (mostly central; 34%) and metabolic disorders (26%). The overall safety profile was similar to previously published findings.
   Conclusions/Significance: In field conditions and in a wider population, including children, NECT displayed a similar tolerability profile to that described in more stringent clinical trial conditions. The in-hospital safety was comparable to published results, and long term efficacy will be confirmed after 24 months follow-up.

AB Objective To explore demographic and social support predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (mental and physical) for childbearing women in the perinatal period.
   Design Longitudinal.
   Sample Three public hospitals in metropolitan Brisbane, Australia.
   Participants Four hundred seventy-three (473) women recruited at 36 weeks of pregnancy, and 6 and 12 weeks following childbirth.
   Methods The Short Form-12 (SF-12) Version 2 Health Survey was used to measure the mental and physical domains of HRQoL. Social support was measured using the Maternal Social Support Scale (MSSS).
   Results Mean scores for the mental and physical domains of HRQoL were lower than population norms. Social support was found to be a significant and consistent predictor of higher HRQoL scores, particularly in the physical domain at 12 weeks following child birth and mental domain during the perinatal period. The relationship between social support and HRQoL was found to be independent of other factors including education, length of relationship with partner, age, parity, and antenatal visit. The only other significant predictor was length of relationship with partner in the mental domain at 36 weeks of pregnancy.
   Conclusion Social support is a significant and consistent predictor of a mother's HRQoL during the perinatal period. Nurses and midwives need to assess social support, rather than making assumptions based on demographic factors.

AB To identify maternal and infant characteristics associated with accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ASSB) in US infants. Using 2000-2002 US linked infant birth and death certificate cohort files, we compared ASSB deaths to survivors. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) from logistic regression were used to analyze associations between selected maternal and infant characteristics and ASSB mortality. During 2000-2002, 1,064 infants died from ASSB, resulting in an ASSB mortality rate of 9.2 per 100,000 live births. Most ASSB deaths (71%) occurred before an infant reached 4 months old. Maternal factors associated with an increased risk of ASSB were younger age (using maternal age of 25-29 years as reference aOR 2.6 for mothers < 20 years old and 1.6 for mothers 20-24 years old), lower educational attainment (aOR 4.3 for < 12 years and 3.3 for 12 years compared to a parts per thousand yen16 years), multiparity (aOR 1.7, 2.2, and 3.5 for parity 2, 3, and 4 or higher, respectively) and smoking during pregnancy (aOR 2.8). Compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks (aOR 1.8) and American Indians (aOR 1.8) were more likely to have an ASSB death. Being male and born preterm were also associated with a higher ASSB mortality risk. Younger, less educated, mulitparous, non-Hispanic black or American Indian women and their families who smoke during their pregnancy and deliver male or preterm infants, may need more intense safe sleeping education during the infant's first year of life, especially during the first 4 months of age.

AB Objective: To describe the development of the integrative capacity of the fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) according to gestational age and emerging behavioral states, assuming that developing integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability markers.
   Methods: Magnetocardiograms of 114 healthy fetuses (21-40 weeks of gestation) were recorded. Level of fetal activity (quiet/active sleep) was estimated according to characteristic heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation functions of (i) fetal heart rate and (ii) time patterns of SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal intervals) were calculated and autocorrelation was determined over different time scales. Age and activity related changes were examined using linear regression and non-parametric tests.
   Results: During pregnancy, autocorrelation increased in fetal heart rate signals and time patterns of SDNN and RMSSD. Short-time correlation (0-20 s) changed between 21 and 31 gestational weeks. Long-time correlation (75-300 s) accelerated later in pregnancy and did not increase in quiet heart rate patterns. Strong state-dependent changes were found with time patterns of SDNN.
   Conclusions: Emerging integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate fluctuations over increasing time scales. The period from 21 to 31 gestational weeks seems to be critical to ANS development. Increasing long-time correlation is specific to active sleep states.

AB This study assessed the links between maternal sleep and mothers' perceptions of their attachment relationship with their infant among women at risk for postpartum depression by virtue of having been depressed during pregnancy. Sixty-two mothers completed sleep diaries and questionnaires at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Regression analyses, controlling for depression severity and infant temperament, revealed significant prospective correlation between maternal shorter total sleep time at 3 months and lower scores on a mother-infant attachment questionnaire at 6 months. At 6 months, the longer time mothers were awake tending to their infants the lower were their attachment scores. The findings suggest that improving sleep of mothers who suffered from prenatal depression may have a positive effect on mothers' self-reported relationship with their infants.

AB Objective: To investigate whether sleep disturbances during pregnancy affect cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 160 pregnant women at various stages of gestation. Participants were interviewed about their sleep length per night, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), snoring habits, and symptoms of restless legs syndrome during the previous few weeks. Cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state was quantified by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) from short-term electrocardiogram monitoring. The relationship of HRV to diverse covariates was studied by multiple regression analysis. Results: No significant influences were observed of short sleep duration (<7 hours per night), poor sleep quality (PSQI score >5), or restless legs syndrome on HRV measures. Participants with excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score >9) and habitual snorers had a significantly elevated low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio and LF power in normalized units (IF norm). In multiple regression analyses, habitual snoring was strongly and positively associated with LF/HF ratio (P<0.001) and LF norm (P<0.001). Conclusion: Resting cardiac autonomic modulation was found to shift toward a sympathetic predominant state among pregnant women who are habitual snorers.

AB Purpose: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data from routine well-child assessments at ages 0-4 years.
   Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11-17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0-4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories.
   Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43).
   Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and maternal and neonatal morbidities in a cohort of obese gravid women.
   METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to screen for OSA and describe the possible risk factors for and outcomes of OSA among obese (body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)](2)] 30 or higher) pregnant women. Women underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor. Studies were manually scored by a central masked sleep reading center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea hypopnea index of 5 or more was considered diagnostic of OSA. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women with and without OSA.
   RESULTS: Among 175 women, OSA prevalence was 15.4% (13 mild, 9 moderate, 5 severe). Compared with no OSA (apnea hypopnea index less than 5), the OSA group had a higher BMI (46.8+/-12.2 compared with 38.1+/-7.5; P=.002) and more chronic hypertension (55.6% compared with 32.4%, P=.02). Maternal complications included maternal death (n=1, amniotic fluid embolus [no OSA group]) and cardiac arrest (n=1, intra-operative at cesarean delivery [OSA group]). One previable birth and two stillbirths occurred in the no OSA group. Among live births, OSA was associated with more frequent cesarean delivery (65.4% compared with 32.8%; P=.003), preeclampsia (42.3% compared with 16.9%; P=.005), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (46.1% compared with 17.8%; P=.002). After controlling for BMI, maternal age, and diabetes, OSA (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-11.3), previous preeclampsia (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.09-7.19), and hypertension (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.67-10.77) were associated with development of preeclampsia.
   CONCLUSION: Obstructive sleep apnea among obese pregnant women is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and cesarean delivery. (Obstet Gynecol 2012; 120: 1085-92) DOI: http://10.1097/AOG.0b013e31826eb9d8

AB Purpose of review
   Review recent research on the roles of gender, race/ethnicity, residential socioeconomics and age in obstructive sleep apnea syndromes (OSA) and their treatment.
   Recent findings
   Men have a higher prevalence of OSA than women and require higher continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) pressures for treatment, given similar severity of OSA. When comparing age, women have less severe apnea at all ages. Menopause, pregnancy and polycystic ovarian syndrome increase the risk for OSA in women. Neck fat and BMI influence apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) severity in women; abdominal fat and neck-to-waist ratio do so in men. Obesity, craniofacial structure, lower socioeconomic status and neighborhood disadvantage may better explain ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA. Ethnicity was no longer significantly associated with OSA severity when WHO criteria for obesity were used.
   Summary
   OSA has a male predominance; women have a lower AHI than men during certain stages of sleep; women require less CPAP pressure for treatment of similar severity of OSA, and there are ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA but these may be due to environmental factors, such as living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

AB Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a non-pregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in brain regions known to regulate the sleep/wake cycle and body temperature might reflect altered rhythms in these overt functions. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS in early pregnant and diestrous rats in the medial septum (MS), vertical and horizontal diagonal bands of Broca (VDB and HDB), perifornical lateral hypothalamus (LH), and ventrolateral, medial, and median preoptic areas (VLPO, MPA, and MnPO, respectively). In the pregnant animals, FOS expression was reduced and the daily rhythms of expression were lost or attenuated in the MS, VDB, and LH, areas known to support wakefulness, and in the MPA, a brain region that may coordinate sleep/wake patterns with temperature changes. However, despite the well-documented differences in sleep patterns between diestrous and pregnant rats, reproductive state did not affect FOS expression in the VLPO or MnPO, two brain regions in which FOS expression usually correlates with sleep. These data indicate that plasticity in sleep/wake patterns during early pregnancy may be driven by a reduction in wakefulness-promotion by the brain, rather than by an increase in sleep drive.

AB Purpose: Identify epilepsy-associated factors and calculate measures of impact, stigma, quality of life (QOL), knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) and treatment gap in Prey Veng, Cambodia.
   Methods: This first Cambodian population-based case-control study had 96 epileptologist-confirmed epilepsy cases and 192 randomly selected matched healthy controls. Standard questionnaires, which have been used in similar settings, were used for collecting data on various parameters. Univariate and multivariate regression was done to determine odds ratios. Jacoby stigma, 31-item QOL, KAP etc were determined and so were the factors associated with them using STATA software. Treatment gap was measured using direct method.
   Key findings: Multivariate analyses yielded family history of epilepsy, difficult or long delivery, other problems beside seizures (mainly mental retardation, hyperthermia), and eventful pregnancy of the subject's mother as factors associated with epilepsy. There was high frequency of seizure precipitants esp. those related to sleep. Population attributable risk (%) was: family history (15.0), eventful pregnancy of subject's mother (14.5), long/difficult birth (6.5), and other problem beside seizures (20.0). Mean stigma (1.9 +/- 1.1, on a scale of 3) was mainly related to treatment efficacy. Mean QOL (5.0 +/- 1.4 on a scale of 10) was mainly related to treatment regularity. Cause or risk factor could be determined in 56% of cases. Treatment gap was 65.8%.
   Significance: Factors in pre- and perinatal period were found to be most crucial for epilepsy risk in Cambodia which inturn provides major prevention opportunities. A global action plan for treatment, stigma reduction and improvement of QOL should be set-up in this country.

AB Background: Psychiatric disorders have been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints and disorders among pregnant women with psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: A cohort of 1,332 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We ascertained psychiatric diagnosis status and collect information about sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Approximately 5.1% of the cohort (n=68) reported having a physician-diagnosis of mood or anxiety disorder before interview. Compared with women without a psychiatric diagnosis, the multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) for short sleep duration in early pregnancy (<= 6 hours) were 1.95 (1.03-3.69). The corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration (>= 9 hours) during early pregnancy was 1.13 (0.63-2.03). Women with psychiatric disorders had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR=2.41; 95% CI 1.46-4.00) and elevated perceived stress (OR=3.33; 95% CI 1.89-5.88). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight/obese women.
   Conclusions: Women with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to report short sleep durations, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent mood/anxiety-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

AB Introduction. - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder typically affecting young, obese women, producing a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without identifiable cause.
   State of the art. - Despite a large number of hypotheses and publications over the past decade, the etiology of IIH is still unknown. There continues to be no evidence-based consensus or formal guidelines regarding management and treatment of the disease. Treatment studies show that the diagnostic lumbar puncture is a valuable intervention beyond its diagnostic importance, and that weight management is critical. However, many questions remain, regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and cerebral transverse venous sinus stenting. Identification of subgroups of patients at high-risk for irreversible visual loss, such as black patients, men, morbidly obese patients, and patients with fulminant IIH, helps determine management approaches and refine follow-up strategies.
   Perspective. - Better understanding of the pathophysiology and ongoing clinical trials will hopefully help inform treatment strategies over the next few years. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Taiwanese women.
   Methods: We enrolled 461 pregnant women (18-45 years) admitted at Mackay Memorial Hospital for delivery from September 2010 to May 2011. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included assessment of RLS diagnostic criteria, and questions related to RLS.
   Results: The overall prevalence rate of RLS among the study participants was 10.4%; 2.8% were categorized as having chronic RLS. Participants without RLS reported higher folate and iron supplement consumption than those with RLS. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations of RLS with anemia and peptic ulcer disease. Participants with transient RLS during pregnancy reported more regular coffee consumption before pregnancy, and better sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, than those with chronic RLS. Overall, 81.2% of RLS sufferers reported sleep disturbances.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed highly prevalent but poorly recognized RLS among Taiwanese pregnant women. The identification of predictors such as medical comorbidities, and protectors such as folate and iron supplements, is warranted for obstetric RLS. In most cases, symptoms began during the second or third trimester and resolved within a week after delivery. Restricted coffee consumption before pregnancy is encouraged, but further evidence is needed to support this recommendation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Menopause means a definitive end of the generative ovarian function and mostly occurs in women aged 40-58. It is well-known that the sooner it occurs the more serious consequences may result, even in the case of early menopausal hormone therapy. The most serious short-term consequences of menopause are menopausal symptoms (depression, hot flushes, sleep disorders, loss of libido), while long-term estrogen deficiency leads to osteoporosis, cardiovascular system diseases, depression, neurodegenerative diseases, urogenital area atrophy, skin and sense organ disorders.
   Therefore, an important task is to select women at risk of premature termination of the ovarian function.
   An important issue thus appears to be identification of factors influencing the age of the last natural menstrual period. Analysis of heritability results has brought the conclusion that the age of menopause is a multifactorial trait. The proportion of the impact of environmental and genetic factors, however, was not precisely estimated. Among environmental determinants the influence of many factors is being considered, including reproductive factors (related to the reproductive period), such as age of menarche, number of pregnancies and children, socio-economic factors, such as education, economic status, health determinants, such as the use of oral contraceptives or lifestyle-related factors, such as physical activity and the use of stimulants. Among the genetic factors, a genetic polymorphism of genes encoding enzymes of the estrogen biosynthesis pathway and other independent markers scattered throughout the genome (linkage studies and genome-wide association studies - GWAS) is taken into consideration.

AB Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

AB Background: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if reproductive experience is associated with cumulative effects on human memory performance during pregnancy and if these effects persist into the postpartum period.
   Methods: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
   Results: The data indicate that the previously documented adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality.
   Conclusions: Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function.

AB Study Objectives: We compared sleep problems during pregnancy and sleep dissatisfaction 18 months after pregnancy in pregnant women with binge eating disorder (BED) symptoms and pregnant women without an eating disorder.
   Design: Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).
   Patients or Participants: Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent).
   Measurements and Results: Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.

AB Diabet. Med. 29, 13351338 (2012) Abstract Fulminant Type 1 diabetes is a subtype of Type 1 diabetes characterized by (1) abrupt onset of diabetes, (2) very short duration of hyperglycaemia with mildly elevated HbA1c (< 69 mmol/mol, 8.5%), (3) rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis, (4) very low C-peptide level, and (5) often associated with elevated serum pancreatic enzymes, and absence of diabetes-related autoantibodies. We encountered a case of fulminant Type 1 diabetes that developed with an initial manifestation of the insulin autoimmune syndrome and rapidly progressed to diabetic ketoacidosis during pregnancy. A 31-year-old Korean woman presented with recurrent sudden onset of sweating and change of consciousness during sleep at 19 weeks gestation. During a 72-h fasting test, hypoglycaemia (1.72 mmol/l) occurred at 4 h after the start of the test. At that time, there was a high insulin level (370.2 mu U/ml), a paradoxically low C-peptide level (0.01 nmol/l) and a positive insulin autoantibody test. An oral glucose tolerance test revealed postprandial hyperglycaemia. She was initially diagnosed as the insulin autoimmune syndrome. On the day 5 of admission, she developed diabetic ketoacidosis. Her HbA1c was 62 mmol/mol (7.8%). The rapid progression of diabetic ketoacidosis altered the diagnosis to fulminant Type 1 diabetes. This case differed from typical fulminant Type 1 diabetes because it presented with hypoglycaemia, and positive insulin and anti-phospholipid antibody tests. Her HLA typing was HLA-DQA1*0302, 0501, HLA-DRB1*0301 (DR3), 0901(DR9). Her glucose level was subsequently very well controlled with multiple insulin injections and she successfully delivered a healthy baby.

AB Background Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels.
   Methods An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA(1c) levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses.
   Results Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA(1c) (p=0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p=0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea.
   Conclusions Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA(1c) and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Circadian rhythm disorders represent an important component underlying the pathology of depression. One of the subtypes of depression, in which these disorders may play a crucial role, is the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The bright light therapy (BLT) has been reported as a novel, promising treatment method for SAD since 1984, and most of the data revealing its efficacy has been referred to adult patients, without comorbid disorders. However, in the recent years, more and more reports have been presented, which confirm the usefulness of BLT in some specific subpopulations of patients, including children, adolescents and pregnant women. The present review summarizes the applications of BLT in antepartum depression, childhood and adolescence depression as well as in patients suffering from eating disorders. Although the body of evidence is still too small to recommend the use of BLT as the first line of treatment for the depression or eating disorders in these patient subpopulations; it appears that BLT may be a useful alternative or adjunctive therapy for these diseases. However, the specific clinical applications of BLT in these areas need further investigation.

AB In the search of the sleep substance, many studies have been addressed for different hormones, responsible for sleep-wake cycle regulation. In this article we mentioned the participation of steroid hormones, besides its role regulating sexual behavior, they influence importantly in the sleep process. One of the clearest relationships are that estrogen and progesterone have, that causing changes in sleep patterns associated with the hormonal cycles of women throughout life, from puberty to menopause and specific periods such as pregnancy and the menstrual cycle, including being responsible for some sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and insomnia. Another studied hormone is cortisol, a hormone released in stressful situations, when an individual must react to an extraordinary demand that threatens their survival, but also known as the hormone of awakening because the release peak occurs in the morning, although this may be altered in some sleep disorders like insomnia and mood disorders. Furthermore neurosteroids such as pregnanolone, allopregnanolone and pregnenolone are involved in the generation of slow wave sleep, the effect has been demonstrated in experimental animal studies. Thus we see that the sleep and the endocrine system saved a bidirectional relationship in which depends on each other to regulate different physiological processes including sleep.

AB heilemann m.v., choudhury s.m., kury f.s. & lee k.a. (2012) Factors associated with sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Journal of Advanced Nursing68(10), 22562266. Abstract Aims. The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background.similar to Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design. This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods. Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (2140 years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results. Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion. When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.

AB Objectives: To examine the relationship of anxiety and quality of life and sleep variables to recurrent miscarriages (RMs) in patients during two stages of their treatment in an RM-dedicated clinic - before and after the evaluation - and determine what factors could aggravate anxiety and worsen global well-being outcomes.
   Study design: Thirty-nine women who had experienced two or more RMs were measured before and after their evaluation and investigation in the RM clinic. A battery of questionnaires including the STAI scale and various instruments were administered to record anxiety, mental, and physical components of quality of life and sleep quality. Several statistical tests including canonical correlation were performed.
   Results: All the patients revealed a mild to moderate level of anxiety, low numbers of physical and mental health but reasonably normal values of the global quality of sleep. The evaluation in the RM clinic and investigation for possible causes accounting for RM did not significantly change anxiety levels. The children-to-pregnancies ratio introduced into the analysis proved to correlate significantly with the sleep quality and mental health. Summarized anxiety in a given RM woman could be predicted based on the set of the variables, characterizing the woman's reproductive status and her psychological health.
   Conclusions: This study establishes anxiety as a common response in RM patients, and suggests factors that predict it. Knowing these factors may help clinicians to identify more accurately those RM patients who would be prone to a high level of anxiety and therefore need more attention and reassurance.

AB Objective: To assess characteristics of short sleepers and long sleepers and to assess association between sleep duration and central obesity in a population-based sample of women.
   Method: Non-pregnant women >= 20 years that were randomly selected from the population-registry of Uppsala, Sweden, answered a questionnaire (n =6461) including questions on sleeping habits and somatic disorders.
   Results: There was a U-shaped association between sleep duration and waist circumference. Short sleeping women (<5 h) had a waist circumference of 89.2 +/- 14.9 cm (mean +/- SD) decreasing to 82.9 +/- 11.9 cm for women sleeping 7-<8 h and increasing to 89.0 +/- 16.7 cm for women sleeping >= 10 h. Both short sleepers and long sleepers were more often physically inactive, smokers, ill or taking medication, and psychologically distressed than normal sleepers (6-<9 h). In women <50 years both short and long sleep duration were risk factors for central obesity. Short sleep duration remained a risk factor for central obesity, whereas the association with long sleep duration did not reach statistical significance after adjustments.
   Conclusions: Short sleepers and long sleepers showed differences in characteristics compared to normal sleepers. Furthermore, we showed an independent association between short sleep duration and central obesity, which was strongest in younger women. It is important to identify short sleepers, especially in younger women. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Short sleep duration is associated with multiple adverse child outcomes. We examined associations of the built environment with infant sleep duration among 1226 participants in a pre-birth cohort. From residential addresses, we used a geographic information system to determine urbanicity, population density, and closeness to major roadways. The main outcome was mother's report of her infant's average daily sleep duration at 1 year of age. We ranked urbanicity and population density as quintiles, categorized distance to major roads into 8 categories, and used linear regression adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, fetal growth, and television viewing at 1 year. In this sample, mean (SD) sleep duration at age 1 year was 12.8 (1.6) h/day. In multivariable adjusted analyses, children living in the highest quintile of urbanicity slept - 19.2 min/day (95% CI: -37.0, -1.50) less than those living in the lowest quintile. Neither population density nor closeness to major roadways was associated with infant sleep duration after multivariable adjustment. Our findings suggest that living in more urban environments may be associated with reduced infant sleep. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID WOMEN; ALCOHOL; DISEASE; COHORT
AB Background: Appearance, aging, and disorders of the breast are multifactorial. There are intrinsic, patient-specific characteristics, such as breast growth during puberty and propensity for breast cancer, which are primarily inherited. There are also environmental factors, which can be potentially controlled. Monozygotic twins provide an excellent research opportunity to examine the role of extrinsic factors in subjects with identical genetic predispositions.
   Objectives: The authors investigate the role and significance of various environmental and acquired factors on breast aesthetics.
   Methods: Identical female twins were recruited during the Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, in 2009 and 2010. After consent was obtained, enrolled subjects completed a comprehensive survey on their medical and personal history. Standardized digital photographs were taken by medical photographers. Sixteen aesthetic breast features were subjectively rated by 6 plastic surgery residents blinded to the survey results. These ratings were then analyzed against survey data to determine the significance of different exogenous factors on breast appearance.
   Results: A total of 161 pairs of identical female twins (n = 322) with a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.5) years were recruited. Twins who moisturized their skin daily had significantly fewer rhytids (P=.002). Twins who received hormone replacement therapy after menopause had more attractive breast shape, size, projection, areolar shape, and areolar size (P<.03). However, twins who had a higher body mass index, greater number of pregnancies, and larger cup sizes had significantly less attractive breasts (P<.05). Twins who smoked cigarettes and consumed alcohol also had significantly less attractive breasts (P<.05). Twins who breastfed had less attractive areolar size and shape but better skin quality than their counterparts who never breastfed (P<.03). Finally, there was a significantly higher incidence of breast pain in twins who primarily slept on their sides compared with twins who primarily slept on their backs (P<.008).
   Conclusions: This study implicates several environmental factors that significantly affect the aesthetic quality of breasts.

AB Background Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Not all women who consume alcohol during pregnancy have children with FASD and studies have shown that genetic factors can play a role in ethanol teratogenesis. We examined gene expression in embryos and placentae from C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice following prenatal alcohol exposure. B6 fetuses are susceptible to morphological malformations following prenatal alcohol exposure while D2 are relatively resistant. Methods Male and female B6 and D2 mice were mated for 2hours in the morning, producing 4 embryonic genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and D2D2, and reciprocal B6D2 and D2B6. On gestational day 9, dams were intubated with 5.8g/kg ethanol, an isocaloric amount of maltose dextrin, or nothing. Four hours later, dams were sacrificed and embryos and placentae were harvested. RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 v2 microarray chips. Data were normalized, subjected to analysis of variance and tested for enrichment of gene ontology molecular function and biological process using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Results Several gene classes were differentially expressed in B6 and D2 regardless of treatment, including genes involved in polysaccharide binding and mitosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure altered expression of a subset of genes, including genes involved in methylation, chromatin remodeling, protein synthesis, and mRNA splicing. Very few genes were differentially expressed between maltose-exposed tissues and tissues that received nothing, so we combined these groups for comparisons with ethanol. While we observed many expression changes specific to B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure, none were specific for D2. Gene classes up- or down-regulated in B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure included genes involved in mRNA splicing, transcription, and translation. Conclusions Our study identified several classes of genes with altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, including many specific for B6, a strain susceptible to ethanol teratogenesis. Lack of strain specific effects in D2 suggests there are few gene expression changes that confer resistance. Future studies will begin to analyze functional significance of the expression changes.

AB Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as increased motor activity and elevated anxiety, that may last a lifetime. Persistent sleep disruption may underlie these problems. Using a rat model, we investigated long-term alterations of sleep-wake behavior following AE during a critical early developmental period. Male rats received 2.6 g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group), or were sham-intubated (S group). On PD52-80, they were instrumented for tethered electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram recording and habituated to the recording procedures. Sleep-wake behavior was then recorded during one 24 h-long session. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored in 10 s epochs during 6 h of the lights-on (rest) and 6 h of the lights-off (active) periods. During the active period, REMS percentage was significantly lower (4.7 +/- 0.9 (SE) vs. 8.2 +/- 0.9; p < 0.02) and the percentage of SWS tended to be lower (p = 0.07) in AE than S rats (N = 6/group). During the rest period, sleep and wake amounts did not differ between the groups, but AE rats had longer latency to both SWS and REMS onset (p = 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). Our data demonstrate that, in a rat model of prenatal AE, impaired sleep-wake behavior persists into the adulthood. Disordered sleep may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral disorders seen in human victims of prenatal AE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Low-sodium and high-potassium diets have been recommended as an adjunct to prevention and treatment of hypertension. Analysis of these nutrients in 24-h urine has been considered the reference method to estimate daily intake of these minerals. However, 24-h urine collection is difficult in epidemiological studies, since urine must be collected and stored in job environments. Therefore, strategies for shorter durations of urine collection at home have been proposed. We have previously reported that collecting urine during a 12-h period (overnight) is more feasible and that creatinine clearance correlated strongly with that detected in 24-h samples. In the present study, we collected urine for 24 h divided into two 12-h periods (from 7: 00 am to 7: 00 pm and from 7: 00 pm to 7: 00 am next day). A sample of 109 apparently healthy volunteers aged 30 to 74 years of both genders working in a University institution was investigated. Subjects with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, renal insufficiency, and pregnant women were not included. Significant (P < 0.001) Spearman correlation coefficients (r(s)) were found between the total amount of sodium and potassium excreted in the urine collected at night and in the 24-h period (r(s) = 0.76 and 0.74, respectively). Additionally, the 12-h sodium and potassium excretions (means +/- SD, 95% confidence interval) corresponded to 47.3 +/- 11.2%, 95% CI = 45.3-49.3, and 39.3 +/- 4.6%, 95% CI = 37.3-41.3, respectively, of the 24-h excretion of these ions. Therefore, these findings support the assumption that 12-h urine collected at night can be used as a reliable tool to estimate 24-h intake/excretion of sodium and potassium.

AB Surprisingly, in our modern 24/7 society, there is scant information on the impact of developmental chronodisruption like the one experienced by shift worker pregnant women on fetal and postnatal physiology. There are important differences between the maternal and fetal circadian systems; for instance, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master clock in the mother but not in the fetus. Despite this, several tissues/organs display circadian oscillations in the fetus. Our hypothesis is that the maternal plasma melatonin rhythm drives the fetal circadian system, which in turn relies this information to other fetal tissues through corticosterone rhythmic signaling. The present data show that suppression of the maternal plasma melatonin circadian rhythm, secondary to exposure of pregnant rats to constant light along the second half of gestation, had several effects on fetal development. First, it induced intrauterine growth retardation. Second, in the fetal adrenal in vivo it markedly affected the mRNA expression level of clock genes and clock-controlled genes as well as it lowered the content and precluded the rhythm of corticosterone. Third, an altered in vitro fetal adrenal response to ACTH of both, corticosterone production and relative expression of clock genes and steroidogenic genes was observed. All these changes were reversed when the mother received a daily dose of melatonin during the subjective night; supporting a role of melatonin on overall fetal development and pointing to it as a 'time giver' for the fetal adrenal gland. Thus, the present results collectively support that the maternal circadian rhythm of melatonin is a key signal for the generation and/or synchronization of the circadian rhythms in the fetal adrenal gland. In turn, low levels and lack of a circadian rhythm of fetal corticosterone may be responsible of fetal growth restriction; potentially inducing long term effects in the offspring, possibility that warrants further research.

AB Background: Obstetrical interventions, including caesarean sections, are increasing in Canada. Canadian women's psychological states, fatigue, and sleep have not been examined prospectively for contributions to obstetric interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes.
   Context and purpose of the study: The prospective study was conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada with 650 low-risk pregnant women. Of those women, 624 were included in this study. Women were recruited through providers' offices, media, posters, and pregnancy fairs. We examined associations between pregnant women's fatigue, sleep deprivation, and psychological states (anxiety and childbirth fear) and women's exposure to obstetrical interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes (preterm, admission to NICU, low APGARS, and low birth weight).
   Methods: Data from our cross-sectional survey were linked, using women's personal health numbers, to birth outcomes from the Perinatal Services BC database. After stratifying for parity, we used Pearson's Chi-square to examine associations between psychological states, fatigue, sleep deprivation and maternal characteristics. We used hierarchical logistic regression modeling to test 9 hypotheses comparing women with high and low childbirth fear and anxiety on likelihood of having epidural anaesthetic, a caesarean section (stratified for parity), assisted vaginal delivery, and adverse neonatal outcomes and women with and without sleep deprivation and high levels of fatigue on likelihood of giving birth by caesarean section, while controlling for maternal, obstetrical (e.g., infant macrosomia), and psychological variables.
   Results: Significantly higher proportions of multiparas, reporting difficult and upsetting labours and births, expectations of childbirth interventions, and health stressors, reported high levels of childbirth fear. Women who reported antenatal relationship, housing, financial, and health stressors and multiparas reporting low family incomes were significantly more likely to report high anxiety levels. The hypothesis that high childbirth fear significantly increased the risk of using epidural anaesthesia was supported.
   Conclusions: Controlling for some psychological states and sleep quality while examining other contributors to outcomes decreases the likelihood of linking childbirth fear anxiety, sleep deprivation, and fatigue to increased odds of caesarean section. Ameliorating women's childbirth fear to reduce their exposure to epidural anaesthesia can occur through developing effective interventions. These include helping multiparous women process previous experiences of difficult and upsetting labour and birth.

AB Background: Research shows that obesity prevention has to start early. Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2-6 years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity.
   Methods/Design: Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n = 5,902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n = 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 11/2 year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements.
   Discussion: If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first-degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.

TI Sleep-Disordered Breathing: A Risk Factor for Adverse Pregnancy
   Outcomes?
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in pregnancy. Epidemiological studies in adult, nonpregnant populations have reported that SDB can initiate or contribute to the development and progression of several cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. It has also been demonstrated that SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there are only a few studies that have investigated the relationship between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine the relationship between SDB and a variety of pregnancy complications among women who had undergone both a delivery and a formal sleep evaluation with a full in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Participants were 143 women who had a delivery of a singleton pregnancy at 20 weeks or longer as well as a PSG at a university hospital between January 2000 and June 2009. Demographic data, PSG sleep study results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the medical records. The presence and severity of SDB were determined using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Absence of SDB was defined as an AHI of less than 5, mild SDB as an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and moderate to severe SDB as an AHI of 15 or longer. The primary study outcome, a composite measure of adverse pregnancy outcomes, was the occurrence of any of the following: pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth at 34 weeks or less. A possible interaction between obesity and SDB in outcomes was analyzed after stratification of adverse pregnancy outcomes in nonobese [body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m(2)] and obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) women with no SDB versus any (AHI >= 5) and moderate to severe (AHI >= 15) SDB.
   There was a significant association between increasing severity of SDB and increasing risk of the composite APO (18.1% for an AHI of <5, 23.5% for an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and 38.5% for an AHI of >= 15, P = 0.038). The highest rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes (41.7%) was found in obese women with moderate to severe SDB. These findings indicate that moderate to severe SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is unclear, however, whether SDB is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes independent of obesity.

AB Objective: Assessment of the safety and efficacy of a 10-day melarsoprol schedule in second stage T.b. rhodesiense patients and the effect of suramin-pretreatment on the incidence of encephalopathic syndrome (ES) during melarsoprol therapy.
   Design: Sequential conduct of a proof-of-concept trial (n = 60) and a utilization study (n = 78) using historic controls as comparator. Setting: Two trial centres in the T.b. rhodesiense endemic regions of Tanzania and Uganda. Participants: Consenting patients with confirmed second stage disease and a minimum age of 6 years were eligible for participation. Unconscious and pregnant patients were excluded.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were safety and efficacy at end of treatment. The secondary outcome measure was efficacy during follow-up after 3, 6 and 12 months.
   Results: The incidence of ES in the trial population was 11.2% (CI 5-17%) and 13% (CI 9-17%) in the historic data. The respective case fatality rates were 8.4% (CI 3-13.8%) and 9.3% (CI 6-12.6%). All patients discharged alive were free of parasites at end of treatment. Twelve months after discharge, 96% of patients were clinically cured. The mean hospitalization time was reduced from 29 to 13 days (p<0.0001) per patient.
   Conclusions: The 10-day melarsoprol schedule does not expose patients to a higher risk of ES or death than does treatment according to national schedules in current use. The efficacy of the 10-day melarsoprol schedule was highly satisfactory. No benefit could be attributed to the suramin pre-treatment.

AB For women with epilepsy (WWE), the postpartum period is a vulnerable time owing to medication alterations, disrupted sleep, increased stress, and the challenges of breastfeeding. Sleep deprivation and the stress of having a new child can be challenging for WWE. Concerns over antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in breast milk and sleep disruption associated with breastfeeding leads some WWE to discontinue breastfeeding. Adjustment of AEDs in the postpartum period can lead to difficulties in seizure control. Postpartum depression is increased in WWE, and patient education about newborn safety remains a concern. This article covers these important topics in postpartum WWE.

AB Background Individual differences in susceptibility to the detrimental effects of prenatal ethanol (EtOH) exposure have been demonstrated. Many factors, including genetics, play a role in susceptibility and resistance. We have previously shown that C57BL/6J (B6) mice display a number of morphological malformations following an acute dose of EtOH in utero, while DBA/2J (D2) mice are relatively resistant. Here, we present the results of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for EtOH teratogenesis in recombinant inbred strains derived from a cross between B6 and D2 (BXD RIs). Methods Pregnant dams were intubated with either maltose-dextrin or 5.8 g/kg EtOH on day 9 of gestation (GD9). On GD 18, dams were sacrificed and fetuses and placentae were removed. Placentae and fetuses were weighed; fetuses were sexed and examined for gross morphological malformations. Fetuses were then either placed in Bouin's fixative for subsequent soft-tissue analyses or eviscerated and placed in EtOH for subsequent skeletal examinations. QTL mapping for maternal weight gain (MWG), prenatal mortality, fetal weight (FW) at c-section, placental weight (PW), and several morphological malformations was performed using WebQTL. Results Heritability for our traits ranged from 0.06 for PW to 0.39 for MWG. We found suggestive QTLs mediating all phenotypes and significant QTLs for FW and digit and rib malformations. While most QTL regions are large, several intriguing candidate genes emerged based on polymorphisms between B6 and D2 and gene function. Conclusions In this first mapping study for EtOH teratogenesis, several QTLs were identified. Future studies will further characterize these regions. Identification of genes and epigenetic modifications mediating susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of alcohol in mice will provide targets to examine in human populations.

AB The aim of this research was to analyze the relation between coping strategies and somatic symptomatology in pregnant Spanish women and the influence of a previous miscarriage on these variables. We used a correlational retrospective design, which included 207 expectant mothers (44 with a previous miscarriage). The instruments included a questionnaire on coping with stress and questions about first-trimester symptoms. Regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between sleep disturbances and overt emotional expression coping, between tiredness/fatigue and avoidance coping, and between nausea and religious coping. The influence of coping strategies on somatic symptomatology did not differ significantly between women who had had or had not had a previous miscarriage, although women with a previous miscarriage scored higher on the use of religious coping and positive reappraisal and reported more nausea.

AB Background: Infant death rate has declined over the past decades, yet remains high in Palestine. The topic of infant death is well researched and for the first time in Palestine. The objective of our study is to assess the level of awareness and health behaviour of mothers and how this behaviour has affected infant mortality. Methods: Person to person interviews were done with 550 mothers of infants (275 cases and 275 controls) in the Gaza Strip. Stillbirths were excluded. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify the relationship of health behavioural factors and infant mortality. Result: The study showed that infant mortality risks were higher in mothers exposed to passive smoking. Infant mortality was lower for infants receiving exclusive breastfeeding. There was also a significant association between the sleeping position of the baby and infant mortality. Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of explicit attention to health education. A well-organized consultation and health promotion approach should focus on couples whose child has died, in order to combat infant mortality.

AB Epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition found in pregnancy. As such, all neurologists, internists, and obstetricians should know how to counsel women with epilepsy as they are considering pregnancy. While all of the usual recommendations for women of childbearing potential apply, including preconceptual and ongoing use of folic acid, calcium, and vitamin D, additional consideration must be given to the need for adjustment or change of anticonvulsant therapy. Monotherapy with the lowest dose of medication needed to control seizures should be prescribed prior to conception. Most anticonvulsants have a favorable profile when used in pregnancy; older anticonvulsants such as valproate and carbamazepine should be avoided, as they are associated with higher rates of fetal malformation, and in the case of valproate, with proven cognitive deficits in children exposed to this medication in utero. With use of any anticonvulsant medication, dosing throughout pregnancy will need to be adjusted to maintain an appropriate serum concentration. Dosing of anticonvulsants needs to be decreased after delivery to avoid medication-related toxicity, although sleep deprivation and hormonal fluctuation can increase the risk of seizures in postpartum women. With proper management, the majority of women with epilepsy can have uneventful pregnancies and healthy babies.

AB There are few detailed descriptions of parturition behavior in wild primates. Here we report for the first time birth-related behaviors in a highly endangered colobine monkey endemic to southwest China, the white-headed langur (Trachypithecus leucocephalus). We video recorded three complete birth events in three parturient females living in one reproductive group. The births occurred during the night at one of the group's sleeping sites. One parturient was primiparous, while the other two were multiparous. All three delivered close to other group members. Common behaviors among the parturients included adopting a raised-rump posture during contractions, manual inspection of the anogenital area followed by hand-licking, manual self-assistance as the infant emerged, holding and licking the infant immediately after the birth, and ingesting the placenta. However, we found considerable individual variation in birth-related behaviors. The primiparous female had the longest prepartum phase and more contractions than the two multiparous females. All three mothers ingested the placenta, but the primipare took much longer than the two multiparous mothers to deliver the placenta, start to ingest it, and consume it. Other group members had little interaction with the parturients during the prepartum phase, but showed intense interest in the neonates. The newly born infants were held by nonmaternal adult females of the group within 5-9 h of their birth. Our case studies stress the importance of the social context at parturition in group-living primates, and suggest that parity of parturients may influence birth-related behavior.

AB Background Malaria control efforts and elimination in Africa are being challenged by the development of resistance of parasites to antimalarial drugs and vectors to insecticides. We investigated whether the combination of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LLINs) with indoor residual spraying (IRS) or carbamate-treated plastic sheeting (CTPS) conferred enhanced protection against malaria and better management of pyrethroid-resistance in vectors than did LLINs alone.
   Methods We did a cluster randomised controlled trial in 28 villages in southern Benin, west Africa. Inclusion criteria of the villages were moderate level of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors and minimum distance between villages of 2 km. We assessed four malaria vector control interventions: LLIN targeted coverage to pregnant women and children younger than 6 years (TLLIN, reference group), LLIN universal coverage of all sleeping units (ULLIN), TLLIN plus full coverage of carbamate-IRS applied every 8 months (TLLIN+IRS), and ULLIN plus full coverage of CTPS lined up to the upper part of the household walls (ULLIN+CTPS). The interventions were allocated to villages by a block randomisation on the basis of preliminary surveys and children of each village were randomly selected to participate with computer-generated numbers. The primary endpoint was the incidence density rate of Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria in children younger than 6 years as was analysed by Poisson regression taking into account the effect of age and the sampling design with a generalised estimating equation approach. Clinical and parasitological information were obtained by active case detection of malaria episodes during 12 periods of 6 consecutive days scheduled at six weekly intervals and by cross-sectional surveys of asymptomatic plasmodial infections. Children or study investigators were not masked to study group. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN07404145.
   Findings Of 58 villages assessed, 28 were randomly assigned to intervention groups. 413-429 children were followed up in each intervention group for 18 months. The clinical incidence density of malaria was not reduced in the children from the ULLIN group (incidence density rate 0.95, 95% CI 0.67-1.36, p=0.79), nor in those from the TLLIN+IRS group (1.32, 0.90-1.93, p=0.15) or from the ULLIN+CTPS group (1.05, 0.75-1.48, p=0.77) compared with the reference group (TLLIN). The same trend was observed with the prevalence and parasite density of asymptomatic infections (non significant regression coefficients).
   Interpretation No significant benefit for reducing malaria morbidity, infection, and transmission was reported when combining LLIN+IRS or LLIN+CTPS compared with a background of LLIN coverage. These findings are important for national malaria control programmes and should help the design of more cost-effective strategies for malaria control and elimination.

AB Study Design. A cross-sectional, multicenter study.
   Objective. To determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnant Spanish women and to identify the factors associated with a higher risk.
   Summary of Background Data. Previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors for LBP and PGP have shown inconsistent results.
   Methods. Sixty-one clinicians across 5 regions in Spain recruited 1158 women with a median (interquartile range) pregnancy of 35 (range, 31-38) weeks. Validated methods were used to gather data on the prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP, anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics, history of LBP, obstetrical history, physical activity before and during pregnancy, mattress and sleep characteristics, disability, anxiety, and depression. Separate multiple logistic regression models were developed to identify the variables associated with LBP, LP, and PGP.
   Results. The 4-week prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP was 71.3%, 46.2%, and 64.7%, respectively. Main factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting pain for LBP were history of LBP related and unrelated to previous pregnancy and postpartum, pain augmenting with time spent in bed, and anxiety. Previous lumbar surgery was associated with a lower risk. The factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting LP were reporting LBP, lower academic level, younger age, depression, a lower number of hours of sleep per day, and a higher BMI, and for PGP were higher score for depression, a higher body mass index, and a more advanced stage of pregnancy.
   Conclusion. Factors associated with a higher risk vary between LBP and PGP. History of LBP, related or not to previous pregnancy or postpartum, LBP surgery, and anxiety were the factors more strongly associated with pregnancy-related LBP. When these variables are taken into account, obstetrical data from current or previous pregnancies and other variables do not show a significant association with LBP. Stage of pregnancy and depression were associated with PGP.

AB The aims of this study were to examine: (1) the association between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and sleep quality in a population-based cohort of Australian women and (2) possible influence of reproductive status and mental and physical health factors on these associations. Data on 3,655 women (mean age = 46.6 years, range 34.3-67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study. Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to divide women into three categories: normal (65.2 %), moderately poor (26.4 %), and very poor sleep quality (8.5 %). Other covariates were measured at 21-year follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality. Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women.

   MIGRATION; BEHAVIORAL STATES
AB Due to the progress in fetal surgery, it is important to acquire data about fetal pain. Material and methods: We performed a Medline research from 1995, matching the following key words: "pain" and "fetus", with the following: "subplate", "thalamocortical", "myelination", "analgesia", "anesthesia", "brain", "behavioral states", "substance p". We focused on: (a) fetal development of nociceptive pathways; (b) fetal electrophysiological, endocrinological and behavioral reactions to stimuli and pain. Results: We retrieved 217 papers of which 157 were highly informative; some reported similar data or were only case-reports, and were not quoted. Most endocrinological, behavioral and electrophysiological studies of fetal pain are performed in the third trimester, and they seem to agree that the fetus in the 3rd trimester can experience pain. But the presence of fetal pain in the 2nd trimester is less evident. In favor of a 2nd trimester perception of pain is the early development of spino-thalamic pathways (approximately from the 20th week), and the connections of the thalamus with the subplate (approximately from the 23rd week). Against this possibility, some authors report the immaturity of the cortex with the consequent lack of awareness, and the almost continuous state of sleep of the fetus. Conclusions: Most studies disclose the possibility of fetal pain in the third trimester of gestation. This evidence becomes weaker before this date, though we cannot exclude its increasing presence since the beginning of the second half of the gestation.

AB A small number of studies have, thus far, evaluated the association between maternal snoring and fetal growth revealing conflicting results. No study has compared fetal growth between women with habitual snoring who snored before pregnancy and women with habitual snoring that started to snore during pregnancy.
   Objectives: To examine the effect of maternal snoring on fetal outcome and to investigate the differences between "chronic snorers" and "new-onset snorers". Methods: Women of singleton, uncomplicated, full-term pregnancies completed a questionnaire. Obstetric and labor records were reviewed. Newborn records were reviewed for gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score and gender. Results: 246 low risk women were studied. Mean BMI at the beginning of pregnancy was 22.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2). 32% reported habitual snoring. Of those, 26% were chronic snorers and 74% were new-onset snorers. Neither significant difference in fetal growth was found between snorers and non-snorers nor between chronic snorers and new-onset snorers. Increased rate of nulliparous women was found in new-onset snorers compared with both chronic snorers and non-snorers (54 vs. 25 and 29% respectively; p = 0.001). Conclusions: In pregnant women with no apparent risk factors, maternal snoring does not affect fetal growth. No differences in maternal characteristics or fetal outcome were found between chronic snorers and new-onset snorers.

TI Patient and provider perceptions of sleep disordered breathing
   assessment during prenatal care: a survey-based observational study
SO THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
DE antenatal care; obesity; pregnancy; screening; sleep disordered
   breathing; snoring
AB Objectives: Screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) remains poor in the general population, despite evidence for association with adverse outcomes and improvement of certain outcomes with therapy. Data from the past decade have suggested an association between snoring and adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders. However, it is unclear how often SDB is screened for in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether, and how, symptoms of SDB are assessed during prenatal care.
   Methods: This study was designed as a survey-based observational study. Within 48 hours of delivery, English-speaking patients were surveyed regarding prenatal conversations with obstetric providers about symptoms of SDB. During a similar time period, obstetric providers completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding how often they discussed the same symptoms during prenatal visits.
   Results: A total of 776 patients and 80 providers performing the majority of deliveries at the same hospital answered the survey. Nurse providers asked about sleep quality significantly more often than physician providers; however, responses to questions about snoring were similar in both groups. Resident physicians were the least likely to ask about sleep quality. Less than 3% of providers reported asking about snoring, closely matching patient responses. A total of 44% of patients surveyed were overweight and 21.7% were obese. Although 32% of patients snored, only 5% were asked about snoring during a prenatal visit. Obese women and women with a history of gestational hypertensive disorders were more likely to report being asked about snoring.
   Conclusions: Based on patient and obstetric provider recollections of discussions, the issue of SDB is poorly assessed during routine prenatal care, despite an increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the pregnant population.

AB The laboratory rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is widely used as a model for human diseases, because of its size, which permits non-lethal monitoring of physiological changes and similar disease characteristics. Novel transgenic tools such as, the zinc finger nuclease method and the sleeping beauty transposon mediated or BAC transgenesis were recently adapted to the laboratory rabbit and opened new opportunities in precise tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression/silencing, coupled with increased transgenic efficiencies. Many facets of human development and diseases cannot be investigated in rodents. This is especially true for early prenatal development, its long-lasting effects on health and complex disorders, and some economically important diseases such as atherosclerosis or cardiovascular diseases. The first transgenic rabbits models of arrhythmogenesis mimic human cardiac diseases much better than transgenic mice and hereby underline the importance of non-mouse models. Another emerging field is epigenetic reprogramming and pathogenic mechanisms in diabetic pregnancy, where rabbit models are indispensable. Beyond that rabbit is used for decades as major source of polyclonal antibodies and recently in monoclonal antibody production. Alteration of its genome to increase the efficiency and value of the antibodies by humanization of the immunoglobulin genes, or by increasing the expression of a special receptor (Fc receptor) that augments humoral immune response is a current demand.

AB Sleep is an essential human behavior that shows prominent gender differences. Disturbed sleep, in particular, is much more prevalent in females than males. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) as one cause of disturbed sleep was observed to be somewhat more common among women than men in Ekbom's 1945 seminal series of clinical cases with the disease. He, however, reported this gender difference mainly for those with more severe symptoms. Since then numerous studies have reported that women are affected by RLS about twice as often as males for mild as well as moderate to severe RLS. The present review focuses on RLS in females from the perspectives of both epidemiology and pathophysiology. RLS will generally become worse or might appear for the first time during pregnancy. Parity increases the risk of RLS later in life suggesting that pregnancy is a specific behavioral risk factor for developing RLS. Some evidence suggests that dysfunction in iron metabolism and high estrogen levels might contribute to RLS during pregnancy. But, menopause does not lower the incidence of RLS nor does hormone replacement therapy lead to an increase, suggesting a quite complex uncertain role of hormones in the pathophysiology of RLS. Therefore, further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the factors causing RLS in women. These studies should include genetic, clinical and polysomnographic variables, as well as hormonal measures and variables assessing iron metabolism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Prevention is considered effective in combating the obesity epidemic. Prenatal environment may increase offspring's risk for obesity. A child starts to adopt food preferences and other behavioral habits affecting weight gain during preschool years. We report the study protocol of a pragmatic lifestyle intervention aiming at primary prevention of childhood obesity.
   Methods/Design: A non-randomized controlled pragmatic trial in maternity and child health care clinics. The control group was recruited among families who visited the same clinics one year earlier. Eligibility criteria was mother at risk for gestational diabetes: body mass index >= 25 kg/m(2), macrosomic newborn in any previous pregnancy, immediate family history of diabetes and/or age >= 40 years. All maternity clinics in town involved in recruitment. The gestational intervention consisted of individual counseling on diet and physical activity by a public health nurse, and of two group counseling sessions. Intervention continues until offspring's age of five years. An option to participate a group counseling at child's age 1 to 2 years was offered. The intervention includes advice on healthy diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleeping pattern. The main outcome measure is offspring BMI z-score and its changes by the age of six years.
   Discussion: Early childhood is a critical time period for prevention of obesity. Pragmatic trials targeting this period are necessary in order to find effective obesity prevention programs feasible in normal health care practice.

AB In recent years the number of functional neuroimaging studies on adolescence has exploded. These studies have led to important new insights about the relation between functional brain development and behavior. However, special consideration is warranted when working with adolescents. In this review, we review variables, including pubertal stage, sleep patterns and pregnancy, which are particularly relevant for developmental cognitive neuroscience studies involving adolescents. Consideration of the unique challenges associated with adolescence will help the growing field of developmental neuroimaging standardize procedures and will eventually facilitate interpretation across studies.

TI Rhinosinusitis-related quality of life during pregnancy
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ALLERGIC RHINITIS; NASAL; HYPERTENSION; DIAGNOSIS; LACTATION; SNOT-20
AB Background: Pregnancy rhinitis manifests as nasal congestion, with resolution of symptoms after delivery. Eighteen to 30% of pregnant patients report symptoms of rhinitis. Pregnancy rhinitis may have an adverse effect on quality of life (QOL) and may cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which in turn may adversely affect the outcome of pregnancy. Previous examinations of the prevalence of pregnancy rhinitis during different stages of pregnancy have been inconclusive. This study aimed to determine rhinosinusitis-specific QOL during different stages of pregnancy.
   Methods: A cross-sectional observation study of patients in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy using the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) was conducted in the obstetric clinic at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, Canada. Seventy-six low-risk pregnant patients were included in the study. Thirty-two patients were in the second trimester of pregnancy and 44 patients were in the third trimester.
   Results: Average item scores for the entire questionnaire were significantly higher (p = 0.041), indicating more severe impairment of QOL, in the third trimester in comparison with the second trimester. A comparison between women with and without preexisting allergic rhinitis, in both the second and the third trimesters, shows significantly higher SNOT-22 scores for the allergic group (p = 0.007). QOL was lower in the third trimester than in nonrhinosinusitis patients (p = 0.011).
   Conclusion: Rhinosinusitis-specific QOL is lower in the third trimester of pregnancy in comparison with the second trimester and also in comparison with nonrhinosinusitis patients. Increased awareness may enhance the QOL of pregnant patients, prevent OSA, and thereby positively influence the outcome of pregnancy.

AB Thalidomide and its one analogue, lenalidomide (CC5103 or revlimid) are recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by an overproduction of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. The journey of thalidomide was started in 1956 when it was marketed as a non-barbiturate sedative agent. It was considered as a "wonder drug" that provided safe and sound sleep and hence, used to cure morning sickness in pregnant women. Later, in 1961, it was withdrawn from the world market due to its serious side effects, i.e., teratogenic activity. However, the recent decade has witnessed a true renaissance in interest in its broad biological activity. In particular, thalidomide was reevaluated and attracted significant attention due to its selective inhibitory activity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which is a clinically important activity against serious diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, leprosy, AIDS, and various cancers. The comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Recently, the drug has got FDA approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the last few years, number of thalidomide analogues have been synthesized and are in clinical development as a class of immunomodulatory drugs. Among these, lenalidomide is more potent than thalidomide, and is also non-neurotoxic. It was shown in vitro studies to induce apoptosis or arrest growth even in resistant multiple myeloma cell lines, decrease binding of the cells to bone marrow stromal cells, and stimulate host natural killer cell immunity. It also inhibits tumour growth and decreases angiogenesis. Earlier reviews have described the pharmacological aspects of thalidomide and a review has focused only on synthetic aspect of thalidomide. However, review focusing on chemistry and metabolism and mechanism of biological activity is still lacking. In this review, we will concisely describe the therapeutic aspects, metabolism and synthesis of thalidomide.

AB The current literature suggests that nighttime sleep is compromised during late pregnancy and early postpartum periods, but little is known about the 24-hour sleep pattern during this time. This study aims to first, explore the day-to-day changes in the quantity and quality of objectively measured sleep during the week immediately before and after the day of delivery, and second, to provide descriptive data on timing of naps during late pregnancy and the first week postpartum. Twenty-four healthy women completed one week of actigraphy assessment during the third trimester, and six days before and after delivery. Demographic and obstetric information was collected via questionnaires. Nighttime sleep was significantly disrupted and shortened immediately after giving birth, while napping behavior significantly increased. Total sleep time across 24 hours, however, remained stable due to increased napping behaviors. Across the first postpartum week, nighttime sleep improved linearly, with its quantity, but not quality, comparable to that of the third trimester on the sixth postpartum day. Napping behavior decreased linearly during the first postpartum week, although participants continued to take more naps on the sixth postpartum day than during the third trimester. During antenatal periods, naps were most likely to occur during early afternoon, while during the first postpartum week, naps were evenly distributed across late morning to early evening. These findings suggest that sleep is redistributed across 24-hour periods during immediate postpartum, and this redistribution raises questions on the restorative value of sleep women obtain after giving birth.

AB To assess the presence of insomnia and sleepiness and related factors in the late third trimester of pregnancy.
   A total of 370 singleton gravids completed a general questionnaire containing personal data, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In addition, maternal anthropometry was recorded upon survey.
   Median [interquartile range] maternal age and gestational age upon survey was of 31 [7.0] years and 39 [1.8] weeks, respectively. A 73.5% of women displayed some degree of insomnia (Total ISI score 8-28) and 22.2% sleepiness (Total ESS score a parts per thousand yen10). Determined rho Spearman coefficients showed significant correlations between ISI scores and gestational age at survey and survey to birth interval (weeks) and between ESS scores and maternal weight and arm circumference at survey and neonatal birth weight. Multiple linear regression analysis found that smoking habit, higher blood pressure and shorter survey to birth interval (weeks) significantly predicted higher ISI scores, and hence a higher risk of insomnia. Employed status, increased arm circumference and neonatal weight predicted higher ESS scores (sleepiness).
   Insomnia and sleepiness were prevalent in the late third trimester of pregnancy in which lifestyle factors and maternal and neonatal body composition were significant predictors.

AB Pruritus is a common symptom of hepatobiliary disorders and may considerably diminish quality of life. Cholestatic pruritus exerts a circadian rhythm and is typically most severe in the evening hours and early at night. Itching is reported often to be most intense at the palms and the soles, but may also be generalized. The pathophysiological mechanisms of cholestatic pruritus have not been completely clarified. In the past, bile salts, histamine, progesterone metabolites and opioids have been discussed as potential causal substances; a correlation with itch intensity could never be proven. The enzyme autotaxin, which releases lysophosphatidic acid, has recently been identified as potential cholestatic pruritogen. Treatment aims to bind pruritogens in the gut lumen by resins such as cholestyramine, to modulate pruritogen metabolism by rifampicin and to influence central itch signaling by A mu-opioid antagonists and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. In cases of refractory pruritus experimental treatment options such as UV-therapy, extracorporeal albumin dialysis and nasobiliary drainage may be considered.

AB Background: Docosahexaenoic acid (DNA; 22:6n-3) is highly important during pregnancy for optimal development and functioning of fetal neural tissue. Infant ability to organize sleep and wake states following parturition is highly associated with later developmental outcomes. The impact of maternal DHA intake on sleep organization has not been previously investigated.
   Aims: To examine the effect of a DHA-containing functional food consumed during pregnancy on early neurobehavioral development as assessed by infant sleep patterning in the first 48 postnatal hours.
   Study design: A longitudinal, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design was used.
   Subjects: Women (18-35y) with no pregnancy complications consumed a cereal-based functional food (92 kcal) containing 300 mg DHA an average of 5 d/week or placebo bars (n=27 DHA, n=21 Placebo). The intervention began at 24 weeks gestation and continued until delivery (38-40 weeks).
   Outcome measures: Infant sleep/wake states were measured on postnatal days 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) using a pressure sensitive mattress recording respiration and body movements.
   Results: Using ANCOVA and controlling for ethnic variation, there were significant group differences in arousals in quiet sleep on D1 (P=0.006) and D2 (P=0.011) with fewer arousals in the DHA intervention group compared to the placebo group. Similarly, arousals in active sleep on D1 were significantly lower in the DNA-intervention group (P=0.012) compared to the placebo group.
   Conclusions: We conclude that increased prenatal supply of dietary DNA has a beneficial impact on infant sleep organization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. To study development of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during and after pregnancy, and whether RLS is related to snoring or other pregnancy-related symptoms. Design. Prospective study. Setting. Antenatal care clinics in the catchment area of Linkoping university hospital, Sweden. Population. Five hundred consecutively recruited pregnant women. Methods. Sleep disturbances, including symptoms of RLS and snoring, were assessed with questionnaires in each trimester. A complementary questionnaire was sent three years after delivery to women experiencing symptoms of RLS during pregnancy. Main outcome measures. Symptoms of RLS in relation to snoring in each trimester. Results. Symptoms of RLS were reported by 17.0% of the women in the first trimester, by 27.1% in the second trimester and by 29.6% in the third trimester. Snoring in the first trimester was correlated to increased prevalence of RLS in all three trimesters (p= 0.003, 0.017 and 0.044 in the first, second and third trimester, respectively). No correlation was found between RLS and anemia, parity or body mass index. Among the women who experienced RLS, 31% still had symptoms three years after delivery. Fifty-eight per cent of those whose symptoms had disappeared stated that this happened within one month after delivery. Conclusions. Symptoms of RLS progressed most between the first and second trimester. Women who snored in the first or second trimester of pregnancy had a higher prevalence of RLS in the third trimester, which indicates that snoring in early pregnancy might predict RLS later. Symptoms of RLS disappear quite soon after delivery, but about one-third of women with RLS during pregnancy may still have symptoms three years after childbirth.

AB A total of 256 men were studied to evaluate whether serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) impacted semen quality or reproductive hormones. Blood and semen were collected and analyzed for perfluorochemicals and reproductive and thyroid hormones. Semen quality was assessed using standard clinical methods. Linear and logistic modeling was performed with semen profile measurements as outcomes and PFOS and PFOA in semen and plasma as explanatory variables. Adjusting for age, abstinence, and tobacco use, there was no indication that PFOA or PFOS was significantly associated with volume, sperm concentration, percent motility, swim-up motility and concentration, and directional motility (a function of motility and modal progression). Follicle-stimulating hormone was not associated with either PFOA or PFOS. Luteinizing hormone was positively correlated with plasma PFOA and PFOS, but not semen PFOS. Important methodological concerns included the lack of multiple hormonal measurements necessary to address circadian rhythms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sleep disordered breathing and its symptoms have been associated with a multitude of fetal and maternal complications including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and possibly pre-term labour and other markers of alterations in fetal wellbeing. The disease remains underdiagnosed in the general population but likely also in pregnancy, mostly because providers do not appropriately screen for the disorder. Sleep disordered breathing may manifest differently in women, since women report more fatigue and less snoring than men do. This paper discusses typical presentations of sleep disordered breathing but also reports some less obvious presentations to help providers recognise those manifestations and screen for the disorder when warranted. Our case series describes patients with diagnoses such as chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, nocturnal asthma and panic attacks, who were diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing and offered treatment with CPAP during pregnancy.

AB Physiological rhythms entrained by the circadian clock are present in virtually all organs including those of the reproductive system. In mammals, circadian timing is driven by a 'master clock' in the supra-chiasmatic nucleus that influences peripheral tissue clocks via endocrine, autonomic and behavioral cues. The molecular clock machinery comprises a network of 'clock' genes, namely Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2. These clock genes generate endogenous oscillations that drive rhythmic expression of downstream genes and thus physiological and behavioral processes. Importantly, disturbances in clock gene expression are implicated in a range of pathologies including cancer and obesity. The recent recognition that clock genes are expressed in the placenta, together with observations linking circadian disruption with compromised placental function, suggests that circadian variation may be an important component of the normal placental phenotype. In this review we consider this possibility in the context of maternal circadian physiology in pregnancy. While there is good evidence for rhythmic expression of several genes in the rodent placenta, the conventional transcriptional-translational feedback loops of the clock machinery appear less robust and coordinated. Further study is needed to elucidate the function of the placental clock genes across gestation and among different species, particularly those in which greater circadian development occurs in utero. Such studies will likely provide important insights into placental physiology and pathology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   ESTIMATE; MORTALITY CURVES; BIRTH; SIDS; RATES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RISK
AB Background: While the reduction in infants' prone sleeping has led to a temporal decline in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), some aspects of this trend remain unexplained. We assessed whether changes in the gestational age distribution of births also contributed to the temporal reduction in SIDS.
   Methods: SIDS patterns among singleton and twin births in the United States were analysed in 1995-96 and 2004-05. The temporal reduction in SIDS was partitioned using the Kitagawa decomposition method into reductions due to changes in the gestational age distribution and reductions due to changes in gestational age-specific SIDS rates. Both the traditional and the fetuses-at-risk models were used.
   Results: SIDS rates declined with increasing gestation under the traditional perinatal model. Rates were higher at early gestation among singletons compared with twins, while the reverse was true at later gestation. Under the fetuses-at-risk model, SIDS rates increased with increasing gestation and twins had higher rates of SIDS than singletons at all gestational ages. Between 1995-96 and 2004-05, SIDS declined from 8.3 to 5.6 per 10,000 live births among singletons and from 14.2 to 10.6 per 10,000 live births among twins. Decomposition using the traditional model showed that the SIDS reduction among singletons and twins was entirely due to changes in the gestational age-specific SIDS rate. The fetuses-at-risk model attributed 45% of the SIDS reduction to changes in the gestational age distribution and 55% of the reduction to changes in gestational age-specific SIDS rates among singletons; among twins these proportions were 64% and 36%, respectively.
   Conclusion: Changes in the gestational age distribution may have contributed to the recent temporal reduction in SIDS.

TI Determinants of Use of Insecticide Treated Nets for the Prevention of

   IMPLICATIONS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; WESTERN KENYA; WOMEN; OWNERSHIP;
   PERCEPTIONS; TANZANIA
AB Background: One established means of preventing the adverse consequences of malaria during pregnancy is sleeping under an insecticide treated net (ITN) throughout pregnancy. Despite increased access to this intervention over time, consistent ITN use during pregnancy remains relatively uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We sought to identify determinants of ITN use during pregnancy. Utilizing a population-based random sample, we interviewed 500 women living in Jinja, Uganda, who had been pregnant in the past year. ITN ownership at the start of pregnancy was reported by 359 women (72%) and 28 women (20%) acquired an ITN after the first trimester of pregnancy. Among 387 ITN owners, 73% reported either always sleeping under the ITN during all trimesters of pregnancy, or after acquiring their net. Owning more than 1 net was slightly associated with always sleeping under an ITN during pregnancy (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28). Women who always slept under an ITN during pregnancy were more likely to be influenced by an advertisement on the radio/poster than being given an ITN free of charge (RR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.76). No differences were found between other socio-demographic factors, pregnancy history, ANC use or socio-cultural factors.
   Conclusions/Significance: While self-reported ITN ownership and use was common throughout pregnancy, we were unable to pinpoint why a sizable fraction of Ugandan women did not always adhere to recommendations for use of an ITN during pregnancy. More data are needed on the capacity of individual households to support the installation of ITNs which may provide insight into interventions targeted at improving the convenience and adherence of daily ITN use.

TI Hypergravity disruption of homeorhetic adaptations to lactation in rat
   dams include changes in circadian clocks
SO BIOLOGY OPEN
LA English
DT Article
DE Circadian; Hypergravity; Homeorhesis; Lactation; Mammary; Pregnancy
AB Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G] 11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P] 3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation. (C) 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI Ownership and usage of mosquito nets after four years of large-scale

SO MALARIA JOURNAL

DE Malaria; Insecticide-treated nets; Papua New Guinea
ID PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; MALARIA
AB Background: Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a highly malaria endemic country in the South-West Pacific with a population of approximately 6.6 million (2009). In 2004, the country intensified its malaria control activities with support from the Global Fund. With the aim of achieving 80% ownership and usage, a country-wide campaign distributed two million free long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs).
   Methods: In order to evaluate outcomes of the campaign against programme targets, a country-wide household survey based on stratified multi-stage random sampling was carried out in 17 of the 20 provinces after the campaign in 2008/09. In addition, a before-after assessment was carried out in six purposively selected sentinel sites. A structured questionnaire was administered to the heads of sampled households to elicit net ownership and usage information.
   Results: After the campaign, 64.6% of households owned a LLIN, 80.1% any type of mosquito net. Overall usage by household members amounted to 32.5% for LLINs and 44.3% for nets in general. Amongst children under five years, 39.5% used a LLIN and 51.8% any type of net, whereas 41.3% of pregnant women used a LLIN and 56.1% any net. Accessibility of villages was the key determinant of net ownership, while usage was mainly determined by ownership. Most (99.5%) of the household members who did not sleep under a net did not have access to a (unused) net in their household. In the sentinel sites, LLIN ownership increased from 9.4% to 88.7%, ownership of any net from 52.7% to 94.1%. Usage of LLINs increased from 5.5% to 55.1%, usage of any net from 37.3% to 66.7%. Among children under five years, usage of LLINs and of nets in general increased from 8.2% to 67.0% and from 44.6% to 76.1%, respectively (all p <= 0.001).
   Conclusions: While a single round of free distribution of LLINs significantly increased net ownership, an insufficient number of nets coupled with a heterogeneous distribution led to overall low usage rates. Programme targets were missed mainly as a result of the distribution mechanism itself and operational constraints in this very challenging setting.

AB Perinatal depression is an important public health problem affecting 10% to 20% of childbearing women. Perinatal depression is associated with significant morbidity, and has enormous consequences for the wellbeing of the mother and child. During the perinatal period, treatment of depression, which could affect the mother and child during pregnancy and lactation, poses a complex problem for both mother and clinician. Bright light therapy may be an attractive treatment for perinatal depression because it is low cost, home-based, and has a much lower side effect profile than pharmacotherapy. The antidepressant effects of bright light are well established, and there are several rationales for expecting that bright light might also be efficacious for perinatal depression. This review describes these rationales, summarizes the available evidence on the efficacy of bright light therapy for perinatal depression, and discusses future directions for investigation of bright light therapy as a treatment for perinatal depression.

AB Objective: To compare clinical manifestations and polysomnographic data of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in younger (less than 30 years old) versus older premenopausal women.
   Methods: A cohort of 420 premenopausal women diagnosed with SDB in a university sleep clinic during a 5-year period underwent systematic collection of clinical and polysomnographic variables.
   Results: One-hundred and fifteen (27.4%) women were younger than 30 (mean 24.5 +/- 3.5 years), while 305 (72.6%) were older than 30 (mean 39.5 +/- 5.7 years). The younger premenopausal women had less severe SDB with a trend towards upper-airway resistance syndrome. Despite similar daytime consequences, snoring was less common in the younger group. Both groups of premenopausal women frequently had insomnia and nasal abnormalities or craniofacial-deficiency.
   Conclusion: Recognizing the different clinical features and understanding the different polysomnographic presentation of SDB in young premenopausal women are crucial to detecting and treating this syndrome. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Relationship of Nocturnal Melatonin to Estradiol and Progesterone in

AB Purpose: To assess the relationship between nocturnal plasma melatonin and serum estradiol (E-2) and progesterone (P-4) levels in depressed pregnant women (DW) and matched healthy women (HW).
   Methods: We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression analyses on data obtained from pregnant HW and DW.
   Results: Log E-2 and log P-4 were positively correlated with measures of melatonin quantity in HW (p < 0.05) but not DW, controlling for age. Log E-2 and log P-4 were positively correlated with melatonin offset and duration in DW (p < 0.01) but not HW.
   Conclusions: Pregnant DW may be less sensitive than HW to modulation of melatonin secretion by E-2 and P-4. That melatonin timing measures are more sensitive to E-2 and P-4 variation in DW may reflect a circadian system more attuned to the need for realignment in DW than in HW. These altered sensitivities to reproductive hormones may reflect a biologic vulnerability that predisposes some pregnant women to depression.

   women themselves
SO MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Fetal movement; Fetal movement acceleration measurement recorder; Fetal
   well-being; Home monitoring; Ultrasonography
AB Fetal movement is one index of fetal well-being. We designed and built a new recorder based on fetal movement acceleration measurement (FMAM). The FMAM recorder has a newly developed, capacitive acceleration sensor that can detect the oscillations of the maternal abdominal wall caused by fetal movements. In this study, the recorder was examined for its suitability for long-term home monitoring of fetal movement by pregnant women themselves.
   Experiment 1: Fourteen pregnant women underwent 45 examinations in the laboratory at gestational 20-39 weeks. We simultaneously recorded fetal movement as detected by the recorder, ultrasonography, and maternal perception, and then calculated agreement among the three methods. We evaluated agreement using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Agreement for gross fetal movement as detected by FMAM and ultrasonography was substantial or almost perfect, while agreement between maternal perception and ultrasonography was moderate or substantial. Experiment 11: Six pregnant women undertook 53 experiments at home by themselves. Fetal movement during maternal nocturnal sleep was successfully recorded 50 out of 53 times at home.
   In conclusion, there was high agreement for gross fetal movement between FMAM and ultrasonography. The recorder is promising for objective, accurate, and long-term home monitoring of gross fetal movement by pregnant women themselves. (C) 2011 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of ovarian hormones on hamster ultradian rhythms (URs) is unknown. We concurrently monitored URs and circadian rhythms (CRs) of home cage locomotor activity during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation of Syrian hamsters. URs with a mean period of 4-5 h were evident during the dark phase in more than 90% of females on days 1 and 2 of the estrous cycle but were significantly less prevalent on cycle days 3 and 4. The period of the UR did not vary as a function of estrous cycle stage, but at all stages, the UR period was longer in the dark than the light phase. The UR acrophase occurred significantly earlier on cycle day 4 than on days 1 and 2, and UR robustness and amplitude were reduced on days 3 and 4. Robustness, mesor, and amplitude of CRs were greater during cycle days 3 and 4; timing of the CR acrophase was delayed on day 4 relative to all other cycle days. Effects of the estrous cycle on URs were evident only during the dark phase. The proportion of hamsters displaying dark phase URs increased significantly during early and late gestation and decreased during lactation. Pregnancy significantly increased UR complexity, robustness, and amplitude. The emergence of URs over gestation was paralleled by decrements in the robustness and amplitude of CRs, which also were absent in a significant proportion of dams during lactation but re-emerged at weaning of litters. The changing endocrine profile of the estrous cycle, hormonal dynamics of pregnancy and lactation, and nursing demands placed on dams are each associated with alterations in the expression of ultradian and circadian locomotor rhythms. Diminution of CRs and augmentation of URs may afford greater behavioral flexibility during life stages when interactions with mates and offspring are less predictable.

TI Antidepressants May Mitigate the Effects of Prenatal Maternal Anxiety on

   ADHD SYMPTOMS
AB Objective: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring's neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use.
   Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD=38).
   Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus.
   Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction, resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia and sleep fragmentation. Pathophysiological sequelae include sympathetic activation, increased oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory response, culminating in endothelial dysfunction. These are the proposed mechanisms that mediate the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease among patients with OSA outside of pregnancy. It is intriguing to consider the consequences of these events on pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing literature on the impact of maternal OSA on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes and impaired fetal growth. The data, while promising, require confirmation with larger numbers to verify the findings. OSA may be an important mediator of the poor perinatal outcomes associated with maternal obesity; moreover, one which may be amenable to treatment. This review discusses OSA and summarizes the current literature linking OSA with adverse perinatal outcomes.

ID CONSORT STATEMENT; EFFICACY; QUALITY; TRIALS; WOMEN
AB The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the peripartum outcomes of yoga during pregnancy, including the postpartum period and lactation. The PubMed database was analyzed from January 1970 to January 2011. We identified five prospective observational studies (n = 575) and three randomized clinical trials (RCTs; n = 298), which were analyzed separately. The nonrandomized trials indicated a significant reduction in rates of preterm labor (p < 0.0006), intrauterine growth retardation (p < 0.003), low birth weight (p < 0.01), pregnancy discomforts (p 0.01), and perceived sleep disturbances (p = 0.03) in those who practiced yoga during pregnancy. Results of the RCTs indicated that doing yoga during pregnancy can significantly lower pain and discomfort (p < 0.05) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) and improve quality of life in physical domains (p = 0.001). All three RCTs were poorly compliant with the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials statement. While awaiting an appropriately designed RCT to determine the benefits of yoga during pregnancy, it remains a viable exercise option.

AB Aims and objectives. To explore the impact of delivery mode on womens postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background. Childbirth significantly affects puerperas physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design. Cross-sectional study design. Methods. Women residing in rural areas and in their 012 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate womens socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results. The overall caeserean section rate was 70.0% (962/1375), and most of them (59.7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.

AB This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant and postpartum women, to estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, Berlin Questionnaire for sleep disordered breathing, the international restless leg syndrome (IRLS) Study Group criteria, and the Johns Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview Form (JHTDIF) for RLS. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0. Six hundred eighty-nine women completed sleep surveys. The overall percentage of women with very poor sleep quality (a PSQI score greater than 10), clinically significant insomnia (a total score of 9 or more), excessive daytime sleepiness (a total ESS score of 10 or more), short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) were 80.7%, 50.5%, 34.0% and 29.5%, respectively, and all of three parameters became increased as pregnancy progressed and after delivery (p = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The overall positive rates in Berlin and RLS questionnaires were 25.4% and 19.4%. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are prevalent among Korean pregnant and postpartum women, and increase significantly as pregnancy progresses and after delivery.

AB In this pilot study we examined the relationship between objective and subjective sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms in 22 healthy primiparous postpartum women within 3 months after delivery. We found that none of the women in our study had clinically significant depression scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; nonetheless, a variable duration of night-time sleep from night to night during the 7-day monitoring period and reported awakening too early were significantly correlated with increased depressive symptoms. Results suggest that first-time mothers who complain of irregular night-time sleep duration and waking up too early should be screened and evaluated for potential postpartum depressive symptoms.

AB Throughout our evolutionary history, humankind has always lived in contact with large numbers of pathogens. Some cultural traits, such as sedentarization and animal domestication, have considerably increased new parasitic contacts and epidemic transitions. Here, we review the various phenotypic traits that have been proposed to be affected by the highly parasitic human environment, including fertility, birth weight, fluctuating asymmetry, body odours, food recipes, sexual behaviour, pregnancy sickness, language, religion and intellectual quotient. We also discuss how such knowledge is important to understanding several aspects of the current problems faced by humanity in our changing world and to predicting the long-term consequences of parasite eradication policies on our health and well-being. The study of the evolutionary interactions between humans and parasites is a burgeoning and most promising field, as demonstrated by the recent increasing popularity of Darwinian medicine.

AB Background: In November 2010, Sierra Leone distributed over three million long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) with the objective of providing protection from malaria to individuals in all households in the country.
   Methods: We conducted a nationally representative survey six months after the mass distribution campaign to evaluate its impact on household insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership and use. We examined factors associated with household ITN possession and use with logistic regression models.
   Results: The survey included 4,620 households with equal representation in each of the 14 districts. Six months after the campaign, 87.6% of households own at least one ITN, which represents an increase of 137% over the most recent estimate of 37% in 2008. Thirty-six percent of households possess at least one ITN per two household members; rural households were more likely than urban households to have >= 1:2 ITN to household members, but there was no difference by socioeconomic status or household head education. Among individuals in households possessing >= 1 ITN, 76.5% slept under an ITN the night preceding the survey. Individuals in households where the household head had heard malaria messaging, had correct knowledge of malaria transmission, and where at least one ITN was hanging, were more likely to have slept under an ITN.
   Conclusions: The mass distribution campaign was effective at achieving high coverage levels across the population, notably so among rural households where the malaria burden is higher. These important gains in equitable access to malaria prevention will need to be maintained to produce long-term reductions in the malaria burden.

DT Article

   OSCILLATORS; RHYTHMICITY; HAMSTERS; UTERUS; SLEEP; BIRTH
AB Background: The circadian clock has been linked to reproduction at many levels in mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have reported increased rates of reproductive abnormalities and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although whether the cause is circadian disruption or another factor associated with shift work is unknown. Here we test whether environmental disruption of circadian rhythms, using repeated shifts of the light: dark (LD) cycle, adversely affects reproductive success in mice.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Young adult female C57BL/6J (B6) mice were paired with B6 males until copulation was verified by visual identification of vaginal plug formation. Females were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, phase-delay or phase-advance. Controls remained on a constant 12-hr light:12-hr dark cycle, whereas phase-delayed and phase-advanced mice were subjected to 6-hr delays or advances in the LD cycle every 5-6 days, respectively. The number of copulations resulting in term pregnancies was determined. Control females had a full-term pregnancy success rate of 90% (11/12), which fell to 50% (9/18; p<0.1) in the phase-delay group and 22% (4/18; p<0.01) in the phase-advance group.
   Conclusions/Significance: Repeated shifting of the LD cycle, which disrupts endogenous circadian timekeeping, dramatically reduces pregnancy success in mice. Advances of the LD cycle have a greater negative impact on pregnancy outcomes and, in non-pregnant female mice, require longer for circadian re-entrainment, suggesting that the magnitude or duration of circadian misalignment may be related to the severity of the adverse impact on pregnancy. These results explicitly link disruptions of circadian entrainment to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mammals, which may have important implications for the reproductive health of female shift workers, women with circadian rhythm sleep disorders and/or women with disturbed circadian rhythms for other reasons.

AB The association between light exposure at night and sex hormone levels in utero has scarcely reported. We assessed the associations between sleep duration or being awake in the late evening hours, which can be as indicator of light exposure at night, and the maternal and umbilical blood hormone levels during pregnancy and at delivery among Japanese women. The data for 236 women and their newborns who visited a maternal clinic in Gifu, Japan, between May 2000 and October 2001 were analyzed. Maternal blood samples were obtained at approximately the 10th weeks, 29th weeks of gestation, and at delivery. Umbilical cord artery blood was immediately drawn after birth. Information for sleep during pregnancy was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. The levels of estradiol and testosterone were measured using radioimmunoassay. Maternal serum testosterone level in the 10th week was higher among those who were awake at or after 1:00 a.m. than among those who were asleep at that time (P = 0.032). Maternal estradiol level in the 29th week was inversely associated with sleep duration on weekends (P = 0.043). Umbilical testosterone level at delivery inversely correlated with sleep duration on weekdays (P = 0.030). These associations were somewhat stronger among mothers with female offspring than those with male offspring. These results suggested that exposure to light at night might increase sex hormone levels during pregnancy.

AB Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury at birth is associated with 1-3/1000 cases of moderate to severe encephalopathy. Previously, we have shown that connexin 43 hemichannel blockade, with a specific mimetic peptide, reduced the occurrence of seizures, improved recovery of EEG power and sleep state cycling, and improved cell survival following global cerebral ischaemia. In the present study, we examined the dose response for intracerebroventricular mimetic peptide infusion (50 mu mol/kg/h for 1 h, followed by 50 mu mol/kg/24 h (low dose) or 50 mu mol/kg/h for 25 h (high dose) or vehicle only (control group), starting 90 min after the end of ischaemia), following global cerebral ischaemia, induced by 30 min bilateral carotid artery occlusion, in near-term fetal sheep (128 +/- 1 days gestation). Both peptide infusion groups were associated with a transient significant increase in EEG power between 2-12 h after ischaemia. The ischaemia-low dose group showed a significant recovery of EEG power from day five compared to the ischaemia-vehicle and -high dose groups. In contrast, the high dose infusion was associated with greater secondary increase in impedance (brain cell swelling), as well as a trend towards a greater increase in lactate concentration and mortality. These data suggest that higher doses of connexin mimetic peptide are not beneficial and may be associated with adverse outcomes, most likely attributable to uncoupling of connexin 43 gap junctions leading to dysfunction of the astrocytic syncytium.

AB OBJECTIVE: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age.
   METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression.
   RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (>= 300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%-16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming >= 300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17) but at a nonsignificant level.
   CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months. Pediatrics 2012;129:860-868

AB Objectives: To determine the prevalence of wheezing and its associated risk factors in infants in the first year of life in the province of Salamanca, Spain.
   Methods: A multicentre, cross-sectional, descriptive epidemiological study was designed to evaluate a representative sample of 750 infants in the first year of life, born in the province of Salamanca between 1 June 2008 and 30 September 2009.
   The study was based on a previously validated and standardised written questionnaire administered among the parents of those children seen for control at 12 months of age in any of the Primary Care centres in the province of Salamanca.
   Results: The recorded wheezing rate was 32.3%. Feeding and sleep were seen to be affected in 46.3% and 80.9% of the wheezing children, respectively, and parent activity was also altered in 39.3% of the cases.
   A relationship was found between wheezing and nursery attendance (OR: 1.66, 95% confidence interval [1.19-2.31]); weight at birth >3500 g (OR: 1.45 [1.02-2.06]); the presence of eczema at this age (OR: 2.72 [1.75-4.24]); exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (OR: 1.33 [0.98-1.81]); and maternal smoking during the last three months of pregnancy (OR: 1.60 [0.96-2.68]).
   The prevalence of recurrent wheezing (defined as three or more episodes) was 11.9%. Significant differences were observed with respect to nursery attendance (OR: 1.71 [1.08-2.72]), the presence of eczema at this age (OR: 2.55 [1.48-4.42]), a history of maternal asthma (OR: 2.19 [1.08-4.44]) and exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (OR: 1.53 [0.98-2.38]).
   Conclusions: In the province of Salamanca, one third of the infants studied suffered wheezing in the first year of life. Infants exclusively breastfed for less than three months; attending a nursery; having suffered eczema; or with an asthmatic mother showed significantly more wheezing than the rest. Wheezing proved recurrent in 11.9% of the cases. (C) 2011 SEICAP. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB Background
   Average annual fertility rates in industrialised countries have been below two children per woman for the past 3 decades. The reasons behind women's childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of awareness regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome the 'biological clock' may be contributory factors.
   Objective
   A narrative review guided by the research question: What do women need to know about the consequences of delayed childbearing in order to make informed decisions about their fertility?
   Discussion
   There are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing and; some women's ideas about their fertility don't match the the scientific facts'. General practitioners are well placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research is needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.

AB Incidence of cancer in children has increased in recent decades, and known risk factors can account for only a small minority of cases. Gestation and early childhood are particularly vulnerable periods in human development and an important aspect of development is in circadian rhythmicity. Emerging evidence implicates the molecular circadian mechanism in a vast array of other physiologic functions including metabolism, DNA damage response and cell-cycle regulation. Electric light exposure at night can disrupt circadian rhythms and, thereby, many other physiologic processes that are under circadian control. On this basis, it is proposed that ill-timed electric light exposure to pregnant women, to neonates, infants, and small children may increase cancer risk in those children. There are practical implications and interventions that accrue from this idea should it later be confirmed to be true. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prey; 21(5); 701-4. (C)2012 AACR.

AB Objective: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent restless legs syndrome (RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up.
   Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65,544 women (aged 41-58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs >= 5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review.
   Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15+ times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65-6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42)compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53-8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS.
   Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future. Neurology (R) 2012;78:1500-1506

AB Delaying motherhood should be a free choice made in full knowledge of all the consequences, but modern women have alarming misconceptions about their own reproductive systems and the effectiveness of assisted reproductive technologies. Doctors and health professionals must begin to discuss fertility preservation with their patients and make sure that young women truly understand all their options. Preventing age-related infertility is the responsibility not only of doctors and medical practitioners but also of society at large. Social, economic, and personal pressures are causing women to decide to conceive later in life, yet those who choose to delay motherhood are stigmatized as being selfish and unconcerned about starting a family. This stigma must be banished, and age-related infertility should be faced as a medical problem. (Fertil Steril (R) 2012; 97: 1044-7. (C) 2012 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

AB Glomerular hyperfiltration is a phenomenon that can occur in various clinical conditions including kidney disease. No single definition of glomerular hyperfiltration has been agreed upon, and the pathophysiological mechanisms, which are likely to vary with the underlying disease, are not well explored. Glomerular hyperfiltration can be caused by afferent arteriolar vasodilation as seen in patients with diabetes or after a high-protein meal, and/or by efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction owing to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, thus leading to glomerular hypertension. Glomerular hypertrophy and increased glomerular pressure might be both a cause and a consequence of renal injury; understanding the renal adaptations to injury is therefore important to prevent further damage. In this Review, we discuss the current concepts of glomerular hyperfiltration and the renal hemodynamic changes associated with this condition. A physiological state of glomerular hyperfiltration occurs during pregnancy and after consumption of high-protein meals. The various diseases that have been associated with glomerular hyperfiltration, either per nephron or per total kidney, include diabetes mellitus, polycystic kidney disease, secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis caused by a reduction in renal mass, sickle cell anemia, high altitude renal syndrome and obesity. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in glomerular hyperfiltration could enable the development of new strategies to prevent progression of kidney disease.

ID DISORDERS
AB Background: Sleep disturbance is common during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of sleep duration and its quality on labor and fetal outcome. Method: In a cross sectional study, primigravida women with singleton pregnancy (gestational age > 37 weeks) were recruited. Women with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or those who needed emergency cesarean section were excluded. Data regarding the type and length of delivery, the quality of sleep as well as the neonates' weight and Apgar scores were recorded. Results: Totally, 457 participants were recruited. There was a significant correlation between the sleep duration and length of delivery stages. In most participants with more than 8 hours sleep, the first stage of delivery lasted between 6 and 10 hours. They had normal vaginal delivery with induction, and their neonates' Apgar score was >9 (p = 0.029, p = 0.018, and p = 0.001, respectively). Most mothers with refreshing sleep had normal vaginal delivery with induction, their neonates weighted >= 2500 g and with Apgar score >9 (p = 0.010, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005 respectively). Conclusion: Sleep duration and quality of sleep can affect the type of delivery, length of labor stages, as well as neonates' Apgar score and birth weight. Such predictors of labor and fetal outcome should be assessed during prenatal evaluations.

AB Prenatal cigarette smoke (CS) exposure, in combination with hypoxia and/or hyperthermia can lead to gasping and attenuated recovery from hypoxia in 7 days old rat pups. We studied 95 unanesthetized spontaneously breathing 14 days old rat pups to investigate if the destabilizing effects of increased ambient temperature and prenatal CS exposure on respiratory control observed in 7 days old rats were still evident at day 14. This postnatal age was selected as it is beyond the analogous risk period for SIDS in human. Furthermore, we investigated if the breathing responses to hypercapnia are affected by prenatal CS exposure. Since high ambient (HA) temperature can lead to gasping and aberrant respiratory control, we recorded respiratory patterns at low (2425 degrees C) and high (2930 degrees C) ambient temperatures, and under hypoxic or hypercapnic states. No gasping was observed in 14 days old rat pups. During hypoxia, breathing frequency increased in the CS-exposed group under low and HA temperatures. Rectal temperature decreased only in the sham group in response to low ambient temperature hypoxia. At HA temperature, breathing frequency increased in both sham and CS-exposed groups during hypercapnia, however, it remained elevated during washout period only in the sham group. We demonstrate that prenatal CS exposure continues to have profound effects on respiratory and thermoregulatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia at day 14. The attenuated respiratory and thermoregulatory responses to acute hypoxia and hypercapnia on day 14 demonstrate a strong interaction between CS exposure, respiratory control, and thermoregulation during postnatal maturation.

AB Research on the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythmicity and the response of brain and body clocks to environmental and physiological challenges requires assessing levels of circadian clock proteins. Too often, however, it is difficult to acquire antibodies that specifically and reliably label these proteins. Many of these antibodies also lack appropriate validation. The goal of this project was to generate and characterize antibodies against several circadian clock proteins. We examined mice and hamsters at peak and trough times of clock protein expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In addition, we confirmed specificity by testing the antibodies on mice with targeted disruption of the relevant genes. Our results identify antibodies against PER1, PER2, BMAL1 and CLOCK that are useful for assessing circadian clock proteins in the SCN by immunocytochemistry.

TI Non drowsy obstructive sleep apnea as a potential cause of resistant
   hypertension: a case report
SO BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Sleep Apnea; Arterial Hypertension; Resistant Hypertension; Obesity
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; ADULTS
AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and arterial hypertension (AH) are common and underrecognized medical disorders. OSA is a potential risk factor for the development of AH and/or may act as a factor complicating AH management. The symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are considered essential for the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which is a first line treatment of OSA. The medical literature and practice is controversial about the treatment of people with asymptomatic OSA. Thus, OSA patients without EDS may be left at increased cardiovascular risk.
   Case presentation: The report presents a case of 42 year old Asian woman with symptoms of heart failure and angina like chest pain upon admission. She didn't experience symptoms of EDS, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was seven points. Snoring was reported on direct questioning. The patient had prior medical history of three unsuccessful pregnancies complicated by gestational AH and preeclampsia with C-section during the last pregnancy. The admission blood pressure (BP) was 200/120 mm Hg. The patient's treatment regimen consisted of five hypotensive medications including diuretic. However, a target BP wasn't achieved in about one and half month. The patient was offered to undergo a polysomnography (PSG) study, which she rejected. One month after discharge the PSG study was done, and this showed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 46 events per hour. CPAP therapy was initiated with a pressure of 11 H(2)0 cm. After 2 months of compliant CPAP use, adherence to pharmacologic regimen and lifestyle modifications the patient's BP decreased to 134/82 mm Hg.
   Conclusions: OSA and AH are common and often underdiagnosed medical disorders independently imposing excessive cardiovascular risk on a diseased subject. When two conditions coexist the cardiovascular risk is likely much greater. This case highlights a possible clinical phenotype of OSA without EDS and its association with resistant AH. Most importantly a good hypotensive response to medical treatment in tandem with CPAP therapy was achieved in this patient. Thus, it is reasonable to include OSA in the differential list of resistant AH, even if EDS is not clinically obvious.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has a distinctive pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment compared with that of older children and adults. Infants have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction and gas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased chest wall compliance, ventilation perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia, hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has been associated with failure to thrive, behavioral deficits, and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia, mandibular distraction for micrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.

AB Background: Problems experienced within the first year of an infant's life can be precursors of later mental health conditions. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency and continuity of difficult behaviors in infants at 3 and 6 months of age and the associations of these difficulties with biomedical and psychosocial factors.
   Methods: This study was a part of an ongoing prospective birth-cohort study. Study participants were 189 uniparous mothers and their full-term newborns. The index of infant difficult behavior was constructed. This index was then associated with the following factors: delivery mode, newborn function after birth, maternal emotional well-being, risk behavior, subjective evaluation of the quality of the relationship of the couple, and attitudes toward infant-rearing.
   Results: Common difficult behaviors, including crying, sleeping and eating problems, were characteristic for 30.2% of 3 month old and for 22.2% of 6 month old full-term infants. The expression of infant difficult behaviors at the age of 3 months increased the likelihood of the expression of these difficulties at 6 months by more than 5 times. Factors including younger maternal age, poor prenatal and postnatal emotional well-being, prenatal alcohol consumption, low satisfaction with the couple's relationship before pregnancy, and deficiency of infant-centered maternal attitudes towards infant-rearing increased the likelihood of difficult behaviors in infants at the age of 3 months. Low maternal satisfaction with the relationship of the couple before pregnancy, negative emotional reactions of both parents toward pregnancy (as reported by the mother) and the deficiency of an infant-centered maternal attitude towards infant-rearing increased the likelihood of infant difficult behaviors continuing between the ages of 3 to 6 months. Perinatal biomedical conditions were not related to the difficult behaviors in infants.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that early onset of difficult behavior highly increases the risk for the continuation of difficult behavior during infancy. In general, the impact of prenatal psychosocial environment on infant behavior decreases from the ages of 3 to 6 months; however, some prenatal and preconceptional psychosocial factors have direct associations with the continuity of difficult behaviors through the first half-year of an infant's life.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the maternal and neonatal factors associated with offspring adiposity and the role of birth and placental weight as potential mediators in such associations.
   DESIGN: The Tasmanian Infant Health Survey was a prospective cohort study conducted between 1988 and 1995 in Australia to investigate the cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This large infant cohort provides measurement of skinfolds on 7945 mothers and their offspring.
   SUBJECTS: Participants included singletons born >= 37 weeks gestation who were at high risk of sudden infant death syndrome identified through a composite score that included birth weight, maternal age, neonatal gender, season of birth, duration of second-stage labor and intention to breastfeed.
   MEASUREMENTS: Neonatal adiposity was assessed from skinfold measurements of the subscapular (SSF) and triceps folds (TSF) taken at birth. Maternal early-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Neonatal data were extracted from birth records. Data relating to other environmental exposures were obtained from questionnaires administered when neonates were similar to 4-days old.
   RESULTS: In multivariable models, higher maternal adiposity, increasing maternal age, gestation age, delivery by Caesarian section and female gender were associated with larger SSF independent of placental and birth weight (P<0.001). Maternal age and delivery by Caesarian section were significantly associated with larger TSF, whereas gestational age and male gender were associated with thinner TSF independent of placental and birth weight. Higher early-pregnancy BMI, maternal weight gain, maternal age, parity and gestational age were significantly associated with larger placental and birth weight. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with smaller birth weight but not with placental weight.
   CONCLUSION: In addition to birth weight, maternal adiposity and placental weight were important additional factors associated with neonatal adiposity.

ID DIABETES-MELLITUS; DNA-DAMAGE; OBESITY; ASSOCIATION; ORIGINS; INSULIN
AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the body composition of offspring.
   SUBJECTS: Grade 4 elementary school children (n = 1366; boys/girls, 724/642; 9-10 years old) were enrolled in this study. All parents answered a lifestyle questionnaire, and children underwent passive smoking tests. Urinary cotinine measurement and lifestyle screening test parameters (that is, body weight, body length, body mass index (BMI), obesity index (OI), blood tests for liver function and lipid profile and questions regarding maternal smoking and lifestyle) were evaluated in terms of their relationship with maternal smoking. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentration was measured in 80 randomly selected children to assess its relationship with oxidative stress.
   RESULTS: Both BMI and OI were significantly higher in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy than in those whose mothers never smoked (BMI: 17.2 +/- 2.7 vs 16.9 +/- 2.5 kgm(-2), P=0.016; OI: 2.7 +/- 14.3% vs 0.4 +/- 14.0%, P=0.003). The degree of elevation was positively correlated with the duration of maternal smoking. The increases in BMI and OI resulted from increased body weight and reduced height. The confounding factors-'breakfast with family', 'watching television at dinner', 'eating and drinking before sleep', 'watching television for >2h', 'sleep duration <8 h' and 'playing sports'-were statistically significant. BMI and OI were significantly high in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy in these six confounders. On the other hand, urinary 8-OHdG concentration was negatively correlated with BMI in children who had >1.3 ng ml(-1) urinary cotinine, suggesting that it may be related to basal metabolism due to oxidative stress.
   CONCLUSION: Maternal smoking is a risk factor for higher BMI and OI in 9- to 10-year-old children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy and may be independent of other confounding factors.

AB In nonpregnant populations, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Few studies have examined the relationship between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). The objective of this study was to examine the association between SDB and APO. Women who had a delivery as well as an in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) were identified. Demographics, PSG results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. Absence of SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of <5, mild SDB as an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and moderate to severe SDB as an AHI of >= 15. The primary outcome was a composite measure of APO: pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth <= 34 weeks. We identified 143 women who had undergone a PSG and a delivery. Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk of the composite APO: AHI <5, 18.1%; AHI 5 to 14.9, 23.5%; AHI >= 15, 38.5% (p = 0.038). Obese women (body mass index >= 30) with moderate to severe SDB had the highest rate of APO, 41.7%. SDB, especially moderate to severe disease, may be associated with APO. However, it is unclear if SDB is a risk factor for APO independent of obesity.

AB Prolactin (PRL) is one of the most versatile hormones in the mammalian body, affecting reproductive, sexual and other functions. In rats, mating or vaginocervical stimulation activates a characteristic PRL secretory pattern for several days, which is essential for successful reproduction. Although the underlying mechanisms appear to be different, PRL is also crucial for human fertility. We have detected a PRL increase in women induced by sexual intercourse. Extending these findings, the current study aimed at analyzing the PRL secretory rhythm after sexual contact, in order to elucidate whether human females also show long-term alterations of the PRL secretory pattern.
   In a pilot study, serial blood samples were taken from women (n 7) in mid-cycle to assess changes in PRL secretory rhythm induced by sexual intercourse, during a period of 32 h.
   Compared with control condition, sexual intercourse with orgasm induced not only the well-established immediate PRL increase of approximate to 300 but also an additional PRL elevation around noon of the next day (P 0.05). These fluctuations were measured on top of the regular circadian rhythm of PRL, manifested as a surge early in the morning.
   We are able to demonstrate a long-term change in the PRL secretory rhythm after sexual intercourse with orgasm in females, suggesting memory effects. We hypothesize that the additionally secreted PRL could be beneficial for decidualization and implantation. Further studies with more participants are required to investigate in detail the implications of such effects on reproductive success in humans.

AB Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004-2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.

ID CORTISOL; FETUS; BETAMETHASONE; PREGNANCY; MOVEMENTS
AB Objectives. To investigate whether parameters in fetal biophysical profile (BPP) testing exhibit a diurnal rhythm and to discuss the probable factors associated with these variables.
   Methods. Thirty healthy primigravid patients carrying pregnancies between 35 and 40 completed weeks were enrolled for the study. Fetal BPP testing was performed for each patient both in the early morning (08:00-10:00 am) and in the late evening (08:00-10:00 pm), and the scoring parameters were compared between morning and evening tests.
   Results. BPP scores in the evening were significantly higher than that in the morning (p < 0.05). Deepest vertical amniotic pocket measurements and fetal breathing absence in the morning mostly contributed to this variation (p < 0.001). Fetal movement counts were also significantly lower in the morning tests (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions. The parameters of BPP exhibit circadian variations in healthy fetuses, which may be associated with many factors such as fetomaternal hormones. It is essential for the clinician to be aware of these changes when interpreting the results, as interventions based on false-positive results may have deleterious effects on both the mother and her fetus.

TI Inequities in maternal and child health outcomes and interventions in
   Ghana
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVIVAL; AFRICA; EQUITY
AB Background: With the date for achieving the targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approaching fast, there is a heightened concern about equity, as inequities hamper progress towards the MDGs. Equity-focused approaches have the potential to accelerate the progress towards achieving the health-related MDGs faster than the current pace in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner. Ghana's rate of progress towards MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing child and maternal mortality respectively is less than what is required to achieve the targets. The objective of this paper is to examine the equity dimension of child and maternal health outcomes and interventions using Ghana as a case study.
   Methods: Data from Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 2008 report is analyzed for inequities in selected maternal and child health outcomes and interventions using population-weighted, regression-based measures: slope index of inequality and relative index of inequality.
   Results: No statistically significant inequities are observed in infant and under-five mortality, perinatal mortality, wasting and acute respiratory infection in children. However, stunting, underweight in under-five children, anaemia in children and women, childhood diarrhoea and underweight in women (BMI < 18.5) show inequities that are to the disadvantage of the poorest. The rates significantly decrease among the wealthiest quintile as compared to the poorest. In contrast, overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obesity (BMI >= 30) among women reveals a different trend there are inequities in favour of the poorest. In other words, in Ghana overweight and obesity increase significantly among women in the wealthiest quintile compared to the poorest. With respect to interventions: treatment of diarrhoea in children, receiving all basic vaccines among children and sleeping under ITN (children and pregnant women) have no wealth-related gradient. Skilled care at birth, deliveries in a health facility (both public and private), caesarean section, use of modern contraceptives and intermittent preventive treatment for malaria during pregnancy all indicate gradients that are in favour of the wealthiest. The poorest use less of these interventions. Not unexpectedly, there is more use of home delivery among women of the poorest quintile.
   Conclusion: Significant Inequities are observed in many of the selected child and maternal health outcomes and interventions. Failure to address these inequities vigorously is likely to lead to non-achievement of the MDG targets related to improving child and maternal health (MDGs 4 and 5). The government should therefore give due attention to tackling inequities in health outcomes and use of interventions by implementing equity-enhancing measure both within and outside the health sector in line with the principles of Primary Health Care and the recommendations of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health.

ID SLEEPING POSITION; COT DEATH; DEPRIVATION; SIDS
AB Objectives To compare changes in inequalities in sudden infant death syndrome with other causes of infant mortality and stillbirth in Scotland, 1985-2008.
   Design Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting Scotland 1985-2008, analysed by four epochs of six years.
   Participants Singleton births of infants with birth weight >500 g born at 28-43 weeks' gestation.
   Main outcome measures Sudden infant death syndrome, other causes of postneonatal infant death, neonatal death, and stillbirth. Odds ratios expressed as the association across the range of seven categories of Carstairs deprivation score.
   Results The association between deprivation and the risk of all cause stillbirth and infant death varied between the four epochs (P=0.04). This was wholly explained by variation in the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (P<0.001 for interaction). Among women living in areas of low deprivation, there was a sharp decline in the rate of sudden infant death syndrome from 1990 to 1993. Among women living in areas of high deprivation, there was a slower decline in sudden infant death syndrome rates between 1992 and 2004. Consequently, the odds ratio for the association between socioeconomic deprivation and sudden infant death syndrome increased from 2.04 (95% confidence interval 1.53 to 2.72) in 1985-90, to 7.52 (4.62 to 12.25) in 1991-6, and 9.50 (5.46 to 16.53) in 1997-2002 but fell to 1.78 (0.87 to 3.65) in 2002-8. The interaction remained significant after adjustment for maternal characteristics.
   Conclusion The rate of sudden infant death syndrome declined throughout Scotland in the early 1990s. The decline had a later onset and was slower among women living in areas of high deprivation, probably because of slower uptake of recommended changes in infant sleeping position. The effect was to create a strong independent association between deprivation and sudden infant death syndrome where one did not exist before.

AB Dopamine deficiency or dopamine dysfunction has been implicated as one of the factors involved in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS). Our objective is to determine the prevalence of primary RLS in patients taking neuroleptic drugs. One hundred patients taking neuroleptic drugs and 100 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were interviewed with the Cambridge-Hopkins diagnostic questionnaire for RLS. Patients with malignancy, end-stage renal disease, neuropathy, history of spinal cord diseases, pregnancy and Parkinson's disease were excluded. Only one patient had symptoms consistent with RLS (1%), similar to one patient in the control group. She was a 40 years old female with a diagnosis of depression. She started having RLS symptoms approximately four years after starting perphenazine. The symptoms persisted after the medications were discontinued but decreased in severity and frequency. Her serum ferritin level was 90.3 ng/ml. The prevalence of primary RLS is low in patients attending the out-patient clinic who are taking neuroleptic drugs. Other factors apart from dopaminergic dysfunction are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of RLS. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Physiological effects of coffee and human health. A review
   In this review, we summarize the main known effects of coffee and caffeine on health based on the numerous studies performed over the last ten years. These recent studies report the beneficial properties of moderate closes of coffee (3-4 cups per clay) on alertness, vigilance, and cognitive abilities. On the other hand, coffee can disturb sleep and generate anxiety. Its lifelong consumption slows clown normal cognitive aging and reduces the risk of developing Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes and numerous cancers (cancers of the digestive tract, breast, endometrial and skin cancer in particular). Coffee has no negative impact on the cardiovascular system; it stimulates digestion and needs to be consumed in moderation during pregnancy. The data summarized in this review come from animal and human studies and in many cases they originate from meta-analyses published in the area of interest. This large wealth of data played a critical role in the change from the earlier prevalent negative view that coffee had negative effects on health to the present view that coffee consumed in moderation can be part of a balanced diet and may even be rather good for health.

AB Objectives: To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories and associated predictors.
   Design: A prospective, follow-up study.
   Setting: A teaching medical center in central Taiwan.
   Participants: A convenience sample of 121 low-risk, childbearing women.
   Methods: Depressive and fatigue symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time 2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4). Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features, health status, and sleep quality.
   Results: The mean age of participants was 31.2 years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis.
   Conclusion: Overlapping but distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important for improving care during the early postpartum period. JOGNN, 41, 216-226; 2012.

AB Objective. To describe the background characteristics of women who gave birth to their first child at an advanced and very advanced maternal age, including their sociodemographic background, social relationships, health behavior, physical and mental health, and reproductive history. Design. Cross-sectional data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Setting. Norway. Sample. 41 236 Norwegian-speaking nulliparous women. Methods. Data were collected by the first questionnaire distributed in week 17 of pregnancy during the recruitment period 19992008. The distribution of descriptive variables in relation to age was investigated, by means of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Main outcome measures. Advanced (3337 years) and very advanced (=38 years) maternal age. Results. Women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age differed from the younger women with regard to a wide range of background characteristics, and this difference was most pronounced for the very advanced group. Problems related to physical aging were more common (infertility, physical health problems, sleep problems, depression and fatigue). Of the sociodemographic factors; high annual income and low level of education were most strongly correlated with high maternal age, followed by single status, unemployment, unsatisfactory relationship with partner and unplanned pregnancy. Conclusions. Besides having more age-related reproductive and physical health problems, women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age constituted a heterogeneous group characterized by either socioeconomic prosperity or vulnerability.

AB Fetal sleep states emerge during the third trimester of pregnancy and involve multiple interconnected neuronal networks. We examined whether fetal sleep characteristics predict child and adolescent self-regulation in a non-clinical sample (study group, n = 25: reference group, n = 48). Combined recordings of three sleep variables (fetal heart rate, body movements and rapid eye movements) were made for 2 h at 36-38 weeks' gestation. Fetuses showing synchronous change of sleep variables (i.e. within 3 min) at transition from quiet into active sleep reached a higher level of effortful control, both at 8-9 and 14-15 years, than fetuses not making synchronous transitions and compared with the reference group. Results are discussed from a Developmental Origins of Behavior, Health and Disease (DOBHaD) point of view. It is concluded that studying sleep ontogeny offers the possibility to gain insight into brain maturational processes and/or environmental adaptive processes that may have long term behavioral developmental consequences.

AB Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence rate of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in elderly Chinese people over 50 years of age in an urban suburb of Shanghai by a community-based study.
   Methods: A 3-step survey was adopted including two telephone-based interviews and one face-to-face interview. We used questions based on four diagnostic criteria for RLS to perform the first telephone interview. The second telephone interview was performed by a sleep specialist to rule out the 'mimics' and secondary RLS. The final face-to-face interview was performed in the clinic for confirmation and examination.
   Results: There were 2609 inhabitants in the Wuli Bridge suburb of Shanghai who responded to the first telephone interview (men 68.55 +/- 10.13 years of age and women 65.34 +/- 10.52 years of age, mean +/- SD). Eighteen people were finally diagnosed with RLS. In this sample, the overall prevalence rate of RLS was about 0.69% (95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.41-1.09).
   Conclusion: Our study provided the first data about the prevalence rate of RLS in an urban suburb of Shanghai from mainland China, which is consistent with the low prevalence rate reported in other Asian countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The trajectory to heart defects may start in tubular and looping heart stages when detailed analysis of form and function is difficult by currently available methods. We used a novel method, Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT), to follow changes in cardiovascular function in quail embryos during acute hypoxic stress. Chronic fetal hypoxia is a known risk factor for congenital heart diseases (CHDs). Decreased fetal heart rates during maternal obstructive sleep apnea suggest that studying fetal heart responses under acute hypoxia is warranted. Results: We captured responses to hypoxia at the critical looping heart stages. Doppler OCT revealed detailed vitelline arterial pulsed Doppler waveforms. Embryos tolerated 1 hr of hypoxia (5%, 10%, or 15% O2), but exhibited changes including decreased systolic and increased diastolic duration in 5 min. After 5 min, slower heart rates, arrhythmic events and an increase in retrograde blood flow were observed. These changes suggested slower filling of the heart, which was confirmed by four-dimensional Doppler imaging of the heart itself. Conclusions: Doppler OCT is well suited for rapid noninvasive screening for functional changes in avian embryos under near physiological conditions. Analysis of the accessible vitelline artery sensitively reflected changes in heart function and can be used for rapid screening. Acute hypoxia caused rapid hemodynamic changes in looping hearts and may be a concern for increased CHD risk. Developmental Dynamics 241:534544, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Environmental variables such as photoperiod, heat, stress, nutrition and other external factors have profound effects on quality and quantity of a dairy cow's milk. The way in which the environment interacts with genotype to impact milk production is unknown; however, evidence from our laboratory suggests that circadian clocks play a role. Daily and seasonal endocrine rhythms are coordinated in mammals by the master circadian clock in the hypothalamus. Peripheral clocks are distributed in every organ and coordinated by signals from the master clock. We and others have shown that there is a circadian clock in the mammary gland. Approximately 7% of the genes expressed during lactation had circadian patterns including core clock and metabolic genes. Amplitude changes occurred in the core mammary clock genes during the transition from pregnancy to lactation and were coordinated with changes in molecular clocks among multiple tissues. In vitro studies using a bovine mammary cell line showed that external stimulation synchronized mammary clocks, and expression of the core clock gene, BMAL1, was induced by lactogens. Female clock/clock mutant mice, which have disrupted circadian rhythms, have impaired mammary development and their offspring failed to thrive suggesting that the dam's milk production was not adequate enough to nourish their young. We envision that in mammals, during the transition from pregnancy to lactation the master clock is modified by environmental and physiological cues that it receives, including photoperiod length. In turn, the master clock coordinates changes in endocrine milieu that signals peripheral tissues. In dairy cows, it is clear that changes in photoperiod during the dry period and/or during lactation influences milk production. We believe that the photoperiod effect on milk production is mediated, in part by the 'setting' of the master dock with light, which modifies peripheral circadian docks including the mammary core clock and subsequently impacts milk yield and may impact milk composition.

   MUTANT MICE; BODY-WEIGHT
AB The transition from pregnancy to lactation is the most stressful period in the life of a cow. During this transition, homeorhetic adaptations are coordinated across almost every organ and are marked by changes in hormones and metabolism to accommodate the increased energetic demands of lactation. Recent data from our laboratory showed that changes in circadian clocks occur in multiple tissues during the transition period in rats and indicate that the circadian system coordinates changes in the physiology of the dam needed to support lactation. Circadian rhythms coordinate the timing of physiological processes and synchronize these processes with the environment of the animal. Circadian rhythms are generated by molecular circadian clocks located in the hypothalamus ( the master clock) and peripherally in every organ of the body. The master clock receives environmental and physiological cues and, in turn, synchronizes internal physiology by coordinating endocrine rhythms and metabolism through peripheral clocks. The effect of the circadian clock on lactation may be inferred by the photoperiod effect on milk production, which is accompanied by coordinated changes in the endocrine system and metabolic capacity of the dam to respond to changes in day length. We have shown that bovine mammary epithelial cells possess a functional clock that can be synchronized by external stimuli, and the expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like gene, a positive limb of the core clock, is responsive to prolactin in bovine mammary explants. Others showed that 7% of genes expressed in breasts of lactating women had circadian patterns of expression, and we report that the diurnal variation of composition of bovine milk is associated with changes in expression of mammary core clock genes. Together these studies indicate that the circadian system coordinates the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation, and we believe that the capacity of the dam to produce milk and cope with metabolic stresses in early lactation is related to her ability to set circadian rhythms during the transition period.

TI Circadian Rhythms of Fetal Liver Transcription Persist in the Absence of

AB The cellular circadian clock and systemic cues drive rhythmicity in the transcriptome of adult peripheral tissues. However, the oscillating status of the circadian clocks in fetal tissues, and their response to maternal cues, are less clear. Most clock genes do not cycle in fetal livers from mice and rats, although tissue level rhythms rapidly emerge when fetal mouse liver explants are cultured in vitro. Thus, in the fetal mouse liver, the circadian clock does not oscillate at the cellular level (but is induced to oscillate in culture). To gain a comprehensive overview of the clock status in the fetal liver during late gestation, we performed microarray analyses on fetal liver tissues. In the fetal liver we did not observe circadian rhythms of clock gene expression or many other transcripts known to be rhythmically expressed in the adult liver. Nevertheless, JTK_CYCLE analysis identified some transcripts in the fetal liver that were rhythmically expressed, albeit at low amplitudes. Upon data filtering by coefficient of variation, the expression levels for transcripts related to pancreatic exocrine enzymes and zymogen secretion were found to undergo synchronized daily fluctuations at high amplitudes. These results suggest that maternal cues influence the fetal liver, despite the fact that we did not detect circadian rhythms of canonical clock gene expression in the fetal liver. These results raise important questions on the role of the circadian clock, or lack thereof, during ontogeny.

AB Background: Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health problem in Nigeria leading to increase in the risk of maternal mortality, low birth weight and infant mortality. This paper is aimed at highlighting key predictors of the ownership of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and its use among pregnant women in Nigeria.
   Methods: A total of 2348 pregnant women were selected by a multi-stage probability sampling technique. Structured interview schedule was used to elicit information on socio-demographic characteristics, ITN ownership, use, knowledge, behaviour and practices. Logistic regression was used to detect predictors of two indicators: ITN ownership, and ITN use in pregnancy among those who owned ITNs.
   Results: ITN ownership was low; only 28.8% owned ITNs. Key predictors of ITN ownership included women who knew that ITNs prevent malaria (OR = 3.85; p < 0001); and registration at antenatal clinics (OR = 1.34; p = 0.003). The use of ITNs was equally low with only 7.5% of all pregnant women, and 25.7% of all pregnant women who owned ITNs sleeping under a net. The predictors of ITN use in pregnancy among women who owned ITNs (N = 677) identified by logistic regression were: urban residence (OR = 1.87; p = 0.001); knowledge that ITNs prevent malaria (OR = 2.93; p < 0001) and not holding misconceptions about malaria prevention (OR = 1.56; p = 0.036). Educational level was not significantly related to any of the two outcome variables. Although registration at ANC is significantly associated with ownership of a bednet (perhaps through free ITN distribution) this does not translate to significant use of ITNs.
   Conclusions: ITN use lagged well behind ITN ownership. This seems to suggest that the current mass distribution of ITNs at antenatal facilities and community levels may not necessarily lead to use unless it is accompanied by behaviour change interventions that address the community level perceptions, misconceptions and positively position ITN as an effective prevention device to prevent malaria

TI Baby Business: a randomised controlled trial of a universal parenting
   program that aims to prevent early infant sleep and cry problems and
   associated parental depression

AB Background: Infant crying and sleep problems (e. g. frequent night waking, difficulties settling to sleep) each affect up to 30% of infants and often co-exist. They are costly to manage and associated with adverse outcomes including postnatal depression symptoms, early weaning from breast milk, and later child behaviour problems. Preventing such problems could improve these adverse outcomes and reduce costs to families and the health care system. Anticipatory guidance-i.e. providing parents with information about normal infant sleep and cry patterns, ways to encourage self-settling in infants, and ways to develop feeding and settling routines before the onset of problems-could prevent such problems. This paper outlines the protocol for our study which aims to test an anticipatory guidance approach.
   Methods/Design: 750 families from four Local Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia have been randomised to receive the Baby Business program (intervention group) or usual care (control group) offered by health services. The Baby Business program provides parents with information about infant sleep and crying via a DVD and booklet (mailed soon after birth), telephone consultation (at infant age 6-8 weeks) and parent group session (at infant age 12 weeks). All English speaking parents of healthy newborn infants born at > 32 weeks gestation and referred by their maternal and child health nurse at their first post partum home visit (day 7-10 postpartum), are eligible. The primary outcome is parent report of infant night time sleep as a problem at four months of age and secondary outcomes include parent report of infant daytime sleep or crying as a problem, mean duration of infant sleep and crying/24 hours, parental depression symptoms, parent sleep quality and quantity and health service use. Data will be collected at two weeks (baseline), four months and six months of age. An economic evaluation using a cost-consequences approach will, from a societal perspective, compare costs and health outcomes between the intervention and control groups.
   Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial of a program which aims to prevent both infant sleeping and crying problems and associated postnatal depression symptoms. If effective, it could offer an important public health prevention approach to these common, distressing problems.

AB Circadian rhythms impact on a wide range of physiological systems and this impact extends to fertility, such that disruptions to timing systems can impact upon reproductive capacity. This is highlighted most obviously in mutant mouse models whereby deletion or mutation of single genes results not only in disrupted circadian rhythmicity, but also compromised male and female reproductive function. In this review, we discuss the presence of circadian clocks in female and male reproductive tissues and the role these clocks play in the generation of oestrus cycles, ovulation, sperm generation, implantation and the maintenance of pregnancy. Given the increased incidence of shiftwork and international travel which disrupt circadian rhythmicity, and the increasing prevalence of reproductive technologies whereby early embryo development occurs without external time cues, it is important for us to consider the role of circadian rhythms in fertility.

AB The identification of circadian clocks in endocrine tissues has added considerable depth and complexity to our understanding of their physiology. A growing body of research reveals circadian clock gene expression in the uterus of non-pregnant and pregnant rodents. This review will focus on the mammalian uterus and its rhythmicity, particularly as it pertains to the circadian timing of parturition. This key event in the reproductive axis shows dramatic species-specific differences in its circadian phase. It is proposed here that these differences in the phasing of mammalian parturition are likely a function of opposite uterine cell responses to humoral cues. The argument will be made that melatonin fulfills many of the criteria to serve as a circadian signal in the initiation of human parturition, including specific actions on uterine smooth muscle cells that are consistent with a role for this hormone in the circadian timing of parturition.

AB Throughout gestation, the close relationship between mothers and their progeny ensures adequate development and a successful transition to postnatal life. By living inside the maternal compartment, the fetus is inevitably exposed to rhythms of the maternal internal milieu such as temperature; rhythms originated by maternal food intake and maternal melatonin, one of the few maternal hormones that cross the placenta unaltered. The fetus, immature by adult standards, is however perfectly fit to accomplish the dual functions of living in the uterine environment and developing the necessary tools to "mature" for the next step, i.e. to be a competent newborn. In the fetal physiological context, organ function differs from the same organ's function in the newborn and adult. This may also extend to the developing circadian system. The information reviewed here suggests that the fetal circadian system is organized differently from that of the adult. Moreover, the fetal circadian rhythm is not just present simply as the initial immature expression of a mechanism that has function in the postnatal animal only. We propose that the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and fetal organs are peripheral maternal circadian oscillators, entrained by different maternal signals. Conceptually, the arrangement produces internal temporal order during fetal life, inside the maternal compartment. Following birth, it will allow for postnatal integration of the scattered fetal circadian clocks into an adult-like circadian system commanded by the SCN. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: It is well known that earthquake severely threatens life-safety and physical damage. However, the empirical literature on the effects of nature disasters such as earthquake on the reproductive outcomes is limited. METHODS: On May 12th, 2008, a massive 8.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, a city 92 km away from our animal facility [National Chengdu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs (NCCSED)]. To investigate whether this tremendous earthquake exerted adverse effects on the reproductive and developmental functions in Sprague-Dawley rats, we collected some relevant data from reproductive toxicity studies around the earthquake, and compared them with the background data, which were gathered before and after the earthquake. Copulation ratio, gestation ratio, and fertility of female rats, as well as uterine and fetal morphology, were examined. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that the Wenchuan earthquake significantly decreased the copulation and gestation ratio, although it did not exhibit obvious side effects on some other reproductive and developmental parameters.

AB OBJECTIVE: We examined the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), cesarean section (CS), low Apgar score (at 5 minutes after delivery), and preeclampsia in pregnant women with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   STUDY DESIGN: Our subjects included 791 women with OSA and 3955 randomly selected women without OSA. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes between women with and without OSA.
   RESULTS: Compared with women without OSA, adjusted odds ratios for LBW, preterm birth, SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia in women with OSA were 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.40), 2.31 (95% CI, 1.77-3.01), 1.34 (95% CI, 1.09-1.66), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.48-2.04), and 1.60 (95% CI, 2.16-11.26), respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with OSA are at increased risk for having LBW, preterm, and SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia, compared with pregnant women without OSA.

TI Solitary sleeping in young infants is associated with heightened

   DISORDERS
AB Background: In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the relation between sleeping arrangements and infant cortisol reactivity to stressors in the first two post-natal months. Co-sleeping, as compared to solitary sleeping, is hypothesized to provide more parental external stress regulation by night, thus reducing general stress sensitivity. We therefore expected lower cortisol reactivity to stress in infants who co-slept more regularly.
   Methods: Participants were 163 mothers and infants from uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies. Mothers completed daily diaries on sleeping arrangements in the first 7 weeks of life. Co-sleeping was defined as sleeping in the parents' bedroom (i.e. own or parents' bed). Cortisol reactivity was measured twice: to a mild physical stressor (bathing session) at 5 weeks of age and to a mild pain stressor (vaccination) at 2 months of age.
   Results: Infants with a solitary sleeping arrangement in their first month of life showed a heightened cortisol response to the bathing session at 5 weeks compared to infants that co-slept regularly. This effect was not explained by breastfeeding practices, maternal caregiving behavior, or infants' night waking and sleep duration. No effects were found of co-sleeping on the cortisol response to the vaccination at 2 months.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that solitary sleeping in the first month of life is associated with heightened sensitivity of the HPA-axis to a mild stressor, possibly due to less nocturnal parental availability as external stress regulator. Whether this effect continues in later life, remains to be investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To examine the association among nighttime sleep and daytime napping behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perception of fatigue in pregnant women.
   Design: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design.
   Setting: A university-affiliated hospital and participants' home environments.
   Participants: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association.
   Interventions: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 +/- 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep < 6 h. Nineteen women (50%) napped > 3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

AB Premature babies are at high risk for both infantile apnoea and long-term neurobehavioural deficits. Recent studies suggest that diffuse structural changes in brain white matter are a positive predictor of poor cognitive outcomes. Since oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination, axon development, and synapse formation mainly occur in the third trimester of gestation and first postnatal year, infantile apnoea could lead to and/or exaggerate white matter impairments in preterm neonates. Therefore, we investigated oligodendroglia and axon development in a neonatal mouse model of intermittent hypoxia between postnatal days 2 and 10. During critical phases of central nervous system development, intermittent hypoxia induced hypomyelination in the corpus callosum, striatum, fornix, and cerebellum, but not in the pons or spinal cord. Intermittent hypoxia-elicited alterations in myelin-forming processes were reflected by decreased expression of myelin proteins, including MBP, PLP, MAG, and CNPase, possibly due to arrested maturation of oligodendrocytes. Ultrastructural abnormalities were apparent in the myelin sheath and axon. Immature oligodendrocytes were more vulnerable to neonatal intermittent hypoxia exposures than developing axons, suggesting that hypomyelination may contribute, at least partially, to axonal deficits. Insufficient neurofilament synthesis with anomalous components of neurofilament subunits, beta-tubulin, and MAP2 isoforms indicated immaturity of axons in intermittent hypoxia-exposed mouse brains. In addition, down-regulation of synapsin I, synaptophysin, and Gap-43 phosphorylation suggested a potential stunt in axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. The region-selective and complex impairment in brain white matter induced by intermittent hypoxia was further associated with electrophysiological changes that may underlie long-term neurobehavioural sequelae.

AB The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to ethanol, through maternal consumption of an aqueous ethanol solution, induces neurobehavioral deficits and increases ethanol preference in offspring. Pregnant Dunkin-Hartley-strain guinea pigs were given 24-h access to an aqueous ethanol solution (5%, v/v) sweetened with sucralose (1 g/l), or water sweetened with sucralose (1 g/l), throughout gestation. Spontaneous locomotor activity was measured in the offspring on postnatal day (PD) 10. The offspring underwent either ethanol preference testing using a two-bottle-choice paradigm beginning on PD 40 or Morris water maze testing using a hidden moving platform design beginning on PD 60. Maternal consumption of a 5% (v/v) ethanol solution (average daily dose of 2.3 +/- 0.1 g of ethanol/kg maternal body weight; range: 1.8-2.8 g/kg) decreased offspring birth weight, increased spontaneous locomotor activity, and increased preference for an aqueous ethanol solution. In the Morris water maze test, sucralose-exposed offspring decreased escape latency on the second day of testing, whereas the ethanol-exposed offspring showed no improvement. These data demonstrate that moderate maternal consumption of ethanol produces hyperactivity, enhances ethanol preference, and impairs learning and memory in guinea pig offspring.

AB AIM After in utero exposure to tricyclic antidepressants, neonatal withdrawal symptoms have been reported with an estimated incidence between 20 and 50%; however, few data are available for clomipramine. This could also be the case for neonatal pharmacokinetic clomipramine parameters and so this study was set up.
   METHODS
   Babies exposed to clomipramine in utero were included in an observational study, approved by the local ethics committee, after written informed consent. Withdrawal symptoms were scored at 12, 24 and 48 h after birth using the Finnegan score. Plasma concentrations were determined using an in- house- developed, validated liquid chromatography with mass detection (LC- MSMS) method at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h after birth.
   RESULTS
   We found that three of 11 pregnancies were complicated with pre-eclampsia. Ten neonates were observed for clomipramine withdrawal symptoms. The observed withdrawal symptoms were too short a period of sleep after feeding (6), poor feeding (3), mild to severe tremors (6), hyperactive Moro reflex (3) and respiratory rate > 60 breaths min- 1. Serious withdrawal reactions, such as tachycardia and cyanosis, were seen. We calculated a half- life value of 42 +/- 16 h for clomipramine in neonates. Only a weak correlation was found between withdrawal reactions and clomipramine plasma concentration or desmethylclomipramine plasma concentration.
   CONCLUSIONS
   In neonates, clomipramine is eliminated with a half- life value of 42 h, compared with 20 h in adults. In two of 10 neonates, tachycardia and cyanosis were seen as serious withdrawal symptoms after maternal use of clomipramine.

AB Aim To evaluate self-reported satisfaction and barriers to initiating real-time continuous glucose monitoring in early pregnancy among women with pregestational diabetes. Methods Fifty-four women with Type 1 diabetes and 14 women with Type 2 diabetes were offered continuous glucose monitoring for 6 days at median 9 (range 614) gestational weeks and were asked to answer a semi-structured questionnaire on patient satisfaction. Results Median HbA1c was 49 (range 3486) mmol/mol) [6.6 (5.310.0) %] and duration of diabetes was 12 (0.537) years. Continuous glucose monitoring was used for 6 (0.57) days, with 43 (65%) women using continuous glucose monitoring for at least 5 days. The women experienced 2.7 (012) alarms per 24 h, of which approximately one third was technical alarms and one third disturbed their sleep. Sixteen women (24%) reported discomfort with continuous glucose monitoring during daytime and twelve (18%) during sleep. Many women reported improved diabetes understanding (52%) and would recommend continuous glucose monitoring to others (83%). Twenty-four patients (36%) had continuous glucose monitoring removed earlier than planned ( before the intended 6 days of initial monitoring). Ten women (15%) did not wish to use continuous glucose monitoring again in pregnancy. Main causes behind early removal of continuous glucose monitoring were self-reported skin irritation, technical problems and continuous glucose monitoring inaccuracy. No differences were found in continuous glucose monitoring use, inconvenience or compliance with respect to diabetes type. Conclusions The majority of pregnant women with diabetes found real-time continuous glucose monitoring useful and the intervention was equally tolerated regardless of diabetes type. Nevertheless, continuous glucose monitoring was frequently removed earlier than planned, primarily because of skin irritation, technical problems and inaccuracy.

AB Background: Pregnancy is a time of significant physiological and physical change for women. In particular, it is a time at which many women are at risk of gaining excessive weight. We describe the rationale and methods of the Health in Pregnancy and Post-birth (HIPP) Study, a study which aims primarily to determine the effectiveness of a specialized health coaching (HC) intervention during pregnancy, compared to education alone, in preventing excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention 12 months post birth. A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the mechanisms by which our HC intervention impacts on weight management both during pregnancy and post birth.
   Methods/Design: The randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 220 women who have a BMI > 18.5 (American IOM cut-off for normal weight), are 18 years of age or older, English speaking, no history of disordered eating or diabetes and are less than 18 weeks gestation at recruitment. Women will be randomly allocated to either a specialized HC intervention group or an Education Alone group. Our specialized HC intervention has two components: (1) one-on-one sessions with a Health Coach, and (2) two by two hour educational group sessions led by a Health Coach. Women in the Education Alone group will receive two by two hour educational group sessions with no HC components. Body Mass Index, waist circumference, and psychological factors including motivation, readiness to change, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and body dissatisfaction will be assessed at baseline (14-16 weeks gestation), and again at follow-up: 32 weeks gestation, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months postpartum.
   Discussion: Our study responds to the urgent need to design effective interventions in pregnancy to prevent excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention. Our pregnancy HC intervention is novel and innovative and has been designed to be easily adopted by health professionals who work with pregnant women, such as obstetricians, midwives, allied health professionals and health psychologists.

AB Over the past two decades, research has identified extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor populations that enable neurons to sense the low ambient GABA concentrations present in the extracellular space in order to generate a form of tonic inhibition not previously considered in studies of neuronal excitability. The importance of this tonic inhibition in regulating states of consciousness is highlighted by the fact that extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are believed to be key targets for anesthetics, sleep-promoting drugs, neurosteroids, and alcohol. The neurosteroid sensitivity of these extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs may explain their importance in stress-, ovarian cycle-, and pregnancy-related mood disorders. Moreover, disruptions in network dynamics associated with schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease may well involve alterations in the tonic GABA(A)R-mediated conductance. Extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs may therefore present a therapeutic target for treatment of these diseases, with the potential to enhance cognition and aid post-stroke functional recovery.

AB The burdens of malaria on economic development of many tropical countries cannot be overemphasized. Introduction of ITN is a major effort by international bodies to reduce the problem. This study analysed the interrelationship between access to ITN and malaria morbidity. Data from the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were used and analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics and Two Stage Least Square. Results show that presence of pregnant women in the household, household size, north east, south east, and south south regions, number of children 5 years and under, age of household head, sex of household head, educational status, listening to radio, read newspaper, occupation, electricity, one room for sleeping in the household and marital status significantly influence access to ITN (p<0.10), while presence of a pregnant woman and number of children five years and under increased reported malaria morbidity. It was concluded that access to ITN may not translate into reduction of malaria morbidity, depending on the usage and exposure of household members to mosquito bites outside the nets. Efforts at reducing malaria morbidity should therefore focus on media interventions in providing complete information on malaria prevention. [Ajayi FF, Oyekale AS.

AB Objectives: Despite being highly educated in comparison with women in other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japanese women are expected to assume traditional gender roles, and many dedicate themselves to full-time housewifery. Women working outside the home do so under poor conditions, and their health may not be better than that of housewives. This study compared the self-rated health status and health behaviours of housewives and working women in Japan.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: A national university in Tokyo with 9864 alumnae.
   Participants: A total 1344 women who graduated since 1985 and completed questionnaires in an anonymous mail-based survey.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: Health anxiety and satisfaction, receipt of health checkups, eating breakfast, smoking, and sleep problems according to job status and family demands: housewives (n=247) and working women with (n=624) and without (n=436) family demands. ORs were used for risk assessment, with housewives as a reference.
   Results: After adjustment for satisfaction with present employment status and other confounding factors, working women were more likely than housewives to feel health anxiety (with family demands, OR: 1.68, 95% CI1.10 to 2.57; without family demands, OR: 3.57, 95% CI 2.19 to 4.50) and health dissatisfaction (without family demands, OR: 3.50, 95% CI 2.35 to 5.21); they were also more likely than housewives to eat an insufficient breakfast (with family demands, OR: 1.91, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.00; without family demands, OR: 4.02, 95% CI 2.47 to 6.57) and to have sleep problems (ORs: 2.08 to 4.03).
   Conclusions: No healthy-worker effect was found among Japanese women. Housewives, at least those who are well educated, appear to have better health status and health-related behaviours than do working women with the same level of education.

AB Eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care is a national priority, and obesity is a prime target. During the last 30 y in the United States, the prevalence of obesity among children has dramatically increased, sparing no age group. Obesity in childhood is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes and with other long-term adverse outcomes, including both physical and psychosocial consequences. By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present, suggesting that disparities in childhood obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life. Several risk factors during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of offspring obesity, including excessive maternal gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, smoking during pregnancy, antenatal depression, and biological stress. During infancy and early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, infant feeding practices, sleep duration, child's diet, physical activity, and sedentary practices are associated with the development of obesity. Studies have found substantial racial/ethnic differences in many of these early life risk factors for childhood obesity. It is possible that racial/ethnic differences in early life risk factors for obesity might contribute to the high prevalence of obesity among minority preschool-age children and beyond. Understanding these differences may help inform the design of clinical and public health interventions and policies to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and eliminate disparities among racial/ethnic minority children.

AB Study Objective: The Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are commonly used to screen for sleep apnea in non-pregnant populations. We sought to evaluate the Berlin and ESS in pregnancy and to determine whether an alternative screening approach could better detect sleep apnea in pregnant women.
   Methods: Pregnant women at high risk for sleep apnea (women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) completed a sleep survey composed of the Berlin and ESS, and participated in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted device designed to diagnose sleep apnea, defined as an apnea hypopnea index >= 5. Using multivariable statistics, demographic, clinical, and subjective symptoms that were independently associated with sleep apnea were determined and a prediction rule for the presence of sleep apnea was developed. The predictive capacity of this newly developed system was compared to that of the Berlin and ESS using receiver-operating curve (ROC) statistics.
   Results: Of the 114 women who participated and had a valid WP100 study, 100 completed the Berlin and 96 the ESS. The Berlin and ESS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this high-risk pregnancy cohort, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.54 (p = 0.6) and 0.57 (p = 0.3), respectively. Conversely, a model incorporating frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, age, and body mass index performed significantly better (AUC 0.86, p > 0.001).
   Conclusion: The Berlin and ESS are not appropriate tools to screen for sleep apnea in high-risk pregnant women. Conversely, our four-variable model more accurately predicts sleep apnea in pregnancy.

AB Study Objectives: Sleep problems in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are reportedly common but not well characterized. Objectives were to: (1) assess sleep concerns in children with FASD using a caregiver-report survey, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ); (2) compare CSHQ results with those of previously reported community sample; and (3) describe pilot polysomnography findings in children with FASD.
   Methods: Children with FASD were recruited from a behavioral intervention study, and participating caregivers completed the CSHQ. CSHQ results were compared with the original data from a previously published community sample of similar age. Participants with FASD and elevated CSHQ scores were offered overnight polysomnography.
   Results: Thirty-three children with FASD (4.1-12.1 years) were enrolled; 85% of children with FASD scored above the clinical cutoff Total Score of 41, reflecting marked sleep disturbance. Elevated subdomain scores occurred primarily in areas concerning for pediatric insomnia. Those with comorbid ADHD had elevated CSHQ on additional subdomains with no difference in Total Scores. Compared with the community sample, children with FASD had higher Total Scores on the CSHQ (52 vs. 39, p < 0.001). Polysomnography, completed in 5 subjects, revealed mild sleep disordered breathing and fragmented sleep with elevated non-respiratory arousal indices.
   Conclusions: Clinically significant sleep problems are present in children with FASD on both subjective and objective measures. Further investigation is needed to better describe these sleep disturbances and their impact on overall health and daytime neurobehavioral problems in this clinical population.

AB Orexins play a role in many biological functions include sleep, feeding, and energy balance. They also regulate circadian rhythms and the way that we feel pain. Orexins have been identified in a variety of tissues including the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, hypothalamus, spinal cord, sensory ganglion, enteric nervous system, pituitary, adrenal, salivary and lacrimal glands, testis, vestibular gland, and skin. Orexins play a role in a variety of biological functions including arousal, sleeping, food and fluid intake, pain, memory, perception of odor, and sexual activity. Orexins have also been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism. The expression of orexin is induced by hypoglycemia, low food, pregnancy, and hemodialysis. In contrast, factors that inhibit the expression of orexins include obstructive sleep apnea, aging, depression, obesity, traumatic brain injury, and inflammatory molecules such as liposaccharide. In conclusion, orexins are widely distributed and involved in a large variety of biological activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Obesity and being overweight affect almost half of all women of childbearing age, with postpartum weight retention (PWR) being a key contributing factor. Retention of postpartum weight has a number of negative health implications for mothers and offspring, including longer-term higher body mass index (BMI). There is increasing evidence that psychological factors are associated with PWR, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, and body dissatisfaction. However, what is less known is how these psychological factors might interact with maternal physiological and physical weight factors, sociocontextual influences, pregnancy-related medical factors, and maternal behaviours to lead to PWR. We have incorporated identified psychological influences within an empirically supported, multifactorial, conceptual model of hypothesised predictors of PWR, and argue that a systematic and rigorous evaluation of this conceptual model will inform the development of appropriate prevention strategies.

AB Background. Prediabetes is a preclinical stage in the hyperglycemia continuum where subjects are at increased risk of developing diabetes. Several studies reported a positive association between markers of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and diabetes. However, few studies investigated the relationship between SDB markers and prediabetes. Methods. We examined 5,685 participants >= 20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008. The exposure of interest was SDB markers including sleep duration, snoring, snorting, and daytime sleepiness. The outcome was prediabetes (n = 2058), among subjects free of diabetes. Results. SDB markers were associated with prediabetes. Compared to those without any sleep disturbance, the multivariable odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of prediabetes among those with three or more SDB markers was 1.69 (1.28-2.22). In subgroup analyses, the association between SDB markers and prediabetes was stronger among women (OR (95% CI) = 2.09 (1.36-3.23) when compared to men (1.52 (1.00-2.35)) and was present among non-Hispanic whites (2.66 (1.92-3.69)) and Mexican Americans (1.99 (1.13-3.48)), but not among non-Hispanic blacks (1.10 (0.70-1.73)). Conclusion. SDB markers were associated with prediabetes. This association was stronger in women and was present mainly in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans.

AB The aims of the current study were to evaluate the effects of diazepam (D) and/or xylazine (X) on the induction of sedation and anesthesia, performing ovarian transplantation and litter size upon administration during pregnancy. One hundred and five albino rat females were classified randomly into four groups given intraperitoneal (IP) injection of physiological saline (group I), diazepam (6.2 mg/kg body weight -group II), xylazine (13.2 mg/kg/body weight -group III) and 6.2 mg/kg body weight diazepam and 13.2 mg/kg body weight xylazine (group IV). Induction of sedation and anesthesia were monitored. The onset of anesthesia, duration of surgical anesthesia and sleep time after injections was recorded. Rectal temperatures were monitored at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 120 min after injection. Blood samples were collected at 0 and 120 min post injection for determination of hemoglobin, glucose and urea concentrations. Ovarian transplantation was performed in females anesthesized with DX drugs. Mated females were injected with physiological saline, 6.2 mg/kg diazepam and/or 13.2 mg/kg xylazine at day 4, 11 and 18 of pregnancy and litter sizes were recorded. Sedation was obtained after injection of diazepam or xylazine alone whereas surgical anesthesia was obtained upon injection of both diazepam and xylazine. The onset of anesthesia, duration of anesthesia and sleep time after DX injection was 4.6, 144.1 and 79.1 min, respectively. Rectal temperature decreased (P<0.05) after injection of diazepam and/or xylazine. The hemoglobin (P<0.05), glucose and urea blood concentrations increased after injection of diazepam and/or xylazine. Upon ovarian transplantation, all animals recovered and ovarian follicles were found in the transplanted ovaries. Number of offspring per animal did not differ due to diazepam and/or xylazine injection at day 4, 11 and 18 of pregnancy. In conclusion, DX injection induced surgical anesthesia in rats sufficient for performing major surgeries.

AB A population-based questionnaire study of 2,816 women was conducted in week 32 of pregnancy to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for insomnia and depressive symptoms. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) measured insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) measured depressive symptoms. The prevalence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) was 61.9%, and mean BIS score 17.5 (SD = 10.5), significantly higher than among the general population. The prevalence of depressive symptoms (EPDS >= 10) was 14.6%. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with insomnia during late pregnancy, especially with sleep durations <5 or >10 hours, sleep efficiency <75%, daytime impairment, and long sleep onset latency. Pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain was associated with insomnia, but not with depressive symptoms.

AB Sleep disruption has been suggested to contribute to postpartum mood, but few studies have explored differences in this relationship between nulliparous and multiparous mothers. This study compared the interaction of sleep and mood as a function of parity. Thirty-five nulliparous and 34 multiparous mothers completed questionnaires on mood and sleep, and wore actigraphs for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within 2 weeks postpartum. Mood and objective sleep were better in multiparas than in nulliparas after delivery. However, other than a stronger association between subjective sleep and stress in nulliparous mothers, the relationship between sleep and mood did not differ significantly between the two groups. This suggests that parity might play only a limited role in the interaction between sleep and mood during the immediate postpartum period.

AB The present study determined which self-reported sleep variables and daytime impairment measures are most closely associated with sleep quality ratings (SQR) in men and women with insomnia. The participants were 137 people with insomnia, 56 men and 81 women. Multiple regression found that for men, sleep efficiency best predicted SQR, explaining 26.9% of variance. A similar analysis was conducted for women. After race was entered as a covariate, number of awakenings and total sleep time were significant predictors of SQR. Collectively, race, number of awakenings, and total sleep time explained 35.7% of variance. This suggests that the middle-of-the-night experience predicts sleep quality rating in women with insomnia, whereas the full night experience predicts sleep quality ratings in men with insomnia.

AB Study Objectives: To determine the relationships between key variables obtained from ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) and the wrist-worn Watch-PAT 200 device in pregnant women.
   Methods: In this prospective cohort study, women in their third trimester of pregnancy underwent full overnight home PSG using the 22-channel MediPalm system and the Watch-PAT 200 device. PSGs were scored by a blinded, experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored automatically by the manufacturer's proprietary software.
   Results: A total of 31 pregnant women were studied. Mean age was 30.2 +/- 7.1 years; mean gestational age was 33.4 +/- 3.0 weeks; mean BMI was 31.9 +/- 8.1 kg/m(2); 39% of women were nulliparous. Key variables generated by PSG and Watch-PAT correlated well over a wide range, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.76, p < 0.001); respiratory disturbance index (RDI, r = 0.68, p < 0.001), mean oxygen saturation (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The area under the curve for AHI >= 5 and RDI >= 10 were 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Association between stage 3 sleep on PSG and deep sleep on Watch-PAT was poor. Watch-PAT tended to overscore RDI, particularly as severity increased.
   Conclusions: Among pregnant women, Watch-PAT demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity for identification of obstructive sleep apnea, defined as AHI >= 5 on full PSG. Watch-PAT may overestimate RDI somewhat, especially at high RDI values.

AB The prevalence rate of epilepsy is between 4-10/1000 people in general population. It is a well-known fact that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used during pregnancy increase the rate of congenital malformations. However, there is not enough information about the electrophysiological effects of AEDs. In this study, 127 children whose mothers have epilepsy and 33 children whose mothers are healthy, were included. Twenty nine mothers did not use AEDs whereas 98 patients used AEDs during their pregnancy. Demographic features of both mothers and children, as well as epilepsy characteristics of mothers are recorded. The EEG examinations were done awake and/or during sleep. The children whose mothers have epilepsy had higher rate of EEG abnormalities and the ratio was statistically significant. EEG abnormalities were higher in the children whose mothers had polytherapy (%50) than in the group with monotherapy (%31,7). EEG abnormalities were mostly seen (%47) in children whose mothers used VPA. Children born of patients with epilepsy who did not use folic acid with AEDs had a higher rate of EEG abnormalities and this ratio was statistically significant. It was also observed that children, whose mothers have generalized EEG abnormalities, have generalized EEG abnormalities more frequently. It is necessary to examine patients who used AEDs during pregnancy not only in terms of congenital malformations but also electrophysiological effects and to advise taking folic acid. Examining children who are born under the effect of AEDs electrophysiologically in the years following their birth may provide predictions about whether the effects of AEDs.

ID BODY-TEMPERATURE; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; MOUTH-DISEASE; HORSE; GOATS
AB Background: Circadian rhythms are biological rhythms generated by an organism or group of organisms that have an intrinsic period of 24 h. Among the many variables that exhibit circadian rhythmicity, body temperature has received considerable attention. The circadian rhythm of body temperature is a well-documented physiological phenomen. Also, it has been shown that changes in heat loss via convection and radiation are primarily caused by variations in skin blood flow, with consequent changes in skin temperature. For this reason, foot temperature assumes a great importance both as indicator of equine laminitis and foot-and-mouth disease in sheep. Particularly, the foot rot, term loosely used to describe lameness associated with the bovine foot, is characterized by acute inflammation of the skin and adjacent soft tissue of the interdigital cleft or space in which the modifications of temperature assume a great importance. In fact, the regulation of body temperature is an essential component of the process of fever, which plays an important role in an organism's response to infection and disease, and its manipulation is a standard procedure in various surgical and therapeutic procedures. In this regards, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of rectal temperature (RT) both in healthy Comisana sheep and in Comisana sheep affected by foot rot.
   Materials, Methods & Results: This experiment was carried out on 10 clinically healthy and not pregnant female sheep, and 10 not pregnant female sheep affected by foot rot. During the experimental period, all animals were kept under a natural photoperiod (sunrise 06: 30, sunset 19: 00). RT was measured every 3 h intervals for 24 consecutive hours starting at 11: 00 on day 1 and ending at 11: 00 on day 2. A trigonometric statistical model was applied to the average values of each time series, so as to describe the periodic phenomenon analytically, by characterizing the main rhythmic parameters according to the single cosinor procedure. Four rhythmic parameters were determined: mean level, amplitude (the difference between the peak, or trough, and the mean value of a wave), acrophase (the time at which the peak of a rhythm occurs), and robustness (strength of rhythmicity). The application of the periodic model showed a circadian rhythm of RT in healthy subjects and no circadian rhytmicity of RT was observed in ill sheep.
   Discussion: The analysis of the results obtained under experimental conditions used in the present study indicated the existence of a circadian periodicity of rectal temperature in healthy sheep whereas no circadian oscillations of rectal temperature were revealed in sheep affected by foot rot. A simple and coherent explanation for these pathological alterations is that the set point is elevated during the rising phase and returned to normal during the later phase. Taking together, the findings of the present study, along with those of others, emphasize the concept that RT exhibits a circadian rhythm that reflect the familiar circadian patterns of endogenous source and the existence of circadian oscillations around a set point with changes in mean body temperature and an absent rhythm when temperature is modified to a new set point, as observed in sheep affected by foot rot.

AB Purpose: To compare obstetric outcomes between patients with positive and negative Berlin Questionnaire results. Methods: An observational study comparing outcome between these two groups was carried out in seven hospitals, representing seven different regions of Turkey. In each center, pregnant women who were admitted for normal pregnancy follow-up or labor, were consecutively recruited in the study. Each participant completed a sleep apnea questionnaire from the Berlin Questionnaire. This questionnaire tests snoring and daytime sleepiness. Fetal outcome and pregnancy outcome are recorded from patient files. Results: A total of 465 consecutive patients who completed the Berlin Questionnaire were analyzed. Patients with a positive questionnaire had a higher BMI, pre-pregnancy medical disorder rate and cesarean rate (68% vs 51%) than the negative group. Preeclampsia and gestational diabetes were more prevalent in the positive questionnaire group than the negative questionnaire group [19 (28%) vs 18 (5%) for preeclampsia, 8 (12) vs 13 (3%) for gestational diabetes, respectively]. At logistic regression analysis, gravidity, gestational age at birth and a positive questionnaire were independent predictors for preeclampsia. BMI and history of maternal medical disorders were independent predictors of gestational diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea may be related to preeclampsia.

AB Background: Studies of children who undergo major non-cardiac surgery in the neonatal period are needed so that subsequent abnormal neurodevelopment can be better understood. Objective: It was the aim of our study to describe the influence of analgesic and sedative medication on the predominant background pattern and the development of sleep-wake cycling (SWC), as measured on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), in newborn infants born >= 32 weeks' gestation after major non-cardiac surgery. Methods: This prospective study included infants >= 32(+0) weeks' gestation admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne who were undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. Data on morphine and midazolam given after surgery were recorded and the BrainZ Monitor was applied post-operatively. The maximum levels of morphine and midazolam were assessed as predictors of time to aEEG outcomes using linear regression. Results:Forty-seven eligible infants were included. Emergence of SWC was observed at a mean of 13 h after surgery. The maximum dose of morphine or midazolam was not predictive of time to either any or developed SWC. Conclusions: Despite high doses of morphine and midazolam, SWC was observed on aEEG in neonates >= 32 weeks' gestational age soon after major non-cardiac surgery. The aEEG background pattern was not affected by the maximum dose of either morphine or midazolam. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Human and rodent studies indicate a role for circadian rhythmicity and associated clock gene expression in supporting normal parturition. The importance of clock gene expression in tissues besides the suprachiasmatic nucleus is emerging. Here, a Bmal1 conditional knockout mouse line and a novel Cre transgenic mouse line were used to examine the role of myometrial Bmal1 in parturition. Ninety-two percent (22/24) of control females but only 64% (14/22) of females with disrupted myometrial Bmal1 completed parturition during the expected time window of 5 p.m. on Day 19 through to 9 a.m. on Day 19.5 of gestation. However, neither serum progesterone levels nor uterine transcript expression of the contractile-associated proteins Connexin43 and Oxytocin receptor differed between females with disrupted myometrial Bmal1 and controls during late gestation. The data indicate a role for myometrial Bmal1 in maintaining normal time of day of parturition.

AB This study aims to investigate insomnia experienced by pregnant women and factors associated with it. This study was designed as hospital-based, descriptive, and cross-sectional research. The participants were 486 people chosen with nonprobability random sampling method. The data were collected through Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Interview Form. Insomnia prevalence in women participating in this study was found 52.2%. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of insomnia was 2.03 times higher for those in the third trimester than those in the first and second trimesters, 2.19 times higher for those 20 years old and over than younger ones, and 2.63 times higher for those who had depression syndrome than those who did not. Insomnia in pregnant women who participated in this study was found to be at high rates.

AB Objectives: A number of studies have examined the relationship between disconfirmed expectations about early parenthood and postnatal depressive symptoms. Most have focused on primiparous women, yet new fathers and multiparous parents also develop depressive symptoms following childbirth. The current study examined whether primiparous and multiparous mothers' and fathers' antenatal expectations about infant feeding and sleeping behaviours were consistent with their later experiences and whether disconfirmed expectations were associated with postnatal depressive symptoms. Method: Thirty-five mothers and 24 fathers in Brisbane Australia completed questionnaires during the third trimester of pregnancy and again in the first 16 weeks post-delivery. Results: Parents' expectations of infant behaviours were matched or exceeded by their postnatal experience. Discrepancies between antenatal expectations and postnatal experiences were not associated with parity or severity of depressive symptoms in the early postnatal period. Conclusion: Primiparous and multiparous parents typically held realistic expectations of infant sleeping and feeding behaviours relative to their postnatal experience. A small group of parents held less favourable antenatal expectations which may be an adaptive cognitive strategy used to protect parents against negative postnatal experience. Implications of these findings for research and clinical practice are discussed.

   PRIMARY-CARE; PREGNANCY; AUGMENTATION
AB Gabapentin enacarbil XR is a new extended-release formulation which attempts to overcome the reduced efficacy of shorter-acting gabapentin, with sustained delivery over a 24-hour period. It is a gabapentin prodrug which is efficiently and rapidly converted to gabapentin during active transport throughout the length of the intestine via high-capacity monocarboxylate type 1 nutrient transporters unlike its predecessor, which is absorbed via low-capacity transporters largely confined to the upper intestinal region. Its lack of saturable absorption allows for dose-proportional absorption and hence increased bioavailability. Several clinical trials addressing its efficacy in moderate to severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) demonstrate improvements in the International RLS Rating Scale after a 2-week to 3-month period. Open-label studies of 52 weeks' duration showed maintenance of symptom reduction with once-daily administration of the extended-release formulation. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse effects were somnolence and dizziness. Although the incidence of emergent adverse effects is high, it is comparable with that of gabapentin. No studies thus far have documented augmentation as an issue, unlike that observed with most dopaminergic agents. In addition, both dopamine precursors and agonists have not been shown to increase slow wave sleep or improve overall sleep architecture consistently despite improvement in the periodic leg movement index, in contrast with gabapentin enacarbil. Presently, gabapentin enacarbil has not been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration or Medsafe for use in RLS. The cost of this medication may also be a potential barrier for many patients. Future comparative efficacy studies with gabapentin, first-line dopaminergic agents, rotigotine, being the other once daily RLS medication, and pregabalin, the structural analog of gabapentin, will be necessary.

AB Objective. To study the variation of protein excretion in short-interval day-and-night collections in hospitalized preeclamptic patients on continuous bed rest. Methods. We prospectively studied 50 patients admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Urine volumes in 2-, 4-, 12-, and 24-h durations were recorded. Protein concentrations in different volumes of urine were measured. Paired t-test was used to compare the volumes, concentrations, and the total amounts of protein in these samples of different durations. Results. There was no significant difference in the volume of urine and the concentration of proteinuria in the day when compared to night (12-h samples) (p > 0.05). The total amount of protein excreted was comparable for the two durations of samples. For shorter-duration collections (4- and 2-h), the difference in proteinuria between day and night samples remained blunted. Conclusion. This study concludes that there is blunting of variation in protein excretion as observed in short-interval urine collections at different times of the day in hypertensive pregnant patients on continuous bed rest.

AB Introduction: Assessment of loneliness, quality of sleep and affecting factors in elders.
   Materials and Method: A total of 428 elders were included in the research. The research data were collected using the loneliness scale (UCLA-LS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). One-way analysis of variance, t test and Pearson analysis of correlation were used to evaluate the data.
   Results: The average loneliness score was 41.87 +/- 8.43. The average loneliness score of those living in the nursing home was higher than that of those living in the home environment. The relationship between the average loneliness score and age, educational background, childbearing, and the number of visitors were significant (p<0.05). The average sleep quality score was 6.21 +/- 3.33. Educational background, income status, childbearing, having a chronic disease, number of visitors, and duration of residence in the nursing home were found to affect the quality of sleep (p<0.05). A slightly positive relationship (r=0.298; p=0.001) was observed between the average loneliness score and the quality of sleep score.
   Conclusion: Loneliness and sleep problems are common among elders. In order to improve their quality of life and health status, health care providers should recognize and take necessary actions to alleviate these problems.

AB The cardiovascular structure is temporally organized in both health and disease. The link between obesity and hypertension is elevated sympathetic nervous system activity and hormonal activity which present a clear rhythmicity, with the pineal, corticosteroid and leptin systems being those most implicated. Also, genetic mutations or deletions have implicated peripheral clock genes in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, which are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. As hypertension and obesity are related, and the treatments of these disorders are well established but sometimes ineffective, this review focuses on chronobiological contributions to decrease the burden of hypertension and obesity in low-and middle-income groups of individuals. MEDLINE, Pubmed and SUMSearch sites (2001-2011) were used in the search strategy, together with the keywords: "antihypertensive drugs"; "arterial hypertension"; "circadian rhythms"; "obesity"; and "sleep quality". Eighty-six articles were found and 50 articles from these were selected. A link between the circadian clock and hypertension has recently been described in animal models, using Clock-mutant mice that display metabolic syndrome. Experimental evidence clearly implicates circadian rhythms in the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the blood pressure (BP) rhythm. Most clinical studies of BP focus on some pathological situation, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes or pregnancy with blood biomarker alterations. However, epidemiological evidence for the role of circadian rhythms in hypertension has been lacking until recently. In Brazil, in an epidemiological, cross-sectional study, changed sleep quality and an earlier phase of mid-sleep were found in those using antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, some pharmacological studies support a circadian-and dose-dependent relationship in the use of antihypertensive drugs for the 24-h control of BP. In low-and middle-income areas, cost-effectiveness of any intervention is fundamental to the implementation of any kind of public-health policy. Therefore, improvements in diagnosis, effectiveness and implementing prevention measures to control the risk of disease are all necessary, and there is evidence that chronobiology has an important role to play. Consequently, it is important to provide guidelines to monitor BP to reduce cardiovascular risk that include chronobiological aspects of the problem.

AB Some infants show a free-running rhythm in their rest-activity. We do not know why, nor do we know exactly what the entrainment factors are for the development of the normal 24-h rest-activity rhythm. Actigraphic recordings on 10 primiparae during late pregnancy and these mothers and their infants during the 2nd, 6th, and 12th wks after birth were made over 3-5 continuous days to investigate maternal and infant entrainment. One infant showed a free-running rest-activity circadian rhythm. In late pregnancy, the period in the autocorrelogram of the mother with the free-running infant was longer than the significant period of the mean autocorrelogram of the mothers with non-free-running infants. The finding of this study indicates the free-running rhythm of infant is not reset by maternal entrainment factors. (Author correspondence: nishihara-kk@igakuken.or.jp)

AB The vast majority of females affected by hemochromatosis are asymptomatic during childbearing years. We were able to provide effective obstetric anesthesia care to a 35-year-old woman with severe hemochromatosis. She had systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, severe pulmonary hypertension, mitral insufficiency, a history of ventricular tachycardia, cirrhosis, obstructive sleep apnea, gestational diabetes, and severe scoliosis. A multidisciplinary approach was used to stabilize her heart failure and prepare her for childbirth. An arterial line and epidural analgesic were placed before induction of labor. Vaginal delivery was accomplished with passive decent of the fetus and forceps assistance. We discuss hemochromatosis and its implications for the parturient. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A long-standing critique of adolescent employment is that it engenders a precocious maturity of more adult-like roles and behaviors, including school disengagement, substance use, sexual activity, inadequate sleep and exercise, and work-related stress. Though negative effects of high-intensity work on adolescent adjustment have been found, little research has addressed whether such work experiences are associated with precocious family formation behaviors in adolescence, such as sexual intercourse, pregnancy, residential independence, and union formation. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that teenagers who spend long hours on the job during the school year are more likely to experience these family formation behaviors earlier than youth who work moderately or not at all.

AB Objective: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. Methods: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 6 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. Results: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from +/- 13 6 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia-vehicle to - 9 +/- 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia-short infusion and -5 6 +/- 1.6dB after ischemia-long infusion (n 6, p < 0.05). Peptide infusion was associated with reduced seizure activity after ischemia, less frequent status epilepticus (p < 0.05), and earlier return of sleep state cycling (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion (but not ischemia-short infusion) was associated with improved survival of oligodendrocytes in intragyral and periventricular white matter (p < 0.05) and increased brain weight (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion was associated with an intermediate estimate of surviving neurons in the parasagittal cortex of 2.9 +/- 0.8 x 10(6), in comparison to sham control (4.3 +/- 0.9 x 10 6) or ischemia-vehicle (1.5 +/- 0.4 x 10(6); p < 0.05 vs sham control). Interpretation: These data support the hypothesis that opening of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray matter dysfunction and injury.

AB Objective: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by other psychosocial risk factors.
   Methods: Pregnant women (n = 217) for whom we had depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed sleep was associated with PTB.
   Results: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI.92-1.71). No other relationships were significant.
   Conclusions: We report preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB. Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

ID DEATH-SYNDROME; RISK-FACTORS; PRONE; ENVIRONMENT; WASHINGTON; CAMPAIGN;

AB This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2-66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6-47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000-2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006-2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome.

AB A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to investigate the association between preeclampsia and arterial stiffness. Twenty-three relevant studies were included. A significant increase in all arterial stiffness indices combined was observed in women with preeclampsia vs. women with normotensive pregnancies [ standardized mean difference 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-2.50]; carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and augmentation index (AIx) were also significantly increased (weighted mean difference, WMDcfPWV 1.04, 95% CI 0.34-1.74; WMDAIx 15.10, 95% CI 5.08-25.11), whereas carotid-radial PWV (crPWV) increase did not reach significance (WMDcrPWV 0.99, 95% CI -0.07 to 2.05). Significant increases in arterial stiffness measurements were noted in women with preeclampsia compared with those with gestational hypertension. Arterial stiffness measurements may also be useful in predicting preeclampsia and may play a role in the increased risk of future cardiovascular complications seen in women with a history of preeclampsia.

AB Purpose This study utilises an ecological design to analyse the relation between concurrent temporal trends in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rates and prevalence of smoke-free households with infants in the USA, controlling for an important risk factor, infant supine sleep position.
   Methods Annual state-specific SIDS cases were computed using period linked birth/infant death files; the prevalence of 100% smoke-free homes with infants using Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey data, and percentage of infants in supine sleep position from National Infant Sleep Position data, for years 1995-2006. Incidence rate ratios relating trends in SIDS cases and risk factors were determined using time-series negative binomial regression. Population-level health effects were assessed with secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure population attributable fractions and excess attributable SIDS deaths.
   Results For every 1% absolute increase in the prevalence of smoke-free homes with infants, SIDS rates decreased 0.4% from 1995 to 2006, controlling for supine sleep position. Nationally, it is possible that 20% of the 1326 total SIDS cases were attributable to childhood SHS exposure at home in 2006 with potentially 534 fewer infant deaths attributable to SHS exposure in 2006 than in 1995, owing to an increasing prevalence of 100% smoke-free homes with infants. Cumulatively, 4402 (lower 95% CI) to 6406 (upper 95% CI) excess SIDS cases may have been attributable to SHS exposure in the home over the 12-year study period.
   Conclusions The uptake of voluntary restrictions on smoking inside the home may present a public health benefit for infants in their first year of life. In light of inherent ecological study design limitations, these results warrant further individual level research linking postnatal SHS exposure and SIDS.

AB Background
   Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.
   Objectives
   To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or shamor no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate.
   Main results
   Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.
   Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor.
   Authors' conclusions
   Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.

TI Time scales of autonomic information flow in near-term fetal sheep
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE fetal heart rate; HRV; autonomic nervous system; permutation entropy;
   complexity; sleep; atropine; propranolol
AB Autonomic information flow (AIF) characterizes fetal heart rate (FHR) variability (fHRV) in the time scale dependent complexity domain and discriminates sleep states [high voltage/low frequency (HV/LF) and low voltage/high frequency (LV/HF) electrocortical activity (ECoG)]. However, the physiologic relationship of AIF time scales to the underlying sympathetic and vagal rhythms is not known. Understanding this relationship will enhance the benefits derived from using fHRV to monitor fetal health non-invasively. We analyzed AIF measured as Kullback-Leibler entropy (KLE) in fetal sheep in late gestation as function of vagal and sympathetic modulation of fHRV, using atropine and propranolol, respectively (n = 6), and also analyzed changes in fHRV during sleep states (n = 12). Atropine blockade resulted in complexity decrease at 2.5 Hz compared to baseline HV/LF and LV/HF states and at 1.6 Hz compared to LV/HE Propranolol blockade resulted in complexity increase in the 0.8-1 Hz range compared to LV/HF and in no changes when compared to HV/LE During LV/HF state activity, fHRV complexity was lower at 2.5 Hz and higher at 0.15-0.19 Hz than during HV/LF. Our findings show that in mature fetuses near term vagal activity contributes to fHRV complexity on a wider range of time scales than sympathetic activity. Related to sleep, during LV/HF we found lower complexity at short-term time scale where complexity is also decreased due to vagal blockade. We conclude that vagal and sympathetic modulations of fHRV show sleep state-dependent and time scale-dependent complexity patterns captured by AIF analysis of fHRV. Specifically, we observed a vagally mediated and sleep state-dependent change in these patterns at a time scale around 2.5 Hz (0.2 s). A paradigm of state-dependent non-linear sympathovagal modulation of fHRV is discussed.

AB Background: Rapid weight gain during the first three years of life predicts child and adult obesity, and also later cardiovascular and other morbidities. Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult, the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care.
   Methods/Design: This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded "Well Child" care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and support in addition to "Well Child" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life; the Sleep group which receives at least 3 extra parent contacts over the first 6 months of life with a focus on prevention of sleep problems and then active intervention if there is a sleep problem from 6 months to 2 years; or the Combination group which receives all extra contacts. The main outcome measures are conditional weight velocity (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months) and body mass index z-score at 24 months, with secondary outcomes including sleep and physical activity (parent report, accelerometry), duration of breastfeeding, timing of introduction of solids, diet quality, and measures of family function and wellbeing (parental depression, child mindedness, discipline practices, family quality of life and health care use). This study will contribute to a prospective meta-analysis of early life obesity prevention studies in Australasia.
   Discussion: Infancy is likely to be the most effective time to establish patterns of behaviour around food, activity and sleep that promote healthy child and adult weight. The POI.nz study will determine the extent to which sleep, food and activity interventions in infancy prevent the development of overweight.

AB Background: BRAC, an indigenous non-governmental development organization (NGO), has been implementing a programme to prevent and control malaria in the 13 malaria-endemic districts of Bangladesh since 2007. One of the critical preventive interventions is the distribution of insecticidal bed nets (long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, LLINs and insecticide-treated ordinary nets, ITNs) to the community free of cost. This study aimed to assess progress in the possession, preferential use, and knowledge on use of the LLIN/ITNs including the programme's avowed pro-poor inclination one and three and half years after intervention began.
   Methods: A convenient sampling strategy based on malaria endemicity in the districts was adopted. First, thirty upazila (sub-district, with a population around 250,000)s were selected at random, with high prevalent districts contributing more upazilas; second, from each upazila, one (2008) to two (2011) villages (covered by insecticidal bed net distribution programme) were selected. From each village, households that had either one under-five child and/or a pregnant woman were included in the survey, one household being included only once. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire.
   Results: In all, 3,760 households in 2008 and 7,895 households in 2011 were surveyed for collecting relevant information. Proportion of households with at least one LLIN, and at least one LLIN/ITN increased (22-59 to 62-67% and 22-64% to 74-76% respectively) over time, including increase in the mean number of LLIN/ITNs per household (<= 1 to 1 +). The programme achieved > 80% coverage in sleeping under an LLIN/ITN in the case of under-five children and pregnant women, especially in the high-endemic districts. Knowledge regarding critical time of hanging the net also increased over time (7-22 to 44-54%), but remained low. The pro-poor inclination of the programme is reflected in the status of relevant indicators according to self-rated poverty status of the households.
   Conclusions: There has been a substantial improvement in possession and usage of insecticidal bed nets especially for the two most vulnerable groups (under-five children and pregnant women), including a reduction of gaps between the high and low endemic districts, and the deficit and non-deficit households during the study period.

AB Background: Ownership of insecticidal mosquito nets has dramatically increased in Ethiopia since 2006, but the proportion of persons with access to such nets who use them has declined. It is important to understand individual level net use factors in the context of the home to modify programmes so as to maximize net use.
   Methods: Generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM) were used to investigate net use using individual level data from people living in net-owning households from two surveys in Ethiopia: baseline 2006 included 12,678 individuals from 2,468 households and a sub-sample of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) in 2007 included 14,663 individuals from 3,353 households. Individual factors (age, sex, pregnancy); net factors (condition, age, net density); household factors (number of rooms [2006] or sleeping spaces [2007], IRS, women's knowledge and school attendance [2007 only], wealth, altitude); and cluster level factors (rural or urban) were investigated in univariate and multi-variable models for each survey.
   Results: In 2006, increased net use was associated with: age 25-49 years (adjusted (a) OR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.7) compared to children U5; female gender (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.2-1.5); fewer nets with holes (Ptrend = 0.002); and increasing net density (Ptrend < 0.001). Reduced net use was associated with: age 5-24 years (aOR = 0.2; 95% CI 0.2-0.3). In 2007, increased net use was associated with: female gender (aOR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.6); fewer nets with holes (aOR ([all nets in HH good]) = 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1); increasing net density (Ptrend < 0.001); increased women's malaria knowledge (Ptrend < 0.001); and urban clusters (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5-4.1). Reduced net use was associated with: age 524 years (aOR = 0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.4); number of sleeping spaces (aOR ([per additional space]) = 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7); more old nets (aOR ([all nets in HH older than 12 months]) = 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.7); and increasing household altitude (Ptrend < 0.001).
   Conclusion: In both surveys, net use was more likely by women, if nets had fewer holes and were at higher net per person density within households. School-age children and young adults were much less likely to use a net. Increasing availability of nets within households (i.e. increasing net density), and improving net condition while focusing on education and promotion of net use, especially in school-age children and young adults in rural areas, are crucial areas for intervention to ensure maximum net use and consequent reduction of malaria transmission.

AB Background: The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to use objective methods to assess the association between maternal smoking and body composition in offspring.
   Methods: A total of 2508 grade 4 school children were enrolled; all underwent lifestyle disease and passive smoking screening. Children were classified into four groups according to their urinary cotinine level and maternal smoking status during or before pregnancy. Items measured on lifestyle disease screening were compared among the four groups.
   Results: Only degree of obesity (DO) and body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy. The prevalence of both DO > 20% and DO > 30%, and BMI > 22% and BMI > 25% was highest in children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy. These children had a tendency toward shorter height and increased weight although it was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between maternal smoking status and lipid profile among groups. Confounders such as food, exercise and sleep were able to be eliminated
   Conclusion: Maternal smoking during pregnancy may be an independent risk factor of changing body composition in offspring, that is, shorter height and increased weight.

AB Animal studies can contribute to addressing the issue of possible greater health risk for children exposed to 50-60 Hz extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MFs), mostly in terms of teratological effects and cancer.
   Teratology has been extensively studied in animals exposed to ELF MFs but experiments have not established adverse developmental effects.
   Childhood leukaemia has been the only cancer consistently reported in epidemiological studies as associated with exposure to ELF MFs. This association has been the basis for the classification as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2002. Animal experiments have provided only limited support for these epidemiological findings. However, none but one study used an animal model for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the main form of childhood leukaemia, and exposures to ELF MFs were not carried out over the whole pregnancy period, when the first hit of ALL is assumed to occur.
   Moreover, there are no generally accepted biophysical mechanisms that could explain carcinogenic effects of low-level MFs. The radical pair mechanism and related cryptochromes (CRY) molecules have recently been identified in birds and other non-mammalian species, as a sensor of the geomagnetic field, involved in navigation. The hypothesis has to be tested in mammalian models. CRY, which is part of the molecular circadian clock machinery, is a ubiquitous protein likely to be involved in cancer cell growth and DNA repair.
   In summary, we now have some clues to test for a better characterization of the interaction between ALL and ELF MFs exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auditory perception and learning take place during the third trimester of gestation. Fetuses and newborns who lack typical auditory experience can go on to develop typical socioemotional attachment and language, given a supportive environment. For hospitalized preterm infants in developmentally sensitive neonatal intensive care units, detrimental effects of deviant early auditory experience may be remediated by later experience, but much is unknown about the causes of language deficits of prematurity. Prenatal auditory stimulation programs that incorporate audio speakers against the maternal belly should be discouraged because of possible overstimulation effects on the developing auditory system and sleep/wake state organization.

AB Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause several cognitive and behavioral difficulties. Few studies have investigated the associations with infant temperament or sleeping patterns. Our aim was to study potential associations between early prenatal binge exposure and infant temperament and sleeping pattern.
   Methods: In a population based longitudinal study, representative of pregnant women in Oslo, questionnaires were answered at 17 and 30 weeks of pregnancy and 6 months after term. Two factors, difficult temperament and sleeping problems, were identified using Principal Component Analysis and dichotomized at the least optimal 14-15%. Logistic regression analyses identified predictive factors.
   Results: Maternal binge drinking (>= 5 drinks per occasion) once a week during pregnancy week 0-6 significantly predicted both difficult temperament (Odds Ratio OR 3.3**; 95% Confidence interval Cl 1.4-7.9) and sleeping problems (OR 5.3**; 95% Cl 2.1-13.7) in the infant, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Including binge drinking more often than once a week, further increased the OR of sleeping problems (6.0***; 2.7-13.7). Prenatal maternal depressive symptoms also predicted both outcomes. Reduced birth weight predicted difficult temperament. Maternal satisfaction with life reduced the probability of sleeping problems. Maternal smoking, and work stress, during pregnancy had no predictive power. The results were not explained by binge drinking later during pregnancy or higher consumption per occasion.
   Conclusions: Binge drinking once a week during pregnancy week 0-6 had stronger predictive power of difficult temperament and sleeping problems during infancy, than other covariates. The findings support advising women to avoid binge drinking when planning pregnancy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background/Objectives: Energy costs of pregnancy approximate 320 MJ in well-nourished women, but whether or not these costs may be partly covered by modifications in activity behavior is incompletely known. In healthy Swedish women: (1) to evaluate the potential of the Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity (IDEEA) to assess energy expenditure during free-living conditions, (2) to assess activity pattern, walking pace and energy metabolism in pregnant women and non-pregnant controls, and (3) to assess the effect on energy expenditure caused by changes in physical activity induced by pregnancy.
   Subjects/Methods: Activity pattern was assessed using the IDEEA in 18 women in gestational week 32 and in 21 non-pregnant women. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) was assessed using IDEEA, as well as using the doubly labelled water method and indirect calorimetry.
   Results: AEE using the IDEEA was correlated with reference estimates in both groups (r = 0.4-0.5; P<0.05). Reference AEE was 0.9 MJ/24 h lower in pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Pregnant women spent 92 min/24 h more on sitting, lying, reclining and sleeping (P = 0.020), 73 min/24 h less on standing (P = 0.037) and 21 min/24 h less on walking and using stairs (P = 0.049), and walked at a slower pace (1.1 +/- 0.1 m/s versus 1.2 +/- 0.1 m/s; P = 0.014) than did non-pregnant controls. The selection of less demanding activities and slower walking pace decreased energy costs by 720 kJ/24 h and 80 kJ/24 h, respectively.
   Conclusion: Healthy moderately active Swedish women compensated for the increased energy costs of pregnancy by 0.9 MJ/24 h. The compensation was mainly achieved by selecting less demanding activities. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011) 65, 1295-1301; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2011.129; published online 27 July 2011

AB Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the "de novo mutation" hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP.
   Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort.
   Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99-1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA.
   Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the "de nova mutation" hypothesis.

AB OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ownership and use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) by the local community 2 years after a free distribution campaign in Ethiopia.
   METHODS This is a population-based survey using a two-stage cluster sample design in 115 randomly selected clusters in Oromia and Amhara regional states of Ethiopia, performed in June 2009. Data on the possession and use of ITNs were collected using structured and pre-tested questionnaires through house-to-house visits. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of participant's malaria knowledge, location and ITN characteristics on the use of ITNs.
   RESULTS A total of 2874 households participated in the study, and 90.6% of the study population was knowledgeable about ITNs. About 49.1% of households reported at least one ITN; 28.4% owned two or more. ITN coverage was significantly lower in Oromia (34.9%) than in Amhara (76.8%, P < 0.001). The average number of ITNs per ITN-owning household was 1.8. In all surveyed households, only 21.8% of all family members, 29.4% of all children under the age of 5 years and 23.2% of all pregnant women had slept under an ITN the night preceding the survey. Among ITN-owning households, 63.0% of all children under the age of 5 years and 52.1% of pregnant women had slept under an ITN the night before the survey. Using multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with ITN use were number of ITNs in the household, number of ITNs hung over the bed in the household, women's knowledge of ITNs and women's lack of problem in using ITNs, whereas region, area of residence and ITN status were not.
   CONCLUSIONS Household ITN ownership and use remain below the current Roll Back Malaria targets of universal coverage. A replacement strategy is urgently needed to scale-up coverage and use of ITNs.

AB A few previous studies have reported that the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a 29.1% to 36.8% frequency of restless legs syndrome (RLS). In this study, we observed RLS symptoms in patients experiencing COPD exacerbation to better understand the relationship between the many clinical parameters of COPD and the presence of RLS and to attract the attention of specialists on the association between the two conditions. Twenty-two male patients in COPD exacerbation; 17 healthy individuals were evaluated in this study. The patients were evaluated using the 2003 RLS symptom criteria outlined by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Groups (IRLSSG). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth daytime sleepiness scale were used to assess the sleep quality of patients. The RLS symptoms were correlated with blood levels of laboratory and clinical parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 statistical software packet. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth daytime sleepiness scale scores were increased in COPD patients and correlated significantly with RLS symptoms. It was found that 54.5% of COPD patients with acute exacerbations were observed to have RLS symptoms. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was significantly higher in COPD patients with RLS symptoms compared to COPD patients without RLS symptoms (p < 0.05). We did not observe any significant difference in the previously reported metabolic and clinical parameters associated with RLS in COPD patients with and without RLS. RLS symptoms increase during COPD exacerbation and lead to decreased sleep quality.

AB Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a group of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or abnormal gas exchange during sleep. The most common type of SDB, especially among young obese women, is obstructive sleep apnea. SOB has clearly been linked to poor sleep and impaired daytime function, but there are also data linking SOB to other health outcomes, principally cardiovascular and metabolic disease. SOB symptoms are common in pregnancy, and pregnancy itself has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of SOB symptoms. Although a link between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be biologically plausible, data exploring this relationship are only now emerging, and large prospective studies in which the authors use objective measures of sleep are lacking. Until we know more about the epidemiology and the impact of SOB in pregnancy, screening efforts for SOB in pregnancy should be focused on identifying very symptomatic patients because treatment of these individuals often leads to improved sleep quality and daytime functioning.

AB Precise measures of phenology are critical to understanding how animals organize their annual cycles and how individuals and populations respond to climate-induced changes in physical and ecological stressors. We show that patterns of core body temperature (T (b)) can be used to precisely determine the timing of key seasonal events including hibernation, mating and parturition, and immergence and emergence from the hibernacula in free-living arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii). Using temperature loggers that recorded T (b) every 20 min for up to 18 months, we monitored core T (b) from three females that subsequently gave birth in captivity and from 66 female and 57 male ground squirrels free-living in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range Alaska. In addition, dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed for four free-living male squirrels. Average T (b) in captive females decreased by 0.5-1.0A degrees C during gestation and abruptly increased by 1-1.5A degrees C on the day of parturition. In free-living females, similar shifts in T (b) were observed in 78% (n = 9) of yearlings and 94% (n = 31) of adults; females without the shift are assumed not to have given birth. Three of four ground squirrels for which dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed did not exhibit obvious diurnal rhythms in T (b) until they first emerged onto the surface when T (b) patterns became diurnal. In free-living males undergoing reproductive maturation, this pre-emergence euthermic interval averaged 20.4 days (n = 56). T (b)-loggers represent a cost-effective and logistically feasible method to precisely investigate the phenology of reproduction and hibernation in ground squirrels.

AB Purpose This study aimed to determine the characteristics of respiratory events in preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea at or beyond 35 weeks postmenstrual age and to compare these findings with a group of preterm infants ready for discharge, without clinically concerning apnoea.
   Methods Infants born at < 32 weeks of gestation and who underwent nap polysomnography at or beyond 35 weeks corrected age prior to discharge were included. Cases were preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea, and control infants were preterm infants asymptomatic for apnoea. Infants with upper airway obstruction, congenital malformations or apnoea associated with sepsis were excluded. Studies were retrospectively reviewed for length, type and frequency of apnoea. The relationship between sleep state and changes in oxygen saturation was compared between groups. Peri-natal and demographic data were also compared.
   Results Data were complete for 16 case and 18 control infants. Gestational age was similar at birth and at time of study, but cases had a lower birth weight (p = 0.04) and higher weight at study (p = 0.04). There were no group differences in the mean duration, type or numbers of apnoea. The duration of the longest apnoea was greater in case infants (17.4 s vs. 12.3 s, p = 0.02). Lowest oxygen saturation (p < 0.05) and average minimum oxygen saturation (p < 0.05) were lower in case infants.
   Conclusions Preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea have similar amounts and types of apnoea but lower oxygen saturation after apnoea compared with controls. The use of oxygen saturation monitoring is more useful than respiratory monitoring alone in recognising these events.

AB Background: The association between placental malaria (PM) and first peripheral parasitaemias in early infancy was assessed in Tori Bossito, a rural area of Benin with a careful attention on transmission factors at an individual level.
   Methodology: Statistical analysis was performed on 550 infants followed weekly from birth to 12 months. Malaria transmission was assessed by anopheles human landing catches every 6 weeks in 36 sampling houses and season defined by rainfall. Each child was located by GPS and assigned to the closest anopheles sampling house. Data were analysed by survival Cox models, stratified on the possession of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) at enrolment.
   Principal Findings: Among infants sleeping in a house with an ITN, PM was found to be highly associated to first malaria infections, after adjusting on season, number of anopheles, antenatal care (ANC) visits and maternal severe anaemia. Infants born from a malaria infected placenta had a 2.13 fold increased risk to present a first malaria infection than those born from a non infected placenta ([1.24-3.67], p<0.01) when sleeping in a house with an ITN. The risk to present a first malaria infection was increased by 3.2 to 6.5, according to the level of anopheles exposure (moderate or high levels, compared to the absence of anopheles).
   Conclusions: First malaria infections in early childhood can be attributed simultaneously to both PM and high levels of exposure to infected anopheles. Protective measures as Intermittent Preventive Treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) and ITNs, targeted on both mothers and infants should be reinforced, as well as the research on new drugs and insecticides. In parallel, investigations on placental malaria have to be strengthened to better understand the mechanisms involved, and thus to protect adequately the infants high risk group.

AB Study Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health priority and the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for PTB.
   Design: Observational
   Measurements and Results: Participants included 166 pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 +/- 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% Cl [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% Cl [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy.
   Conclusions: Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with other established risk factors, such as stress.

AB Gestational lead exposure (GLE) produces supernormal scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) in children, monkeys and rats, and a novel retinal phenotype characterized by an increased number of rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells in adult mice and rats. Since the loss of dopaminergic amacrine cells (DA ACs) in GLE monkeys and rats contributes to supernormal ERGs, the retinal DA system was analyzed in mice following GLE. C57BL/6 female mice were exposed to low (27 ppm), moderate (55 ppm) or high (109 ppm) lead throughout gestation and until postnatal day 10 (PN10). Blood [Pb] in control, low-, moderate- and high-dose GLE was, <= 1, <= 10, similar to 25 and similar to 40 mu g/dL, respectively, on PN10 and by PN30 all were <= 1 mu g/dL. At PN60, confocal-stereology studies used vertical sections and wholemounts to characterize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and the number of DA and other ACs. GLE dose-dependently and selectively decreased the number of TH-immunoreactive (IR) DA ACs and their synaptic plexus without affecting GABAergic, glycinergic or cholinergic ACs. lmmunoblots and confocal revealed dose-dependent decreases in retinal TH protein expression and content, although monoamine oxidase-A protein and gene expression were unchanged. High-pressure liquid chromatography showed that GLE dose-dependently decreased retinal DA content, its metabolites and DA utilization/release. The mechanism of DA selective vulnerability is unknown. However, a GLE-induced loss/dysfunction of DA ACs during development could increase the number of rods and bipolar cells since DA helps regulate neuronal proliferation, whereas during adulthood it could produce ERG supernormality as well as altered circadian rhythms, dark/light adaptation and spatial contrast sensitivity.

AB Study Objective: To determine the mechanical upper airway properties and compensatory neuromuscular responses to obstruction during propofol anesthesia in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.
   Design: Prospective, randomized study.
   Setting: University-affiliated hospital.
   Subjects: 12 premenopausal female volunteers for studies of upper airway collapse throughout their menstrual cycle during the follicular phase (6 -10 days) and mid-late luteal phase (20 - 24 days).
   Measurements: The level of propofol anesthesia (1.5 - 2.0 mu g/mL) required to suppress arousal responses was determined by Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scoring (level 2) and confirmed by bispectral index monitoring. Pressure-flow relationships were constructed to evaluate collapsibility (P(CRIT)) and up-stream resistance (R(US)) during acute [Passive; hypotonic electromyography (EMG)] and sustained (Active; elevated EMG) changes in nasal mask pressure. The difference between passive P(CRIT) and active P(CRIT) (Delta P(CRIT) (A-P)) represented the magnitude of the compensatory response to obstruction.
   Main Results: Passive P(CRIT) was significantly higher in the mid-late luteal phase (-4.7 cm H(2)O) than in the follicular phase (-6.2 cmH(2)O; P < 0.05). Active P(CRIT) significantly decreased compared with passive P(CRIT) in the follicular phase (-10.1 cm H(2)O) and in the mid-late luteal phase (-7.7 cm H(2)O) and (P < 0.05). No significant difference was noted in Delta P(CRIT) between the follicular (3.9 +/- 2.9 cm H(2)O) and mid-late luteal phases (3.0 +/- 2.6 cm H(2)O). No differences were seen in R(US) between the menstrual phases for either the passive (P = 0.8) or active (P = 0.75) states.
   Conclusions: Menstrual phase has an effect on anatomical alterations (mechanical properties) in the hypotonic upper airway during propofol anesthesia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE-To explore relationships among sleep disturbances, glucose tolerance, and pregnancy outcomes.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Four validated sleep questionnaires were administered to 169 pregnant women at the time of 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during the second trimester. Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in 108 women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT).
   RESULTS-Of the participants, 41% had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] >8); 64% had poor sleep quality; 25% snored frequently; 29% had increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); 52% experienced short sleep (SS); 19% had both increased SDB risk and SS (SDB/SS); and 14% had daytime dysfunction. Reported sleep duration inversely correlated with glucose values from 50-g OGTT (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). Each hour of reduced sleep time was associated with a 4% increase in glucose levels. Increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was found in subjects with increased SDB risk (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.2-7.4]), SS (2.4 [1.0-5.9]), SDB/SS (3.4 [1.3-8.7]), and frequent snoring (3.4 [1.3-8.8], after adjustment for BMI). Among NGT subjects, preterm delivery was more frequent in those with increased ESS (P = 0.02), poor sleep quality (P = 0.02), and SS (P = 0.03). Neonatal intensive care unit admissions were associated with increased ESS (P = 0.03), SDB/SS (P = 0.03), and daytime dysfunction (P < 0.01) in mothers.
   CONCLUSIONS-Pregnant women experience significant sleep disturbances that are associated with increased risk of GDM and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women with increased SDB risk, frequent snoring, and sleep duration of <7 h/night have increased risk of developing GDM.

AB Background: Sleep disturbance is a significant health issue in pregnant women. Although previous studies contribute to an understanding of the multifactorial nature of pregnancy-related sleep disturbance, objective measures of sleep were not included, and so data may be subject to recall and potential participant self-report bias.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors associated with poor sleep quality in women during their third trimester of pregnancy.
   Methods: This prospective study included 30 nulliparous women who wore a wrist actigraph to objectively monitor sleep for 7 consecutive days and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
   Results: Fifteen women (50%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score of >5, indicating poor sleep quality. Mean actigraphic sleep efficiency was only 80.05% +/- 6.27%. There were significant differences (p < .01) in sleep offset time and total nocturnal sleep time between weekdays and weekends. Later sleep onset time was associated with poorer sleep, including longer sleep latency, and reduced total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency.
   Discussion: Nulliparous women experience both objective and subjective sleep disturbances, and their sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends during their third trimester of pregnancy. Results suggest that maternal sleep pattern may be improved by maintaining a regular and earlier bedtime so women have more opportunity to obtain sufficient nocturnal sleep and improved sleep quality.

AB Aim: This study's aim was to increase knowledge about maternal and paternal self-rated health and body mass index in relation to lifestyle during early pregnancy. Methods: Study subjects were expectant parents visiting antenatal care (2006-07) as part of the Salut Programme in northern Sweden. During early pregnancy, 468 females and 413 male partners completed questionnaires. The questions addressed sociodemography, self-rated general health, weight and height, satisfaction with weight, and lifestyle, such as dietary habits, physical activity, sleeping pattern, and alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Results: Most rated their general health as good, very good, or excellent, although women less often than men (88% and 93%). The sex difference was more prominent when restricting the comparison to self-rated health being very good or excellent - 49% of the women compared to 61% of the men. Being overweight or obese was common (53% of the men and 30% of the women). Few participants fulfilled the national recommendations with respect to a health-enhancing lifestyle; this was somewhat more common for women than men. Expectant parents with normal body mass index and vigorous physical activity were more likely to have very good or excellent self-rated health. Conclusions: Most expectant parents perceived their general health as good, although this perception was less for women than men. Being overweight and having a non-health-enhancing lifestyle were more common for men than women. Thus, there is need for more powerful health-promoting interventions for expectant parents.

AB Background Varying work schedules are suspected of increasing risks to pregnant women and to fetal wellbeing. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm disruption might impair fetal growth or lead to complications of pregnancy. Two independent meta-analyses (from 2000 to 2007) reported a small adverse effect of shift work on the risk of preterm delivery (PTD). However, these reviews were based on few high-quality studies.
   Objectives To provide an updated review of the associations of shift work with PTD, low birthweight (LBW), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and pre-eclampsia.
   Search strategy and selection criteria We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE using combinations of keywords and MeSH terms.
   Data collection and analysis For each relevant paper we abstracted standard details, used to summarise design features and rate methodological quality. We calculated pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) in random-effect meta-analyses.
   Main results We retrieved 23 relevant studies. The pooled estimate of RR for PTD was 1.16 (95% CI 1.00-1.33, 16 studies), but when five reports of poorer methodological quality were excluded, the estimated RR decreased to 1.03 (95% CI 0.93-1.14). We also observed increased RRs for LBW (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93-1.74) and for SGA (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22), which varied little by study quality. Little evidence was found on pre-eclampsia.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that overall, any risk of PTD, LBW, or SGA arising from shift work in pregnancy is small.

TI Prolonged-release melatonin versus placebo for benzodiazepine
   discontinuation in patients with schizophrenia: a randomized clinical

AB Background: Treatment of schizophrenia frequently includes prolonged benzodiazepine administration despite a lack of evidence of its use. It is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines because of the development of dependence. We aim to assess if melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of prolonged benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life.
   Methods/Design: Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel superiority trial. We plan to include 80 consenting outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 18-55 years of age, treated with antipsychotic drug(s) and at least one benzodiazepine derivative for the last three months before inclusion. Exclusion criteria: currently under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, aggressive or violent behavior, known mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, dementia, epilepsy, terminal illness, severe co morbidity, inability to understand Danish, allergy to melatonin, lactose, starch, gelatin, or talc, hepatic impairment, pregnancy or nursing, or lack of informed consent. After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin(R)) 2 mg daily or matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose. The primary outcome measure is benzodiazepine dose at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include sleep, psychophysiological, and neurocognitive measures. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, adverse events, social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up.
   Discussion: The results from this trial will examine whether melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy of patients compared to the background population. The results will also provide new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine treatment with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients.

AB Background: There is a gap in the knowledge of longterm outcome of mild to moderate prematures compared to the extreme prematures or very low birth weight infants.
   Aim: Determine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in (pre-)school age children born at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation.
   Study design: A descriptive cohort study in a non-Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatment and social economic status (SES) were analyzed. Study tools were the TNO-AZL Preschool Quality of Life (TAPQoL) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Subjects: 362 children born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation who had a follow-up evaluation at 2-5 years of age.
   Outcome measure: Health-related quality of life and the occurrence of emotional and behavioral problems.
   Results: Main characteristics (mean +/- SD) were: gestation 34.7 +/- 1 weeks and birth weight 2360 +/- 444 g. Most families were two-parent middle-class households with parents employed at their educational level. Questionnaire response rate was 62.7%. The 12-item TAPQoL showed significantly lower scores for stomach and liveliness, while scores for behavior, communication and sleep were significantly higher compared to the general population. The TAPQoL subscale score for lung problems was significantly lower for children who had received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CBCL scores were within the validated normal range although the study-population scored higher on emotionally reactive, somatic complaints and attention problems compared to their full-term peers.
   Conclusion: Children born at 32 to 36 weeks' gestational age do not experience an overall lower HR-QoL at 2 to 5 years of age. CPAP results in lower HRQoL scores for lung problems. The overall occurrence of behavioral and emotional problems does not differ from the general term-born pediatric population. Several subitems need further attention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Association Between Maternal Sleep Practices and Risk of Late
   Stillbirth: A Case-Control Study
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Although a large number of studies have examined risk factors for stillbirth, few have explored a wide range of potential risk factors. Although little is known about the potential impact of sleep practices on the developing fetus, some studies have reported that sleeping supine may be associated with sleep-disordered breathing and lower maternal cardiac output in late pregnancy.
   The Auckland Stillbirth Study was a prospective population-based case-control study with the broad aim to identify modifiable risk factors for late stillbirth (>= 28 weeks' gestation). The present study explored the possibility that snoring, sleep position, and other sleep practices in pregnant women were associated with risk of late stillbirth. Participants were 155 singleton women with a late stillbirth (>= 28 weeks' gestation); matched controls were singleton women with ongoing pregnancies at the same gestational age as the stillbirths. Multivariable analysis adjusted for potential confounding factors. The primary study outcome measures were self-reported maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (determined also with the Epworth sleepiness scale), and maternal sleep position both at the time of going to sleep and on waking (classified as left side, right side, back, and other).
   The prevalence of late stillbirth among the cohort was 3.09/1000 births. No association was found between risk of late stillbirth and either maternal snoring or daytime sleepiness. After adjustment for multiple potential confounding factors, the risk of late stillbirth was increased among women who slept on their back or their right side on the previous night compared with those who slept on their left side; the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for back sleeping was 2.54, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.04-6.18, and for right side sleeping was 1.74, with a 95% CI of 0.98-3.01. The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their left side was half of those who did not go to sleep on their left (1.96/1000 vs. 3.93/1000). The risk of a late stillbirth was also lower in women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night compared with those who got up more frequently (aOR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.40-3.71). There was a higher likelihood for late stillbirth among women sleeping regularly during the day in the previous month in comparison with those who did not (aOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.26-3.27).
   These findings suggest that the risk of late stillbirth may be lower in pregnant women who sleep on their left side. This novel association requires confirmation before any recommendations can be made on optimal sleep position in late pregnancy.

AB Objective. - The behaviour of pregnant women live in towards prevention, attitude health workers, access measures prejudices and inadequate in urban design contribute to course the persistence of malaria. Objective analyse the factors leading to occurrence of malaria in women speakers in the health district Bogodogo.
   Patients and methods. - He acts sectional study was place in the rainy season period high malaria transmission. The test rapid diagnosis (TDR) using soluble antigens (HRPII) of Plasmodium falciparum was the diagnostic method used in this work and carried on 810 pregnant women in the health area District Bogodogo in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
   Results The overall prevalence of antigen HRPII P. falciparum was 18.6% with a CI [16.1-21.5] to 95%. It follows from this work that the risk of infection malaria was significantly higher among pregnant women: that were not educated, lived in outlying areas called "zones not off" of the town and villages nearby, who were not using net. For various reasons, the administration of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine was not supervised and less than 50% of women regularly slept under a mosquito net.
   Conclusion. - The fight against malaria in pregnant women should focus on communication for change of behaviour of pregnant women and also of health professionals. The fight antivector must be considered in rural areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: to explore the strategies used by Jordanian women to manage heartburn during pregnancy.
   Design: an exploratory descriptive study.
   Participants and setting: 235 Jordanian women from the three regions of Jordan, aged between 18 and 54 years, who were pregnant at the time of the study or had previously had at least one full-term pregnancy.
   Findings: a number of strategies were used by Jordanian women in the sample for the alleviation of heartburn of pregnancy, including non-pharmacological strategies such as diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatments such as antacids, and the use of home remedies such as drinking cold milk, 'baking powder' in liquid form or herbs, eating cucumber, lintel seeds, or dry tea leaves. Women aged 40 years and older, who had lower income, and were not employed were more likely to use home remedies to manage heartburn in pregnancy than the other groups. Overall, women rated their chosen strategy as useful.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: heartburn can be very uncomfortable and can affect food intake and appetite, daily routine and even sleep. Heartburn during pregnancy is at risk for being poorly managed given that birth is the cure. As a health-care provider, it is important to prepare women and their families to manage heartburn during pregnancy effectively. Midwives should encourage women to seek help from care providers when they need it, and continue to assess heartburn and the strategies used to manage symptoms during pregnancy.

AB Background: The objectives of the present study were to explore whether maternal psychosocial factors, mental health and work stress around delivery, are related to the behavior of 2-year-old children.
   Methods: In a prospective cohort study design, pregnant women attending the National Taiwan University Hospital for delivery and post-partum care from April 2004 to January 2005 were recruited and their children were observed at 24 months. A total of 186 mother-term-born child dyads completed the measurement. The five-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5) self-report data of maternal psychosocial factors were selected from the Taiwanese version of the short form 36 (SF-36). The Child Behavior Checklist for age 11/2-5 (CBCL/11/2-5) was completed by the parents when the child was 2 years old.
   Results: The mean score of mental health around delivery was 68.11. The proportion of mothers with work stress seldom and always was 61.8% and 24.7%, respectively. The mean of the total CBCL score, and internalizing, externalizing behavior and sleep problems scores was 45.95, 11.89, 15.59 and 4.23, respectively. After adjusting for the potential confounders, maternal work stress around delivery was found to have a significant effect on the total CBCL and externalizing, attention and aggressive, behavioral problems of 2-year old children. Maternal mental health around delivery, however, did not show significant effects on child behavior.
   Conclusions: Work stress around delivery seems to aggravate children's externalizing behavior problems at 2 years old. It is therefore important to improve the psychosocial health and reduce the stress of pregnant women.

We recorded 24 h/day TLA in five not pregnant Holstein Friesian cows during parts of the lactation and dry periods, by means of an activity monitoring system (Actiwatch mini (R)) for seven days in each period. During mild lactation (period 1) animals were milked and fed twice a day. During the dry (period 2) they were kept to graze all day. In both periods hay and water were available ad libitum. Differences between the photophase and the scotophase were evaluated with a Student t-test. One-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine a statistical significant effect of time. A trigonometric statistical model was used to describe the main rhythmic parameters: mean level, amplitude, acrophase and robustness of rhythm.
   Our results showed a circadian rhythm of daily TLA in both periods, with different percentages of robustness, and acrophase in the middle of the photophase. The different patterns of activity in the two periods were attributed to the management practise during milking period. These results could be taken in consideration during farming management for the evaluation of such systems used in livestock, with respect to production and welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties).
   Method: 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries.
   Results: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less.
   Limitations: An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints.
   Conclusion: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population.

AB The aim of this study was to discriminate the impact of lighting and feeding conditions on the regulation of lipid metabolism in Ovis aries. Six clinically healthy female Comisana ewes, not pregnant and not lactating were kept under different environmental conditions: 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle, constant darkness and fasting. Blood samples were collected at the end of each period of treatment every 4 h for a 24-h period. Blood concentration of triglycerides, total cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acid showed robust daily rhythmicity in ewes maintained under 12:12 LD cycle and fed ad libitum. Conversely, either constant darkness or fasting had a deep impact on all lipid parameters investigated. Our results suggest that lighting and feeding conditions have an impact on daily variations in lipid metabolism in ewes.

   DISORDERS; POPULATION; THERAPY; COHORT; APNEA
AB The timing and continuity of sleep in healthy individuals is regulated by the synchronous function of the sleep homeostasis and the endogenous circadian rhythms. Multiple factors affect these two processes and the way they interact. Sleep disorders may manifest differently in men and women and these differences are particularly notable during pregnancy, lactation, and menopause. Insomnia may occur relatively commonly during pregnancy and in the postpartum, and may be the result of either a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), movement disorders such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), or sometimes depression, especially in the postpartum period. Obstructive sleep apnea may contribute to a higher risk of hypertension during pregnancy and doubles the risk for preeclampsia and preterm birth. Snoring, a frequent symptom of OSA, increases in frequency during pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome is more common in pregnant women, is more frequent in the third trimester of pregnancy, and tends to improve dramatically after delivery. Factors associated with increased RLS in pregnancy may be related to iron and folate metabolism. Risk for OSA increases after menopause and presentation with insomnia can delay the diagnosis of OSA. Various treatment options for sleep disorders in women are discussed.

AB Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy and are currently regarded as one of the most important factors determining pregnancy outcome. Detailed research of sleep features during pregnancy is obviously essential. In the present review recent data concerning changes in sleep structure and regulation in pregnant women and rats - main subjects of experimental sleep research, are given, including sur-mised mechanisms underlying such changes. The importance of women's sleep integrity preservation during pregnancy for the viability and normal development of the fetus is emphasized and possible ways of pathological influence of sleep disorders during this period are discussed.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition contributing to oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to ascertain if there is any connection between OSA and novel oxidative stress-related markers. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), soluble receptors for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were measured. Further biochemical markers were evaluated.
   Material/Methods: Fifty-one men suspected for OSA indicated for night polygraphy were included. Apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), mean blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) and time of blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation below 90% (SpO2 <90%) were measured. Morning venous blood samples were taken.
   Results: For body mass index (BMI) we found strong positive correlation with levels of Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fibrinogen, and negative correlation with sRAGE. Concerning ventilation parameters, we found positive correlation of ODI and SpO2 <90% with markers MMP-9 and hsCRP. sRAGE level correlated with AHI and ODI negatively. SpO2 correlated negatively with Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fibrinogen. There was no correlation between ventilation parameters and markers MMP-2, PAPP-A and Zn. Compared to severity of OSA, there was significant difference in levels of hsCRP and Cu between patients with AHI <5 and AHI >30 independent of BMI.
   Conclusions: MMP-9, hsCRP, sRAGE and Cu seem to be strong predictors of oxidative stress in OSA patients. The strong correlation between oxidative stress-related markers and OSA is elucidated by connection of these to BMI, which is probably a primary condition of oxidative stress, but OSA is an additive condition.

AB The primary purpose of this study was to examine pathways from prenatal cigarette exposure to physiological regulation at 2 months of age. Specifically, we explored the possibility that any association between prenatal cigarette exposure and infant physiological regulation was moderated by fetal growth, prenatal or postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. We evaluated whether exposed infants who were also exposed to ETS after birth, were small for gestational age (SGA) or had mothers with higher depressive symptoms during pregnancy had the highest levels of physiological dysregulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was obtained from 234 (166 exposed and 68 nonexposed) infants during sleep. As expected, cigarette-exposed infants had significantly lower RSA than nonexposed infants. This association was not moderated by prenatal or postnatal ETS exposure, or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. However, small for gestational age status did moderate this association such that nonexposed infants who were not small for gestational age had a significantly higher RSA than nonexposed small for gestational age infants and exposed infants. These findings provide additional evidence that prenatal cigarette exposure is directly associated with dysregulation during infancy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Low physical activity (PA) during the postpartum period is associated with weight retention. While patterns of PA have been examined in normal weight women during this period, little is known about PA among overweight and obese women. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate PA and determine the proportion of women meeting recommendations for PA. Methods: Women (n = 491), with a body mass index (BMI) >= 25 kg/m(2) were enrolled in a behavioral intervention. PA was assessed at six weeks postpartum using the Seven-Day PA Recall. Results: Women averaged 923 +/- 100 minutes/day of sedentary/light and 33 +/- 56 minutes/day of combined moderate, hard, and very hard daily activity. Women with a BMI >= 40 kg/m(2) reported more time in sedentary/light activities and less hours of sleep than those with a lower BMI. Only 34% met national PA guidelines; this proportion was significantly lower among blacks (OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.9). Conclusions: These overweight and obese postpartum women reported a large percentage of time spent in sedentary/light activity, and a high proportion failed to meet minimal guidelines for PA. Promotion of PA in the postpartum period should focus on reducing sedentary behaviors and increasing moderate PA.
