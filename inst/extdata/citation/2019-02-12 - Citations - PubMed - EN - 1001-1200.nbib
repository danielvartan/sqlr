AB  - AIMS: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with placenta-mediated adverse 
      clinical outcomes. We aimed at comparing placenta-secreted proteins, such as
      first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers which have been linked
      to preeclampsia, and markers of angiogenesis in pregnant women with OSA, and
      pregnant controls at low risk for OSA. METHODS: A case-control study of pregnant 
      women with OSA and controls at low risk for OSA was performed. Levels of first
      and second trimester markers were reported as multiple of median (MoM), and
      adjusted for body mass index (BMI). Stored samples were tested for markers of
      angiogenesis and adjusted for gestational age, BMI, and chronic hypertension.
      RESULTS: A total of 24 women with OSA and 166 controls had screening markers. BMI
      was higher in cases compared to controls, P=0.01. MoM levels of placenta
      associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) were significantly lower in cases versus
      controls, even after adjusting for BMI (0.52 IQR 0.48 vs. 1.01 IQR 0.63,
      P=0.009). The ratio of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 to
      placental growth factor was significantly higher in cases than controls, even
      after adjusting for confounders (4.42 IQR 2.52 vs. 2.93 IQR 2.01, P=0.009).
      CONCLUSION: Circulating placenta-secreted glycoproteins and markers of
      angiogenesis are altered in pregnant women with OSA.

TI  - Survey of trend and factors in perinatal maternal fatigue.
PG  - 64-70
LID - 10.1111/nhs.12149 [doi]
AB  - Few studies have investigated maternal fatigue, particularly fatigue throughout
      the duration of pregnancy and the postpartum period. The purpose of this study
      was to explore changes related to maternal fatigue from pregnancy to postpartum
      and the factors influencing fatigue. This prospective longitudinal study surveyed
      197 pregnant women beyond 24 gestational weeks monthly until one month
      postpartum. The Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale and one question
      about fatigue were used. Women at late pregnancy experienced a significant
      increase in level of fatigue, which remained high after childbirth. Those who
      were not happy about the pregnancy or were multiparas experienced a higher level 
      of prenatal fatigue than their counterparts. At postpartum, mothers who were
      unemployed, had no one to help with childcare, or felt that the baby's night-time
      sleep pattern was a serious problem had a higher level of fatigue. Interventions 
      can be planned and implemented at early pregnancy to reduce the prevalence of
      fatigue. Encouraging pregnant women to share experiences and thoughts about
      pregnancy and being a mother is suggested. Further studies that evaluate
      culturally sensitive instruments for fatigue are needed.

TI  - Pruritus of Cholestasis
BTI - Itch: Mechanisms and Treatment
CP  - Chapter 6
AB  - Cholestasis is defined as impaired secretion of bile.(1) Pruritus is a
      complication of cholestasis including that associated with mutations in genes
      that code for transporters in the hepatocyte(2,3) and from inflammatory liver
      diseases.(4,5) In this regard, pruritus is more common in conditions
      characterized by bile duct inflammatory destruction and ductopenia including
      primary bile cirrhosis primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)(5) than in those
      characterized by hepatocellular injury such as chronic viral hepatitis.(4) The
      pruritus of cholestasis tends to be generalized. It leads to scratching,
      sometimes violent, resulting in excoriations and prurigo nodularis. This type of 
      pruritus can lead to sleep deprivation, and in some patients, to suicidal
      ideations. Intractable pruritus from liver disease is an indication for liver
      transplantation even in the absence of liver failure.(6,7) Accordingly, pruritus 
      is a complication of liver disease that requires specific management and intense 
      research in an effort to design effective antipruritic medications. Women with
      cholestasis of pregnancy can experience severe pruritus especially in the third
      trimester.(8) The pruritus from cholestasis of pregnancy resolves itself after
      delivery; if it does not, investigations to rule out liver disease are indicated.
      In patients with PBC the pruritus has not been consistently reported to correlate
      with biological markers of disease.(9) Also, in PBC the presence of intrahepatic 
      florid bile duct lesions and granulomata were significantly related to the
      severity of pruritus (and fatigue), which was assessed subjectively, on the day
      of the biopsy.(10) This observation is interesting because, although it is
      difficult to infer the degree of cholestasis from a liver biopsy, as there is
      sampling error, the fact that patients with stage I PBC can experience severe
      pruritus may suggest an important release of pruritogens in association with
      active inflammatory destruction of biliary epithelial cells, which characterizes 
      this stage. The pruritus can persist and remit throughout the course of the
      disease, and as the disease progresses to liver failure, the pruritus tends to
      cease,(11) as if a certain degree of liver function were necessary for
      pruritogen(s) or its cofactors to be produced or for the sensation to be
      perceived. In relation with PBC, it was also reported that presentation of the
      disease at less than 50 years of age correlated with an increased likelihood of
      reporting symptoms (and not responding to ursodeoxycholic acid, the drug approved
      for the treatment of this disease).(12)

TI  - SCN1A-Related Seizure Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: SCN1A-related seizure disorders encompass a spectrum
      that ranges from simple febrile seizures (FS) and generalized epilepsy with
      febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable 
      childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (ICE-GTC) at the severe
      end. Phenotypes with intractable seizures including Dravet syndrome (also known
      as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy [SMEI] or polymorphic myoclonic epilepsy 
      in infancy [PMEI]) are usually associated with progressive dementia. Less
      commonly observed phenotypes include myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE or Doose
      syndrome), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), infantile spasms, and vaccine-related
      encephalopathy and seizures. The phenotype of SCN1A-related seizure disorders can
      vary even within the same family. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of
      SCN1A-related seizure disorders relies on detection of a heterozygous pathogenic 
      variant in SCN1A. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Antiepileptic drugs
      (AEDs) include benzodiazepines (diazepam and clonazepam), stiripentol (used in
      Europe; not currently FDA approved for use in the US), topiramate, and valproic
      acid. Clobazam can be used for the treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaus
      syndrome. Phenobarbital is effective but poorly tolerated because of its effects 
      on cognition. Use of the ketogenic diet to decrease seizure frequency has been
      beneficial in some affected individuals. Prevention of secondary complications:
      Use of protective helmets by individuals with atonic seizures or
      myoclonic-astatic epilepsy. Surveillance: Serial neuropsychological evaluation
      for neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral deterioration; EEG monitoring for new
      or different seizure types. Agents/circumstances to avoid: AEDs: carbamazepine,
      lamotrigine, and vigabatrin, which can induce or increase myoclonic seizures;
      phenytoin, which can induce choreoathetosis. Activities in which a sudden loss of
      consciousness could lead to injury or death (e.g., bathing, swimming, driving, or
      working/playing at heights). Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should receive 
      counseling regarding the risks and benefits of the use of antiepileptic drugs
      during pregnancy; the advantages and disadvantages of increasing maternal
      periconceptional folic acid supplementation to 4000 microg daily; the effects of 
      pregnancy on anticonvulsant metabolism; and the effect of pregnancy on maternal
      seizure control. Other: The AEDs clobazam and stiripentol, used in treatment of
      SMEI, are not FDA-approved for this use in the US. Sleep deprivation and illness 
      can exacerbate seizures. Persons with epilepsy should be made aware of motor
      vehicle driving laws. GENETIC COUNSELING: SCN1A-related seizure disorders are
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A proband with an SCN1A-related
      seizure disorder may have an inherited or de novo pathogenic variant. The
      proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants varies by phenotype:
      the percentage of probands with an SCN1A-related seizure disorder and an affected
      parent decreases as the severity of the phenotype in the proband increases; thus,
      most SCN1A-related SMEI and ICE-GTC are the result of de novo mutation. Each
      child of an individual with an SCN1A-related seizure disorder has a 50% chance of
      inheriting the pathogenic variant; however, the risk of developing seizures is
      less than 100% because of reduced penetrance. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies 
      at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

TI  - Seizures in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: evaluation of clinical,
      electroencephalographic, and neuroradiologic features in a pediatric case series.
PG  - e60-6
LID - 10.1111/epi.12638 [doi]
AB  - Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and
      electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13
      patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from 
      the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children
      were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both
      generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal
      epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during
      sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular
      heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in
      almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11
      cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up 
      are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions
      requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological
      evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be
      associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. A PowerPoint slide
      summarizing this article is available for download in the Supporting Information 
      section here.

      brain activity of preterm infants.
PG  - 922-7
LID - 10.1111/apa.12681 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to measure the brain activity of preterm infants
      treated with caffeine citrate and doxapram for preterm apnoea, using
      amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), to identify any adverse
      effects on cerebral function. METHODS: We analysed the aEEG tracings of 13
      preterm infants <30 weeks of gestation before, during and after doxapram
      treatment, with regard to background activity (percentages of continuous and
      discontinuous patterns), occurrence of sleep-wake cycling and appearance of
      electrographic seizure activity. They were also compared with 61 controls without
      doxapram treatment. RESULTS: During doxapram treatment, aEEG tracings showed an
      increase in continuous background activity (19 +/- 30% before treatment, 38 +/-
      35% during treatment) and a decrease in discontinuous patterns. In addition, they
      showed more frequent electrographic seizure activity (0% before treatment, 15 +/-
      37% during treatment) and less frequent sleep-wake cycling (92 +/- 27% before
      treatment, 85 +/- 37% during treatment) could be observed. These results were
      confirmed when compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Doxapram treatment
      influences aEEG in preterm infants, showing higher percentages of continuous
      activity as well as more electrographic seizure activity and less sleep-wake
      cycling. It should, therefore, be used with caution in very preterm infants.

      adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring, most likely through epigenetic
      modifications. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) expression inversely correlates with obesity 
      and insulin resistance. The effects of SF during late gestation on metabolic
      function and AdipoQ expression in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of
      offspring mice are unknown. Male offspring mice were assessed at 24 weeks after
      dams were exposed to SF or control sleep during late gestation. Increased food
      intake, body weight, VWAT mass, and insulin resistance, with reductions in AdipoQ
      expression in VWAT, emerged in SF offspring. Increased DNMT3a and -b and global
      DNA methylation and reduced histone acetyltransferase activity and TET1, -2, and 
      -3 expression were detected in VWAT of SF offspring. Reductions in
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine and H3K4m3 and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine and
      H3K9m2 in the promoter and enhancer regions of AdipoQ emerged in adipocytes from 
      VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression. SF during late gestation induces
      epigenetic modifications in AdipoQ in male offspring mouse VWAT adipocytes along 
      with a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype. Thus, altered gestational environments 
      elicited by SF impose the emergence of adverse, long-lasting metabolic
      consequences in the next generation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This narrative review describes the differential diagnosis of restless
      legs syndrome, and provides an overview of the evidence for the associations
      between RLS and potential comorbidities. Secondary causes of RLS and the
      characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management
      strategies for RLS are summarized. METHODS: The review began with a comprehensive
      PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination
      with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,
      cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal
      disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver
      disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy,
      obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric
      disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers
      were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications.
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be
      straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with
      comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and
      anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly
      important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may
      exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may
      benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease
      burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of
      RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the
      disorder.

TI  - New insights into septo-optic dysplasia.
PG  - 123-7
AB  - Septo-Optic Dysplasia (SOD) is a rare disorder with postulated genetic and
      environmental etiology. Whilst initially considered as a very rare disease
      (defined as incidence of approx. 1 in 50,000 births) recent data gave a reported 
      incidence of 1 in 10,000, with equal sex distribution. The diagnosis of SOD is
      predominantly a clinical one, and made with the presence of two or more features 
      of the classic triad: 1) hypopituitarism, 2) optic nerve hypoplasia, and 3)
      midline brain defects, typically absence or hypoplasia of the septum pellucidum
      and/or corpus callosum. Hypopituitarism ranges from isolated to multiple hormone 
      deficits, with diabetes insipidus in a minority. The condition is heterogeneous
      and may also manifest additional brain defects. Although homozygous mutations in 
      the homeobox gene HESX1 have been identified in SOD, these are uncommon and
      genetic diagnosis can be made in only <1% of patients with autosomal recessive
      inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported. SOX2, SOX3
      and OTX2 mutations have also been identified in some forms of SOD. The aetiology 
      of SOD is uncertain but viral infections, environmental teratogens and vascular
      or degenerative damage have been postulated to account for its sporadic
      occurrence. Other factors (endogenous or exogenous) include parental age, parity,
      smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, antenatal bleeding, and ethnicity. Cocaine 
      abuse during pregnancy, which is a potent vasoconstrictor has recently been
      identified as a potential external cause. The phenotype of SOD is highly
      variable; the clinical picture may include visual impairment, short stature,
      obesity and sleep-wake inversion. Approximately 75-80% of patients exhibit optic 
      nerve hypoplasia, which may be the first presenting feature. Pituitary
      insufficiency may evolve over time, and children with possible SOD must be kept
      under careful endocrine follow-up. Untreated hormonal abnormalities will further 
      jeopardize neurodevelopment of children with SOD and could also lead to
      life-threatening adrenal crises. The attention should be focussed on early
      diagnosis and treatment and education of paediatricians how to recognize this
      complex disorder.

TI  - Pregnancy-induced changes in ultradian rhythms persist in circadian arrhythmic
      Siberian hamsters.

AB  - The impact of pregnancy and lactation on ultradian rhythms (URs) and circadian
      rhythms (CRs) of locomotor activity was assessed in circadian rhythmic and
      arrhythmic Siberian hamsters maintained in a long-day photoperiod (16h
      light/day). Progressive decrements in CR robustness and amplitude over the course
      of gestation were accompanied by enhanced URs. Dark-phase UR period and amplitude
      increased during early gestation and complexity and robustness increased during
      late gestation. The persistence of pregnancy-associated enhancements of URs in
      circadian arrhythmic (ARR) hamsters suggests that reproductive modulation of the 
      UR waveform is not dependent on coherent circadian organization. The increased
      incidence of dark-phase URs appeared more rapidly in ARR dams than entrained
      (ENTR) dams. Throughout gestation, the percentage of dams with dark-phase URs was
      significantly greater in the ARR group. Gestational increases in UR complexity
      and robustness emerged earlier and were greater in ARR than ENTR dams. The
      attenuation of CRs during lactation is correlated with increased expression of
      URs. Relaxation of circadian control of the dam's behavior may increase fitness
      by permitting more efficient interactions with circadian arrhythmic pups.

TI  - Antenatal depression: an artefact of sleep disturbance?
PG  - 291-302
LID - 10.1007/s00737-014-0427-6 [doi]
AB  - Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede
      depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either
      condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and
      depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also
      asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep
      quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores
      of probable depression (X (2) 13.39; p < 0.001). Berlin-assessed risk of SDB was 
      also associated with probable depression (X (2) 9.20 p < 0.01), though this was
      attenuated following multivariate analysis. There was a significant relationship 
      between total PSQI score and the tendency for participants to attribute
      'sleep-related causes' to their low mood (X (2) 20.78; p < 0.001). This study
      confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive
      symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or
      overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable
      depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for
      other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI).

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea and severe maternal-infant morbidity/mortality in the
      United States, 1998-2009.
PG  - 843-9
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3644 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity
      and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study
      is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in
      pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related
      morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. DESIGN: A retrospective,
      cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: A nationally representative sample of maternal
      hospital discharges from 1998-2009. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: The analytic sample
      included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges.
      INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample
      (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or
      gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital
      mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
      Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome
      measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate
      adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations 
      between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000;
      however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an 
      average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential
      confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related
      morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9), eclampsia (OR,
      5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5-10.9), and pulmonary 
      embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than
      fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4-11.5). The adverse 
      effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. CONCLUSIONS:
      Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity,
      cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may
      improve pregnancy outcomes in this group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The majority of women develop sleep impairments during pregnancy, but 
      alterations in dream experiences remain poorly understood. This study aimed to
      assess prospectively and comparatively the recall of dreaming and of disturbed
      dreaming in late pregnancy. METHODS: Fifty-seven nulliparous, third-trimester
      pregnant women (mean age+/-SD, 28.7+/-4.06 years) and 59 non-pregnant controls
      (mean age+/-SD, 26.8+/-4.21 years) completed demographics and psychological
      questionnaires. A 14-day prospective home log assessed sleep and dream
      characteristics and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire measured retrospective
      dream and disturbed dream recall. RESULTS: Even though pregnant and non-pregnant 
      women showed similar prospective dream recall (P=0.47), pregnant women reported
      prospectively more bad dreams (P=0.004). More pregnant women (21%) than
      non-pregnant women (7%) reported a nightmare incidence exceeding moderately
      severe pathology (>1/week) (P=0.03). Pregnant women also reported overall lower
      sleep quality (P=0.007) and more night awakenings (P=0.003). Higher prospective
      recall of bad dreams (r = -0.40, P=0.002) and nightmares (r = -0.32, P=0.001)
      both correlated with lower sleep quality in pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Late
      pregnancy is a period of markedly increased dysphoric dream imagery that may be a
      major contributor to impaired sleep at this time. Further polysomnographic
      assessments of pregnant women are needed to clarify relationships between sleep
      and disturbed dream production in this population.

TI  - The Effect of Mass Media Campaign on the Use of Insecticide-Treated Bed Nets
      among Pregnant Women in Nigeria.

LID - 10.1155/2014/694863 [doi]
AB  - Background. Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health problem in Nigeria 
      especially in malaria-endemic areas. It increases the risk of low birth weight
      and child/maternal morbidity/mortality. This paper addresses the impact of radio 
      campaigns on the use of insecticide-treated bed nets among pregnant women in
      Nigeria. Methods. A total of 2,348 pregnant women were interviewed during the
      survey across 21 of Nigeria's 36 states. Respondents were selected through a
      multistage sampling technique. Analysis was based on multivariate logistic
      regression. Results. Respondents who knew that sleeping under ITN prevents
      malaria were 3.2 times more likely to sleep under net (OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 2.28 to 
      4.33; P < 0.0001). Those who listened to radio are also about 1.6 times more
      likely to use ITN (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.28; P = 0.020), while respondents 
      who had heard of a specific sponsored radio campaign on ITN are 1.53 times more
      likely to use a bed net (P = 0.019). Conclusion. Pregnant women who listened to
      mass media campaigns were more likely to adopt strategies to protect themselves
      from malaria. Therefore, behavior change communication messages that are aimed at
      promoting net use and antenatal attendance are necessary in combating malaria.

TI  - A critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy.
PG  - 186-8
AB  - Hypocretin/orexin peptides are known for their role in the control of the
      wake-sleep cycle and narcolepsy-cataplexy pathophysiology. Recent studies
      suggested that hypocretin peptides also have a role in pregnancy. We tested this 
      hypothesis by conducting a retrospective analysis on pregnancy complications in
      two different mouse models of hypocretin deficiency. We recorded 85 pregnancies
      of mice lacking either hypocretin peptides (knockout) or hypocretin-releasing
      neurons (transgenic) and their wild-type controls. Pregnancy was associated with 
      unexplained dam death before delivery in 3/15 pregnancies in knockout mice, and
      in 3/23 pregnancies in transgenic mice. No casualties occurred in wild-type
      pregnant dams (P < 0.007 versus hypocretin-deficient mice as a whole). Hypocretin
      deficiency did not impact either on litter size or the number of weaned pups per 
      litter. These data provide preliminary evidence of a critical role of hypocretin 
      deficiency in pregnancy.

AB  - Although sleep complaints are very common among pregnant women, the potential
      adverse effects of sleep disturbance on the offspring are not well studied.
      Growing evidence suggests that maternal stress can induce an inflammatory
      environment on the fetal development. But people are not sure about the
      consequences of prenatal stress such as the inflammatory responses induced by
      maternal sleep deprivation (MSD). In the present study, we investigated the
      effects of MSD on long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences in offspring
      and its underlying inflammatory response pathway. The pregnant Wistar rats
      received prolonged sleep deprivation (72h) on gestational day (GD) 4, 9, and 18, 
      respectively. The post-natal day (PND) 21 offspring showed impaired
      hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze task
      and anhedonia in sucrose preference experiment. Quantification of BrdU(+) and
      DCX(+) cells revealed a significant decrease in hippocampus neurogenesis in
      prepuberty offspring, especially for the late MSD (GD 18) group. Real-time RT-PCR
      showed that after MSD, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta,
      IL-6 and TNFalpha) increased in the hippocampus of offspring on PND 1, 7, 14 and 
      21, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 reduced at the same time.
      Immunofluorescence found that the cells of activated microglia were higher in the
      brains of MSD offspring. Taken together, these results suggested that the
      MSD-induced inflammatory response is an important factor for neurogenesis
      impairment and neurobehavioral outcomes in prepuberty offspring.

TI  - Creatine supplementation during pregnancy: summary of experimental studies
      suggesting a treatment to improve fetal and neonatal morbidity and reduce
      mortality in high-risk human pregnancy.
PG  - 150
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-14-150 [doi]
AB  - While the use of creatine in human pregnancy is yet to be fully evaluated, its
      long-term use in healthy adults appears to be safe, and its well documented
      neuroprotective properties have recently been extended by demonstrations that
      creatine improves cognitive function in normal and elderly people, and motor
      skills in sleep-deprived subjects. Creatine has many actions likely to benefit
      the fetus and newborn, because pregnancy is a state of heightened metabolic
      activity, and the placenta is a key source of free radicals of oxygen and
      nitrogen. The multiple benefits of supplementary creatine arise from the fact
      that the creatine-phosphocreatine [PCr] system has physiologically important
      roles that include maintenance of intracellular ATP and acid-base balance,
      post-ischaemic recovery of protein synthesis, cerebral vasodilation, antioxidant 
      actions, and stabilisation of lipid membranes. In the brain, creatine not only
      reduces lipid peroxidation and improves cerebral perfusion, its interaction with 
      the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor is likely to counteract the effects
      of glutamate excitotoxicity - actions that may protect the preterm and term fetal
      brain from the effects of birth hypoxia. In this review we discuss the
      development of creatine synthesis during fetal life, the transfer of creatine
      from mother to fetus, and propose that creatine supplementation during pregnancy 
      may have benefits for the fetus and neonate whenever oxidative stress or
      feto-placental hypoxia arise, as in cases of fetal growth restriction, premature 
      birth, or when parturition is delayed or complicated by oxygen deprivation of the
      newborn.

AB  - Circadian clocks regulate homeostasis and mediate responses to stressors.
      Lactation is one of the most energetically demanding periods of an adult female's
      life. Peripartum changes occur in almost every organ so the dam can support
      neonatal growth through milk production while homeostasis is maintained. How
      circadian clocks are involved in adaptation to lactation is currently unknown.
      The abundance and temporal pattern of core clock genes' expression were measured 
      in suprachiasmatic nucleus, liver, and mammary from late pregnant and early
      lactation mice. Tissue-specific changes in molecular clocks occurred between
      physiological states. Amplitude and robustness of rhythms increased in
      suprachiasmatic nucleus and liver. Mammary rhythms of core molecular clock genes 
      were suppressed. Attenuated rhythms appeared to be a physiological adaptation of 
      mammary to lactation, because manipulation of timing of suckling resulting in
      significant differences in plasma prolactin and corticosterone had no effect on
      amplitude. Analysis of core clock proteins revealed that the stoichiometric
      relationship between positive (CLOCK) and negative (PER2) components remained 1:1
      in liver but was increased to 4:1 in mammary during physiological transition.
      Induction of differentiation of mammary epithelial cell line HC11 with
      dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin resulted in similar stoichiometric changes 
      among positive and negative clock regulators, and prolactin induced phase shifts 
      in HC11 Arntl expression rhythm. Data support that distinct mechanisms drive
      periparturient changes in mammary clock. Stoichiometric change in clock
      regulators occurs with gland differentiation. Suppression of mammary clock gene
      expression rhythms represents a physiological adaptation to suckling cues.
      Adaptations in mammary clock are likely needed in part to support suckling
      demands of neonates.

AB  - This study examines the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, sleep
      quality and unplanned Caesarean delivery. For this research, we adopted a
      prospective survey design and a sample of 200 women in the early stages of
      labour. The findings were as follows: (i) 11.5% of the participants underwent
      unplanned Caesarean sections; (ii) based on a Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index split
      point of 5, approximately 90.5% of the participants experienced poor sleep
      quality; and (iii) the odds ratio for primiparas undergoing an unplanned
      Caesarean section was 4.183 times that for multiparas (95% confidence interval
      (CI) = 1.177 to 14.864), indicating a statistically significant difference. The
      results also showed that stress was a significant factor related to unplanned
      Caesarean sections; a 1-point increase on the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale was
      associated with a 1.033-fold higher probability of undergoing an unplanned
      Caesarean section (95% CI = 1.002 to 1.065). Furthermore, prenatal stress was a
      significant variable that can be used to predict unplanned Caesarean deliveries.

TI  - Maternal sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion during pregnancy is
      associated with placental abruption.
PG  - 350-5
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2014.916682 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disorders are associated with cardiovascular complications and
      preterm delivery (PTD). Insufficient sleep results in metabolic alterations and
      increased inflammation, both known to contribute to placental abruption
      (abruption), a determinant of PTD. We examined associations of abruption with
      sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion. METHODS: The study included
      164 abruption cases and 160 controls in a multicenter study in Peru. Data on
      habitual sleep duration and vital exhaustion during the first 6 months of
      pregnancy were elicited during interviews conducted following delivery. Women
      were categorized according to short, normal and long sleep duration (</=6, 7-8
      and >/=9 h); and frequency of feeling exhausted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Short and long sleep
      durations were associated with increased odds of abruption. The ORs of abruption 
      in relation to short (</=6 h) and long (>/=9 h) sleep duration were 2.0 (95% CI
      1.1-3.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-4.1), compared with normal sleep duration (7-8 h).
      Complaints of vital exhaustion were also associated with abruption (OR = 2.37;
      95% CI 1.46-3.85), and were independent of sleep duration. CONCLUSION: We extend 
      the existing literature and support the thesis that maternal sleep habits and
      disorders should be assessed among pregnant women.

PG  - 391-6
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3612 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to evaluate the hypothesis that the
      extremely obese manifest sleep disordered breathing with a preponderance of
      hypopneas and relative paucity of obstructive apneas. METHODS: Retrospective
      review of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS)
      matched for age and gender, comparing two groups, Group A: body mass index (BMI) 
      < 35, Group B: BMI >/= 45. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: age < 18 years, pregnancy, >/= 5
      central apneas/hour, BMI >/= 35 < 45. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Hypopnea/apnea
      ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI),
      obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index (HI), oxygen saturation
      (SpO2) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), and presence of
      obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). STATISTICAL METHODS: t-test for
      independent samples; Mann-Whitney, linear regression with natural log
      transformation, and Kruskal-Wallis chi(2). Descriptive statistics were expressed 
      as interquartile range, median and mean +/- standard deviation, p < 0.05
      considered significant. RESULTS: Group A (n = 45): age = 50.6 +/- 11.5 years, BMI
      = 28.9 +/- 4 kg/m(2); Group B (n = 45): age = 47.4 +/- 12.7 years, BMI = 54.5 +/-
      8 kg/m(2). HAR was significantly higher in Group B (38.8 +/- 50.7) than Group A
      (10.6 +/- 16.5), p = 0.0006, as was HI (28.7 +/- 28.6 in B vs 12.6 +/- 8.4 in A, 
      p = 0.0005) and AHI (35.5 +/- 33.8 vs 22 +/- 23, p = 0.03), but not apnea index. 
      HAR was significantly higher in Group B regardless of race, gender, or presence
      of OHS. The BMI was the only significant predictor of HAR (adjusted r(2) = 0.138;
      p = 0.002) in a linear regression model with natural log transformation of the
      HAR performed for age, gender, race, BMI, and PetCO2. CONCLUSION: Extremely obese
      patients manifest OSAHS with a preponderance of hypopneas.

TI  - Can insomnia in pregnancy predict postpartum depression? A longitudinal,
      population-based study.
PG  - e94674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0094674 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia and depression are strongly interrelated. This study aimed
      to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia 
      in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression. METHODS: A longitudinal,
      population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at
      Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17
      and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from
      2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of
      pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average
      sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to
      measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to
      measure depressive symptoms. RESULTS: After delivery, sleep duration was reduced 
      by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to
      75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and
      the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS
      scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression,
      primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum
      insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women 
      with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression 
      had residual insomnia. LIMITATIONS: Depression and insomnia were not verified by 
      clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in
      the study. CONCLUSIONS: Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery 
      compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime
      awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of
      insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be
      a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous
      depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pregnancy physiology may predispose women to the development 
      of airflow limitations during sleep. The goal of this study was to evaluate
      whether pregnant women suspected of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are more
      likely to have airflow limitations compared to non-pregnant controls. METHODS: We
      recruited pregnant women referred for polysomnography for a diagnosis of SDB.
      Non-pregnant female controls matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and
      apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) were identified from a database. We examined airflow
      tracings for changes in amplitude and shape. We classified airflow limitation by 
      (a) amplitude criteria defined as decreased airflow of > or =10 s without
      desaturation or arousal (FL 10), or decreased airflow of any duration combined
      with either 1-2% desaturation or arousal, (FL 1-2%); and (b) shape criteria
      defined as the presence of flattening or oscillations of the inspiratory flow
      curve. RESULTS: We identified 25 case-control pairs. Mean BMI was 44.0+/-6.9 in
      cases and 44.1+/-7.3 in controls. Using shape criteria, pregnant women had
      significantly more flow-limited breaths throughout total sleep time (32.4+/-35.8 
      vs. 9.4+/-17.9, p<0.0001) and in each stage of sleep (p<0.0001) than non-pregnant
      controls. In a subgroup analysis, pregnant women without a diagnosis of
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) who had an AHI <5 had similar findings (p<0.0001).
      There was no difference in airflow limitation by amplitude criteria between
      pregnant women and controls (p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women suspected of
      OSA have more frequent shape-defined airflow limitations than non-pregnant
      controls, even when they do not meet polysomnographic OSA criteria.

TI  - Sources of methodological variability in phase angles from respiratory inductance
      plethysmography in preterm infants.
PG  - 753-60
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201310-363OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Better phenotypic descriptions are needed for chronic lung disease
      among surviving premature infants. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the potential usefulness of respiratory inductance plethysmography in
      characterizing respiratory system mechanics in preterm infants at 32 weeks
      postmenstrual age. METHODS: Respiratory inductance plethysmography was used to
      obtain the phase angle, Phi, to describe rib cage and abdominal dyssynchrony in
      65 infants born between 23 and 28 weeks gestation, all of whom were studied at 32
      weeks postmenstrual age. Up to 60 breaths were evaluated for each subject.
      Sources of intrasubject variability in Phi arising from our methods were explored
      using mechanical models and by evaluating interobserver agreement. MEASUREMENTS
      AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean Phi from infants ranged from 5.8-162.9 degrees , with 
      intrasubject coefficients of variation ranging from 11-123%. On the basis of the 
      mechanical model studies, respiratory inductance plethysmography recording and
      analysis software added <2.3% to the intrasubject variability in Phi. Potential
      inconsistencies in breaths selected could have contributed 8.1%, on average, to
      the total variability. The recording sessions captured 22.8 +/- 9.1 minutes of
      quiet sleep, and enough breaths were counted to adequately characterize the range
      of Phi in the session. CONCLUSION: Phi is quite variable during even short
      recording sessions among preterm infants sleeping quietly. The intrasubject
      variability described herein arises from the instability of the rib cage and
      abdominal phase relationship, not from the recording and analytical methods used.
      Despite the variability, Phi measurements allowed the majority (80%) of infants
      to be reliably categorized as having relatively synchronous or dyssynchronous
      breathing. Respiratory inductance plethysmography is easy to use and should prove
      useful in quantifying respiratory mechanics in multicenter studies of preterm
      infants.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with alterations in markers of
      fetoplacental wellbeing.
PG  - 262-6
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2014.913131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with adverse fetal 
      outcomes in some studies. Second trimester Down syndrome screening markers
      reflect fetal and fetoplacental wellbeing. We aimed to compare markers of fetal
      and feto-placental wellbeing in women with OSA and low risk controls. METHODS: A 
      retrospective case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and available second 
      trimester markers was performed. Controls were screened for sleep disordered
      breathing (SDB) at the time of delivery using a questionnaire. Women at low risk 
      for OSA were selected. Marker levels were adjusted for gestational age and race
      and reported as multiples of median and later adjusted for body mass index (BMI).
      RESULTS: Twenty-four OSA cases and 166 controls were identified. Women with OSA
      had a higher mean BMI when compared to controls (37.1 +/- 12.7 versus 24.1 +/-
      5.1, p = 0.03). Estriol (uE3) multiples of the median (MoM) levels were lower in 
      women with OSA compared to controls, even after adjusting for BMI, 0.74
      (interquartile range (IQR) 0.45) versus 1.06 (IQR 0.38), respectively, p = 0.026.
      Once adjusted for BMI, alpha feto-protein (AFP) MoM levels were no longer
      significantly different in women with OSA compared to controls. CONCLUSION: OSA
      is associated with reduced serum uE3 levels, independently of BMI, possibly
      indicating fetal distress.

TI  - The effect of maternal presence on premature infant response to recorded music.
PG  - 341-50
LID - 10.1111/1552-6909.12303 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and 
      behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus
      ambient sound. DESIGN: Repeated-measures randomized controlled trial. SETTING:
      Special care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center. PARTICIPANTS:
      Clinically stable preterm infants (22) born at > 28 weeks gestation and enrolled 
      at > 32 weeks gestation and their mothers. METHODS: Infants were exposed to
      lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded 
      lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The
      mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline
      and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent
      overall. RESULTS: There was no discernible infant response to music and therefore
      no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over
      time. However during the mothers' presence (first 12 minutes), the infants
      exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p =
      .024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was
      not significant. CONCLUSION: Infants may have been unable to detect the music
      against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants'
      physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and
      departure of the mothers.

TI  - Sphygmology of ibn sina, a message for future.
PG  - 155-8
LID - 10.4103/1995-705X.125934 [doi]
AB  - Sphygmology is a 2000-year-old method that is still used in some traditional
      medicine systems, mainly Iranian, Chinese and Ayurveda. Ibn Sina is one of the
      most popular physicians in the history of Sphygmology, who had made great
      contributions to this method, but few meticulous studies have been made on his
      concepts. In this article, his standpoints on Pulsology are studied. Ibn Sina has
      mentioned 10 parameters for pulse palpation, and 13 compound pulses, as well.
      Besides, some pulse patterns applicable for differentiating similar diseases have
      been introduced. Nowadays some concepts on pulse patterns, such as pulse change
      in sleep and pregnancy have been studied; but unfortunately many of the ideas on 
      Pulsology have not yet been examined. Sphygmology, as an accessible and
      inexpensive means, having a substantial diagnosis yield, has been accepted by the
      people since its rise, and its development over centuries ago. Although some new 
      instruments have been innovated, which can measure different parameters of pulse,
      yet sphygmology can be one of the most commonly usable diagnostic methods in
      future, not only applicable by cardiologists but also by all the physicians.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy: reliability of prevalence and prediction
      estimates.
PG  - 587-93
LID - 10.1038/jp.2014.48 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to ascertain the validity of two screening scales for
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy and to establish the prevalence of OSA
      in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective observational study, two
      screening scales were administered. Screen positive subjects were referred for
      diagnostic polysomnography (PSG); if admitted for antepartum care, screen
      positive subjects underwent a modified study with a type 3 device (T3D). RESULT: 
      A total of 1509 subjects underwent OSA screening; 58 completed diagnostic
      testing. Neither measure was a reliable diagnostic tool for OSA as determined by 
      T3D or PSG (detection rates of 10.3% and 18.0%, respectively). Among screen
      positive subjects undergoing PSG or T3D testing, 15.5% ultimately met 'gold
      standard' OSA diagnostic criteria for an estimated point prevalence of 4.9%.
      CONCLUSION: In this prospective trial, screening positive on the Berlin
      questionnaire or Epworth sleepiness scale was poorly predictive of OSA among
      gravidae and was associated with a high false referral rate.

TI  - The influence of women's attachment style on the chronobiology of labour pain,
      analgesic consumption and pharmacological effect.
PG  - 787-96
LID - 10.3109/07420528.2014.901973 [doi]
AB  - Circadian variation in biological rhythms has been identified as affecting both
      labour pain and the pharmacological properties of analgesics. In the context of
      pain, there is also a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of adult
      attachment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether labour pain,
      analgesic consumption and pharmacological effect are significantly affected by
      the time of day and to analyse whether this circadian variation is influenced by 
      women's attachment style. This prospective observational study included a sample 
      of 81 pregnant women receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).
      Attachment was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale - Revised. The perceived 
      intensity of labour pain in the early stage of labour (3 cm of cervical
      dilatation and before the administration of PCEA) was measured using a visual
      analogue scale (VAS). Pain was also indirectly assessed by measuring the
      consumption of anaesthetics. The latency period and the duration of effect were
      recorded for a chronopharmacology characterisation. Pain, as assessed with the
      VAS, was significantly higher in the night-time group than in the daytime group. 
      An insecure attachment style was significantly associated with greater labour
      pain at 3 cm of cervical dilatation (p < 0.001) and before the beginning of
      analgesia (p < 0.001) as well as with higher analgesic consumption and lower
      pharmacological efficacy (p < 0.05). The time of day was significantly associated
      with the pharmacological effect: the latency period was longer at night, and the 
      duration of the pharmacological effect was longer during the daytime. The
      interaction between time of day and attachment style was not significant for any 
      of the study variables. Our results provide evidence of the importance of
      circadian variation in studying labour pain and the pharmacological effect of
      labour analgesia involving epidural blockage with a PCEA regimen. Moreover,
      although there was no evidence that attachment style influenced the circadian
      variation, these data emphasise that insecure attachment patterns are a risk
      factor for greater labour pain and analgesic consumption, which should be
      considered in pain management approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to
      compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently,
      maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play 
      a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often
      pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the 
      proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position.
      METHODS: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home
      sleep studies. RESULTS: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age
      28.3+/-6.9weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in
      the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine
      sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0-82.9%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that if 
      supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education
      regarding sleep position. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Most pregnant women spend time
      asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal
      cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position
      and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant 
      women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy.

      conditions?
PG  - 2741-5
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i11.2741 [doi]
AB  - Adequate bowel preparation is important for successful colonoscopic examination. 
      Several effective colonic cleansing agents are available and routinely
      prescribed, but each carries its own limitations and benefits from particular
      dosing regimens. The most frequently prescribed colonic cleansing agent, the
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) cathartic solution, suffers from low patient compliance
      in general, due to its unpalatable taste and smell coupled with the large
      ingested volumes required. However, PEG is preferred over other cathartics for
      use in individuals of advanced age, sufferers of chronic kidney disease, heart
      failure and inflammatory bowel disease, and women who are pregnant or lactating. 
      The laxative agents sodium phosphate (NaP) and sodium picosulfate plus magnesium 
      citrate have been applied and have improved patient compliance and tolerance.
      NaP, however, should be avoided in individuals with impaired renal function or
      plasma clearance, such as those with chronic kidney disease, who are taking drugs
      that affect renal function, or who suffer from heart failure. Other special
      conditions that may affect an individual's tolerance of the cathartic agent or
      ability to complete the administration routine include stroke, severe
      constipation, hematochezia, suspicious lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and
      mental disorders such as dementia. All ingestible bowel preparation solutions can
      be instilled into the stomach and duodenum through nasogastric tube or
      esophagogastroduodenoscope with the aid of a water irrigation pump for patients
      with difficulties swallowing or ingesting the large volumes of fluid required. In
      addition, dietary regimens based on clear liquids and low-residue foods for 1-4 d
      prior to the colonoscopy may be supplemental bowel preparation strategies.
      Achieving an effective and safe cleansing of the bowel is important for
      successful colonoscopy in all patients, so full knowledge of the individual's
      condition and capabilities is necessary to select the most appropriate colonic
      cleansing agent and delivery regimen.

TI  - Non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease pathogenesis: a role for developmental
      programming and altered circadian rhythms.
PG  - e89505
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0089505 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests that maternal obesity (MO) predisposes
      offspring to obesity and the recently described non-alcoholic fatty pancreas
      disease (NAFPD) but involved mechanisms remain unclear. Using a
      pathophysiologically relevant murine model, we here investigated a role for the
      biological clock--molecular core circadian genes (CCG) in the generation of
      NAFPD. DESIGN: Female C57BL6 mice were fed an obesogenic diet (OD) or standard
      chow (SC) for 6 weeks, prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation and lactation:
      resulting offspring were subsequently weaned onto either OD (Ob_Ob and Con_Ob) or
      standard chow (Ob_Con and Con_Con) for 6 months. Biochemical, pro-inflammatory
      and pro-fibrogenic markers associated with NAFPD were then evaluated and CCG mRNA
      expression in the pancreas determined. RESULTS: Offspring of obese dams weaned on
      to OD (Ob_Ob) had significantly increased (p</=0.05): bodyweight, pancreatic
      triglycerides, macrovesicular pancreatic fatty-infiltration, and pancreatic mRNA 
      expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, alpha-SMA, TGF-beta and increased collagen
      compared to offspring of control dams weaned on to control chow (Con_Con).
      Analyses of CCG expression demonstrated a phase shift in CLOCK (-4.818, p<0.01), 
      REV-ERB-alpha (-1.4,p<0.05) and Per2 (3.27,p<0.05) in association with decreased 
      amplitude in BMAL-1 (-0.914,p<0.05) and PER2 (1.18,p<0.005) in Ob_Ob compared to 
      Con_Con. 2-way ANOVA revealed significant interaction between MO and post-weaning
      OD in expression of CLOCK (p<0.005), PER1 (p<0.005) and PER2 (p<0.05) whilst MO
      alone influenced the observed rhythmic variance in expression of all 5 measured
      CCG. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal and neonatal exposure to a maternal obesogenic
      environment interacts with a post-natal hyper-calorific environment to induce
      offspring NAFPD through mechanisms involving perturbations in CCG expression.

LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2014.01.003 [doi]
LID - S1389-9457(14)00036-7 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. 
      Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little 
      is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors. METHODS: Diary and
      actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure
      (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women
      (N=161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks) and T3 (18-20
      weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake
      after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were
      dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs. RESULTS: BMI and BP
      significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL>/=20 min had greater
      BMI than women without persistent SOL>/=20 min prior to covariate adjustment at
      T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for 
      persistent WASO>/=30 min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was 
      associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSIONS:
      Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report
      substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy
      and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these
      relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant
      morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for
      appropriate intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although many studies have shown the evolution of sleep parameters
      across the lifespan, not many have included a representative sample of the
      general population. The objective of this study was to describe age-related
      changes in sleep structure, sleep respiratory parameters and periodic limb
      movements of the adult population of Sao Paulo. METHODS: We selected a
      representative sample of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil that included both genders
      and an age range of 20-80 years. Pregnant and lactating women, people with
      physical or mental impairments that prevent self-care and people who work every
      night were not included. This sample included 1024 individuals who were submitted
      to polysomnography and structured interviews. We subdivided our sample into
      five-year age groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare age
      groups. Pearson product-moment was used to evaluate correlation between age and
      sleep parameters. RESULTS: Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep showed a significant
      age-related decrease (P<0.05). WASO (night-time spent awake after sleep onset),
      arousal index, sleep latency, REM sleep latency, and the percentage of stages 1
      and 2 showed a significant increase (P<0.05). Furthermore, apnea-hypopnea index
      increased and oxygen saturation decreased with age. The reduction in the
      percentage of REM sleep significantly correlated with age in women, whereas the
      reduction in the percentage of slow wave sleep correlated with age in men. The
      periodic limb movement (PLM) index increased with age in men and women.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sleep structure and duration underwent significant alterations
      throughout the aging process in the general population. There was an important
      correlation between age, sleep respiratory parameters and PLM index. In addition,
      men and women showed similar trends but with different effect sizes.

TI  - Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) typically
      presents before age 20 years with weakness of the facial muscles and the
      stabilizers of the scapula or the dorsiflexors of the foot. Severity is highly
      variable. Weakness is slowly progressive and approximately 20% of affected
      individuals eventually require a wheelchair. Life expectancy is not shortened.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Although some controversy remains, FSHD is likely caused by
      inappropriate expression of the double homeobox-containing gene DUX4 in muscle
      cells. DUX4 lies in the macrosatellite repeat D4Z4 on chromosome 4q35, which has 
      a length between 11 and 100 repeat units on normal alleles. Approximately 95% of 
      individuals with FSHD have a D4Z4 allele of between one and ten repeat units. The
      shortening of the D4Z4 allele causes chromatin relaxation at the D4Z4 locus and
      DUX4 promoter and thereby derepression of DUX4. This common form of FSHD is
      designated facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 1 (FSHD1). Molecular genetic
      testing measures the length of the D4Z4 allele. About 5% of individuals with FSHD
      show chromatin relaxation at D4Z4 without having a D4Z4 contraction. In these
      individuals with so-called FSHD2, pathogenic variants in the chromatin modifier
      SMCHD1 cause the chromatin relaxation at D4Z4. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Consultation with a physical therapist; low-intensity aerobic
      exercise; management of chronic pain by physical therapy and medication, as
      necessary; ventilator support for hypoventilation; standard treatment of
      sensorineural hearing loss; lubricants to prevent drying of the sclera or taping 
      the eyes shut during sleep to treat exposure keratitis; ankle/foot orthoses to
      improve mobility and prevent falls. Surgical fixation of the scapula to the chest
      wall may improve range of motion of the arms over the short term. Surveillance:
      Pain should be assessed at regular visits to the primary care physician or
      physical therapist; routine screening for hypoventilation and yearly forced vital
      capacity in those with moderate to severe disease; periodic hearing screening in 
      affected children; annual dilated ophthalmoscopy in childhood. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: FSHD1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately
      70%-90% of individuals have inherited the disease-causing deletion from a parent,
      and approximately 10%-30% of affected individuals have FSHD as the result of a de
      novo deletion. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of
      inheriting the deletion. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is
      possible if the D4Z4 pathogenic contraction has been identified in the family.
      FSHD2 is inherited in a digenic manner.

TI  - "Taking its toll": the challenges of working in fetal medicine.
PG  - 52-60
LID - 10.1111/birt.12029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis
      during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published
      personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with
      couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically
      challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This
      study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an
      effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these
      effects. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied
      health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. 
      Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis.
      RESULTS: Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with
      patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants
      reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and
      many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes.
      Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult
      when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported 
      in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine.
      Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are
      vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for
      formal support and self-care management is suggested.

TI  - Nighttime breastfeeding behavior is associated with more nocturnal sleep among
      first-time mothers at one month postpartum.
PG  - 313-9
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3538 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe sleep duration and quality in the first month
      postpartum and compare the sleep of women who exclusively breastfed at night to
      those who used formula. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study in a
      predominantly low-income and ethnically diverse sample of 120 first-time mothers.
      Both objective and subjective measures of sleep were obtained using actigraphy,
      diary, and self-report data. Measures were collected in the last month of
      pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Infant feeding diaries were used to group 
      mothers by nighttime breastfeeding behavior. RESULTS: Mothers who used at least
      some formula at night (n = 54) and those who breastfed exclusively (n = 66) had
      similar sleep patterns in late pregnancy. However, there was a significant group 
      difference in nocturnal sleep at one month postpartum as measured by actigraphy. 
      Total nighttime sleep was 386 +/- 66 minutes for the exclusive breastfeeding
      group and 356 +/- 67 minutes for the formula group. The groups did not differ
      with respect to daytime sleep, wake after sleep onset (sleep fragmentation), or
      subjective sleep disturbance at one month postpartum. CONCLUSION: Women who
      breastfed exclusively averaged 30 minutes more nocturnal sleep than women who
      used formula at night, but measures of sleep fragmentation did not differ. New
      mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively since breastfeeding may
      promote sleep during postpartum recovery. Further research is needed to better
      understand how infant feeding method affects maternal sleep duration and
      fragmentation. CITATION: Doan T; Gay CL; Kennedy HP; Newman J; Lee KA. Nighttime 
      breastfeeding behavior is associated with more nocturnal sleep among first-time
      mothers at one month postpartum.

      implications for risk and severity of diabetes.
PG  - 151-73
LID - 10.1111/nyas.12355 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbances, including sleep insufficiency and sleep fragmentation, have
      been linked to abnormal glucose metabolism and increased diabetes risk.
      Well-controlled laboratory studies have provided insights regarding the
      underlying mechanisms. Several large prospective studies suggest that these sleep
      disturbances are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes.
      Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a
      major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. Whether glycemic 
      control in type 2 diabetes patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea
      remains controversial. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy and their
      relationship to gestational diabetes and hyperglycemia have received considerable
      attention owing to potential adverse effects on maternal and fetal health.
      Additionally, evidence from animal models has identified disruption of the
      circadian system as a putative risk factor for adverse metabolic outcomes. The
      purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current state of knowledge 
      linking sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and glucose metabolism.
      Experimental, prospective, and interventional studies are discussed.

      and metabolism.
PG  - 603-12
LID - 10.1111/jne.12144 [doi]
AB  - Internal temporal organisation properly synchronised to the environment is
      crucial for health maintenance. This organisation is provided at the cellular
      level by the molecular clock, a macromolecular transcription-based oscillator
      formed by the clock and the clock-controlled genes that is present in both
      central and peripheral tissues. In mammals, melanopsin in light-sensitive retinal
      ganglion cells plays a considerable role in the synchronisation of the circadian 
      timing system to the daily light/dark cycle. Melatonin, a hormone synthesised in 
      the pineal gland exclusively at night and an output of the central clock, has a
      fundamental role in regulating/timing several physiological functions, including 
      glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion and energy metabolism. As such, metabolism
      is severely impaired after a reduction in melatonin production. Furthermore,
      light pollution during the night and shift work schedules can abrogate melatonin 
      synthesis and impair homeostasis. Chronodisruption during pregnancy has
      deleterious effects on the health of progeny, including metabolic, cardiovascular
      and cognitive dysfunction. Developmental programming by steroids or
      steroid-mimetic compounds also produces internal circadian disorganisation that
      may be a significant factor in the aetiology of fertility disorders such as
      polycystic ovary syndrome. Thus, both early and late in life, pernicious
      alterations of the endogenous temporal order by environmental factors can disrupt
      the homeostatic function of the circadian timing system, leading to
      pathophysiology and/or disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep
      quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women. DESIGN:
      Prospective, longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy (170) pregnant
      women at 10-20 weeks gestation. METHODS: Sleep quality was assessed with the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep
      fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10-12, 14-16, and
      18-20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time,
      averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status
      (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression
      analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after
      adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived
      stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. RESULTS: On average, women
      reported modestly poor sleep quality (M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration
      (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household
      income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (beta = -.18, p < 
      0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (beta = -.18, p < 0.05) following covariate
      adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and
      fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and
      financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial
      situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.

AB  - The paper examines the case of a pregnant woman in a twin pregnancy complicated
      by pre-eclampsia and sleep disordered breathing. The patient was admitted to
      hospital with high blood pressure, proteinuria and increasing oedema. Laboratory 
      tests revealed proteinuria and reduced total protein concentration in serum. The 
      patient was diagnosed with mild pre-eclampsia. Due to the observed severe daytime
      sleepiness of the patient, loud snoring and pauses in breathing during sleep,
      polysomnography was performed. The test revealed a number of episodes of
      obstructive apnea and hypopnea. The AHI (apnea-hypopnea index) value was 82.1. A 
      number of episodes of desaturation were observed. The lowest saturation had a
      value of 82%. When the patient was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea,
      treatment with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) was introduced. The use
      of CPAP allowed a reduction of the AHI to 1.2, and the blood pressure value
      normalised. The patient used CPAP between the 33rd and 35th weeks of gestation.
      At the 35th week of gestation, caesarean section was performed due to
      life-threatening symptoms of the first foetus in the CTG-recording. Two male
      infants were delivered in good condition. During the postpartum period, the
      patient discontinued the use of CPAP. Following this, an increase in AHI to 45.3 
      and an increase in blood pressure to a maximum of 180/100mmHg were observed. The 
      patient was discharged from hospital in good general condition on the 7th day
      postpartum with recommendation for further diagnostic and therapy. The conclusion
      that may be drawn from the case is that sleep disorders adversely affect the
      health of the mother and the foetus. Also, the mood and quality of life of the
      pregnant woman deteriorate. It has been proven that there are many relationships 
      between sleep and health. Sleep disorders and disorders of breathing during sleep
      contribute to the development of various diseases or they degrade the overall
      phenomena. A disease, on the other hand, additionally negatively affects the
      quality of sleep. Therefore, it is essential to treat not only the primary
      disease, but also the accompanying sleep disorders.

AB  - Of the problems that complicate child-bearing, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), or
      severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is likely one of the most painful 
      with unrelenting retching and vomiting that can lead to measurable injuries such 
      as Mallory-Weiss Syndrome and esophageal rupture, and/or subtle maternal
      cognitive impairments related to starvation and dehydration. Recognized hallmarks
      of HG include dehydration, ketonuria, weight loss over 5%, and electrolyte
      abnormalities not attributable to other causes. Historically providers regarded
      the hyperemetic as a difficult to treat patient with potentially underlying
      psychological problems. Sick patients who experience pain and suffering present
      challenges to care, not excepting NVP. Ill patients can be demanding and
      agitated. Agitation can be one of the early signs of delirium or altered mental
      status (AMS). AMS can include previously diagnosed psychiatric conditions as well
      as new onset of Wernicke's encephalopathy, deliria, insomnia, hallucinations and 
      autoscopy, resulting from various etiologies including and not limited to
      medications, pain including pain from hunger, vomiting and retching,
      constipation, dehydration, altered electrolytes, hypoglycemia, malnutrition and
      sleep deprivation. AMS may have a subtle waxing and waning trajectory, making the
      condition difficult to diagnosis in early stages. What have not been well
      elucidated in AMS are subjective images and/or experiences. Whether all AMS
      experiences are similar is unknown. We believe there may be a transient
      alteration of cognitive status or "altered sensorium gestosis" (ASG), attributed 
      to the direct insults of hyperemesis gravidarum which will be discussed herein.
      How prevalent ASG might be is unknown and needs further investigation.

TI  - Association of adverse perinatal outcomes with screening measures of obstructive 
      sleep apnea.
PG  - 441-8
LID - 10.1038/jp.2014.25 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective observational study explored the association of
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and
      sleep studies. STUDY DESIGN: Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the
      Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were
      administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen-positive subjects were referred for 
      polysomnography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational
      hypertension or preeclampsia. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to
      estimate the relative risks of associations. RESULT: One thousand one hundred and
      fifty-seven subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on 
      the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models
      (adjusted relative risk=1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.37). CONCLUSION: 
      In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggests that the BQ but not the
      ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy
      outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others.
      However, causative association of BQ with OSA cannot be assumed.

TI  - Early origins of health disparities: material deprivation predicts maternal
      evening cortisol in pregnancy and offspring cortisol reactivity in the first few 
      weeks of life.
PG  - 723-30
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.22532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Maternal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal-axis function regulates
      production of the stress hormone cortisol, which during pregnancy can cross the
      placenta and have lasting impacts on fetal growth and development. This article
      provides a preliminary test of the hypothesis that a woman's socioeconomic status
      (SES) predicts her cortisol during pregnancy and her offspring's cortisol during 
      the early postnatal period among an ethnically diverse sample in Auckland, New
      Zealand to evaluate whether differences in cortisol contribute to the
      intergenerational inheritance of health disparities within this population.
      METHODS: Maternal saliva samples were collected at waking and prior to sleep on 2
      days in late pregnancy (34-36 weeks gestation; N = 55), and a subset of offspring
      saliva was collected before (N = 48) and 20 min after a standard vaccination at 6
      weeks of age (N = 19). SES was quantified using a locally validated index of
      material deprivation, the NZ Deprivation Index for individuals (NZiDep). RESULTS:
      We found that, after controlling for ethnicity and other covariates, women with
      higher NZiDep scores had significantly higher evening but similar morning
      cortisol, consistent with a pattern of chronic strain. Infants of women reporting
      greater material deprivation had elevated cortisol response to vaccination.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that maternal SES experience impacts maternal
      cortisol in pregnancy and offspring cortisol reactivity soon after birth, with
      potential long-term effects on offspring biology and health. Additional research 
      is needed to clarify how biological and behavioral factors in both the prenatal
      and postnatal period facilitate this relationship.

TI  - Study protocol for a randomized, controlled, superiority trial comparing the
      clinical and cost- effectiveness of integrated online mental health
      assessment-referral-care in pregnancy to usual prenatal care on prenatal and
      postnatal mental health and infant health and development: the Integrated
      Maternal Psychosocial Assessment to Care Trial (IMPACT).
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-15-72 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women.
      However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health
      problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those
      who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers
      frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental
      health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family
      well-being. METHODS/DESIGN: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial
      assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women
      compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The
      primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress
      symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum
      depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem;
      sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age;
      birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development;
      parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency,
      feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are <28
      weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email
      questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at
      recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited
      from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated
      randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online
      psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or 
      stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules.
      All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization
      and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers
      conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews
      with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will
      provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of
      this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated
      approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible
      computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and
      family-based outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Restless legs syndrome is related to obstructive sleep apnea symptoms during
      pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the relation between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and 
      obstructive sleep apnea symptoms during pregnancy. METHODS: A questionnaire
      consisting of diagnostic criteria of restless legs syndrome, demographic
      characteristics, personal behavior, muscle cramps during pregnancy, past medical 
      illnesses, family history of RLS, and the major symptoms of obstructive sleep
      apnea syndrome was administered during a face-to-face interview. Pregnant women
      with and without RLS were compared in terms of serum hemoglobin, hematocrit,
      calcium, phosphor, iron, folate, vitamin B12 levels, and obstructive sleep apnea 
      symptoms. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between two
      groups in terms of two of the obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (witnessed apnea
      and fatigue) (p < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found with
      regard to serum calcium, magnesium, iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, vitamin B12,
      phosphor, and folate levels; however, there were significant differences in terms
      of total iron-binding capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing awareness of restless
      legs syndrome among obstetricians is essential as it might be related to
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, which is associated with adverse pregnancy
      outcomes.

TI  - MDMA is certainly damaging after 25 years of empirical research: a reply and
      refutation of Doblin et al. (2014).
PG  - 109-19
LID - 10.1002/hup.2390 [doi]
AB  - Human Psychopharmacology recently published my review into the increase in
      empirical knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA over the past 25 years 
      (Parrott, 2013a). Deficits have been demonstrated in retrospective memory,
      prospective memory, higher cognition, complex visual processing, sleep
      architecture, sleep apnoea, pain, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status.
      Neuroimaging studies have shown serotonergic deficits, which are associated with 
      lifetime Ecstasy/MDMA usage, and degree of neurocognitive impairment. Basic
      psychological skills remain intact. Ecstasy/MDMA use by pregnant mothers leads to
      psychomotor impairments in the children. Hence, the damaging effects of
      Ecstasy/MDMA were far more widespread than was realized a few years ago. In their
      critique of my review, Doblin et al. (2014) argued that my review contained
      misstatements, omitted contrary findings, and recited dated misconceptions. In
      this reply, I have answered all the points they raised. I have been able to
      refute each of their criticisms by citing the relevant empirical data, since many
      of their points were based on inaccurate summaries of the actual research
      findings. Doblin and colleagues are proponents of the use of MDMA for
      drug-assisted psychotherapy, and their strongest criticisms were focused on my
      concerns about this proposal. However, again all the issues I raised were based
      on sound empirical evidence or theoretical understanding. Indeed I would
      recommend potentially far safer co-drugs such as D-cycloserine or oxytocin. In
      summary, MDMA can induce a wide range of neuropsychobiological changes, many of
      which are damaging to humans.

AB  - Pregnant women, both before and after childbirth, frequently experience memory
      deficits and disrupted sleep. In the present study we assessed the relationship
      between false memory generation and fragmented sleep during pregnancy and
      motherhood. We tested 178 pregnant women and 58 female non-pregnant childless
      controls, during pregnancy (15-35th week of gestation) and again after childbirth
      (8-13th month). False memories were defined as memories of gist words that were
      semantically related to studied word lists but were not presented during learning
      of these lists in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was
      monitored by actigraphy in the home environment for seven consecutive nights.
      Compared to the controls, the group of pregnant women produced more false
      memories and displayed more fragmented sleep both during pregnancy and after
      childbirth. However, false memory generation was not correlated to measures of
      sleep fragmentation. These results show that pregnant women suffer from sleep
      fragmentation and a higher susceptibility to false memories, but leave open the
      question as to whether both phenomena are related.

TI  - Physical activity and health-related quality of life during pregnancy: a

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of physical activity before and
      during pregnancy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from the
      cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial
      conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases
      considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of
      moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) (N =
      80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) (N =
      258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes
      mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D,
      with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical
      activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity,
      education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the
      expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI
      0.003-0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had
      greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04-3.78), ability to handle their usual
      activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29-3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI
      1.22-3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep
      (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03-4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active
      women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was
      associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical
      activity.

AB  - Physical activity is associated with improved sleep quality and duration in the
      general population, but its effect on sleep in postpartum women is unknown. We
      examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hours/week of
      self-reported domain-specific and overall moderate to vigorous physical activity 
      (MVPA) and sleep quality and duration at 3- and 12-months postpartum among a
      cohort of 530 women in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Postpartum Study. 
      MVPA was not associated with sleep quality or duration at 3-months postpartum. At
      12-months postpartum, a 1 h/week increase in recreational MVPA was associated
      with higher odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95 %
      confidence interval, CI, 1.03-1.27) and a 1 h/week increase in child/adult care
      MVPA was associated with lower odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (OR = 0.93; 
      95 % CI 0.88-0.99). A 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA (OR 1.08, 95 %
      CI 1.00-1.16) was associated with higher odds of long sleep duration and 1 h/week
      increases in indoor household (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.18) and overall MVPA (OR
      1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) were associated with higher odds of short (vs. normal)
      sleep duration. Comparing 3-months postpartum to 12-months postpartum, increased 
      work MVPA was associated with good sleep quality (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.12-5.15) and
      increased indoor household MVPA was associated with short sleep duration (OR
      1.85, 95 % CI 1.05-3.27) as measured at 12-months postpartum. Selected domains of
      MVPA and their longitudinal increases were associated with sleep quality and
      duration at 12-months postpartum. Additional research is needed to elucidate
      whether physical activity can improve postpartum sleep.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder that has numerous medical
      consequences including cardiovascular morbidity. The clinical presentation in
      women is frequently vague, leading to its under-recognition in this population.
      Sleep is known to influence several female hormonal cycles including estrogen,
      progesterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating
      hormone (FSH); consequently, sleep disruption may have adverse effects on female 
      health including pregnancy. Miscarriage, defined as the loss of a pregnancy in
      the first trimester, occurs in one in four pregnancies; in up to half of cases,
      the cause may be unknown. Risk factors for miscarriage include increased age,
      increased weight, and a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, all of which are 
      also risk factors for SDB. Since SDB is frequently accompanied by sleep
      fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia, we speculate that these factors may
      contribute to miscarriage risk. If this is the case, then treatment of SDB may be
      a possible intervention for subsequent pregnancies.

TI  - The incidence of and risk factors for postpartum depression at an urban maternity
      clinic in Turkey.
PG  - 179-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects 
      not only mothers, but also entire families. Postpartum follow-up should address
      emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in
      those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the
      associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at
      an urban maternity clinic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study investigating
      the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that
      presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks
      post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a
      sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors
      (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related,
      pregnancy-related, and child-related factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was
      28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy,
      bottle-feeding only, mother's lack of satisfaction with the baby's sleep pattern,
      lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital
      relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P <
      0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family
      support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence 
      were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD.
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women
      and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly
      associated with PPD.

TI  - A new pharmacologic treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.
PG  - 73-7
LID - 10.1111/1751-486X.12096 [doi]
AB  - Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80 percent of pregnant
      women. This condition is usually self-limiting, but the symptoms can be
      distressing and interfere with work, social activities and sleep. Symptoms can
      often be managed by diet and lifestyle changes, but these interventions may not
      be successful for everyone. In April 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      approved doxylamine succinate 10 mg/pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg (Diclegis) as 
      the first medication to specifically treat NVP in more than 30 years. This
      article reviews the indications, dosage and nursing interventions associated with
      using doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine to treat NVP.

AB  - A unique group of ear, nose, and throat disorders are associated with pregnancy. 
      While most are benign and reverse during the postpartum period, some do not.
      These disorders may be classified categorically by site into ear, nose, and
      laryngeal manifestations. The etiology, pathogenesis and management of these
      disorders are discussed. Therapeutic recommendations are made based on available 
      information. It is especially important to have knowledge of these common
      manifestations and treat them with precaution considering the possible effects to
      both the mother and growing foetus during this crucial period.

TI  - Persistence of fertility despite semen alterations in a pinealectomised patient
      treated with melatonin.
PG  - 763-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the effect of chronic melatonin treatment on
      human reproductive function. We report here on the effect of 10 months treatment 
      with a controlled-release melatonin preparation (Circadin(R), 2 mg) on
      spermatogenesis and gonadotropic hormone status in a pinealectomised patient
      whose melatonin secretion was abolished. METHODS: Semen analysis, hormone
      (Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), inhibin B,
      prolactin, testosterone and estradiol) and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHB G)
      concentrations were determined before and at the end of 4 and 10 months of,
      treatment. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, testosterone, sex hormone-binding
      globulin, prolactin and inhibin B levels did not display significant variation
      with time, whereas FSH and LH levels showed a tendency to a decrease, but
      remained in the normal range. Sperm concentration and total spermatozoa count
      dropped below the lower limit of the reference range during melatonin treatment, 
      whereas motility and normal form percentages remained in the normal range.
      Fertility was preserved, since the patient's wife became pregnant during month 10
      of melatonin treatment and gave birth to a healthy female baby. CONCLUSIONS: this
      isolated clinical observation shows that more investigations in large patient
      series are needed to document possible side-effects of melatonin administration
      on male reproductive function. One should therefore be cautious about melatonin
      prescription for circadian rhythm sleep disorders in young males.

TI  - A systematic review and quantitative assessment of sleep-disordered breathing
      during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.
PG  - 703-13
LID - 10.1007/s11325-014-0946-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous investigations have suggested a strong association between
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.
      However, the results of the following replication studies were not always
      concordant. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the more
      reliable estimate. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on
      PubMed, Springer Link, and EMBASE to identify all eligible studies published
      before August 2013. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      were calculated using fixed or random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 24
      publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. 
      Findings demonstrated that moderate-to-severe SDB during pregnancy was associated
      with gestational diabetes mellitus (OR=1.78; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.46),
      pregnancy-related hypertension (OR=2.38; 95% CI, 1.63 to 3.47), preeclampsia
      (OR=2.19; 95% CI, 1.71 to 2.80), preterm delivery (OR=1.98; 95% CI, 1.59 to
      2.48), low birth weight (OR=1.75; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.32), neonatal intensive care 
      unit (NICU) admission (OR=2.43; 95% CI, 1.61 to 3.68), intrauterine growth
      restriction (OR=1.44; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.71), and Apgar score of <7 at 1 min
      (OR=1.78; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.91) based on all studies but not gestational age and 
      birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis revealed that moderate-to-severe
      SDB during pregnancy may be associated with most of adverse perinatal outcomes.
      Further well-designed studies are warranted to confirm our findings.

      dissipation limits in lactating common voles (Microtus arvalis).

AB  - According to the heat dissipation limit theory, maximum metabolic turnover is
      limited by the capacity of the body to dissipate excess heat. Small mammals,
      including common voles (Microtus arvalis), face a heat dissipation limitation
      during lactation. Pup growth and milk production are reduced under higher ambient
      temperatures. Heat dissipation problems might in part be alleviated by modifying 
      behavior, such as reducing nest attendance and being active at energetically
      optimal times of day. According to the circadian thermo-energetics hypothesis,
      animals can make use of daily ambient temperature fluctuations to alter their
      energetic expenditure. In this study we test whether heat challenged (housing at 
      30 degrees C compared to 21 degrees C) lactating common voles allocate their time
      differently among behaviors and whether their ultradian and circadian behavioral 
      rhythmicity are altered. Behavior was scored every 13 min from automated picture 
      recordings, while general locomotor activity was measured by passive infrared
      detectors to assess ultradian and circadian organization. The effects of ambient 
      temperature on the ultradian organization of behavior were assessed by
      determining the ultradian period length and the distribution of activity within
      the ultradian bout. Changes in circadian organization were assessed by the
      distribution of activity over the light and dark phase. As a complementary
      measure nest temperature recordings were used to quantify nest attendance
      distribution between day and night. Lactating dams at 30 degrees C reduced the
      fraction of time spent on the nest while increasing the fraction of time resting 
      without pups away from the nest. The ultradian period of locomotor activity was
      longer in voles housed at 30 degrees C during pregnancy and lactation, but not
      after weaning when the pups were removed. No differences in the distribution of
      activity within the ultradian bout could be detected. The circadian organization 
      was also modulated by ambient temperature. Lactating voles housed at 30 degrees C
      became more day active and a loss of day-night differences in nest temperature
      suggests a shift of nest attendance towards the night. Reducing the time
      attending the nest can reduce the risk of hyperthermia, and may be the behavioral
      component resulting in lower milk production and hence reproductive output.
      Becoming more day active allows feeding and nursing of the pups during the rest
      phase to occur during the night at which lower ambient temperatures are expected 
      in the field. In natural situations this strategy will increase heat dissipation 
      and lactation capacity. Whether there are similar benefits associated with a
      longer ultradian period is currently unknown, but these are likely to result from
      decreased energy turnover at 30 degrees C. In conclusion, our study shows that
      lactating common voles facing heat dissipation problems re-organize their
      behavior in a way that can maximize heat dissipation capabilities and thereby
      optimize lactation capacity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and
      incidence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy among high-risk women.
      STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, observational study. We recruited women
      with a body mass index (BMI) >/= 30 kg/m(2), chronic hypertension, pregestational
      diabetes, history of preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment 
      of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB
      was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >/=5, and further grouped into
      severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9) and severe (>/=30).
      Subjects who had a normal AHI at the baseline (AHI < 5), but an abnormal study in
      the third trimester (AHI >/=5) were classified as having "new-onset" SDB.
      RESULTS: A total of 128 women were recruited. In early pregnancy 21, 6 and 3% had
      mild, moderate, or severe SDB, respectively. These frequencies increased to 35,
      7, and 5% in the third trimester (p < 0.001). About 27% (n = 34) experienced a
      worsening of SDB during pregnancy; 26 were cases of new-onset SDB, while the
      other 8 had SDB in early pregnancy that worsened in severity. The incidence of
      new-onset SDB was 20%. The majority of these new-onset cases were mild.
      CONCLUSIONS: SDB in early pregnancy is common in high-risk women and new-onset
      SDB occurs in 20% of these women.

      diagnosis and long-term effects of neonatal pain].
PG  - 47-53
AB  - UNLABELLED: Entering of high-tech methods used in the treatment of premature
      infants carries the risk of increased invasiveness which causes the pain and
      stress in them. The aim of this literature review is to present the achievements 
      in the study of neonatal pain, causes and responses to it, the short-term effects
      on their status and their later development, as well as the ways of pain's
      assessment. The newborn after 26-30 weeks of gestation has functionally mature
      pain receptor apparatus. Numerous invasive procedures cause in the prematurely
      born baby psycho-physiological abnormalities (changes in heart rate, breathing,
      blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and behavioral abnormalities (facial
      expression, motion activity of the body and extremities, sleep disturbances,
      characteristics of crying). The last mentioned are basis for creating a rating
      scale for procedural and prolonged pain. Future studies are aimed at creating an 
      universal scales. CONCLUSION: At the time of intensive treatment, the premature
      infant is under the adverse effects of acute or repeated pain incentives. They
      worsen the status, prolong the hospital stay and influence the later neurological
      development and outcome of the premature infant. In everyday clinical practice,
      prevention of pain, establishing its severity and its evaluation reduce its
      negative effects on the newborn.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the link between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and
      sleep-disordered breathing using complete polysomnography and questionnaires in a
      case-control study of pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women (body mass index
      [BMI] less than 35, no prior diabetes or hypertension) were eligible as cases
      (n=26) if diagnosed with GDM by routine 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Women
      in the control group without GDM (n=26) were matched for gestational age at
      polysomnography, BMI, and age. Polysomnography were conducted at home at 24-32
      weeks of gestation. Sleepiness score (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), subjective sleep
      quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), risk for depression (Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale), and restless legs syndrome were assessed by
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Primary outcome apnea-hypopnea index (4.2+/-3.9 events
      per hour in women in the case group compared with 3.8+/-2.3 events per hour in
      women in the control group) as well as other objective and subjective sleep
      measures, including oxygen desaturation index, snoring, and flow limitation, were
      not significantly different between groups. Sleepiness was greater in women in
      the case group than in women in the control group (9.8+/-3.6 compared with
      7.2+/-3.6, P=.05). Additionally, 23% of women in the case group compared with 0% 
      of women in the control group (P<.01) reported an Edinburgh Scale score of at
      least 10 (suggesting significant depression) and 46% of women with GDM reported
      restless legs syndrome compared to 19% of women in the control group (P=.07).
      CONCLUSION: There was no association between GDM and sleep-disordered breathing
      in pregnant women with prepregnancy BMIs under 35 and no medical comorbidities.

AB  - Over the past two decades, it has become clear just how much of our physiology is
      under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the cell-intrinsic
      molecular clock that ticks with a periodicity of approximately 24 h. The SCN
      prepares our digestive system for meals, our adrenal axis for the stress of
      waking up in the morning, and the genes expressed in our muscles when we prepare 
      to exercise. Long before molecular studies of genes such as Clock, Bmal1, and the
      Per homologs were possible, it was obvious that female reproductive function was 
      under strict circadian control at every level of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and in the establishment and successful
      maintenance of pregnancy. This review highlights our current understanding of the
      role that the SCN plays in regulating female reproductive physiology, with a
      special emphasis on the advances made possible through the use of circadian
      mutant mice.

TI  - Obesity in pregnancy: addressing risks to improve outcomes.
PG  - 32-40; quiz E1-2
LID - 10.1097/JPN.0000000000000008 [doi]
AB  - The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only
      in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks
      during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body
      mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of U.S. women aged 20 to
      39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m or greater. Across the
      life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension,
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During
      pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in
      both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge
      about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI,
      addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence
      of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve
      care.

TI  - Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a
      rare disorder of respiratory and autonomic regulation. It is typically
      characterized by a classic presentation in newborns and, rarely, a milder
      later-onset (LO-CCHS) presentation in toddlers, children, and adults. Classic
      CCHS presents in newborns as: Apparent hypoventilation with monotonous
      respiratory rates and shallow breathing either during sleep only or while awake
      as well as asleep; Autonomic nervous system dysregulation (ANSD); and In some
      individuals, altered development of neural crest-derived structures (i.e.,
      Hirschsprung disease) and/or tumors of neural crest origin (neuroblastoma,
      ganglioneuroma, and ganglioneuroblastoma). Individuals with CCHS who have been
      diagnosed as newborns and ventilated conservatively and consistently throughout
      childhood have now reached the age of 20 to 30 years; they are highly functional 
      and live independently. LO-CCHS manifests as nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation
      and mild ANSD. Individuals with LO-CCHS who were not identified until age 20
      years or older have now reached the age of 30 to 55 years. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      Diagnosis of CCHS is established based on: Clinical findings of alveolar
      hypoventilation and ANSD in the absence of primary pulmonary, cardiac, or
      neuromuscular disease, or a causative brain stem lesion that can account for the 
      entire phenotype; and Identification of a pathogenic variant in PHOX2B. PHOX2B is
      the only gene in which mutation is known to cause CCHS. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of 
      manifestations: Tracheostomy and home ventilator for individuals requiring
      ventilatory support 24 hours per day and for infants/children/adults requiring
      ventilatory support during sleep only. Diaphragm pacing by phrenic nerve
      stimulation can be considered in ambulatory children requiring mechanical
      ventilation 24 hours a day and potentially in older children and adults requiring
      nocturnal ventilation only, though tracheostomy removal for nocturnal diaphragm
      pacing is not assured. Mask ventilation or negative-pressure ventilation is a
      consideration in cooperative older children requiring ventilatory support during 
      sleep; however, during intercurrent illnesses more aggressive ventilatory support
      such as intubation with continuous mechanical ventilation in an intensive care
      setting may be needed. A cardiac pacemaker may be required for prolonged sinus
      pauses. Hirschsprung disease is treated in the usual manner. Neuroblastomas are
      removed surgically; those beyond Stage 1 are treated with chemotherapy. Treatment
      of other tumors of neural crest origin is based on location and type, though
      surgical removal is typically recommended. Prevention of secondary complications:
      Mask ventilation in the infant and young child is strongly discouraged because it
      is not adequately stable as a life-sustaining support, with risk for repeated
      hypoxemia and neurocognitive compromise. Surveillance: For all individuals with
      CCHS: at least yearly (every 6 months until age 3 years) comprehensive,
      multiple-day in-hospital physiologic evaluation to optimize ventilatory support
      awake and asleep and in varied levels of activity and concentration simulating
      activities of daily living; yearly 72-hour Holter recording to identify any
      prolonged sinus pauses; yearly echocardiogram to identify right ventricular
      hypertrophy or cor pulmonale; yearly hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte
      counts to identify polycythemia; and yearly neurocognitive testing to evaluate
      the success of artificial ventilation. For children with specific PHOX2B variants
      placing them at higher risk: evaluate for Hirschsprung disease and tumors of
      neural crest origin. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Swimming (asphyxia; death);
      breathholding contests (asphyxia; death); alcohol (respiratory depression),
      recreational drugs (varied effects including death), and prescribed as well as
      non-prescribed medications/sedatives/anesthetics that could induce respiratory
      depression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Both parents of children with a
      known PHOX2B pathogenic variant should be tested for the family-specific variant 
      to determine their risk for later-onset CCHS or mosaicism. GENETIC COUNSELING:
      CCHS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with CCHS are
      heterozygous for a de novo PHOX2B pathogenic variant; some have an affected
      parent and up to 25% have an asymptomatic parent who has mosaicism for a PHOX2B
      variant. Each child of an individual with CCHS has a 50% chance of inheriting the
      PHOX2B pathogenic variant; the risk to the offspring of an individual with
      mosaicism is 50% or lower. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is 
      possible if the causative variant has been identified in an affected family
      member. Some families choose to pursue prenatal testing in order to make informed
      decisions about the pregnancy and, if the pregnancy is continued, allow for a
      smooth transition to extrauterine life for the affected infant.

TI  - Postpartum mania in a man with bipolar disorder: case report and a review of the 
      role of sleep loss.
PG  - 93-6
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12156 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to postpartum mood episodes in women with bipolar
      disorder, little is known about the risk of recurrence in men with bipolar
      disorder who have just become fathers. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a man 
      with bipolar disorder who had a manic episode immediately after becoming a
      father. His spouse had a normal pregnancy, and delivery started during daytime
      and lasted until the early morning hours. The patient subsequently developed a
      manic episode, which had a major impact on the family. CONCLUSIONS: There is a
      well-known relationship between sleep loss and the occurrence of a manic episode.
      The study of psychopathology in the postpartum period in relation to sleep
      disturbance refers mainly to women. Disturbance of sleep patterns in the
      perinatal and postpartum period may also negatively impact the course of bipolar 
      disorder in the father. In cases of pregnancy of a male bipolar disorder
      patient's spouse, preventive strategies for the postpartum period should be
      planned in advance.

TI  - Depression and anxiety trajectories among women who undergo an elective cesarean 
      section.
PG  - e86653
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0086653 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are important mood changes in childbearing
      women. However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo 
      an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to
      characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of
      co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety
      courses. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N =
      139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were
      respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State
      Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6
      months postpartum. RESULTS: Group-based modeling identified three distinct
      trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%),
      and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were
      identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%),
      and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were 
      the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly
      related to anxiety trajectories (p<0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory
      included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.1 approximately 6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI:
      1.4 approximately 7.3) in the third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Distinctive
      trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were
      identified. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to continuous
      assessment of psychological well-being among women who undergo an elective CS.

TI  - Risk factors for cervical cancer in rural areas of Wuhan China: a matched
      case-control study.
PG  - 7595-600
AB  - Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem in developing countries. We
      investigated possible risk factors for cervical cancer in rural areas of Wuhan
      China using a matched case-control study with 33 women diagnosed with cervical
      cancer and 132 healthy women selected from the same area as matched controls. A
      questionnaire, which included questions about general demography conditions,
      environmental and genetic factors, the first sexual intercourse, first marriage
      age, age at first pregnancy, pregnancy first child's age, female personal health 
      history, social psychological factors, dietary habits, smoking and alcohol status
      and other living habits was presented to all participants. At the same time, HPV 
      infection of every participant was examined in laboratory testing. Results showed
      HPV infection (P<0.000, OR=23.4) and pregnancy first child's age (P<0.000,
      OR=13.1) to be risk factors for cervical cancer. Menopause (P=0.003, OR=0.073)
      was a protective factor against cervical cancer. However, there was no indication
      of associations of environmental (drinking water, insecticide, disinfectant)
      genetic (cancer family history), or life-style factors (smoking status, alcohol
      status, physical training, sleep quality), including dietary habits (intake of
      fruit and vegetable, meat, fried food, bean products and pickled food) or social 
      psychological factors with cervical cancer. The results suggest that the risk of 
      cervical cancer in Chinese rural women may be associated with HPV infection,
      menopause and the pregnancy first child's age.

TI  - Reduction in ultrasonic vocalizations in pups born to rapid eye movement sleep
      restricted mothers in rat model.
PG  - e84948
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0084948 [doi]
AB  - The effects of rapid eye movement sleep restriction (REMSR) in rats during late
      pregnancy were studied on the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) made by the pups.
      USVs are distress calls inaudible to human ears. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
      was restricted in one group of pregnant rats for 22 hours, starting from
      gestational day 14 to 20, using standard single platform method. The USVs of male
      pups were recorded after a brief isolation from their mother for two minutes on
      alternate post-natal days, from day one till weaning. The USVs were recorded
      using microphones and were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using SASPro
      software. Control pups produced maximum vocalization on post-natal days 9 to 11. 
      In comparison, the pups born to REMSR mothers showed not only a reduction in
      vocalization but also a delay in peak call making days. The experimental group
      showed variations in the types and characteristics of call types, and alteration 
      in temporal profile. The blunting of distress call making response in these pups 
      indicates that maternal sleep plays a role in regulating the neural development
      involved in vocalizations and possibly in shaping the emotional behaviour in
      neonates. It is suggested that the reduced ultrasonic vocalizations can be
      utilized as a reliable early marker for affective state in rat pups. Such
      impaired vocalization responses could provide an important lead in understanding 
      mother-child bonding for an optimal cognitive development during post-partum
      life. This is the first report showing a potential link between maternal REM
      sleep deprivation and the vocalization in neonates and infants.

TI  - Snoring during pregnancy and its relation to sleepiness and pregnancy outcome - a
      prospective study.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-14-15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of snoring and sleepiness is known to increase during
      pregnancy, and this might impact maternal health and obstetric outcome. However, 
      the association between snoring and sleepiness during pregnancy is not fully
      understood. This study was aimed at investigating the development of snoring
      during pregnancy and prospectively assessing if there is an association between
      snoring and sleepiness or adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, mode 
      of delivery, and fetal complications. METHODS: Consecutively recruited pregnant
      women (n = 500) received a questionnaire concerning snoring and sleep at the 1st 
      and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who had rated their frequency of
      snoring at both occasions (n = 340) were divided into subgroups according to the 
      development of snoring they reported and included in the subsequent analyses.
      Additional medical data were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: The
      frequency of snoring was 7.9% in the 1st trimester and increased to 21.2% in the 
      3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who snored already in early pregnancy had
      significantly higher baseline BMI (p = 0.001) than the women who never snored,
      but snoring was not associated with the magnitude of weight gain during
      pregnancy. Snoring women were more likely to experience edema in late pregnancy
      than the non-snorers. Women who started to snore during pregnancy had higher
      Epworth Sleepiness Scores than the non snorers in both early and late pregnancy. 
      No significant association between obstetric outcome and snoring was found.
      CONCLUSION: Snoring does increase during pregnancy, and this increase is
      associated with sleepiness, higher BMI at the start of pregnancy and higher
      prevalence of edema, but not with weight gain.

PG  - 147-51
LID - 10.1097/01.inf.0000435503.44620.74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequency of pertussis is highly variable from country to country and
      it depends on multiple factors including case definitions and type of
      surveillance systems used. Many countries recently reported an increase of
      pertussis cases especially in infants and adolescents. METHODS: From April 2006
      to March 2011, 15-year-old patients hospitalized with suspected or proven
      pertussis were reported to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Patients with
      >/=14 days of cough plus paroxysms, whooping or post-tussive vomiting fulfilled
      the clinical case definition of pertussis. For laboratory confirmation,
      Bordetella pertussis polymerase chain reaction was offered free of charge.
      RESULTS: Data were available from 159 of 173 reported cases and 130 (90% of them 
      <12 months old) were eligible including 125 laboratory-confirmed B. pertussis
      infections. Rates per 100,000 population were 2.6 (<16 years) and 38.8 (<12
      months), respectively. Most frequent complications were cyanosis (63%) and sleep 
      disturbance (60%); 35 (27%) patients received intensive care and 1 patient died. 
      Source of infection was known in 79 (61%) patients and was mainly a sibling,
      parent or both. Most patients were unimmunized (65%) or incompletely immunized
      (30%). CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of pertussis hospitalization in young infants
      established in this surveillance project and the incomplete pertussis
      immunization status in almost all hospitalized patients require further efforts
      for improvement. In addition, introduction of pertussis immunizations for all
      adolescents (in 2013), young adults (in 2012) and pregnant women (in 2013) in
      Switzerland should increase indirect protection of vulnerable newborns and
      infants too young to be fully immunized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-pregnancy short sleep duration is predictive of gestational
      diabetes and preeclampsia; mechanisms for these associations are unknown. Leptin,
      an adipocyte-derived peptide involved in regulating food intake and energy
      expenditure, may play a role in these observed associations. Given inconsistent
      reports linking short sleep duration with leptin, and absence of studies among
      pregnant women, we examined the association of maternal sleep duration with
      plasma leptin in early pregnancy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included
      830 pregnant women. Plasma leptin was measured in samples collected around 13
      weeks gestation. Sleep duration was categorized as: </=5, 6, 7-8 (reference), and
      >/=9 hours. Differences in leptin concentrations across categories were estimated
      using linear regression. Analyses were completed for lean and overweight/obese
      women. RESULTS: Overall, women with long sleep duration had elevated plasma
      leptin (p-value = 0.04). However, leptin concentrations were not statistically
      significantly elevated in women with a short sleep duration. There was no
      association of leptin with sleep duration among lean women. Among
      overweight/obese women, a U-shaped relation between leptin and sleep duration was
      observed: Mean leptin was elevated (beta = 21.96 ng/ml, P < 0.001) among women
      reporting </=5 hour of sleep compared with reference group; and women reporting
      >/=9 hours of sleep also had elevated leptin (beta = 4.29 ng/ml, P = 0.09).
      CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep duration, and to a lesser extent long sleep duration,
      were associated with elevated leptin among overweight/obese women. These data add
      some evidence to help understand mechanistic relationships of sleep duration with
      pregnancy complications.

      and maternal hyperglycemia.
PG  - 459
LID - 10.1007/s11892-013-0459-8 [doi]
AB  - This paper reviews recent work investigating the influence of sleep disturbances 
      on maternal hyperglycemia, particularly gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The 
      incidence and prevalence of hyperglycemia are increasing worldwide, which is
      cause for concern because GDM and even mild hyperglycemia are associated with
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. A better understanding of sleep-related risk factors 
      for maternal hyperglycemia is an important health matter. Evidence demonstrates
      associations between sleep disturbances, especially sleep-disordered breathing,
      and hyperglycemia, but causal effects and the underlying mechanisms linking these
      conditions have not been fully elucidated. Subjective sleep assessments show
      associations between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There are,
      however, few studies using objective measures to support these findings. Large
      prospective studies are required to examine causal relationships between sleep
      disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There is also a need for smaller
      mechanistic studies to understand the pathophysiology. Furthermore,
      interventional studies are required to address whether improvement of sleep
      parameters can prevent/decrease the risk of developing maternal hyperglycemia.
      Taken together, the data suggests that sleep disturbances during pregnancy are
      important to identify and manage in order to minimize maternal hyperglycemia and 
      GDM, and improve maternal and fetal well-being.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between
      neck circumference (NC) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in the third
      trimester pregnant women. METHODS: The study included 126 women who were in the
      third trimester pregnancy. All subjects completed a standard sleep questionnaire,
      anthropometric measurements and ultrasonic testing. RESULTS: Pregnant women with 
      NC >/=34.7 cm had significantly higher frequency of PIH than pregnant women with 
      NC <34.7 cm (35.6% versus 2.5%, chi(2 )= 25.863, p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The
      increase of NC was independent risk factor for PIH in the third trimester
      pregnant women.

PG  - 390-5
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000085 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects
      cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the
      proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation
      in critically ill neonates. METHODS: Newborn infants (>/=35 weeks gestation) who 
      required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to
      12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake
      states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the
      EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination
      (Thompson) scores were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-eight infants participated
      (mean gestational age 39.0 +/- 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep
      correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho = 0.54, p =
      0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p > 0.1). Higher state
      entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho = -0.43, p = 0.023).
      Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies,
      was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These
      findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or
      postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities
      were also related to examination scores. CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill
      neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded
      sleep-including analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentation-showed
      associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may
      add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of
      critically ill neonates.

TI  - Triggers of spontaneous preterm delivery--why today?
PG  - 79-87
LID - 10.1111/ppe.12105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our goal is to study the triggers of spontaneous preterm delivery
      using a case-crossover design. METHODS: In a pilot study, we enrolled 50 women
      with spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) and 50 with preterm premature rupture of
      membranes (PPROM) between 2011 and 2012. To assess non-transient risk factors, we
      also enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal
      care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time
      was defined as the onset of PTL/PPROM (for cases) or interview (for controls).
      Detailed data were collected through structured interviews regarding factors of
      interest during the 72 h that preceded the index time. Within case subjects, we
      compared the frequency of transient factors from 0 to 24 h before index time with
      that from 48 to 72 h before index time, and estimated matched odds ratios (OR)
      and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Previously hypothesised chronic risk 
      factors for spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful 
      events, were more common among cases than among controls. Within cases, skipped
      meals [OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2, 15.2], disturbed sleep [OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5, 13.3],
      sexual activity [OR 6.0, 95% CI 0.7, 69.8], and intake of spicy foods [OR 7.0,
      95% CI 1.6, 30.8] were associated with an increased risk for PTL/PPROM within the
      subsequent 24 h. For physical exertion and other potential risk factors
      evaluated, the OR was close to the null. CONCLUSION: Skipping meals and disturbed
      sleep may be associated with imminent PTL/PPROM; sexual activity and spicy food
      may trigger PTL/PPROM in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies will be
      able to evaluate the impact of modifiable risk factors and acute predictors of
      PTL/PPROM, and might help guide obstetrical management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a high-risk
      cohort. STUDY DESIGN: This was a planned analysis of a prospective cohort
      designed to estimate the prevalence and trends of SDB in high-risk pregnant
      women. We recruited women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or greater,
      chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin 
      gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and
      again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index of 5 or 
      greater and further grouped into severity categories: mild SDB (5-14.9), moderate
      SDB (15-29.9), and severe SDB (>/=30). Pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia,
      gestational diabetes, preterm birth, infant weight) were abstracted by physicians
      blinded to the SDB results. RESULTS: Of the 188 women with a valid early
      pregnancy sleep study, 182 had complete delivery records. There was no
      relationship demonstrated between SDB exposure in early or late pregnancy and
      preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age
      (<5%), or large-for-gestational-age (>95%) neonates. Conversely, SDB severity in 
      early pregnancy was associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes
      (no SDB, 25%; mild SDB, 43%; moderate/severe SDB, 63%; P = .03). The adjusted
      odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes for moderate/severe SDB was 3.6
      (0.6, 21.8). CONCLUSION: This study suggests a dose-dependent relationship
      between SDB in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational
      diabetes. In contrast, no relationships between SDB during pregnancy and
      preeclampsia, preterm birth, and extremes of birthweight were demonstrated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Poor sleep quality in pregnancy is frequent. A treatment with
      sedatives is problematic due to possible adverse effects for mother and
      embryo/foetus. In the present study, we investigated the sedative effect of
      Bryophyllum pinnatum, a phytotherapeutic medication used in anthroposophic
      medicine. In previous clinical studies on its tocolytic effect, B. pinnatum
      showed a good risk/benefit ratio for mother and child. A recent analysis of the
      prescribing pattern for B. pinnatum in a network of anthroposophic physicians
      revealed sleep disorders as one of the most frequent diagnoses for which these
      preparations are prescribed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective,
      multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women suffering from sleep problems
      were treated with B. pinnatum (350mg tablets, 50% leaf press juice, Weleda AG,
      Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration). Sleep quality, daily sleepiness 
      and fatigue were assessed with the aid of standardised questionnaires, at the
      beginning of the treatment and after 2 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions
      perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. RESULTS: The number
      of wake-ups, as well as the subjective quality of sleep was significantly
      improved at the end of the treatment with B. pinnatum. The Epworth Sleeping Scale
      decreased, indicating a decrease of the tiredness during the day. There was,
      however, no evidence for prolongation of the sleep duration, reduction in the
      time to fall asleep, as well as change in the Fatigue Severity Scale after B.
      pinnatum. No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. CONCLUSION: B.
      pinnatum is a suitable treatment of sleep problems in pregnancy. The data of this
      study encourage further clinical investigations on the use of B. pinnatum in
      sleep disorders.

TI  - Eating Disorders, Pregnancy, and the Postpartum Period: Findings from the
      Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).
PG  - 51-62
AB  - This review summarizes studies on eating disorders in pregnancy and the
      postpartum period that have been conducted as part of the broader Norwegian
      Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Prior to the 2000s, empirical literature on
      eating disorders in pregnancy was sparse and consisted mostly of studies in small
      clinical samples. MoBa has contributed to a new era of research by making
      population-based and large-sample research possible. To date, MoBa has led to 19 
      studies on diverse questions including the prevalence, course, and risk
      correlates of eating disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum. The
      associations between eating disorder exposure and pregnancy, birth and obstetric 
      outcomes, and maternal and offspring health and well-being, have also been areas 
      of focus. The findings indicate that eating disorders in pregnancy are relatively
      common and appear to confer health risks to mother and her child related to
      sleep, birth outcomes, maternal nutrition, and child feeding and eating.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify quantitative MEG indices of spontaneous brain activity for
      fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies and examine the effect of
      fetal state on these indices. METHODS: Spontaneous MEG brain activity was
      examined in 22 low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from
      30 to 37 weeks. As major quantitative characteristics of spontaneous activity,
      burst duration (BD) and interburst interval (IBI) were studied in correlation
      with GA and fetal state. RESULTS: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age
      (-0.21 s/week, P=0.0031). This trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep
      state. With respect to BD, no significant trends were detected with GA and state.
      CONCLUSION: IBI can be quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter. The
      decrease in IBI over gestation was similar to the trend reported in the preterm
      neonatal EEG studies. Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such MEG
      maturational indices. SIGNIFICANCE: With further investigation, indices extracted
      from spontaneous fetal brain activity may serve as an early warning for fetal
      neurological distress.

TI  - Sleep and pregnancy-induced hypertension: a possible target for intervention?
PG  - 1349-56
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3290 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbances in the general population are associated with elevated blood
      pressure. This may be due to several mechanisms, including sympathetic activation
      and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbance. Elevated blood
      pressure in pregnancy can have devastating effects on both maternal and fetal
      health and is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia and poor delivery
      outcomes. Preliminary evidence suggests that mechanisms linking sleep and blood
      pressure in the general population may also hold in the pregnant population.
      However, the effects of disturbed sleep on physiologic mechanisms that may
      directly influence blood pressure in pregnancy have not been well studied. The
      role that sleep disturbance plays in gestational blood pressure elevation and its
      subsequent consequences warrant further investigation. This review evaluates the 
      current literature on sleep disturbance and elevated blood pressure in pregnancy 
      and proposes possible treatment interventions.

TI  - Does tongue size contribute to risk of airway narrowing in preterm infants
      sitting in a car safety seat?
PG  - 741-4
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1358769 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while
      restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants
      are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect
      relatively smaller tongue size. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed previously
      reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm
      infants ready for discharge (32.6 +/- 1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8 +/- 
      9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an
      insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when
      the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an
      index of relative tongue size. RESULTS: A smaller airspace around the tongue
      (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper
      airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (p < 0.002). In contrast, there 
      was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway 
      size (r (2) = 0.16, p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: The present study supports the
      hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while 
      restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size.

TI  - Adverse circulatory effects of passive smoking during infancy: surprisingly
      strong, manifest early, easily avoided.
PG  - 386-92
LID - 10.1111/apa.12538 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To compare blood pressure reactions (BPR) of infants to mild stress for
      evidence of adverse cardiovascular effects of passive exposure to tobacco smoke
      during pregnancy and early infancy. METHODS: An observational field study
      conducted in Crete. We compared 4- to 6-month olds of lifelong nonsmokers
      minimally (controls, n = 9) or frequently exposed to tobacco smoke (passive
      smokers; n = 10) with those born to habitual smokers (n = 6). Smoke exposure was 
      verified biochemically (urine cotinine each trimester and at study). We recorded 
      beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) during brief repositioning manoeuvres performed 
      during a daytime nap and analysed BPR (% change in BP during head-up tilt) for
      associations with maternal and infant cotinine. RESULTS: We observed a 20-fold
      difference between BPR of infants of controls versus passive smokers -
      exceptional given number of infants (alpha error/confidence level <10% i.e. power
      >90%). The BPR declined linearly as the infant's (but not mother's) cotinine
      level rose (p = 0.04), indicating abnormal BPR was caused mainly by postnatal
      smoke exposure. Infants of active smokers differed from those of passive smokers.
      CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular effects of passive smoking by a newborn infant
      manifest early on and are exceptionally strong. They can be largely avoided by
      keeping the home smoke rigorously free.

TI  - Respiratory viral infections in pregnant women with asthma are associated with
      wheezing in the first 12 months of life.
PG  - 151-8
LID - 10.1111/pai.12156 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few studies investigating the relationship between
      respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and asthma in the offspring, and none
      among mothers with asthma. Infants of mothers with asthma are more likely to
      wheeze and have a higher risk of developing asthma than infants of non-asthmatic 
      mothers. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of viral infection in pregnancy was 
      conducted between 2007 and 2009, and a subgroup of infants of mothers with asthma
      was followed up at 6 and 12 months of age. During common colds, nasal and throat 
      swabs were collected from mothers and respiratory viruses detected by polymerase 
      chain reaction. Respiratory health of infants was assessed by parent-completed
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Twelve-month-old infants whose mothers had confirmed
      viral infections in pregnancy (n = 26) reported more frequent wheeze (40% had
      4-12 wheeze attacks compared with 0%), sleep disturbed by wheeze (1 night per
      week or more in 60% vs. 11%), beta agonist treatment for wheeze (27% vs. 0%),
      prolonged colds (2 wk or longer 31% vs. 0%), more eczema (40% vs. 6.3%), and
      parent-perceived asthma (32% vs. 0%), compared with infants whose mothers had
      common colds without laboratory-confirmed viral infection (n = 16). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study demonstrates a relationship between maternal respiratory viral
      infection in pregnancy and wheezing illness in infants of mothers with asthma.
      Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in pregnancy, 
      and infants of asthmatic mothers are at increased risk of asthma themselves.
      Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.

AB  - This review includes six recent and influential papers that have appeared in the 
      three leading psychiatry journals from the Arab region. The first paper examined 
      the role of personality profile in the motivation to quit smoking and concluded
      that there is a positive correlation between Novelty seeking (NS), Persistence
      (P), Cooperativeness (C) and motivation to quit smoking. The second study
      discussed the prevalence of abuse history in patients with schizophrenia whether 
      physical or sexual, and its impact on their condition and function. The third
      paper reported that patients with substance abuse problem show more risky sexual 
      behaviors than normal controls. The fourth study high-lighted the similarities
      regarding complaints about sleep and polysomnographic changes in depression
      patients and somatoform disorder patients. The fifth paper, investigated the
      prenatal and perinatal risk factors in autistic disorders. The sixth and final
      article concluded that poor levels of maternal fetal attachment during the course
      of pregnancy should be managed in order to optimize fetal and maternal health.
      Overall, the papers describe a wide spectrum of research initiatives in the Arab 
      world that are likely to have implications for global mental health.

TI  - Postnatal parental education for optimizing infant general health and
      parent-infant relationships.
PG  - CD004068

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is
      important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for
      their newborns during this time. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess 
      the effects of structured postnatal education delivered to an individual or group
      related to infant general health or care and parent-infant relationships. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials
      Register (31 March 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled
      trials of any structured postnatal education provided to individual parents or
      groups of parents within the first two months post-birth related to the health or
      care of an infant or parent-infant relationships. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
      Two review authors (JB, CTB) assessed trial quality and extracted data from
      published reports. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 27 trials (3949 mothers and 579 fathers) 
      that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) reported 
      useable data. Educational interventions included: five on infant sleep
      enhancement, 12 on infant behaviour, three on general post-birth health, three on
      general infant care, and four on infant safety. Details of the randomization
      procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not
      reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only 13 were measured similarly enough by
      more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these 13 meta-analyses,
      only four were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an
      overall estimate of effect. Education about sleep enhancement resulted in a mean 
      difference of 29 more night-time minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours at six weeks
      of age (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. However, it
      had no significant effect on the mean difference in minutes of crying time in 24 
      hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age. Education related to infant behaviour
      increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85
      points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of educational
      programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education related to 
      sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep but appears to have no effect 
      on infant crying time. Education about infant behaviour potentially enhances
      mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to 
      confirm these findings.

TI  - Maternal blood pressure and dominant sleeping position may affect placental
      localization.
PG  - 1564-7
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2013.870547 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether maternal socio-demographic and
      clinical characteristics influence the site of placental implantation so that
      placental localization and associated abnormalities can be predicted. METHODS:
      This study reviews 500 healthy women with singleton pregnancy that were
      consecutively admitted to the study center and eventually delivered healthy
      newborns. RESULTS: The most frequently observed sites of placentation were
      anterior uterine wall (53.2%), posterior uterine wall (28.8%), lateral uterine
      walls (10.0%) and uterine fundus (8.0%), respectively. The women with fundal
      placentation had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p =
      0.044 and p = 0.040, respectively). Supine sleeping position was more frequent in
      women with anterior placenta and (OR: 11.568, 95% CI: 2.720-49.193) and prone
      sleeping position was more frequent in women with posterior placenta (OR: 15.449,
      95% CI: 2.151-52.978) (p = 0.001). The women who favored to sleep in right
      lateral position were more likely to have lateral placentation, while the women
      who used to sleep in left lateral position were more likely to have fundal
      placentation (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sleeping position in early pregnancy may
      influence placental implantation site. The probable mechanism may refer to the
      alterations in uterine perfusion which is induced by the change in systemic blood
      pressure and dominant sleeping position.

TI  - Awareness, ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets in Abavo
      community of Delta State.
PG  - 326-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite free distribution of insecticide treated nets in Nigeria, the
      use it as a means of malaria prevention and control has not been fuIly embraced. 
      AIM: The aim of this survey was to determine the level of awareness, ownership
      and utilization of insecticide treated nets among residents of Abavo community,
      Delta State Nigeria METHOD: It is a descriptive cross-sectional survey conducted 
      among 250 heads of households. RESULT: One hundred and seventy five (70%)
      respondents were aware of insecticide treated net as a means of prevention
      against malaria, 111 (44%) claimed to own insecticide treated nets. On further
      inspection of houses of those who claimed to own ITNs, seventy four (66%)
      actually had theirs hanged, the rest were either in their packs or not seen.
      Ninety five (38%) respondents out of the total sleep under insecticide treated
      net. About 92 (70%) households having under-five and 39 (81.3%) of households
      having pregnant women claim to use ITNs. It was observed that the level of
      education (chi2 = 48.35, p = 0.001), presence of under 5 children in a household 
      ?2 = 7.229, p = 0.027) influenced ownership of Insecticide treated nets. In
      conclusion despite a high level of awareness about ITN found in this survey,
      ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets were low.

TI  - Effect of magnesium therapy on nocturnal leg cramps: a systematic review of
      randomized controlled trials with meta-analysis using simulations.
PG  - 7-19
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmt065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are common in primary care
      and may cause severe pain and sleep disturbance. We systematically reviewed the
      effectiveness of magnesium in treating NLC and the side-effect profile of
      magnesium compared to placebo. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane
      Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomised Controlled
      Trial Number and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registries
      until August 2012. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing magnesium
      therapy for NLC in adults with any other comparator were eligible. Two
      investigators independently selected, extracted data from and rated the risk of
      bias of relevant studies. To compensate for the heterogeneity in outcome
      measures, simulations were used to summarize the data. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were
      included in the review (n = 361), all comparing magnesium to placebo. Three of
      these trials included only pregnant women. The difference in the median number of
      leg cramps per week between the placebo and the intervention groups was 0.345
      (quantile 2.5%: -0.133, quantile 97.5%: 0.875). This difference was 0.807
      (quantile 2.5%: 0.015, quantile 97.5%: 1.207) in the three studies involving only
      pregnant women and 0.362 (quantile 2.5%: -0.386, quantile 97.5%: 1.148) in the
      others. Overall gastrointestinal side effects were slightly more common with
      magnesium therapy than with placebo. The strength of this evidence was weak,
      mainly due to small study sizes and short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium
      therapy does not appear to be effective in the treatment of NLC in the general
      population, but may have a small effect in pregnant women. Further research using
      better designed RCTs is necessary.

TI  - CASK-Related Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: CASK-related disorders include a spectrum of phenotypes
      in both females and males. The two main types of clinical presentation are:
      Microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), generally
      associated with pathogenic loss-of-function variants in CASK; and X-linked
      intellectual disability (XLID) with or without nystagmus, generally associated
      with hypomorphic CASK pathogenic variants. MICPCH is typically seen in females
      with moderate to severe intellectual disability, progressive microcephaly with or
      without ophthalmologic anomalies, and sensorineural hearing loss. To date a total
      of 53 females with MICPCH have been reported, the eldest of whom is 21 years old.
      Most are able to sit independently; 20%-25% attain the ability to walk; language 
      is nearly absent in most. Neurologic features may include axial hypotonia,
      hypertonia/spasticity of the extremities, and dystonia or other movement
      disorders. Nearly 40% have seizures. Behaviors may include sleep disturbances,
      hand stereotypies, and self-biting. To date, only seven males have been reported 
      with the severe phenotype. The under-representation in this cohort is likely to
      be a consequence of early male lethality. These males typically present with
      intellectual disability and MICPCH, or early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy
      (Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, or early myoclonic epilepsy). In individuals
      and families with milder (i.e., hypomorphic) pathogenic variants, the clinical
      phenotype is usually that of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) with or
      without nystagmus and additional clinical features. More than 24 males and nine
      females have been reported. The males have mild to severe intellectual
      disability, with or without nystagmus and other ocular features. Females are
      typically normal, with some displaying mild intellectual disability with or
      without ocular features. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of a CASK-related
      disorder is established in a female who is heterozygous for a CASK pathogenic
      variant and in a male who is hemizygous for a CASK pathogenic variant. Molecular 
      genetic testing can be performed as single gene testing or as part of a multigene
      panel. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and
      includes nutritional support, treatment of hearing loss, and use of
      physiotherapy. Management of seizures in children with MICPCH is standard
      treatment and based on the specific seizure type and frequency. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: CASK-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. MICPCH
      phenotype: Most affected females and males are simplex cases (i.e., the only
      affected family member) resulting from a de novo CASK pathogenic variant. Because
      heterozygous females manifest the phenotype, a phenotypically normal mother is
      unlikely to have the CASK pathogenic variant. Note: It is possible (though
      unlikely) that one parent of an affected individual will have germline mosaicism 
      (or germline and somatic mosaicism), which would place male and female sibs at
      risk (when the mother has mosaicism) or female sibs only at risk (when the father
      has mosaicism). XLID phenotype: The father of an affected male will not have the 
      disease or the CASK pathogenic variant. In a family with more than one affected
      individual, the mother of an affected male is likely to be an obligate
      heterozygote and may be variably affected. For all CASK-related disorders: The
      risk to the sibs of a proband depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the
      mother is heterozygous for the CASK pathogenic variant, the chance of
      transmitting the variant in each pregnancy is 50%; sons who inherit the
      pathogenic variant will be affected; daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant
      will be unaffected or affected to a variable degree. Carrier testing for at-risk 
      relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if 
      the pathogenic variant in the family has been identified.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in
      pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a
      psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for
      understanding women's fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention 
      to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the
      psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue
      Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women. METHODS: The study 
      was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination
      of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A
      convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a
      fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of
      pregnancy and within three months postpartum. RESULTS: The C-LFS-SF showed
      satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha>/=.97) and stability over the
      7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient>.87). Exploratory
      factor analysis showed that 88-94% of the total variance was explained by the
      one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and
      actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct
      validity. CONCLUSIONS: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and 
      is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine
      prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more
      diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk
      pregnancies or with medical conditions.

LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2012-202718 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are common among pregnant
      women, and several studies link SDB symptoms with gestational hypertension and
      preeclampsia. However, few prospective studies objectively measuring SDB during
      pregnancy have been performed. OBJECTIVES: We performed a prospective cohort
      study examining risk factors for third trimester SDB in pregnant women.
      MEASUREMENTS AND METHODS: 105 pregnant women from the Hospital of the University 
      of Pennsylvania obstetrics practices completed first and third trimester
      overnight polysomnography studies. We examined whether the number of SDB events
      per hour of sleep increased during pregnancy. We performed unadjusted and
      multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate the effects of usual and
      pregnancy-specific characteristics on development of third trimester obstructive 
      sleep apnoea (OSA). In secondary analyses, we examined the relationship between
      objectively measured SDB, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and other adverse 
      maternal-fetal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Mean Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index increased from
      2.07 (SD 3.01) events/h at baseline (first trimester) to 3.74 (SD 5.97) in the
      third trimester (p=0.009). 10.5% of women had OSA in the first trimester. By the 
      third trimester, 26.7% of women had OSA. In multivariable analyses, first
      trimester body mass index (BMI) and maternal age were significantly associated
      with third trimester OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Third trimester OSA is common. Risk
      factors for third trimester OSA among women without baseline SDB include higher
      baseline BMI and maternal age.

AB  - Night shift work has been thought to play a role in the etiology of chronic
      diseases through a disruption of the circadian rhythm, decreased synthesis of
      melatonin and sleep deprivation. Our aim was to review the epidemiological
      studies on the association between night shift work and some pathologies in
      nurses and midwives. We reviewed publications available in the MEDLINE database
      and published before June 2012, describing the cross-sectional (almost two thirds
      of all papers) and cohort studies. In total, we identified 26 original papers,
      including 5 epidemiological studies addressing diseases or disorders of the
      digestive system, 3--metabolic syndrome, 2--type 2 diabetes, 9--cardiovascular
      diseases and (CVD risk factors, 5--obesity/overweight, 2--menstrual disorders and
      3--poor pregnancy outcomes. The analysis of the literature indicates that night
      shift work of nurses and midwives is most strongly associated with a higher risk 
      ofobesity/overweight. In each of the five studies, which we identified this
      association was observed (confirmed by the statistical significance of the
      results), also after adjustment for confounders. The results for type 2 diabetes 
      and disorders of the menstrual cycle are also suggestive. Epidemiological data on
      the other disorders or pathologies discussed in this article seem to be less
      certain - their results are inconsistent or their number is too small to draw
      definite conclusions. Further epidemiological studies of nurses and midwives
      working on night shifts and prospective observations in particular are
      recommended to find out whether potential association between the night work and 
      discussed health issues is causal.

AB  - Alteration in the HPA axis is a robust biomarker of anxiety and depression in
      adults, but questions remain about this association in pregnancy. We examined the
      longitudinal links between diurnal cortisol and mood symptoms from self-report
      questionnaire and diagnostic interview in an ethnically diverse, psychosocially
      at-risk sample of 101 women at mid-pregnancy and early third trimester. There
      were modest but significant associations between depression and elevated
      cortisol, indexed by a decreased morning level and diminished diurnal decline;
      the effects were strongest for diagnostic data from clinical interview. These
      effects were independent of socio-demographic factors and sleep disturbance.
      Associations with anxiety and trauma were generally non-significant. These
      findings extend prior work by showing that significant mood symptoms in pregnancy
      are associated with altered diurnal cortisol in pregnancy, which may have
      implications for maternal and child health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured
      nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally
      examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap
      frequency on maternal glycemic control. METHODS: Sixty-three urban, low-income,
      pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in
      mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with
      1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to
      evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia,
      defined as 1-h OGTT values >/=130 mg/dL. RESULTS: Mean nighttime sleep duration
      was 6.9+/-0.9 h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r=-0.28,
      P=.03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after
      controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.2 [95%
      confidence interval {CI}, 0.1-0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep 
      duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS:
      Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter
      nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia.
      Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep
      findings.

TI  - Maternal immune activation increases the corticosterone response to acute stress 
      without affecting the hypothalamic monoamine content and sleep patterns in male
      mice offspring.
PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.1159/000355466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Early life experiences are homeostatic determinants for adult
      organisms. We evaluated the impact of prenatal immune activation during late
      gestation on the neuroimmune-endocrine function of adult offspring and its
      interaction with acute stress. METHODS: Pregnant Swiss mice received saline or
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 17. Adult male offspring were
      assigned to the control or restraint stress condition. We analyzed plasmatic
      corticosterone and catecholamine levels, the monoamine content in the
      hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex, and the sleep-wake cycle before and
      after acute restraint stress. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Offspring from LPS-treated 
      dams had increased baseline norepinephrine levels and potentiated corticosterone 
      secretion after the acute stressor, and no effect was observed on hypothalamic
      monoamine content or sleep behavior. The offspring of immune-activated dams
      exhibited impairments in stress-induced serotonergic and dopaminergic alterations
      in the striatum and frontal cortex. The data demonstrate a distinction between
      the plasmatic levels of corticosterone in response to acute stress and the
      hypothalamic monoamine content and sleep patterns. We provide new evidence
      regarding the influence of immune activation during late gestation on the
      neuroendocrine homeostasis of offspring.

TI  - Snoring during pregnancy and delivery outcomes: a cohort study.
PG  - 1625-32
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3112 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key
      delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and
      small-for-gestational age. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: A large tertiary
      medical center. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women in their third trimester
      were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered 
      breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and
      birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual 
      snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After
      adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with
      small-forgestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective
      cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring 
      was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P =
      0.001). CONCLUSION: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for
      adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational
      age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early
      opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes. CLINICAL TRIALS

PG  - 612-22
LID - 10.1002/nur.21568 [doi]
AB  - We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during 
      the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean
      deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed
      sleep-related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap
      duration and 24-hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration
      in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy-derived nor self-reported
      sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). 
      Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that
      studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a
      consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep.

AB  - We tested if the risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with PTSD symptoms was 
      dependent on comorbid sleep disturbance. Our cross-sectional sample included 2465
      participants with complete data from the 21 year follow-up of the Mater
      University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a birth cohort study of young Australians. 
      Using structural equation modelling with indirect pathways we found that 12 month
      PTSD symptoms did not directly predict suicidal ideation at 21 when adjusting for
      major depression symptoms, polyvictimization and gender. However, PTSD symptoms
      had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via past-month sleep disturbance. Our
      results suggest that increased suicidal ideation in those with PTSD may result
      from the fact that PTSD sufferers often exhibit other comorbid psychiatric
      conditions which are themselves known to predict suicidal behaviours. Sleep
      disturbance may be targeted in those who experience PTSD to help prevent suicidal
      ideation.

TI  - Freezing the biological clock: a viable fertility preservation option for young
      Singapore women?
PG  - 472-7
AB  - In March 2012, an article in The Straits Times entitled 'Freezing eggs could
      reverse falling birth rate' suggested that employing the latest oocyte
      cryopreservation techniques could both foster individual women's reproductive
      autonomy and impact Singapore's fertility rate, which in recent years has
      consistently been among the world's lowest. The article cited both local and
      international fertility specialists' approval of elective oocyte cryopreservation
      for young women wishing to protect their reproductive potential against ageing
      and as a potential antidote to the contemporary 'delay and defer' model of
      family-building. Later in 2012, the Ministry of Health announced a review of
      oocyte cryopreservation policy taking into account related medical, scientific
      and ethical issues, while the Singapore College of Obstetricians and
      Gynaecologists endorsed oocyte cryopreservation as an "important, safe and
      efficient technology". This paper outlines and analyses the arguments and
      empirical evidence used both to support and oppose offering elective oocyte
      cryopreservation as a routine fertility service, before concluding that this
      remains unjustifiable on the basis of insufficient evidence of its clinical
      efficacy and safety as regards either pregnancy rates or birth outcomes. If it is
      to be made available at all for these reasons in Singapore, it should be
      subjected to rigorous clinic-specific evaluation in accordance with accepted
      clinical and ethical norms.

TI  - GLB1-Related Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: GLB1-related disorders comprise two phenotypically
      distinct lysosomal storage disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis and
      mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (MPS IVB). GM1 gangliosidosis includes phenotypes 
      that range from severe to mild. Type I (infantile) begins before age one year;
      progressive central nervous system dysfunction leads to spasticity, deafness,
      blindness, and decerebrate rigidity. Life expectancy is two to three years. Type 
      II can be subdivided into the late-infantile form and juvenile form. Type II,
      late-infantile form begins between ages one and three years; life expectancy is
      five to ten years. Type II, juvenile form begins between ages three and ten years
      with insidious plateauing of motor and cognitive development followed by slow
      regression. Type II may or may not include skeletal dysplasia. Type III begins in
      the second to third decade with extrapyramidal signs, gait disturbance, and
      cardiomyopathy; and can be misidentified as Parkinson disease. Intellectual
      impairment is common late in the disease; skeletal involvement includes short
      stature, kyphosis, and scoliosis of varying severity. MPS IVB is characterized by
      skeletal changes, including short stature and skeletal dysplasia. Affected
      children have no distinctive clinical findings at birth. The severe form is
      usually apparent between ages one and three years, and the attenuated form in
      late childhood or adolescence. In addition to skeletal involvement, significant
      morbidity can result from respiratory compromise, obstructive sleep apnea,
      valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, corneal clouding, and spinal cord
      compression. Intellect is normal unless spinal cord compression leads to central 
      nervous system compromise. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of GLB1-related
      disorders is suspected in individuals with characteristic clinical, neuroimaging,
      radiographic, and biochemical findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by either
      deficiency of beta-galactosidase enzyme activity or biallelic pathogenic variants
      in GLB1. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Best provided by specialists in
      biochemical genetics, cardiology, orthopedics, and neurology and therapists
      knowledgeable about GLB1-related disorders; surgery is best performed in centers 
      with surgeons and anesthesiologists experienced in the care of individuals with
      lysosomal storage disorders; occupational therapy to optimize activities of daily
      living (including adaptive equipment) and physical therapy to optimize gait and
      mobility (including orthotics and bracing); early and ongoing interventions to
      optimize educational and social outcomes. For those with GM1 gangliosidosis:
      Adequate nutrition to maintain growth; speech therapy to optimize oral motor
      skills; aggressive seizure control; routine management of risk of aspiration,
      risk of chronic urinary tract infection, and cardiac involvement; when disease is
      advanced: hospice services for supportive in-home care. Prevention of secondary
      complications: Anesthetic precautions to anticipate and manage complications
      relating to skeletal involvement and airway compromise; routine immunization;
      bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in those with cardiac valvular disease.
      Surveillance: GM1 gangliosidosis: Routine monitoring of growth and nutrition.
      Assess yearly: quality of life including history and physical examination;
      seizure risk by a neurologist; cervical spine stability; and hip dislocation
      risk. Perform every one to three years: electrocardiogram and echocardiogram; eye
      examination. MPS IVB: Yearly: perform endurance tests to evaluate functional
      status of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems;
      assess lower extremities for malalignment, hips for dysplasia/subluxation,
      thoracolumbar spine for kyphosis, and cervical spine for instability; perform eye
      examination and audiogram. Perform electrocardiogram and echocardiogram every one
      to three years depending on disease course; assess for obstructive sleep apnea
      and restrictive lung disease; monitor nutritional status using MPS IVA-specific
      growth charts. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Psychotropic medications because of
      the risk of worsening neurologic disease; obesity in those with skeletal
      dysplasia GENETIC COUNSELING: GLB1-related disorders are inherited in an
      autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance
      of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25%
      chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family 
      members and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if 
      the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on
      electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26-34 weeks gestation).
      METHODS: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care
      unit (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized
      controlled trial design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to
      achieve mutual calm and promote communication of affect between infants and their
      mothers throughout the NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants
      during sleep at approximately 35 and approximately 40 weeks postmenstrual age
      (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 frequency bands
      between 1 and 48 Hz in each of 125 electrodes. RESULTS: Near to term age,
      compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG
      power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48 Hz (20% to 36% with
      p-values <0.0004). Effects were significant in both quiet and active sleep,
      regardless of gender, singleton-twin status, gestational age (26-30 or 30-35
      weeks) or birth weight (<1500 or >1500 g). CONCLUSION: FNI leads to increased
      frontal brain activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of
      better neurobehavioral outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: FNI may be a practicable means of 
      improving outcomes in preterm infants.

TI  - Night work and the reproductive health of women: an integrated literature review.
PG  - 113-26
LID - 10.1111/jmwh.12052 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the
      effects of night work on the major stages of women's reproductive health,
      specifically the menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Current
      understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's
      circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. 
      A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive
      hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the
      detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause. METHODS: A
      systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE,
      Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies 
      written in English using the key words "shift-work" and "female/women." Findings 
      of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual 
      cycles, and menopause. RESULTS: Twenty articles were identified, (13 articles
      concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the
      menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified
      articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work
      exposure. DISCUSSION: Evidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive
      health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover,
      available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various
      limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of
      night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on
      night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian
      disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work.

TI  - Melatonin and stable circadian rhythms optimize maternal, placental and fetal
      physiology.
PG  - 293-307
LID - 10.1093/humupd/dmt054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have
      previously-unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs. 
      Likewise, numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms
      are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health. The relationship of
      melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in
      this review. METHODS: Databases were searched for the related published English
      literature up to 15 May 2013. The search terms used in various combinations
      included melatonin, circadian rhythms, biological clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus,
      ovary, pregnancy, uterus, placenta, fetus, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth
      restriction, ischemia-reperfusion, chronodisruption, antioxidants, oxidative
      stress and free radicals. The results of the studies uncovered are summarized
      herein. RESULTS: Both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction,
      especially during pregnancy. Melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct
      free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities. Melatonin is
      produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against
      molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative/nitrosative 
      stress. The placenta, in particular, is often a site of excessive free radical
      generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall, which leads to 
      either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, processes
      that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction. This may
      contribute to pre-eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy.
      Melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in
      experiments using non-human mammals. Likewise, the maintenance of a regular
      maternal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian
      rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker, the
      suprachiasmatic nuclei. Optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important 
      since her circadian clock, either directly or indirectly via the melatonin
      rhythm, programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus. Experimental
      studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms, referred to as
      chronodisruption, and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for
      the maturing fetal oscillators, which may lead to psychological and behavioral
      problems in the newborn. To optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent
      disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy, shift work and bright light
      exposure at night should be avoided, especially during the last trimester of
      pregnancy. Finally, melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the
      fetus. Since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period, 
      the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of
      melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the
      strength of uterine contractions. CONCLUSIONS: A number of conclusions naturally 
      evolve from the data summarized in this review: (i) melatonin, of both pineal and
      placental origin, has essential functions in fetal maturation and
      placenta/uterine homeostasis; (ii) circadian clock genes, which are components of
      all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs, have important
      roles in reproductive and organismal (fetal and maternal) physiology; (iii) due
      to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin, coupled with its virtual absence 
      of toxicity, this indoleamine may have utility in the treatment of pre-eclampsia,
      intrauterine growth restriction, placental and fetal ischemia/reperfusion, etc.
      (iv) the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism
      between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin.

AB  - This study examined the association between measures of objective sleep (OS) and 
      subjective sleep (SS) to postpartum mood in healthy women from the third
      trimester of pregnancy to 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Twenty-nine pregnant women
      completed self-report measures of mood and SS, and wore actigraphs for 7
      continuous days during the third trimester (Time 1), within 15 days (Time 2), and
      10 to 12 weeks postpartum (Time 3). The subjective perception of marked daytime
      dysfunction was associated with low mood during Time 1 and Time 3. Poor nighttime
      SS was related to low mood only at Time 2, whereas poor nighttime OS influenced
      stress during the same assessment time. These data indicate a stronger
      association between postpartum mood and the subjective perception of sleep than
      with OS quality and duration in healthy, non-depressed women, and highlight the
      awareness of poor daytime functioning as a significant contributor to new
      mothers' emotional wellbeing.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome in an appalachian primary care population: prevalence,
      demographic and lifestyle correlates, and burden.
PG  - 1065-75
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3084 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and distressing sensorimotor
      disorder of unknown etiology. While the epidemiology of RLS has been examined in 
      several North American and European studies, research on RLS and RLS burden in
      poor, rural populations, including those residing in Appalachia, remains sparse. 
      In this study, we investigated RLS prevalence in an Appalachian primary care
      population and examined the association of RLS to demographic factors, lifestyle 
      characteristics, sleep quality, and mood disorders. METHODS: Participants of this
      anonymous survey study were community-dwelling adults aged >/= 18 years visiting 
      one of 4 West Virginia primary care clinics. Data gathered included detailed
      information on sleep patterns, demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors,
      and health/medical history; the survey also included questions specific to RLS
      diagnosis and severity. Response rates were excellent, with 68% of eligible
      adults contacted returning completed surveys (N = 1,424/2,087). Pregnant women (N
      = 65) and those with missing data on key variables (N = 142) were excluded from
      the analyses. RESULTS: Of the 1,217 participants included in the final analytic
      sample, 19.6% (18.2% with symptoms at least once/month) met the 4 IRLSSG
      diagnostic criteria in the absence of positional discomfort or leg cramps; 14.5% 
      reported RLS symptoms at least once/week and 10.1% indicated symptoms >/=
      3x/week. Excluding respondents with diabetes, kidney disease, or anemia reduced
      these rates only slightly. Those with RLS were more likely to be older, female,
      lower income, unemployed, disabled, non-Hispanic white, and less likely to be
      college educated than those without RLS. Mood and sleep impairment were
      significantly elevated in those with RLS; after adjustment for demographic and
      lifestyle characteristics, health history, and other factors, those with RLS
      remained significantly more likely to indicate a history of depression (adjusted 
      odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.6) and anxiety (OR =
      1.6, CI 1.1, 2.2), to report sleep impairment both 4 (OR = 2.4, CI 1.6, 3.7) and 
      7 days/week (OR = 1.8, CI 1.3, 2.4), and a mean sleep duration < 5 h/night (OR = 
      1.7, CI 1.2, 2.3). These associations increased in both strength and magnitude
      with increasing symptom frequency (p's for trend </= 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Findings
      of this preliminary anonymous survey study suggest that RLS prevalence is high in
      this Appalachian primary care population and that RLS is associated with
      significant burden in terms of both mood and sleep impairment.

TI  - Melatonin and female reproduction.
PG  - 1-11

AB  - Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is secreted during the dark hours at
      night by the pineal gland. After entering the circulation, melatonin acts as an
      endocrine factor and a chemical messenger of light and darkness. It regulates a
      variety of important central and peripheral actions related to circadian rhythms 
      and reproduction. It also affects the brain, immune, gastrointestinal,
      cardiovascular, renal, bone and endocrine functions and acts as an oncostatic and
      anti-aging molecule. Many of melatonin's actions are mediated through
      interactions with specific membrane-bound receptors expressed not only in the
      central nervous system, but also in peripheral tissues. Melatonin also acts
      through non-receptor-mediated mechanisms, for example serving as a scavenger for 
      reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. At both physiological and 
      pharmacological concentrations, melatonin attenuates and counteracts oxidative
      stress and regulates cellular metabolism. Growing scientific evidence of
      reproductive physiology supports the role of melatonin in human reproduction.
      This review was conducted to investigate the effects of melatonin on female
      reproduction and to summarize our findings in this field.

TI  - Prevalence of sleep deficiency in early gestation and its associations with
      stress and depressive symptoms.
PG  - 1028-37
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2013.4331 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the
      quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women
      since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with 
      morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression 
      and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We
      sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation
      (10-20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more
      depressive symptoms and stress. METHODS: Pregnant women (N=160) with no
      self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via
      diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks'
      gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient
      sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same 
      three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data.
      RESULTS: Approximately 28%-38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one
      time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time
      points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient
      (p<0.01). Depressive symptoms were higher among women with diary-defined sleep
      deficiency across all time points (p=0.02). DISCUSSION: Sleep deficiency is a
      useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women
      with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in 
      psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important
      since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse
      pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Menopause in multiple sclerosis: therapeutic considerations.
PG  - 1257-68
LID - 10.1007/s00415-013-7131-8 [doi]
AB  - While the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) typically occurs during the
      childbearing years, many women living with MS are of perimenopausal age. There is
      frequent overlap between menopausal and MS-related symptoms and co-morbidities
      (e.g. sexual dysfunction, mood disorders and bladder function). Furthermore, some
      MS symptoms may be exacerbated by perimenopausal changes such as hot flashes or
      sleep disturbance. The MS neurologist may frequently be the first to become aware
      of these symptoms and to play a role in monitoring and managing them. In this
      review, we describe immunological and neurologic changes at menopause as they may
      impact MS. We then review common symptoms, including fatigue, depression, sexual 
      function, pain and insomnia, and provide both behavioral and pharmacological
      suggestions for their management. Next, we discuss the need for osteoporosis and 
      cancer screening in perimenopausal women with MS. Finally, we highlight important
      research gaps, including what effect, if any, the menopausal transition may play 
      on MS disease course as well as the potential modulatory role of hormone
      replacement therapies.

TI  - Evaluation of sleep problems in preeclamptic, healthy pregnant and non-pregnant
      women.
PG  - 168-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep problems are common complaints among pregnant women. This study 
      was designed to compare subjective sleep problems in non-pregnancy condition,
      healthy and preeclamptic pregnancy as a major complication of pregnancy. We
      hypothesized that some sleep problems are more prevalent in females with
      preeclampsia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 102 women with
      preeclampsia, 106 healthy pregnant women in the third trimester and 103 healthy
      non-pregnant women were selected through random sampling. Age and parity were
      matched in the three groups. We used Global sleep assessment questionnaire (GSAQ)
      to check the subjective sleep problems, and then we performed statistical
      analysis using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson Chi-square tests.
      RESULTS: Our findings revealed significant differences in initial insomnia (p =
      0.034), fragmented sleep (p = 0.022), snoring (p<0.001), non-idiopathic insomnia 
      (p = 0.045) and sadness and anxiety (p = 0.001) between the three groups. Some
      sleep problems were more common in preeclampctic compared to healthy pregnant
      women including initial insomnia, fragmented sleep, snoring, sleep apnea and
      non-idiopathic insomnia. Moreover, the subjects with preeclampsia revealed more
      fragmented sleep, snoring, sadness and anxiety and lack of getting enough sleep
      due to other activities compared to non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Different
      kinds of sleep problems can occur in subjects with preeclampsia in comparison
      with the non-pregnant and healthy pregnant subjects. Sleep problems should be
      evaluated during pregnancy, particularly in pregnant women with preeclampsia, and
      suitable treatment should be provided for any specific sleep problem.

TI  - A "bottom-up" approach to aetiological research in autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 606
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00606 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are currently diagnosed in the presence of
      impairments in social interaction and communication, and a restricted range of
      activities and interests. However, there is considerable variability in the
      behaviors of different individuals with an ASD diagnosis. The heterogeneity spans
      the entire range of IQ and language abilities, as well as other behavioral,
      communicative, and social functions. While any psychiatric condition is likely to
      incorporate a degree of heterogeneity, the variability in the nature and severity
      of behaviors observed in ASD is thought to exceed that of other disorders. The
      current paper aims to provide a model for future research into ASD subgroups. In 
      doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW),
      and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - are
      associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western
      Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal
      SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a
      greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively.
      The findings from this "proof of principle" paper provide support for this
      "bottom-up" approach as a feasible method for creating homogenous groups.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing and gestational diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of 
      9,795 participants enrolled in epidemiological observational studies.
PG  - 3353-60
LID - 10.2337/dc13-0778 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been reported to be
      associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
      Accordingly, as this is emergent area of research that has significant clinical
      relevance, the objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationship
      between SDB with GDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched several electronic
      databases for all of the studies published before January 2013 and reviewed
      references of published articles. Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate 
      the unadjusted and BMI-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a random effects model.
      Significant values, weighted effect sizes, and 95% CIs were calculated, and tests
      of homogeneity of variance were performed. RESULTS: Results from nine independent
      studies with a total of 9,795 pregnant women showed that SDB was significantly
      associated with an increased risk of GDM. Women with SDB had a more than
      threefold increased risk of GDM, with a pooled BMI-adjusted OR 3.06 (95% CI
      1.89-4.96). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a significant association
      between SDB and GDM that is evident even after considered confounding by obesity.
      This meta-analysis indicates a need to evaluate the role of early recognition and
      treatment of SDB early during pregnancy.

TI  - Influence of bedsharing activity on breastfeeding duration among US mothers.
PG  - 1038-44
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.2632 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Some professional associations advocate bedsharing to facilitate
      breastfeeding, while others recommend against it to reduce the risk of sudden
      infant death syndrome and suffocation deaths. A better understanding of the
      quantitative influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration is needed to guide
      policy. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding
      duration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal data were from the
      Infant Feeding Practices Study II, which enrolled mothers while pregnant and
      followed them through the first year of infant life. Questionnaires were sent at 
      infant ages 1 to 7, 9, 10, and 12 months, and 1846 mothers answered at least 1
      question regarding bedsharing and were breastfeeding at infant age 2 weeks.
      EXPOSURES: Bedsharing, defined as the mother lying down and sleeping with her
      infant on the same bed or other sleeping surfaces for nighttime sleep or during
      the major sleep period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival analysis to
      investigate the effect of bedsharing on duration of any and exclusive
      breastfeeding. RESULTS: Longer duration of bedsharing, indicated by a larger
      cumulative bedsharing score, was associated with a longer duration of any
      breastfeeding but not exclusive breastfeeding, after adjusting for covariates.
      Breastfeeding duration was longer among women who were better educated, were
      white, had previously breastfed, had planned to breastfeed, and had not returned 
      to work in the first year postpartum. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Multiple factors
      were associated with breastfeeding, including bedsharing. Given the risk of
      sudden infant death syndrome related to bedsharing, multipronged strategies to
      promote breastfeeding should be developed and tested.

TI  - Hypochondroplasia
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hypochondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia characterized
      by short stature; stocky build; disproportionately short arms and legs; broad,
      short hands and feet; mild joint laxity; and macrocephaly. Radiologic features
      include shortening of long bones with mild metaphyseal flare; narrowing of the
      inferior lumbar interpedicular distances; short, broad femoral neck; and squared,
      shortened ilia. The skeletal features are very similar to those seen in
      achondroplasia but tend to be milder. Medical complications common to
      achondroplasia (e.g., spinal stenosis, tibial bowing, obstructive apnea) occur
      less frequently in hypochondroplasia but intellectual disability and epilepsy may
      be more prevalent. Children usually present as toddlers or school-age children
      with decreased growth velocity leading to short stature and limb disproportion.
      Other features also become more prominent over time. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      Hypochondroplasia is diagnosed by the recognition of characteristic clinical and 
      radiologic findings that remain controversial. The diagnosis is difficult to make
      in children under age three years, as skeletal disproportion tends to be mild and
      many of the radiographic features are subtle during infancy. DNA-based testing is
      possible and about 70% of affected individuals are heterozygous for a pathogenic 
      variant in FGFR3. However, there is evidence that locus heterogeneity exists,
      implying that pathogenic variants in other as-yet unidentified genes may result
      in similar, if not identical, phenotypes. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Management of short stature in hypochondroplasia is influenced by
      parental expectations and concerns; one approach is to address these concerns
      rather than trying to treat the child. Laminectomy relieves symptoms of spinal
      stenosis; about 70% of individuals experience relief of symptoms following
      decompression without laminectomy. Developmental milestones are followed closely 
      during early childhood so that cognitive impairments are addressed with special
      educational programs. Epilepsy is treated in the standard fashion. Surveillance: 
      Height, weight, and head circumference should be monitored using
      achondroplasia-standardized growth curves. The following should be performed at
      routine well-child visits: neurologic examination for signs of spinal cord
      compression, history for evidence of sleep apnea, physical evaluation for
      emerging leg bowing, and monitoring for social adjustment. MRI or CT examination 
      of the foramen magnum is indicated if there is evidence of severe hypotonia,
      spinal cord compression, or central sleep apnea. Pregnancy management: Vaginal
      deliveries are possible, although for each pregnancy, pelvic outlet capacity
      should be assessed in relation to fetal head size; epidural or spinal anesthetic 
      can be used, but a consultation with an anesthesiologist prior to delivery is
      recommended to assess the spinal anatomy; spinal stenosis may be aggravated
      during pregnancy. GENETIC COUNSELING: Hypochondroplasia is inherited in an
      autosomal dominant manner. The majority of new cases result from spontaneous
      pathogenic variants and the unaffected parents of a child with hypochondroplasia 
      have an extremely low risk of having another affected child. An individual with
      hypochondroplasia who has a partner of average stature is at a 50% risk of having
      a child with hypochondroplasia. If an affected individual's partner also has
      hypochondroplasia (or another dominant form of skeletal dysplasia), genetic
      counseling becomes more complicated because of (1) the risk for inheriting two
      dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, (2) the high incidence of genetic
      heterogeneity, and (3) the lack of medical literature addressing these
      circumstances. Prenatal molecular genetic testing is available if the pathogenic 
      variant(s) in the parent(s) with hypochondroplasia have been identified; however,
      requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as heterozygous
      hypochondroplasia are not common.

TI  - Fetal functional brain age assessed from universal developmental indices obtained
      from neuro-vegetative activity patterns.
PG  - e74431
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0074431 [doi]
AB  - Fetal brain development involves the development of the neuro-vegetative
      (autonomic) control that is mediated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS).
      Disturbances of the fetal brain development have implications for diseases in
      later postnatal life. In that context, the fetal functional brain age can be
      altered. Universal principles of developmental biology applied to patterns of
      autonomic control may allow a functional age assessment. The work aims at the
      development of a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS) based on heart rate
      patterns. We analysed n = 113 recordings in quiet sleep, n = 286 in active sleep,
      and n = 29 in active awakeness from normals. We estimated fABAS from
      magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in
      quiet sleep (n = 113, 63 females) and active sleep (n = 286, 145 females) state
      by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional
      study. According to universal system developmental principles, we included
      indices that address increasing fluctuation range, increasing complexity, and
      pattern formation (skewness, power spectral ratio VLF/LF, pNN5). The resulting
      models constituted fABAS. fABAS explained 66/63% (coefficient of determination
      R(2) of training and validation set) of the variance by age in quiet, while
      51/50% in active sleep. By means of a logistic regression model using fluctuation
      range and fetal age, quiet and active sleep were automatically reclassified
      (94.3/93.1% correct classifications). We did not find relevant gender
      differences. We conclude that functional brain age can be assessed based on
      universal developmental indices obtained from autonomic control patterns. fABAS
      reflect normal complex functional brain maturation. The presented normative data 
      are supplemented by an explorative study of 19 fetuses compromised by
      intrauterine growth restriction. We observed a shift in the state distribution
      towards active awakeness. The lower WGA dependent fABAS values found in active
      sleep may reflect alterations in the universal developmental indices, namely
      fluctuation amplitude, complexity, and pattern formation that constitute fABAS.

PG  - 11-7
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects more than 12 million individuals
      annually. Power and control are central concepts underlying abusive
      relationships. Physicians may see IPV victims, perpetrators, and their children
      for annual examinations, as well as for injuries and health conditions associated
      with abuse. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women
      of childbearing age (ie, 14 to 46 years) be screened for IPV. Brief, validated
      screening tools, such as the 4-item Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Scream (HITS),
      can be used to facilitate screening. Physicians should always assess patients
      whose medical histories or presenting symptoms or injuries are consistent with
      abuse. Risk factors for IPV and consequences of abuse include general health
      conditions (eg, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome), reproductive issues (eg,
      gynecologic disorders, unintended pregnancies), psychological conditions (eg,
      depression, sleep disturbances), and risky health behaviors (eg, substance use,
      poor health care adherence). Tools for identifying perpetrators are under
      investigation. To prepare the practice to address IPV, physicians should educate 
      themselves and staff and learn about community and national resources. By
      identifying and responding to IPV, clinicians may be able to reduce IPV and
      interrupt the intergenerational cycle of violence.

TI  - Antenatal Mental Health and Retinal Vascular Caliber in Pregnant Women.
PG  - 2
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression, anxiety, and poor sleep are associated with increased risks 
      of cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship
      between negative emotion and retinal microvascular changes among adults, yet no
      study has been done in pregnant women so far. This study aims to examine the
      association of antenatal mental health and retinal vascular caliber among Asian
      pregnant women. METHODS: Nine hundred and fifty two Asian pregnant women aged 18 
      to 46 years were included in this study, who were recruited from two Singapore
      cohort studies, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO)
      study and the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) study conducted from 2009 onwards. A
      total of 835 Asian pregnant women underwent retinal photography at 26 weeks
      follow up, of whom 800 had gradable photographs. Symptoms of depression, anxiety,
      and sleep quality were assessed with self-administered questionnaires. RESULTS:
      In multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, ethnicity, household
      income, pregnancy outcome history, means of conception, hypertension history,
      diabetes history, cigarette smoking history, mean arterial blood pressure, body
      mass index, and spherical equivalent, each standard deviation (SD) increase in
      the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (4.49 scores) and in the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (2.90 scores) was associated with a 0.80
      mum (P = 0.03) and a 1.22 mum (P = 0.01) widening in retinal arteriolar caliber, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates relationships of antenatal
      depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality with retinal arteriolar widening in
      pregnant women. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: We speculate that this might possibly
      indicate an effect of antenatal depression and poor sleep on the microcirculation
      during pregnancy.

      offspring.
PG  - E1195-207
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00231.2013 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological studies demonstrated initially that maternal undernutrition
      results in low birth weight with increased risk for long-lasting energy balance
      disorders. Maternal obesity and diabetes associated with high birth weight,
      excessive nutrition in neonates, and rapid catchup growth also increase the risk 
      of adult-onset obesity. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and
      Disease concept, nutrient supply perturbations in the fetus or neonate result in 
      long-term programming of individual body weight set point. Adipose tissue is a
      key fuel storage unit involved mainly in the maintenance of energy homeostasis.
      Studies in numerous animal models have demonstrated that the adipose tissue is
      the focus of developmental programming events in a sex- and depot-specific
      manner. In rodents, adipose tissue development is particularly active during the 
      perinatal period, especially during the last week of gestation and during early
      postnatal life. In contrast to rodents, this process essentially takes place
      before birth in bigger mammals. Despite these different developmental time
      windows, altricial and precocial species share several mechanisms of adipose
      tissue programming. Offspring from malnourished dams present adipose tissue with 
      a series of alterations: impaired glucose uptake, insulin and leptin resistance, 
      low-grade inflammation, modified sympathetic activity with reduced noradrenergic 
      innervations, and thermogenesis. These modifications reprogram adipose tissue
      metabolism by changing fat distribution and composition and by enhancing
      adipogenesis, predisposing the offspring to fat accumulation. Subtle adipose
      tissue circadian rhythm changes are also observed. Inappropriate hormone levels, 
      modified tissue sensitivity (especially glucocorticoid system), and epigenetic
      mechanisms are key factors for adipose tissue programming during the perinatal
      period.

TI  - SUDI prevention: a review of Maori safe sleep innovations for infants.
PG  - 86-94
AB  - Recent research and policy around sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) have 
      emphasised the place of safe sleeping practices within SUDI prevention
      strategies. Maori SUDI prevention workers have focussed on innovations around the
      safe sleep environment for some time now, as they have grappled with difficult to
      change and disproportionately high Maori SUDI rates. The wahakura (a flax
      bassinet modelled on a traditional Maori infant sleeping item) was developed in
      2006 aiming to mitigate some of the risks of bedsharing with vulnerable infants, 
      in particular infants exposed to maternal smoking in pregnancy. Early wahakura
      projects in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay showed high acceptability, effectiveness as 
      an infant health promotion vehicle but difficulty maintaining a low/no cost
      supply for vulnerable families. The Hawke's Bay project revealed two pathways
      forward: the need for robust research to ensure the safety of the wahakura and
      the exploration of financially viable and more readily available alternatives.
      Work on both pathways is currently in progress around the country, signalling New
      Zealand's ongoing contribution to SUDI prevention and its potential contribution 
      to knowledge and practices applicable to indigenous and other marginalised
      communities worldwide.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on
      the reproductive capability of the offspring. DESIGN: Using a sleep loss model or
      control home-cage group (male and females rats) to evaluate sexual behavior and
      hormonal profile in males and females F1 offspring. SETTING: Laboratory.
      ANIMALS(S): First experiment: Pregnant females were exposed to sleep restriction 
      (SR) protocol and the F1 generation was evaluated. Second experiment: male rats
      were submitted to SR or paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) protocol and the F1
      generation was evaluated. INTERVENTION(S): Male and female rats were subjected to
      sleep restriction (SR) for 21 days or paradoxal sleep-deprived (PSD) for 96
      hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sexual behavior and hormonal levels during the
      adult phase were analyzed in F1 offspring of female and male rats submitted to
      sleep loss. RESULT(S): F1 male offspring of SR females had lower motivation for
      sex and reduced progesterone concentrations. In contrast, F1 female offspring
      displayed significantly enhanced proceptivity compared with control offspring. F1
      female offspring also demonstrated hypersexuality by mounting the males in the
      absence of any significant hormonal alterations. F1 male offspring of SR or
      paradoxically sleep-deprived (PSD) males presented a decline in the sexual
      response, accompanied by a reduction in testosterone concentrations. Proceptivity
      was significantly increased among F1 female offspring of PSD and SR males
      compared with control offspring. CONCLUSION(S): SR in progenitors may alter
      sexual behavior of the F1 offspring in adulthood. These findings reveal
      far-reaching consequences of sleep deprivation, and suggest that parental sleep
      influences the reproductive capability of subsequent generations.

AB  - Socioeconomic status (SES) impacts on both structural and functional brain
      development in childhood, but how early its effects can be demonstrated is
      unknown. In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma
      frequency range in awake 6-9-month-olds from areas of East London with high
      socioeconomic deprivation. Between-subject comparisons of infants from low- and
      high-income families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants 
      from low-income homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing
      infants according to maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups
      yielding lower power. Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and 
      birth weight, as well as smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these
      differences. Our results show that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on
      brain activity can already be detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to 
      very early risk for language and attention difficulties. This is the first study 
      to reveal region-selective differences in functional brain development associated
      with early infancy in low-income families.

TI  - Designing artificial environments for preterm infants based on circadian studies 
      on pregnant uterus.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2013.00113 [doi]
AB  - Using uterine explants from Per1::Luc rats and in situ hybridization, we recently
      reported that the circadian property of the molecular clock in the uterus and
      placenta is stably maintained from non-pregnancy, right through to the end stage 
      of pregnancy under regular light-dark (LD) cycles. Despite long-lasting increases
      in progesterone during gestation and an increase in estrogen before delivery, the
      uterus keeps a stable Per1::Luc rhythm throughout the pregnancy. The study
      suggests the importance of stable circadian environments for fetuses to achieve
      sound physiology and intrauterine development. This idea is also supported by
      epidemiological and animal studies, in which pregnant females exposed to repeated
      shifting of the LD cycles have increased rates of reproductive abnormalities and 
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. Leading from this, we introduced artificial circadian
      environments with controlled lighting conditions to human preterm infants by
      developing and utilizing a specific light filter which takes advantage of the
      unique characteristics of infants' developing visual photoreceptors. In spite of 
      growing evidence of the physiological benefits of nighttime exposure to darkness 
      for infant development, many Japanese Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) still
      prefer to maintain constant light in preparation for any possible emergencies
      concerning infants in incubators. To protect infants from the negative effects of
      constant light on their development in the NICU, we have developed a new device
      similar to a magic mirror, by which preterm infants can be shielded from exposure
      to their visible wavelengths of light even in the constant light conditions of
      the NICU while simultaneously allowing medical care staff to visually monitor
      preterm infants adequately. The device leads to significantly increased infant
      activity during daytime than during night time and better weight gains.

TI  - Ontogeny and control of the heart rate power spectrum in the last third of
      gestation in fetal sheep.
PG  - 80-8
LID - 10.1113/expphysiol.2013.074567 [doi]
AB  - Power spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability has been proposed to
      provide a non-invasive estimate of autonomic balance. However, there are few
      systematic data before birth. We therefore examined developmental changes in the 
      frequency power spectrum at very low (0-0.04 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high
      frequencies (0.15-0.4 Hz), as well as the ratio of low- to high-frequency power
      (LF/HF), in chronically catheterized, healthy fetal sheep at 0.6 (n = 8), 0.7 (n 
      = 7) and 0.8 gestational age (ga; n = 11). In a second study, 0.8 ga fetuses
      received either atropine (4.8 mg bolus, then 4.8 mg h(-1) for 30 min, n = 6) or
      6-hydroxydopamine (20 mg ml(-1) at 2.5 ml h(-1) for 3 h; n = 9). Data were
      analysed by sleep state, defined by low-voltage-high-frequency (LV) or
      high-voltage-low-frequency (HV) EEG. Total spectral power increased with
      gestational age (P < 0.05), while LF/HF decreased from 0.6 to 0.7 ga. At 0.8 ga, 
      heart rate and LF/HF were significantly higher during HV than LV sleep (P <
      0.05). Consistent with this, although total spectral power was not significantly 
      greater during HV sleep, there was a significant interaction between sleep state 
      and frequency band (P = 0.02). Both atropine (P = 0.05) and 6-hydroxydopamine (P 
      < 0.05) were associated with an overall reduction in spectral power but no
      significant effect on the LF/HF ratio. This study does not support substantial,
      consistent differences between the frequencies of sympathetic and parasympathetic
      activity in late-gestation fetal sheep.

AB  - We report on two pregnant women who either had de novo restless legs syndrome
      (RLS) or had marked enhancement of preexisting RLS symptoms during pregnancy.
      Both patients had ferritin values <50 mug/L at baseline. The patients had
      relevant sleep disorders and daytime symptoms caused by RLS. The women were
      treated in an open paradigm with intravenous iron sucrose. A few weeks after
      therapy, both patients experienced a significant reduction or even remission of
      RLS symptoms. Their quality of life and sleep substantially improved and no
      treatment-related adverse effects were observed. According to our initial
      experience, intravenous iron sucrose administration appears to be an effective
      therapy in RLS patients with low ferritin values during pregnancy.

TI  - Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep quality and insomnia during
      pregnancy: A systematic review.
PG  - 260-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature regarding non-pharmacological 
      inteventions for improving sleep quality and insomnia during pregnancy. METHODS: 
      An electronic search strategy was conducted using several online databases
      (CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Index to Chiropractic Literature) from inception to
      March 2013. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies evaluating
      non-pharmacological interventions, published in English in a peer reviewed
      journal, and assessed sleep quality or insomnia. The full text of suitable
      articles was reviewed by the authors, and scored using a risk of bias assessment.
      RESULTS: 160 articles were screened and seven studies met the inclusion criteria 
      in the form of three prospective RCTs, one prospective longitudinal trial, one
      experimental pilot study, and two prospective quasi-randomized trials. Quality
      scores ranged from five to eight out of twelve on the risk of bias scoring
      criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise, massage, and acupuncture may be associated with 
      improved sleep quality during pregnancy, however, due to the low quality and
      heterogeneity of the studies yielded, a definitive recommendation cannot be made.
      Further higher quality research is indicated.

AB  - Mental health is an important medical issue in perinatal care, and there is
      increasing evidence that insomnia during pregnancy is associated with postpartum 
      depression (PPD). Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of insomnia
      treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy on PPD symptoms. Fifty-four
      pregnant women with insomnia were randomly assigned to trazodone,
      diphenhydramine, or placebo treatment. Sleep quality was measured by actigraphy
      at baseline, and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, depression was
      assessed 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. Trazodone and diphenhydramine improved
      sleep profile compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Further, depressive
      symptoms were reduced 2 and 6 weeks after delivery in trazodone and
      diphenhydramine groups compared to placebo. No differences in depressive symptoms
      were observed between the trazodone and diphenhydramine groups. These findings
      indicate that insomnia treatment with trazodone or diphenhydramine during the
      third trimester of pregnancy may prevent PPD.

AB  - This paper describes the importance of diabetic retinopathy in the loss of visual
      function. We exposed the most important risk factors, such as diabetes duration, 
      poor metabolic control, pregnancy, puberty, hypertension, poor control of blood
      lipids, renal disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. We describe the pathogenesis of 
      the disease, small retinal vessel microangiopathies which produce extravasation, 
      edema and ischemia phenomena. We put special emphasis on the vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) and its pathogenic importance. They are also described the
      main clinical symptoms as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard and soft
      exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), venous disorders,
      formation of new vessels and diabetic macular edema (the latter being the most
      common cause of vision loss). Finally we describe the latest diagnostic
      techniques and eye treatment, with special emphasis on obesity surgery importance
      as more important preventive factor to eliminate the predisposing and
      precipitating disease symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea, a breathing disorder caused by the repetitive
      collapse of the upper airway during sleep, results in a state of chronic
      intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Although the etiology and consequences of CIH are
      extensively investigated in the adult, the developmental ramifications of this
      disease process are unknown. DESIGN: This study was done to investigate the
      effect of CIH during gestation on offspring development. Pregnant female
      Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIH throughout the gestational period. 
      RESULTS: Postnatal day-1 offspring from CIH mothers were asymmetrically growth
      restricted, with decreased body weights and elevated brain-weight:liver-weight
      ratios. Furthermore, CIH newborns had elevated heart- and brain-weight:body
      weight ratios, and decreased liver-weight:body weight ratios. By adulthood, body 
      weights of growth restricted offspring were significantly greater, as were the
      liver-weight:body weight ratios. CIH offspring also had greater body fat
      deposition, were hyperglycemic and had elevated plasma levels of insulin during
      development into adults. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that alteration of the
      maternal intrauterine environment by gestational CIH effects the long-term
      development of the offspring and increases the risk of the offspring to metabolic
      diseases in adulthood.

TI  - Shift work and circadian dysregulation of reproduction.
PG  - 92
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2013.00092 [doi]
AB  - Health impairments, including reproductive issues, are associated with working
      nights or rotating shifts. For example, shift work has been associated with an
      increased risk of irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, infertility,
      miscarriage, low birth weight or pre-term delivery, and reduced incidence of
      breastfeeding. Based on what is known about circadian regulation of endocrine
      rhythms in rodents (and much less in humans), the circadian clock is an integral 
      regulatory part of the reproductive system. When this 24-h program is disordered 
      by environmental perturbation (such as shift work) or genetic alterations, the
      endocrine system can be impaired. The purpose of this review is to explore the
      hypothesis that misalignment of reproductive hormones with the environmental
      light-dark cycle and/or sleep-wake rhythms can disrupt menstrual cycles,
      pregnancy, and parturition. We highlight the role of the circadian clock in
      regulating human reproductive physiology and shift work-induced pathology within 
      each step of the reproductive axis while exploring potential mechanisms from the 
      animal model literature. In addition to documenting the reproductive hazards of
      shift work, we also point out important gaps in our knowledge as critical areas
      for future investigation. For example, future studies should examine whether
      forced desynchronization disrupts gonadotropin secretion rhythms and whether
      there are sleep/wake schedules that are better or worse for the adaptation of the
      reproductive system to shift work. These studies are necessary in order to define
      not only whether or not shift work-induced circadian misalignment impairs
      reproductive capacity, but also to identify strategies for the future that can
      minimize this desynchronization.

TI  - Interactions between pregnancy, obstructive sleep apnea, and gestational diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 4195-202
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-2348 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Questionnaire studies linked symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      to the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Whether this association is
      present when OSA is assessed objectively by polysomnography is not known.
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between
      pregnancy, OSA, and GDM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted
      observational case-control studies using polysomnography in 15 nonpregnant,
      nondiabetic women (NP-NGT), 15 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance
      (P-NGT), and 15 pregnant women with GDM (P-GDM). The groups were frequency
      matched for age and race/ethnicity. Pregnant women were studied during the late
      second to early third trimester. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparisons of OSA
      diagnosis and sleep parameters between NP-NGT and P-NGT to assess the impact of
      pregnancy and between P-NGT and P-GDM to explore the association between GDM and 
      OSA were measured. RESULTS: Compared with NP-NGT, P-NGT women had a higher apnea 
      hypopnea index (AHI) (median 2.0 vs 0.5, P = .03) and more disrupted sleep as
      reflected by a higher wake time after sleep onset (median 66 vs 21 min, P < .01) 
      and a higher microarousal index (median 16.4 vs 10.6, P = .01). Among the
      pregnant women, P-GDM had markedly lower total sleep time (median 397 vs 464 min,
      P = .02) and a higher AHI (median 8.2 vs 2.0, P = .05) than P-NGT women. OSA was 
      more prevalent in P-GDM than in P-NGT women (73% vs 27%, P = .01). After
      adjustment for prepregnancy body mass index, the diagnosis of GDM was associated 
      with a diagnosis of OSA [odds ratio 6.60 (95% confidence interval 1.15-37.96)].
      In pregnancy, after adjusting for prepregnancy body mass index, higher
      microarousal index significantly associated with higher hemoglobin A1c and
      fasting glucose levels. Higher oxygen desaturation index was associated with
      higher fasting glucose levels. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is associated with sleep
      disturbances. Sleep is more disturbed in GDM than in P-NGT women. There is a
      strong association between GDM and OSA.

TI  - [Circadian clock gene Rev-erb-alpha deficiency prolongs female estrous
      cyclicity].
PG  - 395-401
AB  - The circadian clock has been linked to female reproductive physiology and
      endocrine in mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have shown 
      increased rates of abnormal reproduction and adverse pregnancy. But little is
      known how the circadian rhythms affect reproduction. The aim of the present study
      was to investigate the influences of circadian rhythms on estrous cycle in female
      mice using clock gene Rev-erb-alpha knock out (Rev-erb-alpha(-/-)) mice. To test 
      the fertility of Rev-erb-alpha(-/-) mice, litter sizes were counted after mating 
      with C57BL/6J male mice. HE staining was used to observe the change of follicle
      development. The number of embryos of Rev-erb-alpha(+/+) and Rev-erb-alpha(-/-)
      female mice was compared 1.5 d after mating with C57BL/6J male mice. Then
      Rev-erb-alpha(+/+) and Rev-erb-alpha(-/-) female mice were housed to adult, and
      daily vaginal lavage with 0.9% saline was used to monitor estrous cycle for at
      least 30 days. Quantity of various cells was counted on specified smears views
      after staining. We observed estrous cycles of Rev-erb-alpha(+/+) and
      Rev-erb-alpha(-/-) female mice using line plots and periodic spectrograms. The
      results showed that the Rev-erb-alpha(-/-) female mice were infertility, and the 
      number of embryos of Rev-erb-alpha(-/-) females was less than that of
      Rev-erb-alpha(+/+) females. However, the follicle development of
      Rev-erb-alpha(-/-) female mice was normal. The estrous cycle of
      Rev-erb-alpha(-/-) female mice was 3.22 days longer than that of
      Rev-erb-alpha(+/+) female mice. The results suggest that loss of Rev-erb-alpha
      prolongs estrous cycle, which is probably one of the reasons for female mice
      infertility, and circadian rhythm is important for mammalian estrous cycle.

TI  - Prevalence and impact of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy.
PG  - 366-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological disorder
      which predominantly affects women. Pregnancy is one of the most common conditions
      leading to secondary RLS. Severe symptoms of RLS may lead to complications of
      pregnancy and/or labor. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and
      characteristics of RLS in pregnant women. METHODS: Women in the third trimester
      of gravidity filled out a simple questionnaire based on the official diagnostic
      criteria for RLS. Positive responders were interviewed in order to further
      characterize their symptoms. Afterwards information on changes in frequency
      and/or intensity of the symptoms after delivery was obtained by a telephone
      follow-up. All data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 300
      questionnaires were completed. All 94 RLS-positives met the four diagnostic
      criteria (31.33%). There was no difference in age, body mass index, or the number
      of previous pregnancies between RLS-positives and RLS-negatives, but weight gain 
      during pregnancy was significantly higher in RLS-positives. More than 30% of
      positives had clinically significant symptoms, and 50% reported sleep
      disturbances. Almost 75% of the cases of RLS were secondary, i.e., symptoms
      occurred only during pregnancy (with a peak in the third trimester). More
      complications of pregnancy or labor occurred in women with RLS, but this was only
      marginally significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the relatively high
      prevalence of RLS in pregnant women compared with the general population.
      Although almost three-fourths of the symptoms were only transient throughout
      pregnancy, the impact of the severe symptoms and sleep deprivation on the course 
      of pregnancy and delivery was not negligible. Early detection and adequate
      treatment of severe RLS are necessary to prevent maternal discomfort and possible
      health risks. The questionnaire method is a simple, reliable diagnostic tool.

AB  - Disruption of sleep causes adverse health outcomes and poor quality of life.
      People with sleep disruption have higher levels than people without disrupted
      sleep of depression and anxiety and increased rates of cardiovascular diseases.
      Women have a higher incidence than men of insomnia and depression related to poor
      sleep. The types of complaints differ significantly between the sexes. Women are 
      more likely than men to complain of insomnia, headache, irritability, and fatigue
      than the "typical" symptoms of loud snoring and breathing cessation during sleep.
      Hormones play an important role in sleep in women. Reproductive hormones were
      found to have a protective effect on sleep apnea in women of premenopausal age.
      Pregnancy is another period when the prevalence of sleep apnea and restless leg
      syndrome increases from hormonal effect. Cardiovascular mortality is high in
      women with obstructive sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy
      improves outcomes in most cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The epidemiology,
      risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and therapies for the three most common sleep 
      disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome), along
      with effects of menopause, pregnancy, and social factors on sleep in women, are
      key considerations for clinicians caring for female patients across the adult
      life span.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are increased in
      pregnancy compared to the nongravid state. Maternal SDB may be associated with
      adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this is still under investigation. We performed a
      systematic literature review, and where feasible, a metaanalysis, to evaluate
      whether women with SDB in pregnancy have a higher risk of specific adverse
      pregnancy outcomes compared with women without SDB. STUDY DESIGN: Original
      studies published until June 2012 evaluating the association between gestational 
      hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight infants, and
      maternal SDB, defined either by symptoms or the reference standard
      polysomnography, were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data
      were extracted on study design and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect
      estimates from each study were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of
      the 4386 studies identified, 31 met the defined criteria. Twenty-one studies, all
      observational in design, reported dichotomous outcomes; 9 of these adjusted for
      potential confounders. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with gestational
      hypertension/preeclampsia (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.60-3.09; 5 studies), and gestational diabetes (pooled aOR, 1.86;
      95% CI, 1.30-2.42; 5 studies). CONCLUSION: Based on published observational
      studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational
      hypertension and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. 
      However, large-scale, prospective cohort, and interventional studies are needed
      to further elucidate the relationship between maternal SDB and adverse pregnancy 
      outcomes.

PG  - CD001139
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain (LBP)
      and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. Pain increases with advancing
      pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. OBJECTIVES: To
      assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back
      pain in pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and
      Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and
      reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and
      checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the
      incidence or severity of pelvic or back pain in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted
      data. Quality of the evidence for outcomes was assessed using the five criteria
      outlined by the GRADE Working Group. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 randomised
      trials examining 4093 pregnant women in this updated review. Eleven trials
      examined LBP (N = 1312), four examined pelvic pain (N = 661), and 11 trials
      examined lumbo-pelvic (LBP and pelvic) pain (N = 2120). Diagnoses ranged from
      self-reported symptoms to the results of specific tests. All interventions were
      added to usual prenatal care and unless noted, were compared to usual prenatal
      care. For LBP, there was low-quality evidence that in general, the addition of
      exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.80;
      95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.53; six RCTs, N = 543), and disability
      (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; two RCTs, N = 146); and water-based exercise
      significantly reduced LBP-related sick leave (risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17
      to 0.92; one RCT, N = 241). Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested no 
      significant difference in pain or function between two types of pelvic support
      belt, between osteopathic manipulation (OMT) and usual care or sham ultrasound
      (sham US). Very low-quality evidence suggested that a specially-designed pillow
      may relieve night pain better than a regular pillow. For pelvic pain, there was
      moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced evening pain
      better than exercise; both were better than usual care. Low-quality evidence from
      single trials suggested that adding a rigid belt to exercise improved average
      pain but not function; acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture
      for improving evening pain and function, but not average pain; and evening pain
      relief was the same following either deep or superficial acupuncture. For
      lumbo-pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that an eight- to 20-week 
      exercise program reduced the risk of women reporting lumbo-pelvic pain (RR 0.85; 
      95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; four RCTs, N = 1344); but a 16- to 20-week training program 
      was no more successful than usual care at preventing pelvic pain (one RCT, N =
      257). Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced
      lumbo-pelvic-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, two RCTs, N =
      1062), and improved function. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested
      that OMT significantly reduced pain and improved function; either a multi-modal
      intervention that included manual therapy, exercise and education (MOM) or usual 
      care significantly reduced disability, but only MOM improved pain and physical
      function; acupuncture improved pain and function more than usual care or
      physiotherapy; pain and function improved more when acupuncture was started at
      26- rather than 20- weeks' gestation; and auricular (ear) acupuncture
      significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture.When reported,
      adverse events were minor and transient. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality
      evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of
      pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more
      than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise
      for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16- to 20-week training program was no
      more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality
      evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from
      LBP.There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because 
      of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling.
      Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out.Physiotherapy, OMT, 
      acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt
      to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone.
      Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening
      lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was
      started at 26- rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were
      small.There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different
      support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), 
      or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture.Very
      low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time 
      LBP.Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence
      in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. Future research
      would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can
      be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms.

      exposed to constant light conditions during perinatal development.
PG  - 222-7
LID - 10.3109/03009734.2013.821191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shift-work is suggested to affect fetal development negatively. In
      particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or
      circadian rhythm changes may disturb fetal growth or lead to complications during
      pregnancy. Exposure to constant light is an environmental stressor that can
      affect the circadian system and has been shown to induce neurochemical and
      behavioral changes when used during the prenatal and/or postnatal period in
      experimental animals. However, studies investigating long-term effects of
      constant light in the offspring are sparse. METHODS: An accidental power outage
      resulted in pregnant females being housed under constant light (LL) conditions
      for seven days of the offspring perinatal development (embryonic day 20 to
      postnatal day 4). The long-term effects of constant light on the behavior in the 
      adult offspring were assessed by means of open field, object recognition, and
      water maze tests. RESULTS: In adulthood, LL-animals displayed an intact
      recognition memory and no deficits in spatial learning or memory. In the open
      field test, LL-animals exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior, observed as
      significantly more thigmotaxis and less ambulation. These results were confirmed 
      in the other behavioral tests as the LL-animals spent less time exploring the
      objects in the object recognition test, and showed thigmotactic behavior also in 
      the water maze test. CONCLUSION: The results confirm that early life experience
      can cause changes in brain development that shape brain function and add to the
      sparse literature on long-term effects of constant light conditions during
      perinatal development on specific behaviors in adulthood.

PG  - 121-124
LID - 10.17925/EE.2013.09.02.121 [doi]
AB  - The role of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in pregnancy is not well studied, but 
      an increasing body of literature appears to indicate that there may be adverse
      maternal and foetal health effects of the disease. OSA is associated with a
      twofold risk of pre-eclampsia. The small size of the existing investigations
      still leave unanswered questions about the consequences of OSA as it relates to
      some other clinically relevant outcomes such as eclampsia, stillbirth and
      maternal mortality. A consistent body of literature has emerged demonstrating an 
      increased risk of insulin resistance and diabetes associated with OSA. However,
      among pregnant women, the association appears to be related to short sleep
      duration. Well-designed and adequately powered studies are needed to further
      delineate the role of OSA and sleep duration on pregnancy outcome and the
      mechanisms of those effects.

      cohort study.
PG  - e68057
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0068057 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine whether obstructive sleep 
      apnea (OSA) is associated with reduced fetal growth, and whether nocturnal oxygen
      desaturation precipitates acute fetal heart rate changes. STUDY DESIGN: We
      performed a prospective observational study, screening 371 women in the second
      trimester for OSA symptoms. 41 subsequently underwent overnight sleep studies to 
      diagnose OSA. Third trimester fetal growth was assessed using ultrasound. Fetal
      heart rate monitoring accompanied the sleep study. Cord blood was taken at
      delivery, to measure key regulators of fetal growth. RESULTS: Of 371 women
      screened, 108 (29%) were high risk for OSA. 26 high risk and 15 low risk women
      completed the longitudinal study; 14 had confirmed OSA (cases), and 27 were
      controls. The median (interquartile range) respiratory disturbance index (number 
      of apnoeas, hypopnoeas or respiratory related arousals/hour of sleep) was 7.9
      (6.1-13.8) for cases and 2.2 (1.3-3.5) for controls (p<0.001). Impaired fetal
      growth was observed in 43% (6/14) of cases, vs 11% (3/27) of controls (RR 2.67;
      1.25-5.7; p = 0.04). Using logistic regression, only OSA (OR 6; 1.2-29.7, p =
      0.03) and body mass index (OR 2.52; 1.09-5.80, p = 0.03) were significantly
      associated with impaired fetal growth. After adjusting for body mass index on
      multivariate analysis, the association between OSA and impaired fetal growth was 
      not appreciably altered (OR 5.3; 0.93-30.34, p = 0.06), although just failed to
      achieve statistical significance. Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations
      accompanied nocturnal oxygen desaturation in one fetus, subsequently found to be 
      severely growth restricted. Fetal growth regulators showed changes in the
      expected direction- with IGF-1 lower, and IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 higher- in the cord
      blood of infants of cases vs controls, although were not significantly different.
      CONCLUSION: OSA may be associated with reduced fetal growth in late pregnancy.
      Further evaluation is warranted to establish whether OSA may be an important
      contributor to adverse perinatal outcome, including stillbirth.

TI  - Long work hours and obesity in Korean adult workers.
PG  - 359-66
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to identify the association between
      work hours and obesity in Korean adult manual and nonmanual workers, and to
      determine whether there is a gender difference in this association. METHODS: The 
      study was conducted using Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      data collected between 2007 and 2010. Individuals aged below 25 or over 64 years,
      pregnant women, part-time workers, soldiers, housewives and students were
      excluded. The total number of individuals included in the analysis was 8,889
      (5,241 male and 3,648 female subjects). The outcome variable was obesity, defined
      as body mass index >/=25 kg/m(2). Variables considered in the model were age,
      education, income, marital status, alcohol drinking, smoking, daily energy
      intake, physical activity, sleep hours per day, the type of job, work hours, and 
      work schedule. Work hours were categorized as <40, 40-48 (reference), 49-60, and 
      >60 hours per week. RESULTS: In the multiple SURVEYLOGISTIC regression analyses, 
      the adjusted odds ratio of obesity for long work hours (>60 hours per week) in
      male manual workers was 1.647 (95% confidence interval 1.262-2.151). Long work
      hours did not significantly increase the odds ratio for obesity in male nonmanual
      workers and female manual and nonmanual workers. CONCLUSIONS: More than 60 work
      hours per week increased the risk of obesity in Korean male manual workers. This 
      result might be helpful in preventing obesity in Korean adult workers, especially
      male manual workers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during
      pregnancy and to evaluate factors associated with RLS in a population of Iranian 
      pregnant women. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, 443 consecutive
      pregnant women admitted for delivery underwent an interview within 2 days of
      parturition. The diagnosis of RLS was established by the 4 criteria of the
      International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The severity of RLS
      was assessed through the IRLSSG Rating Scale. RESULTS: Seventy-nine (17.8%) women
      met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with most (74.7%) having RLS of moderate
      severity. The mean RLS duration before delivery was 3.1 +/- 2.1 months among 69
      (87.3%) women; 10 (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Sleep disturbances
      including insomnia and early awakening were significantly more common among women
      with RLS than among those without (P < 0.001), and the frequency of cesarean
      delivery was also significantly higher (58.2% versus 44.5%, P = 0.027; odds ratio
      2.4). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age,
      number of pregnancies, folate and iron supplementation, hemoglobin level, and
      neonatal anthropometric data. CONCLUSION: Restless legs syndrome is common during
      pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep and an increased risk of cesarean
      delivery.

TI  - Human psychobiology of MDMA or 'Ecstasy': an overview of 25 years of empirical
      research.
PG  - 289-307
LID - 10.1002/hup.2318 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This paper aimed to review how scientific knowledge about the human
      psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time. METHODS: In this paper, the
      empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed. RESULTS: When
      MDMA was a 'novel psychoactive substance', it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as
      it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique
      pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost-benefit ratios, and voluntary
      cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol
      levels increased by 800% in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric,
      although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed
      cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its
      anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective
      memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social
      intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show
      reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are
      associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep
      architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric 
      status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to psychomotor impairments in the
      children. CONCLUSIONS: The damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA are far more
      widespread than was realized a few years ago, with new neuropsychobiological
      deficits still emerging.

TI  - Video-EEG recordings in full-term neonates of diabetic mothers: observational
      study.
PG  - F493-8
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-304283 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether full-term newborn infants of diabetic mothers
      (IDM) present immature/disorganised EEG patterns in the immediate neonatal
      period, and whether there was any relationship with maternal glycaemic control.
      DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a
      tertiary hospital neonatal unit. PATIENTS: 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born
      between 2010 and 2013. INTERVENTIONS: All underwent video-EEG recording lasting
      >90 min at 48-72 h of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analysed the percentage of 
      indeterminate sleep, transient sharp waves per hour and mature-for-gestational
      age EEG patterns (discontinuity, maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI),
      asynchrony, asymmetry, delta brushes, encoches frontales and alpha/theta rolandic
      activity). The group of IDM was divided into two subgroups according to maternal 
      HbA1c: (1) HbA1c>/=6% and (2) HbA1c<6%. RESULTS: Compared with healthy newborns, 
      IDM presented significantly higher percentage of indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%;
      p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and delta brushes in the bursts (6%
      vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3 s vs 0 s; p=0.017); fewer encoches
      frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced theta/alpha rolandic activity (3/h vs
      9/h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; p<0.001). IDM with
      maternal HbA1c>/=6% showed greater percentage of delta brushes in the burst (14% 
      vs 4%; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Full-term IDM newborns showed video-EEG features of
      abnormal development of brain function. Maternal HbA1c levels<6% during pregnancy
      could minimise the risk of cerebral dysmaturity.

TI  - Disturbed sleep and inflammatory cytokines in depressed and nondepressed pregnant
      women: an exploratory analysis of pregnancy outcomes.
PG  - 670-81
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31829cc3e7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for
      pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological
      pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health.
      Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored
      whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for
      adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the
      sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse 
      outcomes. METHODS: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations
      were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168)
      at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth
      weight, and peripartum events. RESULTS: Among depressed women, short sleep
      duration (<7 hours) was associated with higher interleukin (IL)-8 across time
      (beta = 0.506, p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (<85%) was associated with higher
      IL-6 (beta = 0.205, p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (beta = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were
      associated with having a lower weight baby (p values <.053). Among depressed
      women, interferon-gamma increased risk for preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.175, p =
      .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (beta = 105.2, p = .085),
      interferon-gamma and lower birth weight (beta = -19.92, p < .069), and increased 
      IL-8 and babies weighing less than 4000 grams (odds ratio = 0.72, p < .083) were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal
      immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory
      analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships.

TI  - Factors associated with clinically significant insomnia among pregnant low-income
      Latinas.
PG  - 694-701
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2012.4039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative
      health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant
      insomnia among pregnant Latinas. METHODS: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas
      recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and 
      questions about demographics and sleep. RESULTS: Clinically significant insomnia 
      (ISI>/=10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of
      clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS>/=9
      and 9% with EPDS<9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26%
      versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or 
      marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%)
      was experienced by women with EPDS>/=9 who completed measures in English. The
      lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by
      women with EPDS<9 who completed measures in Spanish. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample 
      of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically
      significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas.
      Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with
      elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation,
      as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to
      Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors
      (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be
      important to directly test this explanation in future research.

TI  - Niemann-Pick Disease Type C
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lipid storage
      disease that can present in infants, children, or adults. Neonates can present
      with ascites and severe liver disease from infiltration of the liver and/or
      respiratory failure from infiltration of the lungs. Other infants, without liver 
      or pulmonary disease, have hypotonia and developmental delay. The classic
      presentation occurs in mid-to-late childhood with the insidious onset of ataxia, 
      vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSGP), and dementia. Dystonia and seizures are 
      common. Dysarthria and dysphagia eventually become disabling, making oral feeding
      impossible; death usually occurs in the late second or third decade from
      aspiration pneumonia. Adults are more likely to present with dementia or
      psychiatric symptoms. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of NPC is confirmed by
      biochemical testing that demonstrates impaired cholesterol esterification and
      positive filipin staining in cultured fibroblasts. Biochemical testing for
      carrier status is unreliable. Most individuals with NPC have NPC1, caused by
      pathogenic variants in NPC1; fewer than 20 individuals have been diagnosed with
      NPC2, caused by pathogenic variants in NPC2. Molecular genetic testing of NPC1
      and NPC2 detects pathogenic variants in approximately 94% of individuals with
      NPC. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic therapy for seizures,
      dystonia, and cataplexy; a nocturnal sedative to help disordered sleep; physical 
      therapy to maintain mobility as long as possible. Prevention of secondary
      complications: Chest physical therapy with aggressive bronchodilation and
      antibiotic therapy of intercurrent infection; regular bowel program for
      mobility-impaired individuals to prevent severe constipation and resulting
      increased seizure frequency and/or increased spasticity. Surveillance: Swallowing
      is monitored to allow placement of a gastrostomy tube when aspiration or
      nutritional compromise is imminent. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that
      cause excessive salivation or that may exacerbate seizures by interacting with
      antiepileptic drugs; alcohol and other drugs that may exacerbate ataxia. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: NPC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an
      affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an 
      asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. The
      phenotype (i.e., age of onset and severity of symptoms) usually runs true in
      families. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for
      pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants have been
      identified in the family.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 6
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is characterized
      by adult-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. 
      Mean age of onset is 43 to 52 years. Initial symptoms are gait unsteadiness,
      stumbling, and imbalance (in ~90%) and dysarthria (in ~10%). Eventually all
      persons have gait ataxia, upper-limb incoordination, intention tremor, and
      dysarthria. Dysphagia and choking are common. Visual disturbances may result from
      diplopia, difficulty fixating on moving objects, horizontal gaze-evoked
      nystagmus, and vertical nystagmus. Hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses
      occur in up to 40%-50%. Basal ganglia signs, including dystonia and
      blepharospasm, occur in up to 25%. Mentation is generally preserved.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: CACNA1A is the only gene in which mutation is known to cause
      SCA6. The diagnosis of SCA6 rests on the use of molecular genetic testing to
      detect an abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in CACNA1A. Affected
      individuals have 20 to 33 CAG repeats. Molecular genetic testing reveals an
      expansion in more than 99% of affected individuals. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Acetazolamide to eliminate episodes of ataxia; vestibular
      suppressants to reduce vertigo and/or osscilopsia; ophthalmology consultation for
      refractive or surgical management of diplopia; clonopin for REM sleep disorders; 
      home modifications for safety and convenience; canes, walking sticks, and walkers
      to prevent falling; physical therapy to maximize compensation and strength;
      speech therapy and communication devices for dysarthria; weighted eating utensils
      and dressing hooks; video esophagrams to identify safest behaviors and
      consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration; feeding assessment when
      dysphagia becomes troublesome; weight control, as obesity exacerbates ambulation 
      and mobility difficulties; CPAP for sleep apnea. Surveillance: Annual or
      semiannual evaluation by a neurologist; driving ability should be assessed by
      professionals periodically. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sedative hypnotics
      (ethanol or certain medications) that increase incoordination. Other:
      Tremor-controlling drugs are not usually effective in reducing cerebellar
      tremors. GENETIC COUNSELING: SCA6 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
      Offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of inheriting the CACNA1A
      pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased
      risk if the diagnosis has been confirmed in a family member; however, requests
      for prenatal diagnosis of (typically) adult-onset diseases are not common.

TI  - Common sleep disorders: management strategies and pregnancy outcomes.
PG  - 368-77
LID - 10.1111/jmwh.12004 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with
      adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed
      sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet
      recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and
      adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose,
      depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that 
      the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse
      pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. This focused review
      of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep
      disorders of interest: breathing-related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring
      and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep
      disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if
      left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates
      their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current
      evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies.

TI  - Profiling of circadian genes expressed in the uterus endometrial stromal cells of
      pregnant rats as revealed by DNA microarray coupled with RNA interference.
PG  - 82

AB  - The peripheral circadian oscillator plays an essential role in synchronizing
      local physiology to operate in a circadian manner via regulation of the
      expression of clock-controlled genes. The present study aimed to evaluate the
      circadian rhythms of clock genes and clock-controlled genes expressed in the rat 
      uterus endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) during the stage of implantation by a
      DNA microarray. Of 12,252 genes showing significantly expression, 7,235 genes
      displayed significant alterations. As revealed by the biological pathway analysis
      using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery online
      annotation software, genes were involved in cell cycle, glutathione metabolism,
      MAPK signaling pathway, fatty acid metabolism, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis,
      focal adhesion, and PPAR signaling pathway. The clustering of clock genes were
      mainly divided into four groups: the first group was Roralpha, Timeless, Npas2,
      Bmal1, Id2, and Cry2; the second group Per1, Per2, Per3, Dec1, Tef, and Dbp; the 
      third group Bmal2, Cry1, E4bp4, Rorbeta, and Clock; the fourth group
      Rev-erbalpha. Eleven implantation-related genes and 24 placenta formation-related
      genes displayed significant alterations, suggesting that these genes involved in 
      implantation and placenta formation are controlled under circadian clock. Some
      candidates as clock-controlled genes were evaluated by using RNA interference to 
      Bmal1 mRNA. Down-regulation of Igf1 gene expression was observed by Bmal1
      silencing, whereas the expression of Inhbetaa was significantly increased. During
      active oscillation of circadian clock, the apoptosis-related genes Fas and
      Caspase3 remained no significant changes, but they were significantly increased
      by knockdown of Bmal1 mRNA. These results indicate that clock-controlled genes
      are up- or down-regulated in rat UESCs during the stage of decidualization. DNA
      microarray analysis coupled with RNA interference will be helpful to understand
      the physiological roles of some oscillating genes in blastocyst implantation and 
      placenta formation.

TI  - Association between prescribing hypnotics for parents and children in Norway.
PG  - 732-6
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-303646 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the dispensing of the hypnotic alimemazine to children
      aged 0-3 years and investigate the association between dispensing of alimemazine 
      to children and dispensed hypnotics to their parents. DESIGN: An observational
      cohort study linking information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and
      the Norwegian Prescription Database. Hypnotics dispensed to parents in a 1-year
      period before pregnancy was associated with dispensed alimemazine for children
      aged 0-3 years. PATIENTS AND SETTING: All children born in Norway in 2008 (N=59
      325) and their mothers and fathers were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Dispensed alimemazine to children during the first 3 years of life. RESULTS:
      Three percent of children received alimemazine. Dispensed hypnotics to mothers
      increased the risk of the child receiving a prescription for alimemazine, OR of
      2.3 (1.7-3.0) for boys and 1.7 (1.2-2.4) for girls. When both parents had been
      dispensed prescriptions for hypnotics, the risk increased nearly threefold. A
      dispensed alimemazine prescription was also associated with dispensed
      prescriptions for antidepressants to both mother and father, mother's smoking,
      the child's gender and child's prescriptions for antibiotics, respiratory drugs
      and dermatological steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Dispensed alimemazine to children under
      3 was associated with parents' previous use of hypnotics, indicating that factors
      other than the child's health influence the use of hypnotic drugs in infancy and 
      toddler years. The frequent usage of alimemazine in children below 3 years and
      the association with parents' use of hypnotics should concern prescribing
      doctors.

TI  - Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography in male newborns <30 weeks' of
      gestation and unfavourable neurodevelopmental outcome at three years is less
      mature when compared to females.
PG  - e443-8
LID - 10.1111/apa.12334 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate gender-related differences in amplitude-integrated
      electroencephalography (aEEG) associated with neurodevelopmental outcome at 3
      years. METHODS: Preterms born <30 weeks' gestational age between 2000 and 2002
      were prospectively included. aEEGs obtained within the first 2 weeks of life were
      classified according to aEEG composite scores - including background pattern,
      sleep-wake cycling (SWC) and seizure activity. Neurodevelopmental outcome was
      assessed at 3 years of age. RESULTS: Neurodevelopmental outcome data was
      available for 148 of 264 eligible infants - 64 showed a normal outcome and 84 an 
      impaired outcome. A logistic regression model revealed a significant independent 
      influence of IVH, analgetic/sedative/anticonvulsant medication, gestational age
      and gender on aEEG composite scores. Odds ratios for having an abnormal aEEG
      composite score within the first 2 weeks of life for 'female sex', 'no IVH', 'no 
      medication' and 'gestational age' were calculated. aEEG did not differ between
      males and females with normal outcomes. In patients with abnormal outcome,
      however, male preterms showed more burst-suppression patterns and less SWC when
      compared with female preterms. CONCLUSION: Being male with an abnormal outcome at
      3 years of age is reflected by a less mature early aEEG when compared with the
      one of females. This association is independent of IVH and medication and was
      less evident with increasing gestational age.

LID - 10.1111/apa.12330 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the impact of moderate noise on the sleep of very early preterm 
      infants (VPI). METHODS: Observational study of 26 VPI of 26-31 weeks' gestation, 
      with prospective measurements of sound pressure level and concomitant video
      records. Sound peaks were identified and classified according to their
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above background noise. Prechtl's arousal states
      during sound peaks were assessed by two observers blinded to the purpose of the
      study. Changes in sleep/arousal states following sound peaks were compared with
      spontaneous changes during randomly selected periods without sound peaks.
      RESULTS: We identified 598 isolated sound peaks (5 </= SNR < 10 decibel slow
      response A (dBA), n = 518; 10 </= SNR < 15 dBA, n = 80) during sleep. Awakenings 
      were observed during 33.8% (95% CI, 24-43.7%) of exposures to sound peaks of 5-10
      dBA SNR and 39.7% (95% CI, 26-53.3%) of exposures to sound peaks of SNR 10-15
      dBA, but only 11.7% (95% CI, 6.2-17.1%) of control periods. The proportions of
      awakenings following sound peaks were higher than the proportions of arousals
      during control periods (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate acoustic changes can
      disrupt the sleep of VPI, and efficient sound abatement measures are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the association between breastfeeding and 
      postpartum depression. SOURCES: A review of literature found on MEDLINE/PubMed
      database. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The literature consistently shows that
      breastfeeding provides a wide range of benefits for both the child and the
      mother. The psychological benefits for the mother are still in need of further
      research. Some studies point out that pregnancy depression is one of the factors 
      that may contribute to breastfeeding failure. Others studies also suggest an
      association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression; the direction of
      this association is still unclear. Breastfeeding can promote hormonal processes
      that protect mothers against postpartum depression by attenuating cortisol
      response to stress. It can also reduce the risk of postpartum depression, by
      helping the regulation of sleep and wake patterns for mother and child, improving
      mother's self-efficacy and her emotional involvement with the child, reducing the
      child's temperamental difficulties, and promoting a better interaction between
      mother and child. CONCLUSIONS: Studies demonstrate that breastfeeding can protect
      mothers from postpartum depression, and are starting to clarify which biological 
      and psychological processes may explain this protection. However, there are still
      equivocal results in the literature that may be explained by the methodological
      limitations presented by some studies.

TI  - Rising obesity-related hospital admissions among children and young people in
      England: national time trends study.
PG  - e65764

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the trends in hospital admissions associated with obesity 
      as a primary diagnosis and comorbidity, and bariatric surgery procedures among
      children and young people in England. DESIGN: National time trends study of
      hospital admissions data between 2000 and 2009. PARTICIPANTS: Children and young 
      people aged 5 to 19 years who were admitted to hospital with any diagnosis of
      obesity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age- and sex-specific admission rates per million
      children. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2009, age- and sex-specific hospital
      admission rates in 5-19 year olds for total obesity-related diagnoses increased
      more than four-fold from 93.0 (95% CI 86.0 to 100.0) per million children to
      414.0 (95% CI 410.7 to 417.5) per million children, largely due to rising
      admissions where obesity was mentioned as a co-morbidity. The median age of
      admission to hospital over the study period was 14.0 years; 5,566 (26.7%)
      admissions were for obesity and 15,319 (73.3%) mentioned obesity as a
      comorbidity. Admissions were more common in girls than boys (56.2% v 43.8%). The 
      most common reasons for admission where obesity was a comorbid condition were
      sleep apnoea, asthma, and complications of pregnancy. The number of bariatric
      surgery procedures has risen from 1 per year in 2000 to 31 in 2009, with the
      majority were performed in obese girls (75.6%) aged 13-19 years. CONCLUSIONS:
      Hospital admission rates for obesity and related comorbid conditions have
      increased more than four-fold over the past decade amongst children and young
      people. Although some of the increase is likely to be due to improved case
      ascertainment, conditions associated with obesity in children and young people
      are imposing greater challenges for health care providers in English hospitals.
      Most inpatient care is directed at dealing with associated conditions rather than
      primary assessment and management of obesity itself.

TI  - Deformational plagiocephaly at birth: an observational study on the role of
      assisted reproductive technologies.
PG  - 270-4
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2013.814629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Following the "back to sleep" recommendations, a striking rise in
      deformational plagiocephaly (DP) occurred. However, additional maternal,
      pregnancy and infant conditions may play a role. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate
      the prevalence of and risk factors for DP at birth. Additionally, given the
      association between assisted reproductive technologies (ART) use and unfavorable 
      pregnancy events, we explored the association between ART and DP. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A total of 413 neonates >33 weeks born at L. Sacco Hospital (Milan,
      Italy) from May 2011 through to January 2012 were enrolled. Data regarding
      parental, conceivement, pregnancy and delivery characteristics were recorded.
      Infants' skull measurements, including the oblique cranial length ratio (OCLR)
      were taken within 72 h after birth. Plagiocephaly was defined for OCLR > 105.9.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of DP was 20.3%. It was associated with twinning (OR 5.0;
      95%CI 2.22-11.1), pregnancy complications (OR 2.86; 95%CI 1.49-5.26), prematurity
      (OR 2.13; 95%CI 0.98-4.54), ART use (OR 2.00; 95%CI 0.90-4.35) and male gender
      (OR 1.79; 95%CI 0.94-2.50). Adjusting for multiple pregnancies however, the
      association between ART and DP disappeared. CONCLUSION: Results show that
      offspring of pregnancies conceived through ART do not have increased risk of DP. 
      However, our numbers are small thus larger studies are needed for definitive
      conclusions.

AB  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy and a fairly
      lifelong disorder that may significantly lower a patient's expectations and
      potential for a full life. Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and
      up to 85% of patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among
      anticonvulsants, valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may
      be poorly tolerated by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant
      women. Alternatives have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but
      also topiramate, zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy
      may be useful or even required. One should not forget the potential aggravation
      induced not only by some commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine 
      and oxcarbazepine, but also, in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special
      settings, older drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But
      the management of JME should also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict 
      avoidance of sleep deprivation and the management of copathologies, including the
      cognitive and psychiatric problems that are often encountered. With adequate
      management, there will only remain a small proportion of patients with
      uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its related problems. Juvenile myoclonic
      epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician has a fair chance of significantly
      helping the patient with medication and counseling.

TI  - Evidence for a relationship between chronotype and reproductive function in
      women.
PG  - 756-65
LID - 10.3109/07420528.2012.763043 [doi]
AB  - There is evidence for the reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillation
      and reproduction, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with
      impaired menstrual functions and reduced fertility in women. However, only little
      information is available on the relationship between reproduction and chronotype.
      The aim of the present study is to better assess this relationship. The
      participants (aged 25 to 74 yrs) were selected randomly from the Finnish
      Population Information System. The data from 2672 female participants of the
      National FINRISK Survey 2007 were analyzed to test the associations between
      chronotype (morning, intermediate, or evening) and reproductive features. Of the 
      participants, 139 (5.6%) were evening, 1217 (48.7%) intermediate, and 1145
      (45.8%) morning chronotypes. Among the participants aged 25 to 54 yrs, the
      duration of menstrual cycle was longer among evening chronotypes (28.8 +/- 4.4 d)
      than among morning (27.7 +/- 2.6 d; p < 0.01) and intermediate (27.8 +/- 3.3 d; p
      = 0.05) chronotypes. Significant correlations were found between the higher
      morningness-eveningness scores (the more of morning chronotype) and the shorter
      durations of menstrual bleeding, both in the whole sample (p < 0.001) and after
      limiting the analyses to women younger than 55 yrs (p < 0.05). In multivariable
      analyses on the whole sample, as compared with morning chronotypes, intermediate 
      chronotypes had a significantly longer duration of menstrual bleeding (B = 0.160,
      95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.044 to 0.276; p < 0.01) as well as a higher odds
      for difficulties in getting pregnant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.464, 95% CI = 1.118 to 
      1.917; p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that chronotype is related to the
      reproductive function in women.

TI  - Anatomical factors causing oedema of the lower limb during pregnancy.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the morphology of the 
      common iliac artery and vein (CIA&V) comparing right and left sides in females
      versus males. Pregnant women favour lying on one side at rest and during sleep.
      The reason for this may be due to the morphology and orientation between the
      CIA&V. Virtually all women during their pregnancy suffer from lower limb
      swelling. This study provides an anatomical explanation for the propensity to lie
      consistently on one side, for lower limb swelling, and offers prevention
      measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted on anatomical 
      texts, atlases, journals, and websites regarding the morphology and orientation
      of the right and left CIA&V, lower limb oedema, and sleeping positions during
      pregnancy. Measurements from 15 dissected cadavers were conducted on the right
      and left CIA&V. RESULTS: The literature search revealed very limited studies on
      the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA&V with no studies
      relating this orientation to lower limb oedema or sleeping positions during
      pregnancy. Cadaver dissection revealed a relatively direct anterior to posterior 
      orientation left CIA&V and an oblique lateral to medial right CIA&V. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study suggests an explanation of why women lie on their left side when
      resting and sleeping during the third trimester due to the clinically relevant
      anatomy between the CIA&V.

TI  - Can we predict sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy? The clinical utility of
      symptoms.
PG  - 670-8
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12063 [doi]
AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is reported commonly during pregnancy and is
      associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but the
      majority of these data are based upon self-report measures not validated for
      pregnancy. This study examined the predictive value of screening questionnaires
      for SDB administered at two time-points in pregnancy, and attempted to develop an
      'optimized predictive model' for detecting SDB in pregnancy. A total of 380 women
      were recruited from an antenatal clinic in the second trimester of pregnancy. All
      participants completed the Berlin Questionnaire and the Multivariable Apnea Risk 
      Index (MAP Index) at recruitment, with a subset of 43 women repeating the
      questionnaires at the time of polysomnography at 37 weeks' gestation. Fifteen of 
      43 (35%) women were confirmed to have a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 5
      h(-1) . Prediction of an RDI > 5 h(-1) was most accurate during the second
      trimester for both the Berlin Questionnaire (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.50, 
      positive predictive value 0.50 and negative predictive value 0.93), and the MAP
      Index [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.768]. A 
      stepwise selection model identified snoring volume, a body mass index (BMI)>/=32 
      kg m(-2) and tiredness upon awakening as the strongest independent predictors of 
      SDB during pregnancy; this model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.952. We
      conclude that existing clinical prediction models for SDB perform inadequately as
      a screening tool in pregnancy. The development of a highly predictive model from 
      our data shows promise for a quick and easy screening tool to be validated for
      future use in pregnancy.

AB  - Nutritional state in the gestation period influences fetal growth and
      development. We hypothesized that undernutrition during gestation would affect
      offspring sleep architecture and/or homeostasis. Pregnant female mice were
      assigned to either control (fed ad libitum; AD) or 50% dietary restriction (DR)
      groups from gestation day 12 to parturition. After parturition, dams were fed AD 
      chow. After weaning, the pups were also fed AD into adulthood. At adulthood (aged
      8-9 weeks), we carried out sleep recordings. Although offspring mice displayed a 
      significantly reduced body weight at birth, their weights recovered three days
      after birth. Enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA)
      during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was observed in the DR mice over a
      24-hour period without changing the diurnal pattern or amounts of wake, NREM, or 
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, DR mice also displayed an
      enhancement of EEG-SWA rebound after a 6-hour sleep deprivation and a higher
      threshold for waking in the face of external stimuli. DR adult offspring mice
      exhibited small but significant increases in the expression of hypothalamic
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparalpha) and brain-specific
      carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1c) mRNA, two genes involved in lipid
      metabolism. Undernutrition during pregnancy may influence sleep homeostasis, with
      offspring exhibiting greater sleep pressure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the timing of hospital discharge, time to outpatient
      follow-up, and home care practices (breastfeeding initiation and continuation,
      tobacco smoke exposure, supine sleep position) for late-preterm (LPT; 34 0/7-36
      6/7 weeks) and early-term (ET; 37 0/7-38/6/7 weeks) infants with term infants.
      METHODS: We analyzed 2000-2008 data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. chi(2) Analyses were
      used to measure differences in maternal and infant characteristics, hospital
      discharge, outpatient care, and home care among LPT, ET, and term infants. We
      calculated adjusted risk ratios for the risk of adverse care outcomes among LPT
      and ET infants compared with term infants. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, LPT
      infants were less likely to be discharged early compared with term infants,
      whereas there was no difference for ET infants (risk ratio [RR; 95% confidence
      interval (CI)]: 0.65 [0.54-0.79]; 0.95 [0.88-1.02]). [corrected]. LPT and ET
      infants were more likely to have timely outpatient follow-up (1.07 [1.06-1.08];
      1.02 [1.02-1.03]), more likely to experience maternal tobacco smoke exposure
      (1.09 [1.05-1.14]; 1.08 [1.06-1.11]), less likely to be initially breastfed (0.95
      [0.94-0.97]; 0.98 [0.97-0.98]), less likely to be breastfed for >/=10 weeks (0.88
      [0.86-0.90]; 0.94 [0.93-0.96]), and less likely to be placed in a supine sleep
      position (0.95 [0.93-0.97]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Given that LPT and ET
      infants bear an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, greater efforts are
      needed to ensure safe and healthy posthospitalization and home care practices for
      these vulnerable infants.

TI  - Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity: the role of early life
      risk factors.
PG  - 731-8
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.85 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE Many early life risk factors for childhood obesity are more prevalent 
      among blacks and Hispanics than among whites and may explain the higher
      prevalence of obesity among racial/ethnic minority children. OBJECTIVE To examine
      the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in adiposity and overweight are
      explained by differences in risk factors during pregnancy (gestational diabetes
      and depression), infancy (rapid infant weight gain, feeding other than exclusive 
      breastfeeding, and early introduction of solid foods), and early childhood
      (sleeping &lt;12 h/d, presence of a television set in the room where the child
      sleeps, and any intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or fast food). DESIGN
      Prospective prebirth cohort study. SETTING Multisite group practice in
      Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS Participants included 1116 mother-child pairs (63%
      white, 17% black, and 4% Hispanic) EXPOSURE Mother's report of child's
      race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age- and sex-specific body mass index 
      (BMI) z score, total fat mass index from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and
      overweight or obesity, defined as a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher at age 7
      years. RESULTS Black (0.48 U [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64]) and Hispanic (0.43 [0.12 to 
      0.74]) children had higher BMI z scores, as well as higher total fat mass index
      and overweight/obesity prevalence, than white children. After adjustment for
      socioeconomic confounders and parental BMI, differences in BMI z score were
      attenuated for black and Hispanic children (0.22 U [0.05 to 0.40] and 0.22 U
      [-0.08 to 0.52], respectively). Adjustment for pregnancy risk factors did not
      substantially change these estimates. However, after further adjustment for
      infancy and childhood risk factors, we observed only minimal differences in BMI z
      scores between whites, blacks (0.07 U [-0.11 to 0.26]), and Hispanics (0.04 U
      [-0.27 to 0.35]). We observed similar attenuation of racial/ethnic differences in
      adiposity and prevalence of overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
      Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood adiposity and obesity are determined by
      factors operating in infancy and early childhood. Efforts to reduce obesity
      disparities should focus on preventing early life risk factors.

TI  - Poor sleep maintenance and subjective sleep quality are associated with
      postpartum maternal depression symptom severity.
PG  - 539-47
LID - 10.1007/s00737-013-0356-9 [doi]
AB  - Women are at increased risk of developing mood disorders during the postpartum
      period, and poor postpartum sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for the
      development of depression. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship 
      between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy
      and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited
      from their outpatient obstetricians' offices from July 2009 through March 2010.
      Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy
      and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing
      sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at
      the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly
      predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks (p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of
      sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time
      after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores
      postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration
      and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep
      maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep,
      is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective
      assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression
      symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted
      sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression
      symptoms.

TI  - Comparison the effect of Sleep Positioning on Cardiorespiratory Rate in
      Noninvasive Ventilated Premature Infants.
PG  - 182-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of several studies suggest that prone position is beneficial 
      in improving the preterm infants' cardio-respiratory status. Previous studies
      showed opposite results, and also there is not any available clear study about
      the effect of this position on cardio-respiratory rates of Nasal Continuous
      Positive Airway Pressure (N-CPAP) treating premature infants. OBJECTIVES: This
      study aimed at comparing supine and prone positions on cardio-respiratory rates
      of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who were treated
      using N-CPAP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a cross over study which was
      performed in 2010 on 44 hospitalized 29-34 weeks gestation premature infants who 
      were receiving N-CPAP in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Al-Zahra Hospital of
      Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Infants were randomly assigned into two
      groups, and the first group was placed in prone at first and then in supine, and 
      the position of second group was at first supine and then prone. Infants' Heart
      Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR) were assessed three times in each position
      for 30 minutes. The data was recorded in a data-collection form, and demographic 
      data was analyzed using t test, Chi square and Fisher exact test. Also, repeated 
      measurement ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests were used. RESULTS: There was a
      significant difference in HR and RR of premature infants who were similar in
      gestational age and clinical condition and placed in two positions. Premature
      infants' HR and RR became lower at prone position than supine in both groups. So 
      it can be concluded that prone position could decrease infants HR and RR, but
      supine position might increase them (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings support 
      prone positioning for premature infants. Therefore, it is advisable to NICU staff
      that if there is no obstacle for changing the infant's position, prone position
      in infants with respiratory complications during receiving N-CPAP in NICU can be 
      useful. Regarding the fact that prone position is a risk factor for sudden infant
      death syndrome , prone position should be only used when the newborn is being
      supervised carefully.

      including cardiovascular collapse. Diverse stimuli trigger the release of
      vasoactive substances and parturients with systemic mastocytosis are at high risk
      for precipitating mast cell degranulation. As a result, women with systemic
      mastocytosis should have an anaesthetic plan for labour and delivery. Anxiety,
      stress, sleep deprivation, pain and numerous pharmacological agents are all
      triggers for mast cell degranulation. For pain relief in labour, epidural
      analgesia is recommended. Pharmacological agents with a high potential for
      triggering mast cell degranulation should be avoided. This is particularly
      important in the case of an emergency caesarean section. Resuscitation equipment 
      must be available should life-threatening haemodynamic instability occur during
      surgery. We report the case of a pregnant woman with systemic mastocytosis who
      required emergency caesarean section.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian
      phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase
      angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across
      the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between
      circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive
      disorder (MDD). METHODS: Twelve women (age+/-SD=26.9+/-5 years) who fulfilled
      DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were
      studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants
      completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood
      assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate
      weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and
      6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase. RESULTS: Nine women had DLMO phase
      shifts >/=30 min. On average+/-SD, new mothers phase delayed 42+/-80 min
      (range=163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between
      average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum
      compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were
      going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian
      measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6.
      LIMITATIONS: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require 
      replication. CONCLUSIONS: We observed individual differences in magnitude and
      direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the
      perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive
      symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian
      rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders.

TI  - A study of postpartum depression and maternal risk factors in Qatar.
PG  - 90-7
LID - 10.3109/0167482X.2013.786036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between
      maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in 
      Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a
      structured questionnaire. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379
      postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare
      centers of the State of Qatar. RESULTS: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the
      studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the 
      risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as
      education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the
      maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and
      other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease,
      threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD.
      Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to
      feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently
      reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be
      experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal
      complications. CONCLUSION: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied 
      in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal
      complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, 
      especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick
      access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

TI  - Mood disorders and complementary and alternative medicine: a literature review.
PG  - 639-58
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S43419 [doi]
AB  - Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with
      considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic
      costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major
      depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and
      psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has
      been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients 
      with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data
      on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google
      Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant
      articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the
      past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, 
      St John's wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture,
      mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are 
      effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B
      complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in
      physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies
      support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and
      docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms 
      are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar
      depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women
      with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline,
      inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in 
      bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression 
      and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should
      be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have
      the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled
      trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be
      used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant
      depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of
      mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such
      treatments are effective.

TI  - Habitual snoring and depressive symptoms during pregnancy.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-13-113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is frequently observed in patients with untreated
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the general population. Pregnant women are
      particularly vulnerable since pregnancy increases the risk of both SDB and
      depressive symptoms. However, no study has investigated whether SDB symptoms
      prior to or in early pregnancy are associated with such mood problems. METHODS: A
      retrospective chart review of pregnant women. Women were included if they
      attended prenatal clinics between June 2007 and July 2010, were >/=18 years old, 
      pregnant with a single fetus, and had been screened for habitual snoring as well 
      as depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS).
      RESULTS: In total, 362 women were included and 32.3% reported habitual snoring.
      Twenty-nine percent of women had an EPDS score >/=10. Significantly more snoring 
      women, compared to non-snorers, had an EPDS score >/=10 (42.7% vs. 22.9%, p <
      0.001) despite the mean EPDS values not reaching statistical significance (6.1
      +/- 4.9 vs. 5.4 +/- 5.0, p = 0.2). In a logistic regression model controlling for
      parity, the presence of pre-pregnancy obesity, presence of a partner, sleep
      quality, African American race, maternal educational level, pre-eclampsia, and
      diabetes, snoring was independently associated with a prenatal EPDS score >/=10
      (O.R. 2.0, 95%CI 1.13-3.46; p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Maternal snoring may be a
      risk factor for prenatal depressive symptoms. Further investigation of the
      temporal relationship between maternal snoring and depressive symptoms is
      warranted.

      foetal brain.

AB  - Neuroactive steroid concentrations are remarkably high in the foetal brain during
      late gestation. These concentrations are maintained by placental progesterone
      synthesis and the interaction of enzymes in the placenta and foetal brain.
      5alpha-Pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) is a key neuroactive steroid 
      during foetal life, although other 3alpha-hydroxy-pregnanes may make an
      additional contribution to neuroactive steroid action. Allopregnanolone modulates
      GABAergic inhibition to maintain a suppressive action on the foetal brain during 
      late gestation. This action suppresses foetal behaviour and maintains the
      appropriate balance of foetal sleep-like behaviours, which in turn are important 
      to normal neurodevelopment. Neuroactive steroid-induced suppression of
      excitability has a key role in protecting the foetal brain from acute
      hypoxia/ischaemia insults. Hypoxia-induced brain injury is markedly increased if 
      neuroactive steroid levels are suppressed and there is increased seizure
      activity. There is also a rapid increase in allopregnanolone synthesis and hence 
      levels in response to acute stress that acts as an endogenous protective
      mechanism. Allopregnanolone has a trophic role in regulating development,
      maintaining normal levels of apoptosis and increasing myelination during late
      gestation in the brain. In contrast, chronic foetal stressors, including
      intrauterine growth restriction, do not increase neuroactive steroid levels in
      the brain and exposure to repeated synthetic corticosteroids reduce neuroactive
      steroid levels. The reduced availability of neuroactive steroids may contribute
      to the adverse effects of chronic stressors on the foetal and newborn brain.
      Preterm birth also deprives the foetus of neuroactive steroid mediated protection
      and may increase vulnerability to brain injury and suboptimal development. These 
      finding suggest replacement therapies should be explored. This article is part of
      a Special Issue entitled 'Pregnancy and steroids'.

AB  - Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory
      animals, and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT)
      binding in abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many
      different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence
      for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory,
      prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired.
      Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus,
      parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised 
      reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in
      sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and
      psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take
      Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological
      deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by
      serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing
      slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, 
      abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral
      functions with a serotonergic component.

TI  - Metabolic circadian rhythms in embryonic turtles.
PG  - 175-82
LID - 10.1093/icb/ict040 [doi]
AB  - Oviparous species are model organisms for investigating embryonic development of 
      endogenous physiological circadian rhythms without the influence of maternal
      biorhythms. Recent studies have demonstrated that heart rates and metabolic rates
      of embryonic turtles are not constant or always maximal and can be altered in
      response to the presence of embryos at a more advanced stage of development
      within the nest. A first step in understanding the physiological mechanisms
      underpinning these responses in embryonic ectothermic organisms is to develop
      metabolic profiles (e.g., heart rate) at different temperatures throughout
      incubation. Heart beat and rhythmic patterns or changes in development may
      represent important signals or cues within a nest and may be vital to coordinate 
      synchronous hatching well in advance of the final stages of incubation. We
      developed baseline embryonic heart-rate profiles of embryos of the short-necked
      Murray River turtle (Emydura macquarii) to determine the stage of embryogenesis
      that metabolic circadian rhythms become established, if at all. Eggs were
      incubated at constant temperatures (26 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and heart
      rates were monitored at 6-h intervals over 24 h every 7-11 days until hatching.
      Circadian heart rate rhythms were detected at the mid-gestation period and were
      maintained until hatching. Heart rates throughout the day varied by up to 20%
      over 24 h and were not related to time of day. This study demonstrated that
      endogenous metabolic circadian rhythms in developing embryos in turtle eggs
      establish earlier in embryogenesis than those documented in other vertebrate taxa
      during embryogenesis. Early establishment of circadian rhythms in heart rates may
      be critical for communication among embryos and synchrony in hatching and
      emergence from the nest.

TI  - Is there a role for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in pregnancy?
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1111/1440-1681.12106 [doi]
AB  - 1. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been used in pregnancy for
      just over 20 years now and is generally well tolerated. Normal values have been
      established for different gestations; these are slightly higher than conventional
      blood pressure (BP) in normal pregnancy, presumably reflecting greater activity
      during the 24 h of ABPM recordings. 2. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a 
      better predictor than conventional BP for the development of pre-eclampsia and
      fetal growth restriction, but it is not sensitive or specific enough to be
      recommended for these purposes in routine practice. 3. Studies of ABPM have shown
      that sleep hypertension is common in women with gestational hypertension or
      pre-eclampsia, but detecting this in routine clinical practice does not aid usual
      decision making in the pregnancy, including timing of delivery. 4. Studies using 
      ABPM have found that pregnant women who are working outside the home have higher 
      BP than non-working women, but these data should not be interpreted to mean that 
      not working during pregnancy will prevent gestational hypertension or
      pre-eclampsia. 5. The best role for ABPM is to determine whether women with
      office hypertension in early pregnancy have true (usually essential) hypertension
      or white-coat hypertension. The latter can be managed without antihypertensives
      and pregnancy outcomes appear good, although possibly with a slightly increased
      incidence of pre-eclampsia. 6. Women who have had pre-eclampsia are at greater
      life-time risk for cardiovascular diseases; several years postpartum these women 
      have slightly higher ABPM-measured BP than women who had normal pregnancies and a
      greater propensity to metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Functional bimodality in the brain networks of preterm and term human newborns.
PG  - 2657-68
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bht120 [doi]
AB  - The spontaneous brain activity exhibits long-range spatial correlations detected 
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in newborns when (1)
      long neuronal pathways are still developing, and (2) the electrical brain
      activity consists of developmentally unique, intermittent events believed to
      guide activity-dependent brain wiring. We studied this spontaneous electrical
      brain activity using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) of premature and
      fullterm babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration
      during last months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes
      were found to follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain
      activity exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the
      developmentally essential high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial
      correlations. There were no clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but
      clear frontal and parieto-occipital modules at term age. A significant
      fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the development of the graph measure
      clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality was found in the fMRI
      recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early EEG activity and fMRI
      signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The results are
      compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits intermittent 
      long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous guidance for
      early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

TI  - Sleep disordered breathing and gestational hypertension: postpartum follow-up
      study.
PG  - 717-721B
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2634 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a newly recognized risk factor for
      adverse cardiovascular events later in life. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is 
      an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has
      suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, 
      but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum
      state. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased
      rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of 
      pregnancy resolve. METHODS: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated
      pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants
      were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory
      disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects (11
      GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with
      antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. 
      Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum
      (12.0 +/- 12.3 vs. 2.9 +/- 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the
      same change (2.8 +/- 5.3 vs. 2.1 +/- 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons
      showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of
      healthy women (P = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: SDB in women with gestational hypertension
      improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy
      subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a 
      pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

AB  - In pediatrics recording of EEG can range from premature infants aged just 25
      weeks of gestation to young adults. Recording EEG in pediatrics ranges from 25
      weeks of gestation premature in the incubator to young adults. Hence, recording
      conditions need to be adapted to very different situations, not only of age but
      also of environment, asepsis, and behavior.This requires that recording
      conditions be adapted to very different situations, not only of age but also of
      environment, asepsis and behavior. The two major determinants of EEG features are
      the level of vigilance and age. Standard examination includes spontaneous sleep
      until the age of 5 years, and hyperventilation and intermittent light stimulation
      in older children. Hyperventilation may modify the tracing in a physiological way
      until adolescence. One of the major characteristics of a child's EEG recording is
      its course over time that parallels rapid brain maturation. EEG changes are
      particularly rapid in early age and they involve both temporal and spatial
      organization. In premature babies modifications appear by two 2 weeks, in infancy
      by 1 month and in childhood by 1 year, before reaching the adult patterns at an
      age varying between 8 and 12 years of age. Apart from being aware of the normal
      EEG patterns according to thein children of different ages, it is important to
      recognize unusual patterns that are not linked to a pathological situation. Most 
      important are the interpretation and the conclusion of the EEG tracing and any
      conclusions reached, for which and a precise knowledge besides clinical
      information is mandatory for this purpose is essential.

TI  - Revisiting physiologic and psychologic triggers that increase spasticity.
PG  - 357-69
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to systematically identify and summarize
      the literature examining the impact of physiologic and psychologic triggers on
      spasticity and discuss the evidence supporting various types of triggers. DESIGN:
      PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases were searched using specific keyword 
      combinations. Only studies using clinical tests or self-reports of spasticity
      were included. RESULTS: A total of 1152 articles were scanned for relevance, and 
      of 44 relevant articles, 24 were reviewed. Pregnancy, posture, cold, circadian
      rhythm, and skin conditions increased spasticity and were measured using
      objective clinical tests. Self-reports of spasticity suggest that triggers such
      as bowel- and bladder-related issues, menstrual cycle, mental stress, and tight
      clothing can all increase spasticity. No literature evidence of increase in
      spasticity in response to heterotopic ossification, hemorrhoids, deep vein
      thrombosis, fever, and sleep patterns was found. CONCLUSIONS: Although
      self-reports indicate a strong possibility of increasing spasticity, without
      objective examination, the true effects of these triggers on spasticity remain
      inconclusive. Most studies reviewed here were performed in the spinal cord injury
      population; therefore, it is not known whether these triggers induce similar
      effects in persons with other neurologic etiologies.

TI  - Perinatal and early childhood factors for overweight and obesity in young
      Canadian children.
PG  - e69-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed potential early-life factors and their
      interrelationships with obesity among young Canadian children. METHODS: Data from
      a nationally representative sample of children aged 6 to 11 years in the Canadian
      Health Measures Survey were analyzed. The associations of perinatal and early
      childhood behaviours and socio-economic factors with overweight or obesity were
      evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Adjusted population
      attributable risk fractions (PARFs) were calculated using multivariate logistic
      regression models. RESULTS: Of 968 term-born children, 21% were overweight and
      another 13% were obese. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio,
      2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.15) was positively associated with obesity.
      This association was mediated by birth weight (suppression effect); once
      controlled, the strength of the association between smoking and child obesity
      increased by 12%. Birth weight per 100 g (1.05; 1.005-1.09) was significantly
      associated with obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (0.44; 0.31-0.61), 
      adequate sleep hours (0.39; 0.16-0.94) and being physically active (0.50;
      0.26-0.93) were found to be protective. Breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, 
      significantly reduced obesity risk among children whose mothers never smoked in
      pregnancy. PARFs indicated that 24.4%, 11.5%, 11.3% and 6.0% prevalent cases of
      child obesity might be prevented by exclusive breastfeeding, smoking cessation
      during pregnancy, adequate sleep during childhood, and avoiding high birth
      weight, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified multiple perinatal and
      childhood factors associated with obesity in young Canadian children. Effective
      prevention strategies targeting four modifiable maternal and child risk factors
      may reduce childhood obesity by up to 54% in Canada.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy: a review of the physiology and potential
      role for positional therapy.
PG  - 31-7
LID - 10.1007/s11325-013-0849-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) has been shown to be associated with
      negative clinical sequelae such as systemic hypertension and cardiovascular
      disease. It has been reported in the literature that approximately 53-56 % of
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have positional OSA, known as POSA.
      POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR SDB IN PREGNANCY: These findings have led to a resurgence
      of positional therapy as an effective treatment for select patients with SDB.
      Pregnant patients can also be diagnosed with SDB, the negative consequences of
      which not only pertain to the patient but to the unborn fetus as well. Despite
      this, however, SDB is under-diagnosed in pregnant patients and research looking
      at SDB in pregnant patients and potential therapies are scarce. CONCLUSIONS: This
      article reviews the literature regarding the physiologic respiratory changes that
      occur during pregnancy, SDB in pregnancy, supine hypotensive syndrome (SHS),
      complications and current treatments for these events and potential roles for
      positional therapy in pregnant women whose problems may be specifically position 
      dependent.

TI  - Biological rhythms and preeclampsia.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2013.00047 [doi]
AB  - The impact of impaired circadian rhythm on health has been widely studied in
      shift workers and trans-meridian travelers. A part from its correlation with
      sleep and mood disorders, biological rhythm impairment is a recognized risk
      factor for cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer. Preeclampsia is a major
      public health issue, associated with a significant maternal and fetal morbidity
      and mortality worldwide. While the risks factors for this condition such as
      obesity, diabetes, pre-existing hypertension have been identified, the underlying
      mechanism of this multi-factorial disease is yet not fully understood. The
      disruption of the light/dark cycle in pregnancy has been associated with adverse 
      outcomes. Slightly increased risk for "small for gestational age" babies, "low
      birth weight" babies, and preterm deliveries has been reported in shift working
      women. Whether altered circadian cycle represents a risk factor for preeclampsia 
      or preeclampsia is itself linked with an abnormal circadian cycle is less clear. 
      There are only few reports available, showing conflicting results. In this
      review, we will discuss recent observations concerning circadian pattern of blood
      pressure in normotensive and hypertensive pregnancies. We explore the hypothesis 
      that circadian misalignments may represent a risk factor for preeclampsia.
      Unraveling potential link between circadian clock gene and preeclampsia could
      offer a novel approach to our understanding of this multi-system disease specific
      to pregnancy.

      association with fetal adiposity.
PG  - 483-91
LID - 10.1002/dmrr.2417 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the circadian rhythm maturation of temperature, activity
      and sleep during the first year of life in offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM)
      and its relationship with obesity markers. METHODS: A prospective analysis of the
      children of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 gestational diabetes mellitus
      (GDM) controlled with diet and 19 GDM with insulin). Fetal abdominal
      circumference was evaluated ecographically during gestation. Skin temperature and
      rest-activity rhythms were monitored for 3 consecutive days in children at 15
      days and 1, 3 and 6 months. Anthropometrical parameters of the children were
      evaluated during the first year of life. RESULTS: Children from the GDM groups
      tended to higher fetal abdominal circumference z-score than controls at the
      beginning of the last trimester (p = 0.077) and at delivery (p = 0.078). Mean
      skin temperature or activity was not different among the groups. The I < O sleep 
      index pointed to increasing concordance with parental sleeping at 3 and 6 months 
      but no significant GDM-dependent differences. However, some of the parameters
      that define temperature maturation and also the circadian function index from the
      temperature-activity variable were significantly lower at 6 months in the GDM +
      insulin group. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score, as a predictor of fetal
      adiposity, correlated negatively with parameters related to circadian rhythm
      maturation as the circadian/ultradian rhythm (P1 /Pult ratio). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal
      adiposity correlated with a worse circadian rhythm regulation in ODM. In
      addition, ODM insulin-treated showed a disturbed pattern of the circadian
      function index of temperature activity at 6 months of age.

TI  - Do pregnant women accurately report sleep time? A comparison between
      self-reported and objective measures of sleep duration in pregnancy among a
      sample of urban mothers.
PG  - 1323-7
LID - 10.1007/s11325-013-0835-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Survey questions are commonly used to assess sleep duration because of
      their low cost and convenience. Responses to these questions correlate moderately
      with objectively measured sleep duration in nonpregnant individuals, but little
      is known about the validity of self-reported sleep measures in pregnancy. The aim
      of the present study was to determine the extent to which self-reported
      gestational sleep duration assessed by questionnaire predicted objectively
      measured gestational sleep duration via actigraphy. METHODS: We analyzed data
      from 80 mothers enrolled in an ancillary study of Project BABIES, a prospective
      cohort study of urban, pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in
      midpregnancy and included 7 days of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and survey
      questions about sleep time adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
      RESULTS: Mean measured gestational sleep duration derived from actigraphy was
      6.87 h [standard deviation (SD) 0.87], and questionnaire-assessed nocturnal sleep
      time averaged 7.29 h (SD 1.84). While the difference between measures did not
      reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 for paired samples t test), over half
      (62 %) of participants reported a habitual average nightly sleep time that
      differed more than 1 h from their average actigraphically measured sleep duration
      (39 % overestimated by more than an hour; 23 % underestimated by more than an
      hour). There was no correlation between measures (r = 0.007; 95 % confidence
      interval -0.21, 0.23). CONCLUSION: Questionnaire-derived reports of usual sleep
      hours do not reflect objectively measured sleep time in urban, pregnant women.
      Actigraphy is preferable to accurately assess gestational sleep duration.

AB  - Over 25,000 epileptic women deliver viable pregnancies each year in the United
      States. Although medical management is the first line of treatment, many
      physiological changes associated with pregnancy can make optimal treatment
      challenging. Medication dosage is adjusted based on side effects and seizure
      frequency, with the goal being no seizures with the lowest medication dosage(s)
      and side-effect profile possible. Whenever possible, monotherapy is preferred.
      Many antiepileptic drugs have teratogenic potential, so preconceptional
      optimization of medication dosage(s) is recommended. Epilepsy has associated
      neurological comorbidities, the most common being migraines and sleep disorders.

      preschoolers.
PG  - 1020-8
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.112.045088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detailed associations between physical activity (PA) subcomponents,
      sedentary time, and body composition in preschoolers remain unclear. OBJECTIVE:
      We examined the magnitude of associations between objectively measured PA
      subcomponents and sedentary time with body composition in 4-y-old children.
      DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 398 preschool children recruited 
      from the Southampton Women's Survey. PA was measured by using accelerometry, and 
      body composition was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
      Associations between light physical activity, moderate physical activity (MPA),
      vigorous physical activity (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
      (MVPA) intensity; sedentary time; and body composition were analyzed by using
      repeated-measures linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, birth weight,
      maternal education, maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sleep duration.
      Sedentary time and PA were also mutually adjusted for one another to determine
      whether they were independently related to adiposity. RESULTS: VPA was the only
      intensity of PA to exhibit strong inverse associations with both total adiposity 
      [P < 0.001 for percentage of body fat and fat mass index (FMI)] and abdominal
      adiposity (P = 0.002 for trunk FMI). MVPA was inversely associated with total
      adiposity (P = 0.018 for percentage of body fat; P = 0.022 for FMI) but only
      because of the contribution of VPA, because MPA was unrelated to fatness (P >/=
      0.077). No associations were shown between the time spent sedentary and body
      composition (P >/= 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: In preschoolers, the time spent in VPA is 
      strongly and independently associated with lower adiposity. In contrast, the time
      spent sedentary and in low-to-moderate-intensity PA was unrelated to adiposity.
      These results indicate that efforts to challenge pediatric obesity may benefit
      from prioritizing VPA.

AB  - Knowledge translation has relied on research products that take years to
      disseminate, losing relevance for intended users. We used a mixed-methods
      approach to determine women's preferences for research results and format,
      intention to share results, and potential benefits. We sampled healthy, pregnant 
      women who completed survey data during their third trimesters and wanted access
      to results. Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during
      later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared.
      Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational
      contacts increased dissemination of the women's preferred information to nonstudy
      participants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess sleep practices, and investigate their relationship with
      maternal and fetal outcomes, among pregnant Ghanaian women. METHODS: In a
      cross-sectional study conducted at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana,
      between June and July 2011, postpartum women were interviewed within 48hours of
      delivery about sleep quality and practices during pregnancy. Interviews were
      coupled with a systematic review of participants' medical charts for key outcomes
      including maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, low birth
      weight, and stillbirth. RESULTS: Most women reported poor sleep quality during
      pregnancy. Snoring during pregnancy was independently associated with
      pre-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.5;
      P=0.007). The newborns of women who reported supine sleep during pregnancy were
      at increased risk of low birth weight (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-20.2; P=0.025) and
      stillbirth (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.5-43.2; P=0.016). Low birth weight was found to
      mediate the relationship between supine sleep and stillbirth. CONCLUSION: The
      present findings in an African population demonstrate that maternal sleep, a
      modifiable risk factor, has a significant role in pre-eclampsia, low birth
      weight, and subsequently stillbirth.

TI  - Safety profile of modafinil across a range of prescribing indications, including 
      off-label use, in a primary care setting in England: results of a modified
      prescription-event monitoring study.
PG  - 237-46
LID - 10.1007/s40264-013-0025-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modafinil (Provigil) was marketed in the UK in 1998 to promote
      wakefulness in the treatment of narcolepsy. In April 2004, the licence was
      extended to include chronic pathological conditions; 2 years later, the
      prescription of modafinil was restricted to patients with shift work sleep
      disorder, narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Following a
      recent review of the safety data, the licence has been further restricted to only
      treat patients with narcolepsy. The review highlighted the degree of off-label
      usage of modafinil, including patients with multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The
      aim of this study was to examine the safety profile of modafinil in real-world
      clinical usage and across a range of prescribing indications, including multiple 
      sclerosis. METHODS: The study was conducted using the observational cohort
      technique of Modified Prescription-Event Monitoring. Patients were identified
      from dispensed prescriptions issued by primary care physicians from July 2004 to 
      August 2005. Patient demographics and information on prescribing behaviour were
      included in the questionnaire sent to the prescribing general practitioner (GP) 6
      months after the initial prescription for each patient. The questionnaire sought 
      data on any events that patient may have experienced during that time, reasons
      for stopping treatment with modafinil, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), potential
      interaction with contraceptives, and pregnancies. Incidence densities (IDs) were 
      calculated for all events, and stratified according to indication and dose.
      Specific events were evaluated by requesting further information. RESULTS: Of the
      4,023 questionnaires sent to GPs, 2,416 were returned (response rate 60.1 %). Of 
      these, only those patients issued modafinil after April 2004 (with the associated
      broadening of the indications for treatment) were included in the study,
      resulting in a final cohort of 1,096 patients: 497 (45.3 %) male, median age of
      52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41-63), and 599 (54.7 %) female, median age
      of 47 years (IQR 38-57). Nine patients were aged 16 years or younger; no serious 
      skin reactions were reported in this group. Thirty-four percent of the cohort had
      an indication of multiple sclerosis. In this study, the majority of the clinical 
      events that were most frequently reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping or that
      occurred in month 1 have been previously documented with modafinil. The results
      of the study show that less than half of the women of child-bearing potential
      were established on a recommended contraceptive programme; three women became
      pregnant whilst taking modafinil and the oral contraceptive pill. Stratification 
      of IDs by dose revealed certain additional events occurred during month 1 of
      treatment at the higher dose only. Assessment of individual cases of cardiac,
      psychiatric and skin events indicated causal associations with modafinil.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important additional safety data on the use of
      modafinil in patients in 'real-world' use, including those for whom the
      prescribing indication is outside the terms of licence, as per recent changes to 
      the licensed indications for treatment. In addition to safety data, our study
      provides useful utilization data. Results from this study indicate that a
      significant number of women of child-bearing potential had not been commenced on 
      appropriate contraceptive programmes prior to starting modafinil. There were
      three pregnancies that occurred whilst taking contraception, highlighting the
      necessity of ensuring effective contraceptive cover for women during and after
      stopping treatment with modafinil. Analysis of the data showed that the majority 
      of events reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping and ranked events during the
      first month of treatment had been previously documented with the use of
      modafinil. Stratification of events according to dose revealed a number of events
      that occurred at the higher dose only, including serious events such as
      psychosis. The targeted events for which causality assessments were undertaken
      confirmed the potential of modafinil to induce certain types of events in
      individual patients, including cardiac and psychiatric events.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of admission in labor after morphine sleep
      (therapeutic rest), patient characteristics associated with labor, and adverse
      outcomes associated with treatment. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of women
      treated with morphine sleep from December 2005 to December 2009. Variables
      evaluated included medications used for treatment, cervical examination, maternal
      demographic characteristics and obstetric history, fetal heart rate patterns, and
      maternal/neonatal outcomes. These characteristics were compared between those
      admitted in labor after morphine sleep versus those discharged. RESULTS:
      Fifty-eight women received morphine sleep: 36 (62%) were admitted in labor, 17
      (29%) were discharged, and 5 (9%) were admitted secondary to category II fetal
      heart rate tracings. All fetuses had category I fetal heart rate tracings prior
      to treatment. Median dose of morphine sulfate was 20 mg. Those with effacement > 
      50% (p < 0.01) and carrying term gestations (p < 0.01) were more likely to be
      admitted in labor after treatment. There were no adverse maternal outcomes. There
      were no significant differences in neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Sixty-two
      percent of women were admitted in labor after morphine sleep. Admission
      effacement > 50% and term gestational age were associated with admission in
      labor. There were no significant differences in maternal or neonatal morbidity in
      those admitted versus discharged home after treatment with morphine sleep.

      temperature rhythms.

AB  - Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy is a key contributor to
      offspring diseases that develop in adult life. To explore the impact of
      chronodisruption during pregnancy in primates, we exposed pregnant capuchin
      monkeys to constant light (eliminating the maternal melatonin rhythm) from the
      last third of gestation to term. Maternal temperature and activity circadian
      rhythms were assessed as well as the newborn temperature rhythm. Additionally we 
      studied the effect of daily maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy on
      these rhythms. Ten pregnant capuchin monkeys were exposed to constant light from 
      60% of gestation to term. Five received a daily oral dose of melatonin (250
      microg kg/body weight) at 1800 h (LL+Mel) and the other five a placebo (LL). Six 
      additional pregnant females were maintained in a 14ratio10 light:dark cycles and 
      their newborns were used as controls (LD). Rhythms were recorded 96 h before
      delivery in the mother and at 4-6 days of age in the newborn. Exposure to
      constant light had no effect on the maternal body temperature rhythm however it
      delayed the acrophase of the activity rhythm. Neither rhythm was affected by
      melatonin replacement. In contrast, maternal exposure to constant light affected 
      the newborn body temperature rhythm. This rhythm was entrained in control
      newborns whereas LL newborns showed a random distribution of the acrophases over 
      24-h. In addition, mean temperature was decreased (34.0+/-0.6 vs 36.1+/-0.2
      degrees C, in LL and control, respectively P<0.05). Maternal melatonin
      replacement during pregnancy re-synchronized the acrophases and restored mean
      temperature to the values in control newborns. Our findings demonstrate that
      prenatal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the newborn temperature rhythm and supports
      normal body temperature maintenance. Altogether these prenatal melatonin effects 
      highlight the physiological importance of the maternal melatonin rhythm during
      pregnancy for the newborn primate.

TI  - Reduced sleep duration and daytime naps in pregnant women in Taiwan.
PG  - 99-105
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0b013e3182830d87 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Napping is highly prevalent in pregnant women, but the relation
      between nighttime sleep and daytime naps in pregnant women is poorly understood. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the temporal association of
      nighttime sleep quality and quantity with subsequent daytime naps and the
      temporal association of daytime naps with sleep quality and quantity the
      following night in women during the third trimester of pregnancy in Taiwan.
      METHODS: Sleep was assessed in 80 Taiwanese nulliparous women aged 31.70 years
      (SD = 4.58 years) using actigraphy and diaries for 7 consecutive days. Subjective
      sleep quality was examined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multiple
      linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were used to examine the
      temporal associations of nighttime sleep and daytime naps. RESULTS: All women
      napped sometime during the study week, and mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      global score was 6.6, indicating poor sleep quality. Fewer weekly work hours and 
      shorter sleep duration the preceding night were associated with longer nap
      duration the next day. More work hours, longer nap duration, and more intense
      fatigue were associated with shorter sleep duration the following night.
      DISCUSSION: Naps during pregnancy might indicate insufficient nighttime sleep,
      and longer daytime naps could compromise subsequent nighttime sleep. Further
      research is needed to determine if short sleep duration and longer daytime naps
      are associated with negative pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression in pregnancy.
PG  - 203-10
LID - 10.1007/s00737-013-0334-2 [doi]
AB  - Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are
      common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to
      examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during
      pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was
      administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820
      women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group.
      Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a
      single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup
      CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight
      depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate
      for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable 
      indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and
      Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The
      factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst
      the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for
      Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With
      the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common
      occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy.
      When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily
      be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences.

TI  - Morning versus evening induction of labour for improving outcomes.
PG  - CD007707
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007707.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Induction of labour is a common intervention in obstetric practice.
      Traditionally, in most hospitals induction of labour with medication starts early
      in the morning, with the start of the working day for the day shift. In human and
      animal studies spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm
      with a preference for start of labour in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous 
      labour starts in the evening, the total duration of labour and delivery shortens 
      and fewer obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one
      might assume that starting induction of labour in the evening, in harmony with
      the circadian rhythm of natural birth, is more beneficial for both mother and
      child. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether induction of labour starting in the evening,
      coinciding with the endogenous circadian rhythm, improves the outcome of labour
      compared with induction of labour starting in the early morning, organised to
      coincide with office hours. SEARCH METHODS: We contacted the Trials Search
      Co-ordinator to search the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials
      Register (28 February 2012). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to 16
      February 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 16 February 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: We
      included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We excluded 
      trials that employed quasi-random methods of treatment allocation. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for
      inclusion and risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data
      were checked for accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for
      additional information. MAIN RESULTS: The search resulted in 2693 articles that
      we screened on title and abstract for eligibility.Thirteen studies were selected 
      for full text assessment. We included three randomised trials involving 1150
      women. Two trials compared the administration of prostaglandins in the morning
      versus the evening in women with an unfavourable cervix, and one trial compared
      induction of labour in the morning versus the evening in women with a favourable 
      cervix and/or ruptured membranes with intravenous oxytocin. Because of the
      different mechanism, we have reported results for these two comparisons
      separately.In the two trials comparing prostaglandins in the morning versus the
      evening there were few clinically significant differences between study groups
      for maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a statistically significant
      preference by women to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the
      morning.In the trial examining induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin, the
      number of neonatal admissions was statistically significantly increased in the
      group of women that started induction in the morning. This finding was
      unexpected, and while the trial authors offered some possible explanations for
      this, it is important that any future trials examine neonatal outcomes. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account women's preferences that favoured administration
      of prostaglandins in the morning, we conclude that caregivers should preferably
      consider administering prostaglandins in the morning.There is no strong evidence 
      that induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is more or less
      effective than induction in the morning. Consideration may be given to start
      induction of labour with oxytocin in the evening when indicated.

TI  - 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) 
      have a range of findings including the following: Congenital heart disease (74%
      of individuals), particularly conotruncal malformations (tetralogy of Fallot,
      interrupted aortic arch, ventricular septal defect, and truncus arteriosus).
      Palatal abnormalities (69%), particularly velopharyngeal incompetence, submucosal
      cleft palate, bifid uvula, and cleft palate. Characteristic facial features
      (present in the majority of individuals of northern European heritage). Learning 
      difficulties (70%-90%). An immune deficiency (regardless of the clinical
      presentation) (77%). Additional findings include the following: Hypocalcemia
      (50%). Significant feeding and swallowing problems; constipation with or without 
      structural gastrointestinal anomalies (intestinal malrotation, imperforate anus, 
      and Hirschsprung disease). Renal anomalies (31%). Hearing loss (both conductive
      and sensorineural). Laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies. Growth hormone
      deficiency. Autoimmune disorders. Seizures (idiopathic or associated with
      hypocalcemia). CNS anomalies including tethered cord. Skeletal abnormalities
      (scoliosis with or without vertebral anomalies, clubbed feet, polydactyly, and
      craniosynostosis). Ophthalmologic abnormalities (strabismus, posterior
      embryotoxon, tortuous retinal vessels, scleracornea, and anophthalmia). Enamel
      hypoplasia. Malignancies (rare). Developmental delay (in particular delays in
      emergence of language), intellectual disability, and learning differences
      (non-verbal learning disability where the verbal IQ is significantly greater than
      the performance IQ) are common. Autism or autistic spectrum disorder is found in 
      approximately 20% of children and psychiatric illness (specifically
      schizophrenia) is present in 25% of adults; however, attention deficit disorder, 
      anxiety, perseveration, and difficulty with social interactions are also common. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is diagnosed in individuals with a
      submicroscopic deletion of chromosome 22 detected by fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), or
      chromosomal microarray (CMA). At present, fewer than 5% of individuals with
      clinical findings of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have normal routine
      cytogenetic studies and normal results on FISH testing; however, this figure may 
      change as individuals with atypical or nested deletions within the DGCR (DiGeorge
      chromosome region) but not including the area encompassing the N25 or TUPLE FISH 
      probes are identified using array-based or MLPA technologies. MANAGEMENT:
      Treatment of manifestations: Multidisciplinary team approach (which may include
      any combination of the following: allergy, audiology, cardiology, cardiac
      surgery, child development / psychology, dental, endocrine, ENT, feeding,
      gastroenterology, general pediatrics, general surgery, immunology, clinical
      genetics, neurology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, otolaryngology,
      plastic surgery, psychiatry, pulmonary, rheumatology, speech, and urology
      tailored to the affected individual's specific needs. Calcium supplementation and
      referral to an endocrinologist for hypocalcemia and thyroid monitoring; specific 
      strategies (modification of spoon placement when eating; treatment for
      gastroesophageal reflux and gastrointestinal dysmotility) for feeding
      difficulties; educational intervention and speech therapy/introduction of sign
      language therapy beginning at diagnosis because of risk for delays. Growth
      hormone deficiency is treated as in the general population. Immune deficiency
      requires aggressive treatment of infections; rarely, prophylactic antibiotics,
      IVIG therapy, or thymic transplantation are required. Early diagnosis and
      intervention for psychiatric illnesses improve long-term prognosis. Prevention of
      secondary complications: Immunization of infants who have lymphocyte
      abnormalities with live vaccines is not recommended; reevaluate immune status in 
      childhood before giving live vaccines; antibody studies to assess results of
      immunizations are warranted; irradiated blood products are recommended until
      normalization of the immune system can be confirmed; serum ionized calcium
      concentration should be measured pre- and postoperatively to avoid hypocalcemic
      seizures; consider assessment of carotid arteries prior to surgical procedures
      involving the pharynx; consider possible effects on speech prior to
      adenoidectomy; consider assessment of cervical spine anomalies prior to
      hyperextension of the neck during surgical procedures/athletic pursuits; consider
      pre- and postoperative sleep studies when performing pharyngeal procedures;
      consider assessment of platelet volume and function prior to surgical procedures.
      Surveillance: Follow up as needed on a "system by system" basis, but including
      routine reassessment of serum ionized calcium and thyroid studies; reevaluation
      of immunologic status prior to live virus vaccines; annual complete blood count
      and differential; ophthalmologic evaluation prior to school age; evaluation of
      nasal speech quality; audiology evaluation prior to school enrollment;
      surveillance for scoliosis; routine dental care; regular speech, language and
      developmental assessments to provide appropriate remediation.
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: Carbonated drinks and alcohol consumption may
      exacerbate hypocalcemia. Caffeine intake may contribute to or worsen anxiety.
      GENETIC COUNSELING: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion
      syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About 93% of probands have a 
      de novo deletion of 22q11.2 and 7% have inherited the 22q11.2 deletion from a
      parent. Offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of inheriting the
      22q11.2 deletion. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk based on
      family history is possible if the diagnosis has been confirmed in an affected
      family member and for pregnancies not known to be at increased risk in which
      congenital heart disease and/or other associated abnormalities (e.g., cleft
      palate, polydactyly, diaphragmatic hernia, renal anomalies, and polyhydramnios)
      have been detected by ultrasound examination.

TI  - Management of narcolepsy during pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of pregnancy in patients with narcolepsy poses many
      questions regarding therapy, including the risk to the mother and fetus related
      to the disease, potential risks at the time of conception, the risk to both the
      mother and the fetus of the medications used to treat narcolepsy, and the risk to
      the infant from medications that might be secreted in breast milk. There are no
      detailed practice parameters on the treatment of narcolepsy patients during
      pregnancy. We surveyed narcolepsy specialists from around the world to determine 
      their clinical approach to the management of patients with narcolepsy at the time
      of conception, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. METHODS: Survey
      invitations were sent via e-mail to 75 clinicians worldwide between 2/2011 and
      3/2011 with 34 responses (USA, n=10; Brazil, n=3; Czech Republic, n=2; France,
      n=2; Italy; n=2; Netherlands, n=2; Canada, n=1; Denmark, n=1; Finland, n=1;
      Germany, n=1; Japan, n=1; Spain, n=1; unknown n=7). Responders who completed the 
      survey had 20 years (median range, 5-35) of experience in sleep medicine practice
      with a median number of five narcolepsy patients seen per week. The number of
      pregnant narcoleptic patients followed per physician was five (median range
      1-40). RESULTS: The survey results indicated that the management of patients with
      narcolepsy varies greatly from clinician to clinician and from country to
      country. The majority of the clinicians stopped the narcolepsy medications at the
      time of conception, during pregnancy, and during breastfeeding some reduced the
      dose and others did not change the dosage, depending on the particular
      medication. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from our survey and literature review
      suggest that the perceived risks of narcolepsy medication during pregnancy to the
      mother and the fetus usually are overestimated, as the risk for teratogenic
      effects from narcolepsy medications in therapeutic doses is essentially
      nonexistent. However, the potential for rare complications during pregnancy and
      congenital abnormalities cannot be excluded. Most narcolepsy patients have
      vaginal delivery without complications. In rare cases patients had cataplexy that
      interfered with delivery, but if caesarian is required there appears to be no
      increased anaesthetic or surgical risks. Further prospective information for the 
      appropriate treatment of narcolepsy patients during pregnancy is needed.

TI  - Patterns and predictors of sleep quality in Taiwanese pregnant women.
PG  - 95-101
LID - 10.1097/NMC.0b013e3182659345 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined the patterns and psychosocial predictors of sleep
      quality in Taiwanese pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional,
      correlational study design was used. A convenience sample of 400 pregnant women
      from two urban hospitals in Taiwan participated in this study. Data were
      collected using six self-report measures: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 
      Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety 
      Inventory, Attitude to Body Image Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation
      List. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the prevalence of pregnancy-associated 
      sleep disturbance (PSQI score >5) was 65.5%. The mean score of the global PSQI
      was 7.25 +/- 3.43, indicating that participant pregnant women in general reported
      mild sleep disturbance. Trend analyses of PSQI score indicated a linear trend,
      with a gradual decline in the sleep quality as the pregnancy progressed. Sleep
      latency, habitual sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality scores differed 
      significantly by trimesters. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that 
      the best subsets to predict sleep quality were prenatal depression, prepregnancy 
      sleep quality, current body image, and week of gestation for Taiwanese pregnant
      women. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings offer evidence that healthcare
      professionals should provide sleep counseling to pregnant women, and incorporate 
      depression and body image into a supportive model of sleep-related prenatal care.

TI  - Continuous glucose monitors: current status and future developments.
PG  - 106-11
LID - 10.1097/MED.0b013e32835edb9d [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in diabetes technologies allow patients to manage
      their diabetes with greater precision and flexibility. Many recent studies show
      that continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can be used to tighten glycemic control
      safely and to ease certain burdens of diabetes self-management. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      The following summary reflects the most recent findings in CGM and provides an
      overall review of who would most benefit from CGM use. Benefits of CGM may vary
      based on age, type of diabetes, pregnancy, health, sleep, or heart rate. Accuracy
      and reliability are critical in current uses of CGM and especially for new and
      future systems that automate insulin partially (e.g., low glucose suspend) or
      entirely (e.g., 'fully closed-loop' artificial pancreas). Clinicians are
      simultaneously testing available products in new patient groups such as the
      critically ill and type 2 diabetes patients not using mealtime insulin. SUMMARY: 
      In a widening set of circumstances, use of CGM has been shown to promote safer
      and more effective glycemic control than self-monitoring of blood glucose.
      Imperfections remain in certain scenarios such as hypoglycemia and in certain
      populations such as young children. Ongoing research on sensors and calibration
      software should translate to better systems.

TI  - Epworth sleepiness scale scores and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
PG  - 1179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11325-013-0820-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including
      gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and Cesarean
      deliveries. The purpose of this study was to assess whether excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS) assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) increases the risk of
      these complications further. METHODS: Following institutional review board
      approval and informed consent, English-speaking women in the immediate postpartum
      period were systematically selected and recruited. Women answered a survey that
      included questions regarding symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using
      the multivariable apnea prediction index and excessive daytime sleepiness using
      ESS. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were collected by review of medical records.
      Standard statistical analysis with multivariable logistic regression was
      performed. ESS was evaluated both as a continuous variable and with various
      cutoffs given that pregnant women are likely more sleepy at baseline than the
      general population. RESULTS: In patients who underwent planned Cesarean delivery,
      mean ESS was significantly higher than in those with uncomplicated vaginal
      delivery, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.08; 
      95 % CI, 1.01-1.15; p = 0.02). There was no significant association between EDS
      (defined as ESS of >10) and gestational diabetes or gestational hypertensive
      disorders in snorers or non snorers. However, a significant association with
      gestational diabetes was found in patients with an ESS of >16 compared to those
      with an ESS of </=16, even after multiple adjustments (aOR, 6.82; 95 % CI,
      1.19-39.27), but the number of subjects in an ESS of >16 category was small.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased association between women with higher ESS and 
      planned Cesarean delivery. Severe EDS was associated with gestational diabetes in
      pregnant women in a small sample size. Future studies in larger samples need to
      confirm the association of severe EDS and gestational diabetes and elucidate
      potential mechanisms of the links with adverse outcomes.
