TI  - Excess androgen during puberty disrupts circadian organization in female rats.
PG  - 1636-47
LID - 10.1210/en.2012-2066 [doi]
AB  - Circadian clocks have been described in each tissue of the
      hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. Although a role for the clock in the timing
      of ovulation is indicated, the impact of diseases that disrupt fertility on clock
      function or the clocks' role in the etiology of these pathologies has yet to be
      fully appreciated. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a particularly devastating
      endocrinopathy, affecting approximately 10% of women at childbearing age. Common 
      features of PCOS are a polycystic ovary, amenorrhea, and excess serum androgen.
      Approximately 40% of these women have metabolic syndrome, including
      hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperleptinemia. It has been suggested that
      excess androgen is a critical factor in the etiology of PCOS. We have examined
      the effects of androgen excess during puberty on the phase of circadian clocks in
      tissues of the metabolic and hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axes. Female
      period1-luciferase (per1-luc) rats were exposed to androgen
      (5alpha-dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) or placebo for 4-6 weeks (short term) or 9-15 
      weeks (long term). As expected, DHT-treated animals gained more weight than
      controls and had disrupted estrous cycles. At the end of treatment, tissues,
      including the liver, lung, kidney, white adipose, cornea, pituitary, oviduct, and
      ovarian follicles, were cultured, and per1-luc expression in each was recorded.
      Analysis of per1-luc expression revealed that DHT exposure increased phase
      distribution of multiple oscillators, including ovarian follicles, liver, and
      adipose, and altered phase synchrony between animals. These data suggest that
      excess androgen during puberty, a common feature of PCOS, negatively affects
      internal circadian organization in both the reproductive and metabolic axes.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that immune alterations, especially those
      related to inflammation, are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia and 
      schizophrenia-related brain alterations. Much of this work has focused on the
      prenatal period, because infections during pregnancy have been repeatedly (albeit
      inconsistently) linked to risk of schizophrenia. Given that most infections do
      not cross the placenta, cytokines associated with inflammation (proinflammatory
      cytokines) have been targeted as potential mediators of the damaging effects of
      infection on the fetal brain in prenatal studies. Moreover, additional evidence
      from both human and animal studies suggests links between increased levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines, immune-related genes, and schizophrenia as well as
      brain alterations associated with the disorder. Additional support for the role
      of altered immune factors in the etiology of schizophrenia comes from
      neuroimaging studies, which have linked proinflammatory cytokine gene
      polymorphisms with some of the structural and functional abnormalities repeatedly
      found in schizophrenia. These findings are reviewed and discussed with a life
      course perspective, examining the contribution of inflammation from the fetal
      period to disorder presentation. Unexplored areas and future directions, such as 
      the interplay between inflammation, genes, and individual-level environmental
      factors (e.g., stress, sleep, and nutrition), are also discussed.

TI  - [Restrictions on night work: analysis of case studies in a large Lombardy
      Hospital].
PG  - 262-5
AB  - A high percentage of the division's doctors and employees work at night to
      guarantee urgent assistance and diagnostic services to patients. Night work is
      not recommended for persons with rather serious case histories due to the
      disruption of circadian rhythms or the increased workload required of certain
      operators during nighttime hours. All of the evaluations of health operators with
      a limited capacity to work on the night shift in our hospital were analysed,
      except for female workers restricted from night work during pregnancy or
      puerperium, as provisioned by the regulation that protects working mothers.
      Forty-two cases were considered (six physicians and 36 operators in the division)
      out of a total of 2676 employees assigned to night work and the conditions that
      led to the formulation of the decision are divided as follows: 16 Mental
      disturbances currently subject to treatment (depression, post-traumatic anxiety
      disorder, primary insomnia...), 8 Tumours (breast, colon, Ewing Sarcoma), 7
      Neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, myasthenia), 6 Cardiovascular disease
      (previous IMA; arrhythmias, arterial hypertension not controlled by theraphy) and
      5 others patologies (total 45). The cases will be analysed in detail with an
      analysis of the characteristics of the exempt group of workers and with reference
      to the temporary or indefinite nature of the exemption.

TI  - Polysomnographic evaluation of sleep quality and quantitative variables in women 
      as a function of mood, reproductive status, and age.
PG  - 413-24
AB  - This archival cross-sectional investigation examined the impact of mood,
      reproductive status (RS), and age on polysomnographic (PSG) measures in women.
      PSG was performed on 73 normal controls (NC) and 64 depressed patients (DP), in
      the course of studies in menstruating, pregnant, postpartum, and peri- and
      postmenopausal women. A two-factor, between-subjects multivariate analysis of
      variance (MANOVA) was used to test the main effects of reproductive status (RS:
      menstrual vs pregnant vs postpartum vs menopausal) and diagnosis (NC vs DP), and 
      their interaction, on PSG measures. To further refine the analyses, a two-factor,
      between subjects MANOVA was used to test the main effects of age (19 to 27 vs 28 
      to 36 vs 37 to 45 vs 46+ years) and diagnosis on the PSG data. Analyses revealed 
      that in DP women, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage was significantly
      elevated relative to NC across both RS and age. Significant differences in sleep 
      efficiency, Stage 1%, and REM density were associated with RS; differences in
      total sleep time, Stage 2 percentage, and Stage 4 percentage were associated with
      differences in age. Both RS and age were related to differences in sleep latency,
      Stage 3 percentage, and Delta percentage. Finally, wake after sleep onset time,
      REM percentage, and REM latency did not vary with respect to RS or age. Overall, 
      this investigation examined three major variables (mood, RS, and age) that are
      known to impact sleep in women. Of the variables, age appeared to have the
      greatest impact on PSG sleep measures, reflecting changes occurring across the
      lifespan.

TI  - Inhibition of self-grooming induced by sleep restriction in dam rats.
PG  - 1025-30
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Sleep restriction is a common feature of modern
      lifestyle and its effects can be extended to pregnancy. Several neurobehavioural 
      consequences of sleep restriction during pregnancy have been reported, among
      which stand out perinatal depression and maternal fatigue, however, its effects
      over mother-infant relationship warrant further investigation. Thus, this study
      was aimed to evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy over
      maternal behaviour and maternal aggression through animal models. METHODS:
      Eighteen 90-day-old female Wistar rats were distributed in two groups: (i)
      Control - not submitted to any manipulation during pregnancy, and (ii) Sleep
      restriction - submitted to sleep restriction during the entire pregnancy (21
      days) through the multiple platforms technique. In the postpartum day 5,
      resident-intruder paradigm and the latencies test were performed to assess both
      maternal behaviour and maternal aggression. RESULTS: The sleep-restricted females
      displayed grooming in less frequency and duration, and with higher latency when
      compared to normal animals, while maternal aggression and maternal behaviour
      parameters remained equivalent between groups. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS:
      Considering the maintenance of maternal behavioural parameters, the inhibition of
      grooming seems to exert an adaptive mechanism, enabling sleep-restricted rats to 
      display maternal behaviour properly.

      prospective study.
PG  - 738-42
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318283baf3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency,
      characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy
      and its impact on sleep. METHODS: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in
      each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS
      symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including
      the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements
      (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen.
      RESULTS: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was 
      found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the
      20th week; 45% had an IRLSS >20 and 100% had a PSQI >5. Hemoglobin levels <11
      g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third
      trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and
      estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in
      women with RLS. CONCLUSION: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of
      symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after
      delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality.
      Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem
      to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy.

AB  - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss in patients 
      with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia
      are known to be important risks factors for DME. In addition, nephropathy,
      anemia, sleep apnea, glitazone usage, and pregnancy are also important modifiable
      risk factors. It is important for physicians of different subspecialties to work 
      together and understand multiple aspects of DME and diabetic healthcare.

AB  - A 4-year-old girl who had been born of normal pregnancy and delivery and had an
      unremarkable family or personal history was referred to a neuropsychiatric
      department because of the appearance of peculiar nocturnal episodes. Parents
      described that their child abruptly became stiff during sleep. These episodes
      usually ranged from 20 to 40 seconds, and after that the child continued to
      sleep. Initially she presented 1 episode per week, but there was a progressive
      increase in frequency up to 3 to 4 times per night. The child never presented
      similar episodes while awake. Her examination revealed some cafe-au-lait spots,
      congenital microcephaly (3rd centile) and low stature for the age (10th centile).
      She did not present any neurologic deficit, but she failed to develop an
      age-appropriate speech, with a delay in the main language milestones.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing and daytime napping are associated with maternal
      hyperglycemia.
PG  - 1093-102
LID - 10.1007/s11325-013-0809-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy may impair glucose mechanism. This
      study aimed to examine associations of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep, and nap
      duration with 1-h glucose challenge test (GCT) levels in pregnant women after
      controlling for known risk factors for gestational diabetes. METHODS: This is a
      case-control study of 104 pregnant women. All women underwent full
      polysomnography and a GCT and completed the multivariable apnea prediction and
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality indexes. The primary outcome was maternal hyperglycemia 
      measured by GCT. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were
      performed. RESULTS: Over 13 % subjects reported habitual snoring in the first
      trimester. Only 9.3 % women with normoglycemia (GCT < 135) were habitual snorers,
      whereas 45.5 % women with hyperglycemia (GCT >/= 135) had habitual snoring (p <
      0.001). Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (loud snoring, snorting/gasping, and 
      apneas) (odds ratio (OR) 2.85; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.50-5.41; p =
      0.001) and total nap duration (OR 1.48; 95 % CI 0.96-2.28; p = 0.08) were
      associated with hyperglycemia. After adjusting for confounders, sleep-disordered 
      breathing symptoms (OR 3.37; 95 % CI 1.44-8.32; p = 0.005) and nap duration (OR
      1.64; 95 % CI 1.00-2.681.02; p = 0.05) continued to be associated with
      hyperglycemia. However, the primary exposure measure, the apnea/hypopnea index in
      the first trimester was not significantly associated with hyperglycemia (OR 1.03;
      95 % CI 0.83-1.28; p = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms
      and nap duration are associated with hyperglycemia. Sleep duration was not
      associated with hyperglycemia. Research is needed concerning whether women with
      sleep-disordered breathing and/or daytime napping are at risk for gestational
      diabetes.

      gestation in the rat: implications for fetal metabolic programming.
PG  - e53800
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0053800 [doi]
AB  - Disrupting maternal circadian rhythms through exposure to chronic phase shifts of
      the photoperiod has lifelong consequences for the metabolic homeostasis of the
      fetus, such that offspring develop increased adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia and
      poor glucose and insulin tolerance. In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by 
      which these poor metabolic outcomes arise, we investigated the impact of chronic 
      phase shifts (CPS) on maternal and fetal hormonal, metabolic and circadian
      rhythms. We assessed weight gain and food consumption of dams exposed to either
      CPS or control lighting conditions throughout gestation. At day 20, dams were
      assessed for plasma hormone and metabolite concentrations and glucose and insulin
      tolerance. Additionally, the expression of a range of circadian and metabolic
      genes was assessed in maternal, placental and fetal tissue. Control and CPS dams 
      consumed the same amount of food, yet CPS dams gained 70% less weight during the 
      first week of gestation. At day 20, CPS dams had reduced retroperitoneal fat pad 
      weight (-15%), and time-of-day dependent decreases in liver weight, whereas fetal
      and placental weight was not affected. Melatonin secretion was not altered, yet
      the timing of corticosterone, leptin, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids,
      triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations were profoundly disrupted. The
      expression of gluconeogenic and circadian clock genes in maternal and fetal liver
      became either arrhythmic or were in antiphase to the controls. These results
      demonstrate that disruptions of the photoperiod can severely disrupt normal
      circadian profiles of plasma hormones and metabolites, as well as gene expression
      in maternal and fetal tissues. Disruptions in the timing of food consumption and 
      the downstream metabolic processes required to utilise that food, may lead to
      reduced efficiency of growth such that maternal weight gain is reduced during
      early embryonic development. It is these perturbations that may contribute to the
      programming of poor metabolic homeostasis in the offspring.

TI  - Development and validation of a pregnancy symptoms inventory.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-13-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical symptoms are common in pregnancy and are predominantly
      associated with normal physiological changes. These symptoms have a social and
      economic cost, leading to absenteeism from work and additional medical
      interventions. There is currently no simple method for identifying common
      pregnancy related problems in the antenatal period. A validated tool, for use by 
      pregnancy care providers would be useful. The aim of this study was to develop
      and validate a Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory for use by health professionals.
      METHODS: A list of symptoms was generated via expert consultation with health
      professionals. Focus groups were conducted with pregnant women. The inventory was
      tested for face validity and piloted for readability and comprehension. For
      test-re-test reliability, the tool was administered to the same women 2 to 3 days
      apart. Finally, midwives trialled the inventory for 1 month and rated its
      usefulness on a 10cm visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: A 41-item Likert
      inventory assessing how often symptoms occurred and what effect they had, was
      developed. Individual item test re-test reliability was between .51 to 1, the
      majority (34 items) scoring >/=0.70. The top four "often" reported symptoms were 
      urinary frequency (52.2%), tiredness (45.5%), poor sleep (27.5%) and back pain
      (19.5%). Among the women surveyed, 16.2% claimed to sometimes or often be
      incontinent. Referrals to the incontinence nurse increased > 8 fold during the
      study period. CONCLUSIONS: The PSI provides a comprehensive inventory of
      pregnancy related symptoms, with a mechanism for assessing their effect on
      function. It was robustly developed, with good test re-test reliability, face
      validity, comprehension and readability. This provides a validated tool for
      assessing the impact of interventions in pregnancy.

PG  - 331-5
LID - 10.3109/09513590.2012.743018 [doi]
AB  - Dysfunction of the circadian clock genes is involved in the development of
      obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 
      T2D share common genetic and phenotypic features, in the present study, we
      investigated the status of the circadian clock in a cohort of 40 Greek pregnant
      women with GDM, four with T2D and 20 normal controls. Peripheral blood mRNA
      transcript levels of 10 clock genes (CLOCK1, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, PER3, PPARAlpha, 
      PPARD, PPARG, CRY1 and CRY2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. GDM
      patients expressed significantly lower transcript levels of BMAL1, PER3, PPARD
      and CRY2 compared to control women (p < 0.05). No significant difference was
      documented between GDM women maintained either under insulin treatment or diet. A
      positive correlation was found between the expression of BMAL1 versus CRY2 (r =
      0.45, p = 0.003) and BMAL1 versus PPARD (r = 0.43, p = 0.004). Further
      investigation on the functional relevance of these clock genes, disclosed that
      expression of PER3 correlated negatively with HbA1C levels (r = -0.36, p =
      0.022). These data document for the first time that the expression of BMAL1,
      PER3, PPARD and CRY2 genes is altered in GDM compared to normal pregnant women
      and support the notion that deranged expression of clock genes may play a
      pathogenic role in GDM.

TI  - Self-Medication: potential risks and hazards among pregnant women in Uyo,
      Nigeria.
PG  - 15
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence that self-medications among pregnant
      women are common in many developing countries. Despite the adverse impact on
      pregnancy, there are few programs available for their control. The objective of
      this study was to assess the level of self-medication amongst Nigerian pregnant
      women in order to determine possible harmful effects on fetus. METHODS: Five
      hundred and eighteen 518 pregnant women, aged between 18 and 40 years, drawn from
      three General hospitals in Akwa Ibom State were assessed for self-medication and 
      substance abuse using an instrument, adapted from a modified form of 117-item
      self-report questionnaire based on the WHO guidelines for students' substance use
      survey. RESULTS: Of the 518 pregnant women assessed, 375 (72.4%) indulged in one 
      form of self-medication or the other; 143 (27.6%) used only drugs prescribed from
      the antenatal clinic. A total of 157 (41.9%) pregnant women self-medicate
      fever/pain relievers; 47 (9.1%) mixture of herbs and other drugs; 15 (4.0%)
      sedatives; 13 (3.5%) alcohol; while 5 (1.3%) used kolanuts. Reasons for using
      these substances range from protection from witches and witchcrafts, preventing
      pregnancy from coming out, for blood; poor sleep, fever and vomiting and
      infections. There was a significant difference in the rate of using analgesics
      (X2=9.43, p=0.001); and antibiotic (X2=4.43, p=0.001) among pregnant women who
      were highly educated compared to those with little or no education. However, the 
      level of education has no impact in the usage of native herbs. CONCLUSION: This
      study shows that self-medication is common among pregnant women in our
      environment. There is need for adequate education of pregnant women during
      antenatal clinics on the potential danger of self-medication so as to prevent
      child and maternal morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Effects of caffeine and/or nasal CPAP treatment on laryngeal chemoreflexes in
      preterm lambs.
PG  - 637-46
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00599.2012 [doi]
AB  - Current knowledge suggests that laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are involved in the
      occurrence of certain neonatal apneas/bradycardias, especially in the preterm
      newborn. While caffeine and/or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) 
      are the most frequent options used for treating apneas in preterm newborns, their
      effects on LCR-related apneas/bradycardias are virtually unknown. The aim of the 
      present study was to test the hypothesis that caffeine and/or nCPAP decreases
      LCR-related cardiorespiratory inhibition in a preterm ovine model. Seven preterm 
      lambs were born vaginally on gestational day 133 (normal gestation: 147 days)
      after intramuscular injections of betamethasone and mifepristone. Five days after
      birth, a chronic surgical instrumentation was performed to record states of
      alertness, electrocardiogram, systemic arterial pressure, and electromyographic
      activity of a laryngeal constrictor muscle, as well as to insert a transcutaneous
      supraglottal catheter. LCR were induced in quiet sleep under four conditions: 1) 
      control (without caffeine or nCPAP); 2) nCPAP (5 cmH2O, without caffeine); 3)
      caffeine (10 mg/kg infused intravenously for 30 min, without nCPAP); and 4) nCPAP
      + caffeine. Our results showed that nCPAP consistently blunted LCR-related
      cardiorespiratory inhibition vs. control condition, contrary to caffeine whose
      overall effect was nonsignificant. In addition, nCPAP condition was characterized
      by a more consistent and rapid arousal after HCl injection. No significant
      differences were observed between all tested conditions with regard to swallowing
      and cough. It is concluded that nCPAP should be further assessed for its
      usefulness in treating neonatal apneas linked to LCR.

AB  - Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of children under the age of 15, making it a
      very common neurological disorder in the pediatric population (Russ et al.,
      2012). In addition, ~0.4-0.8% of all pregnant women have some form of epilepsy
      (Hauser et al., 1996a,b; Borthen et al., 2009; Krishnamurthy, 2012). Despite the 
      potential deleterious effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the developing
      brain, their use is still required for seizure control in pregnant women
      (Krishnamurthy, 2012), and they represent the standard approach for treating
      children with epilepsy (Chu-Shore and Thiele, 2010; Quach et al., 2010; Verrotti 
      et al., 2011). Even when AEDs are effective, there are potential side effects,
      including cognitive and affective changes or altered sleep and appetite. The
      consequences of AED exposure in development have been studied extensively (Canger
      et al., 1999; Modi et al., 2011a,b; Oguni, 2011). Despite intensive study, there 
      is still debate about the long-term consequences of early life AED exposure.
      Here, we consider the evidence to date that AED exposure, either prenatally or in
      early postnatal life, has significant adverse effects on the developing brain and
      incorporate studies of laboratory animals as well as those of patients. We also
      note the areas of research where greater clarity seems critical in order to make 
      significant advances. A greater understanding of the impact of AEDs on somatic,
      cognitive and behavioral development has substantial value because it has the
      potential to inform clinical practice and guide studies aimed at understanding
      the genetic and molecular bases of comorbid pathologies associated with common
      treatment regimens. Understanding these effects has the potential to lead to AEDs
      with fewer side effects. Such advances would expand treatment options, diminish
      the risk associated with AED exposure in susceptible populations, and improve the
      quality of life and health outcomes of children with epilepsy and children born
      to women who took AEDs during pregnancy.

BTI - Treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome
AB  - CONTEXT: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by
      unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move
      them. RLS severity and burden vary widely, and the condition may require
      long-term treatment. OBJECTIVE: To review the comparative effectiveness,
      efficacy, and safety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for RLS.
      DATA SOURCES: We searched bibliographic databases MEDLINE (via OVID), Embase, and
      Natural Standards through June 2012. REVIEW METHODS: Eligible efficacy studies
      included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of individuals with RLS published in
      English that lasted at least 4 weeks and compared pharmacologic and/or
      nonpharmacologic treatments with placebo or active treatment. We assessed RLS
      symptom impact, sleep scale scores, disease-specific quality of life,
      withdrawals, and adverse effects. We included observational studies that assessed
      long-term (>6 months) treatment adverse effects and withdrawals. RESULTS: Of the 
      53 studies included, one active comparator and 33 placebo-controlled RCTs
      provided efficacy and harms data, and 18 observational studies assessed long-term
      harms and adherence. RCTs were typically small and of short duration, and
      enrolled adult subjects with severe primary RLS of long duration.
      Placebo-controlled RCTs (18 trials) demonstrated that dopamine agonists
      (pramipexole, rotigotine, ropinirole, and cabergoline) increased the percentage
      of subjects who had a clinically important response defined as >/=50 percent
      reduction from baseline in mean International RLS symptom scale scores (IRLS
      responders) (risk ratio [RR]=1.60; [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38 to 1.86], 
      k=7), improved RLS symptom scores, patient-reported sleep scale scores (effect
      size=0.38; [95% CI: 0.29 to 0.46], k=8), and disease-specific quality of life
      (effect size=-0.37; [95% CI: -0.48 to -0.27], k=9). Dopamine agonists resulted in
      more patients who experienced at least one adverse event (high-strength evidence 
      for all outcomes). Long-term augmentation (drug-induced worsening of symptoms)
      and treatment withdrawal were common. Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin
      enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin) increased the number of IRLS responders
      (RR=1.66; [95% CI: 1.33 to 2.09], k=3, high strength of evidence) and mean change
      in IRLS symptom scores (k=3, high strength of evidence). Intravenous ferric
      carboxymaltose reduced IRLS symptom scale scores versus placebo (k=1, moderate
      strength of evidence). Four studies assessed nonpharmacologic interventions.
      Compression stockings but not the botanical extract valerian improved IRLS
      symptom scale scores more than sham or placebo treatments. Strength of evidence
      was moderate for compression stockings and low for valerian. Exercise improved
      symptoms more than control (low-strength evidence). Near-infrared light treatment
      improved IRLS symptom scores more than sham (low-strength evidence). Two trials
      compared active treatments. In one small crossover trial, pramipexole and
      levodopa/benserazide resulted in similar improvements in IRLS scores
      (low-strength evidence). Cabergoline improved IRLS scores and resulted in less
      augmentation than levodopa (moderate-strength evidence). Iron improved symptoms
      in adults with iron deficiency (k=2) (low-strength evidence). No studies enrolled
      pregnant women, children, or those with end-stage renal disease. Withdrawal from 
      mostly dopamine agonist and levodopa treatment at 1 year or more ranged from 13
      to 57 percent. Treatment withdrawals were due to lack of efficacy (6% to 37%) as 
      well as augmentation and other adverse events. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo,
      dopamine agonists and alpha-2-delta ligands reduce RLS symptoms and improve
      patient-reported sleep outcomes and disease-specific quality of life. Adverse
      effects of pharmacologic therapies and long-term treatment withdrawals due to
      adverse effects or lack of efficacy are common. Long-term effectiveness as well
      as applicability for adults with milder or less frequent RLS symptoms,
      individuals with secondary RLS, and children is unknown.

      preeclampsia.
PG  - 15-21
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2292 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly
      associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep
      disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link
      preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that
      treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during
      sleep. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: First, a method of fetal movement
      recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester
      pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent
      polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during
      third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was
      done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and
      during a night of nasal CPAP. INTERVENTION: Overnight continuous positive airway 
      pressure. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow 
      limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P =
      0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced
      total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 
      0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was 
      also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous
      positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and
      hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness
      of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a
      pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity
      and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

AB  - Sex differences in sleep begin at a very early age and women report poorer sleep 
      quality and have higher risk for insomnia than do men. Sleep may be affected by
      variation in reproductive hormones, stress, depression, aging, life/role
      transitions, and other factors. The menstrual cycle is associated with changes in
      circadian rhythms and sleep architecture. Menstruating women (even without
      significant menstrual-related complaints) often report poorer sleep quality and
      greater sleep disturbance during the premenstrual week compared to other times of
      her menstrual cycle. In addition to these sleep disturbances, women with severe
      premenstrual syndrome often report more disturbing dreams, sleepiness, fatigue,
      decreased alertness and concentration during the premenstrual phase. Sleep
      disturbances are also commonly reported during pregnancy and increase in
      frequency and duration as the pregnancy progresses. The precipitous decline in
      hormones and unpredictable sleep patterns of the newborn contribute to and/or
      exacerbate poor sleep and daytime sleepiness during the early postpartum period. 
      Insomnia is also among the most common health complaints that are reported by
      perimenopausal women. Women are particularly vulnerable to developing insomnia
      disorder during these times of reproductive hormonal change. In this review, we
      present a discussion on the most relevant and recent publications on sleep across
      the woman's lifespan, including changes in sleep related to menstruation,
      pregnancy, postpartum, and the menopausal transition. Treatment for sleep
      disturbances and insomnia disorder and special considerations for treating women 
      will also be discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of trazodone and quetiapine for insomnia: an observational study in
      psychiatric inpatients.
LID - 10.4088/PCC.13m01558 [doi]
LID - PCC.13m01558 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is symptomatic of most psychiatric disorders.
      Non-habit-forming agents such as trazodone and quetiapine are commonly used
      off-label to treat patients with insomnia. The safety and efficacy of trazodone
      and quetiapine as medications for treatment of insomnia have never been directly 
      contrasted. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
      trazodone to quetiapine among inpatient psychiatric patients by measuring the
      traditional sleep parameters of total sleep time, number of nighttime awakenings,
      sleep efficiency, sleep latency, length of hospitalization, and patient-reported 
      side effects. METHOD: Participants were recruited from St Helena Hospital Center 
      for Behavioral Health, Vallejo, California. Patient inclusion criteria were age
      18 to 65 years, admitted between September 2011 and February 2012, and a
      physician order for trazodone or quetiapine for insomnia. Exclusion criteria
      included primary insomnia, pregnancy, concomitant order of trazodone and
      quetiapine, receiving trazodone or quetiapine up to 2 weeks prior to the study,
      and inability to coherently communicate. Subjective patient interviews and
      objective nursing sleep log reviews composed the data set. RESULTS: On average,
      mean total sleep time hours were longer among patients receiving trazodone versus
      those receiving quetiapine according to patients' subjective reports (7.80 vs
      6.75, respectively, P < .01) and the nursing sleep logs (9.13 vs 8.68,
      respectively, P = .04). Patients receiving trazodone experienced fewer mean
      nighttime awakenings versus those receiving quetiapine (0.52 vs 0.75,
      respectively, P = .04) according to the nursing sleep log report. Patients
      receiving trazodone reported more side effects of constipation, nausea, and
      diarrhea than patients receiving quetiapine. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to total
      sleep time and nighttime awakenings, trazodone was a more effective alternative
      than quetiapine. However, patients receiving trazodone experienced more
      gastrointestinal patient-reported side effects.

TI  - Efficacy of an eight-week yoga intervention on symptoms of restless legs syndrome
      (RLS): a pilot study.
PG  - 527-35
LID - 10.1089/acm.2012.0330 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and highly burdensome sleep 
      disorder. While relaxation therapies, including yoga, are often recommended for
      RLS management, rigorous supporting research is sparse. The goal of this
      preliminary study was to assess the effects of yoga on RLS symptoms and related
      outcomes in women with RLS. METHODS: Participants were 13 nonsmoking women with
      moderate to severe RLS, who did not have diabetes, sleep apnea, or other serious 
      concomitant chronic conditions, and who were not pregnant. The intervention was a
      gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and
      post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale
      [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep
      Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress
      Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire
      regarding their experience with the study. RESULTS: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66
      years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4+/-0.5 (of 16
      possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1+/-0.3 (of 5 possible) homework
      sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS
      symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all
      but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect
      sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. 
      IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice
      per session (r=0.70, p=0.025) and total homework minutes (r=0.64, p<0.05),
      suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed
      significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's</=0.02),
      with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary
      findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and
      symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in
      women with RLS.

TI  - Auditory evoked arousal responses of 3-month-old infants exposed to
      methamphetamine in utero: a nap study.
PG  - 424-30
LID - 10.1111/apa.12136 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether or not infants exposed to methamphetamine prenatally 
      have impaired arousal responses from sleep. METHODS: The polygraphic nap studies 
      involved 42 infants aged 3 months exposed to methamphetamine in utero and a
      comparison group of 57 infants. A proportion of mothers in both groups smoked
      cigarettes and/or marijuana and drank alcohol during pregnancy. White noise from 
      50 to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10 dB intervals twice within
      non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and
      arousal thresholds measured. RESULTS: Combining groups, 306 tests were completed 
      (128 and 178 within REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more
      likely to wake at lower thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95%
      CI, 3.78-8.23 p < 0.0001). No significant differences in arousal threshold were
      found between methamphetamine and comparison groups, before or after controlling 
      for other substance use (NREM sleep; 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.59 and REM sleep; 1.03,
      95% CI, 0.56-1.89). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that arousal responses of
      methamphetamine-exposed infants remain intact, providing no support for the
      hypothesis that prenatal exposure could increase their vulnerability to sudden
      infant death syndrome (SIDS) through arousal deficits.

TI  - Sleep education during pregnancy for new mothers.
PG  - 155
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-12-155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high association between disturbed (poor quality) sleep
      and depression, which has lead to a consensus that there is a bidirectional
      relationship between sleep and mood. One time in a woman's life when sleep is
      commonly disturbed is during pregnancy and following childbirth. It has been
      suggested that sleep disturbance is another factor that may contribute to the
      propensity for women to become depressed in the postpartum period compared to
      other periods in their life. Post Natal Depression (PND) is common (15.5%) and
      associated with sleep disturbance, however, no studies have attempted to provide 
      a sleep-focused intervention to pregnant women and assess whether this can
      improve sleep, and consequently maternal mood post-partum. The primary aim of
      this research is to determine the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational sleep
      intervention compared with a control group to improve sleep management, with a
      view to reduce depressive symptoms in first time mothers. METHOD: This randomised
      controlled trial will recruit 214 first time mothers during the last trimester of
      their pregnancy. Participants will be randomised to receive either a set of
      booklets (control group) or a 3 hour psychoeducational intervention that focuses 
      on sleep. The primary outcomes of this study are sleep-related, that is sleep
      quality and sleepiness for ten months following the birth of the baby. The
      secondary outcome is depressive symptoms. It is hypothesised that participants in
      the intervention group will have better sleep quality and sleepiness in the
      postpartum period than women in the control condition. Further, we predict that
      women who receive the sleep intervention will have lower depression scores
      postpartum compared with the control group. DISCUSSION: This study aims to
      provide an intervention that will improve maternal sleep in the postpartum
      period. If sleep can be effectively improved through a brief psychoeducational
      program, then it may have a protective role in reducing maternal postpartum
      depressive symptoms. REGISTRATION DETAILS: This trial is registered with the
      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register under the registration number
      ACTRN12611000859987

TI  - Neurotrophic peptides, ADNF-9 and NAP, prevent alcohol-induced apoptosis at
      midgestation in fetal brains of C57BL/6 mouse.
PG  - 150-6
LID - 10.1007/s12031-012-9921-3 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to induce fetal brain growth deficits at
      different embryonic stages. We focused this study on investigating the
      neuroprotective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis at midgestation using
      activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)-9, a peptide (SALLRSIPA) derived
      from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, and NAP, a peptide (NAPVSIPQ)
      derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein. We used an established
      fetal alcohol exposure mouse model. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched
      pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet
      (ALC) group with 25 % (4.49 %, v/v) ethanol-derived calories, (2) pair-fed (PF)
      control group, (3) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of ADNF-9
      (ALC/ADNF-9) group, (4) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of NAP
      (ALC/NAP) group, (5) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of ADNF-9
      (PF/ADNF-9) group, and (6) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of NAP
      (PF/NAP) group. On day 15 (E15), fetal brains were collected, weighed, and
      assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ADNF-9 or NAP
      was administered daily from E7 to E15 alongside PF or ALC liquid diet exposure.
      Our results show that NAP and ADNF-9 significantly prevented alcohol-induced
      weight reduction of fetal brains. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP
      or ADNF-9 administration alongside alcohol exposure significantly prevented
      alcohol-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium of the cingulate
      cortex and ganglionic eminence. These findings may pave the path toward potential
      therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during pregnancy stages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances in late pregnancy are common. This study aimed to 
      survey sleep problems in third trimester pregnant women and to compare sleep in
      the pre-pregnancy period with the third trimester. METHODS: Third-trimester women
      (n=650) were sent a postal survey containing questions relating to sleep
      experience, including perceived sleep quality, sleep difficulties, night waking, 
      sleep environment, snoring, daytime tiredness and daytime napping. Time periods
      reported on were before pregnancy and in the last week. RESULTS: Respondents
      numbered 244 (38%). Before pregnancy, the mean reported duration of night-time
      sleep was 8.1 (SD 1.1) hours; in the last week this had decreased to 7.5 (SD 1.8)
      hours (p<.0001). Only 29% rated their sleep quality in the last week as very good
      or fairly good, compared with 82% rating their sleep this way before the
      pregnancy. The main reasons for sleeping difficulties were discomfort (67%) and
      pain (36%). Snoring increased significantly over the course of the pregnancy,
      with 37% reporting snoring often or every night in the last week. Those with a
      pre-pregnancy body mass index of greater than 25 were significantly more likely
      to snore (p=.01). Only 4% of women had an abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale score
      (i.e. >10) prior to pregnancy, whereas in the last week 33% scored in the
      abnormal range. Likewise, 5% had regularly napped during the daytime before
      pregnancy, compared with 41% in the last week. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep problems are
      common in women in late pregnancy, and increase markedly compared with before
      pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives. To describe psychosocial factors identified as contributors of weight
      gain in the general population and to examine the relationship between these
      factors and gestational weight gain among low socioeconomic status, African
      American, overweight pregnant women. Methods. African American women (n = 120)
      with a pregravid body mass index >/=25 kg/m(2) completed measures of eating,
      sleep, and depressed mood between 14 and 24 weeks of gestation. Weight was
      tracked. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and linear regression modeling
      were used to characterize the sample and examine predictors of gestational weight
      gain. Results. Four percent screened positive for night eating syndrome, with 32%
      consuming at least 25% of their daily caloric intake after dinner (evening
      hyperphagia). None met criteria for binge eating disorder; 4% reported occasional
      binge episodes. Cognitive restraint over eating was low. Participants slept 7.1
      (SD = 1.9) h per night and reported 4.3 (SD = 3.6) awakenings per week; 18%
      reported some level of depressed mood. Night and binge eating were related to
      each other, sleep quality, and depressed mood. Eating due to cravings was the
      only psychosocial variable to predict gestational weight gain. Conclusions.
      Depressed mood, night eating, and nighttime awakenings were common in this
      cohort, while cognitive restraint over eating was low. Most psychosocial
      variables were not predictive of excess gestational weight gain.

      apnea.
PG  - 436-43
LID - 10.4103/0970-9185.101895 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by upper airway collapse and
      obstruction during sleep. It is estimated to affect nearly 5% of the general
      female population. Obesity is often associated with OSA. The physiological
      changes associated with pregnancy may increase the severity of OSA with a higher 
      risk of maternal and fetal morbidity. However, very few parturients are diagnosed
      during pregnancy. These undiagnosed parturients pose great challenge to the
      attending anaesthesiologist during the perioperative period. Parturients at risk 
      should be screened for OSA, and if diagnosed, treated. This review describes the 
      anaesthetic concerns in obese parturients at risk for OSA presenting to the labor
      and delivery unit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure
      daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders.
      Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS,
      although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been
      conducted with this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to perform a
      psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a
      secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and
      Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who
      received prenatal care was at Magee-Women's Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh,
      Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that
      completed the ESS. METHODS: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor
      analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was
      assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test
      (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was
      investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
      RESULTS: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained
      approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor
      solution. An overall Cronbach's alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability
      (Factor 1alpha=.754; Factor 2alpha=.524). Both convergent and discriminant
      validity were established. CONCLUSION: The ESS is appropriate for use in an
      obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include
      additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women.

TI  - Hypergravity disruption of homeorhetic adaptations to lactation in rat dams
      include changes in circadian clocks.
PG  - 570-81
LID - 10.1242/bio.2012687 [doi]
AB  - Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation
      (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and
      reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and
      lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup
      mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to
      pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone
      concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in
      circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue
      metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from 
      mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day
      [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and
      delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected
      for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO(2) and incorporation into 
      lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using
      time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly 
      reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however,
      HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin
      levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue
      metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by
      HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes 
      in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load
      alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations
      needed for a successful lactation.

TI  - Prenatal treatment prevents learning deficit in Down syndrome model.
PG  - e50724
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0050724 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation.
      Active fragments of neurotrophic factors release by astrocyte under the
      stimulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) 
      respectively, have shown therapeutic potential for developmental delay and
      learning deficits. Previous work demonstrated that NAP+SAL prevent developmental 
      delay and glial deficit in Ts65Dn that is a well-characterized mouse model for
      Down syndrome. The objective of this study is to evaluate if prenatal treatment
      with these peptides prevents the learning deficit in the Ts65Dn mice. Pregnant
      Ts65Dn female and control pregnant females were randomly treated (intraperitoneal
      injection) on pregnancy days 8 through 12 with saline (placebo) or peptides (NAP 
      20 microg +SAL 20 microg) daily. Learning was assessed in the offspring (8-10
      months) using the Morris Watermaze, which measures the latency to find the hidden
      platform (decrease in latency denotes learning). The investigators were blinded
      to the prenatal treatment and genotype. Pups were genotyped as trisomic (Down
      syndrome) or euploid (control) after completion of all tests. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: two-way ANOVA followed by Neuman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons,
      P<0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. Trisomic mice who prenatally 
      received placebo (Down syndrome-placebo; n = 11) did not demonstrate learning
      over the five day period. DS mice that were prenatally exposed to peptides (Down 
      syndrome-peptides; n = 10) learned significantly better than Down
      syndrome-placebo (p<0.01), and similar to control-placebo (n = 33) and
      control-peptide (n = 30). In conclusion prenatal treatment with the
      neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) prevented learning deficits in a Down syndrome
      model. These findings highlight a possibility for the prevention of sequelae in
      Down syndrome and suggest a potential pregnancy intervention that may improve
      outcome.

AB  - This study compared self-reported sleep latency (SL) and total sleep time (TST)
      to objective measures on polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Thirty-three
      women in the third trimester (T3) of pregnancy, 16 women in the first trimester
      (T1) of pregnancy, and 15 non-pregnant women underwent overnight PSG, and shortly
      after awakening reported their perceived SL and TST. Results showed that, on
      average, the T3 group slightly overestimated their TSTs, whereas the T1 and
      non-pregnant groups underestimated TSTs when compared with objective measurement.
      All groups overestimated SL, and perceived SL was closest to the first epoch of
      10 min of uninterrupted sleep or the first epoch of slow-wave sleep, rather than 
      the first epoch of sleep (the current definition used for diagnostic sleep
      studies). The wide variation in discrepancies between estimation and PSG
      measurement for both TST and SL shows that self-reports made by both pregnant and
      non-pregnant women tend to be unreliable, which has important implications both
      clinically and for the many studies based on self-reported sleep patterns in
      pregnancy.

      outcome in PCOS?

AB  - Human pre-ovulatory follicular fluid (FF) contains a higher concentration of
      melatonin than serum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      melatonin supplementation of culture medium on the clinical outcomes of an
      in-vitro maturation (IVM) IVF-embryo transfer programme for patients with
      polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Melatonin concentrations in the culture media
      of granulosa cells (GC) or cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COC) were measured and the
      clinical outcomes after using IVM media with or without melatonin were analysed. 
      In the culture media of GC or COC, melatonin concentrations gradually increased. 
      When human chorionic gonadotrophin priming protocols were used, implantation
      rates in the melatonin-supplemented group were higher than those of the
      non-supplemented control group (P<0.05). Pregnancy rates were also higher,
      although not significantly. The findings suggest that the addition of melatonin
      to IVM media may improve the cytoplasmic maturation of human immature oocytes and
      subsequent clinical outcomes. It is speculated that follicular melatonin may be
      released from luteinizing GC during late folliculogenesis and that melatonin
      supplementation may be used to improve the clinical outcomes of IVM IVF-embryo
      transfer. Melatonin is primarily produced by the pineal gland and regulates a
      variety of important central and peripheral actions related to circadian rhythms 
      and reproduction. Interestingly, human pre-ovulatory follicular fluid contains a 
      higher concentration of melatonin than serum. However, in contrast to animal
      studies, the direct role of melatonin on oocyte maturation in the human system
      has not yet been investigated. So, the aim of the study was to evaluate the
      effect of melatonin supplementation of culture medium on the clinical outcome of 
      an in-vitro maturation (IVM) IVF-embryo transfer programme for PCOS patients. The
      melatonin concentrations in culture medium of granulosa cells (GC) or
      cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COC) were measured and the clinical outcomes of IVM
      IVF-embryo transfer using IVM medium alone or supplemented with melatonin were
      analysed. In the culture media of GC or COC, the melatonin concentration
      gradually increased. With human chorionic gonadotrophin priming, the pregnancy
      and implantation rates in the melatonin-supplemented group were higher than those
      of the non-supplemented control (P<0.05). Our findings suggest that follicular
      melatonin is released from luteinizing GC during late folliculogenesis and plays 
      a positive role in oocyte maturation. Therefore, addition of melatonin into IVM
      medium may improve cytoplasmic maturation of human immature oocytes and
      subsequent clinical outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual
      disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides
      NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced
      teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning
      impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We
      evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL
      work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these
      alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant 
      C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g),
      placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after
      6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured
      using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore,
      Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P < .05
      considered significant. RESULTS: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6
      and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control
      embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant
      increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9;
      range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had
      undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P < .003), similar to the controls. Alcohol
      exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) (P < .003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus 
      SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1beta were decreased 6
      hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not
      completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these
      alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, 
      normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
      interferon-gamma, and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of
      the groups. CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a
      significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced 
      increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage 
      in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

AB  - Doxylamine succinate, an H(1)-antihistamine drug, is commonly used as
      sleep-inducing agent as well as therapy for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. At 
      usual doses, it may cause impairment of cognitive and psychomotor performance,
      anticholinergic effects, agitation and postural hypotension. Besides, since this 
      drug is frequently involved in either accidental or intentional overdoses, it
      seems relevant to bear in mind other possible toxic effects. We report a case of 
      acute severe hyponatremia in the setting of a syndrome of inappropriate
      antidiuresis (SIAD), an apparent new adverse effect linked to doxylamine
      overdose. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a
      probable relationship between doxylamine intake and SIAD development. SIAD may be
      considered as a potential, serious adverse reaction of doxylamine overdose.
      Clinicians should consider this aetiological possibility when attending patients 
      suffering from hyponatremia.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine which factors during pregnancy and
      postpartum predict pelvic girdle pain (PGP) at 12 weeks postpartum among working 
      women. A total of 548 Dutch pregnant employees were recruited in 15 companies,
      mainly health care, child care, and supermarkets. The definition of PGP was any
      pain felt in the pelvic girdle region at 12 weeks postpartum. Participants
      received questionnaires at 30 weeks of pregnancy and at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum
      with demographic, work-related, pregnancy-related, fatigue, psychosocial,
      PGP-related and delivery-related questions. Univariate and multiple logistic
      regression analyses were performed. Almost half of the women experienced pain in 
      their pelvic girdle at 12 weeks postpartum. However, the level of pain and the
      degree of disability due to postpartum PGP was low. Pregnancy-related predictors 
      for PGP at 12 weeks were history of low back pain, higher somatisation, more than
      8 hours of sleep or rest per day, and uncomfortable postures at work. The
      pregnancy and postpartum-related predictors were: more disability at 6 weeks,
      having PGP at 6 weeks, higher mean pain at 6 weeks, higher somatisation during
      pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum, higher birth weight of the baby,
      uncomfortable postures at work and number of days of bed rest. Based on these
      results, it is concluded that extra attention should be given to women who
      experience PGP during pregnancy to prevent serious PGP during late pregnancy and 
      postpartum. More research is needed to confirm the roles of hours of sleep,
      somatisation, and bed rest in relation to PGP.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common childbirth complication, which can have
      negative effects on both the newly delivered woman and her family. This condition
      is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated, while a biological diagnostic test is
      not yet available. Furthermore, postpartum thyroid dysfunction is common among
      new mothers, and some evidence point to an association between PPD and thyroid
      function disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible
      association between serum levels of thyroid hormones at the time of delivery, and
      the later development of depressive symptoms, using data from a population based 
      cohort of Swedish women. Blood samples were collected during delivery from 347
      participating women, delivering at Uppsala University Hospital. The participating
      women filled in at least one of three structured questionnaires, containing the
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), at five days, six weeks and six
      months postpartum. A cut-off of 12 or more was applied on the EPDS, to identify
      cases of self-reported PPD and controls. Using a binary logistic regression model
      (adjusting for previous psychiatric contact, smoking during pregnancy,
      pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and sleep), having a thyroid stimulating
      hormone (TSH) level over the clinical cut-off level of 4.0 mU/L was associated
      with increased risk for depressive symptoms at six months postpartum (OR 11.30,
      95% CI 1.93-66.11). A ROC analysis revealed that the predictive variable (PV) had
      significant predictive ability for PPD at 6 months postpartum, given that the AUC
      was 0.764, and at a PV cut-off value of 6.33, the sensitivity and specificity
      were 76.2% and 69.4%, respectively. If these findings are replicated in future
      studies, they can have important clinical implications, since TSH determination
      is an inexpensive routine blood test, and its inclusion in a biological screening
      test for PPD involving other parameters would be tempting.

TI  - [Effect of retinol on interaction of the protein period1, oxytocin, and GABA at
      the prenatal period of formation of the circadian clock-mechanism in rats].
PG  - 481-6
AB  - Clock-gene proteins are expressed in mammals in neurons of the hypothalamus
      suprachiasmatic nucleus and of other CNS structures, in muscles, viscercal
      organs, and vessels, and form circadian rhythms of many functions. Little is
      known about the factors of formation of the circadian mechanism at the prenatal
      period. In rats the E20 stage is characterized by a high level of oxytocin and
      selective expression of the first protein of the clock-genes PER1. The foal of
      the present study was to check the suggestion about the positive feedback between
      PER1 and oxytocin at the prenatal period as well as to elucidate a possible role 
      of PER1 in regulation of interactions between oxytocin and GABA at the period of 
      formation of the cerebral circadian mechanism of clock-genes. With aid of
      western-blotting, we analyzed the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from anterior
      hypothalamus homogenate in pregnant females and embryos of rats (E20). The
      retinol metabolites through their nuclear receptor RORalpha are known to be bound
      to promoters of genes of oxytocin and per 1. Next day after administration of
      retinol to the females, a rise of PER1 content was noted in their cytoplasm,
      whereas in their embryos the PER1 content was elevated in the nucleus. In the
      embryo cytoplasm there was a significant rise of production of oxytocin receptors
      and a decrease of the level of enzymes of GABA synthesis (glutamate
      decarboxylases 67 and 65). The results indicate the oxytocin- and
      retinol-dependent increase of the PER1 expression and the subsequent change of
      ratio of efficiency of oxytocin and GABA at the prenatal stage of formation of
      the circadian clock-mechanism of the rat embryo anterior hypothalamus.

TI  - The prevalence and associated risk factors of sleep disorder-related symptoms in 
      pregnant women in China.
PG  - 951-6
LID - 10.1007/s11325-012-0783-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The sleep disorder in pregnant women remains unfamiliar to perinatal
      care providers, resulting in lack of appropriate care. This study was designed to
      investigate the prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women
      and to identify the associated risk factors. METHODS: Married pregnant women were
      enrolled from their first trimester and followed up until delivery. Nonpregnant
      married healthy women were selected as controls. A survey questionnaire was
      administered to each of them. RESULTS: We successfully performed a survey to
      1,993 pregnant women and 598 nonpregnant women. The overall prevalence of sleep
      disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women was significantly higher than the
      controls (56.1 vs. 29.9 %, P < 0.05). There was higher prevalence of snoring
      (30.2 %), observed sleep apnea (1.1 %), mouth breathing (23.7 %), nocturnal
      arousal (46.5 %), insomnia (35.1 %), and daytime sleepiness (52.6 %) in pregnant 
      women. There were no significant differences of the prevalence of bruxism (7.0
      vs. 6.7 %), sleep talking (8.1 vs. 7.2 %), and sleep walking (0.4 vs. 0.2 %)
      between the two groups (P > 0.05). Nocturnal sleep time (8.0 +/- 1.3 h) was less 
      in the third trimester compared with the nonpregnant women (8.2 +/- 1.1 h) (P <
      0.05). Smoking (OR = 3.39), drinking (OR = 2.40), allergic rhinitis/asthma (OR = 
      1.71), an obvious difference in neck circumference (OR = 1.11), and waistline (OR
      = 1.07) changes between the first and third trimesters were the risk factors for 
      sleep disorder-related problems. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of sleep
      disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women. Our data may provide a baseline for 
      prevention and treatment of sleep disturbances in pregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of, reasons given for, and factors
      associated with sick leave during pregnancy. DESIGN: Longitudinal,
      population-based descriptive study. SETTING: Akershus University Hospital,
      Norway. POPULATION: All women scheduled to give birth at the hospital (November
      2008 to April 2010). METHODS: Consenting women were handed a questionnaire at the
      routine ultrasound check at 17 weeks of gestation. Women returning this
      questionnaire received a second questionnaire at 32 weeks of gestation. Multiple 
      logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations with somatic,
      psychiatric and social factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates and duration of sick
      leave. RESULTS: By 32 weeks of gestation, 63.2% of the 2918 women included were
      on sick leave, and 75.3% had been on sick leave at some point during their
      pregnancy. Pelvic girdle pain and fatigue/sleep problems were the main reasons
      given for sick leave. Being on sick leave in all trimesters was strongly
      associated with hyperemesis, exercising less than weekly, chronic pain before or 
      during pregnancy, infertility treatment (all P < 0.001); younger maternal age,
      conflicts in the workplace (both P < 0.01); multiparity, previous depression,
      insomnia and lower education (all P < 0.05). Sick leave was associated with
      elective caesarean section and higher infant birthweight (P < 0.01). Adjustment
      of the work situation was associated with 1 week shorter duration of sick leave. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Most women receive sick leave during pregnancy, but sick leave might
      not be caused by pregnancy alone. Previous medical and psychiatric history, work 
      conditions and socio-economic factors need to be addressed to understand sick
      leave during pregnancy.

TI  - Factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among 
      women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1665-72
LID - 10.1007/s10995-012-1180-y [doi]
AB  - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of
      subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging
      in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since
      postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman's ability to engage in
      lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive
      symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The
      participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action
      for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized
      trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM,
      conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We
      administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4-15 weeks
      postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed
      by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score >/=9 indicated
      depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and
      administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about
      breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported 
      pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain
      data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery,
      and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify
      correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of
      postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study
      included 71 women (mean age 33 years +/- 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13
      % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m(2) +/-
      6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored >/=9 on the EPDS at the postpartum
      visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6
      weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and
      gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs
      gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of
      depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying
      factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important
      since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum
      period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were
      correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM
      (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

TI  - Anxiety and deterioration of quality of life factors associated with recurrent
      miscarriage in an observational study.
PG  - 495-501
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship of anxiety and quality of life and sleep 
      variables to recurrent miscarriages (RMs) in patients during two stages of their 
      treatment in an RM-dedicated clinic - before and after the evaluation - and
      determine what factors could aggravate anxiety and worsen global well-being
      outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-nine women who had experienced two or more RMs
      were measured before and after their evaluation and investigation in the RM
      clinic. A battery of questionnaires including the STAI scale and various
      instruments were administered to record anxiety, mental, and physical components 
      of quality of life and sleep quality. Several statistical tests including
      canonical correlation were performed. RESULTS: All the patients revealed a mild
      to moderate level of anxiety, low numbers of physical and mental health but
      reasonably normal values of the global quality of sleep. The evaluation in the RM
      clinic and investigation for possible causes accounting for RM did not
      significantly change anxiety levels. The children-to-pregnancies ratio introduced
      into the analysis proved to correlate significantly with the sleep quality and
      mental health. Summarized anxiety in a given RM woman could be predicted based on
      the set of the variables, characterizing the woman's reproductive status and her 
      psychological health. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes anxiety as a common
      response in RM patients, and suggests factors that predict it. Knowing these
      factors may help clinicians to identify more accurately those RM patients who
      would be prone to a high level of anxiety and therefore need more attention and
      reassurance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of the integrative capacity of the fetal
      autonomic nervous system (ANS) according to gestational age and emerging
      behavioral states, assuming that developing integrative ANS functions are
      reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate 
      variability markers. METHODS: Magnetocardiograms of 114 healthy fetuses (21-40
      weeks of gestation) were recorded. Level of fetal activity (quiet/active sleep)
      was estimated according to characteristic heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation
      functions of (i) fetal heart rate and (ii) time patterns of SDNN (standard
      deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square of
      successive differences in normal-to-normal intervals) were calculated and
      autocorrelation was determined over different time scales. Age and activity
      related changes were examined using linear regression and non-parametric tests.
      RESULTS: During pregnancy, autocorrelation increased in fetal heart rate signals 
      and time patterns of SDNN and RMSSD. Short-time correlation (0-20 s) changed
      between 21 and 31 gestational weeks. Long-time correlation (75-300 s) accelerated
      later in pregnancy and did not increase in quiet heart rate patterns. Strong
      state-dependent changes were found with time patterns of SDNN. CONCLUSIONS:
      Emerging integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of
      fetal heart rate fluctuations over increasing time scales. The period from 21 to 
      31 gestational weeks seems to be critical to ANS development. Increasing
      long-time correlation is specific to active sleep states.

TI  - Steroid hormones and sleep regulation.
PG  - 1040-8
AB  - In the search of the sleep substance, many studies have been addressed for
      different hormones, responsible for sleep-wake cycle regulation. In this article 
      we mentioned the participation of steroid hormones, besides its role regulating
      sexual behavior, they influence importantly in the sleep process. One of the
      clearest relationships are that estrogen and progesterone have, that causing
      changes in sleep patterns associated with the hormonal cycles of women throughout
      life, from puberty to menopause and specific periods such as pregnancy and the
      menstrual cycle, including being responsible for some sleep disorders such as
      hypersomnia and insomnia. Another studied hormone is cortisol, a hormone released
      in stressful situations, when an individual must react to an extraordinary demand
      that threatens their survival, but also known as the hormone of awakening because
      the release peak occurs in the morning, although this may be altered in some
      sleep disorders like insomnia and mood disorders. Furthermore neurosteroids such 
      as pregnanolone, allopregnanolone and pregnenolone are involved in the generation
      of slow wave sleep, the effect has been demonstrated in experimental animal
      studies. Thus we see that the sleep and the endocrine system saved a
      bidirectional relationship in which depends on each other to regulate different
      physiological processes including sleep.

TI  - Perinatal outcomes associated with obstructive sleep apnea in obese pregnant
      women.
PG  - 1085-92
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0b013e31826eb9d8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
      and maternal and neonatal morbidities in a cohort of obese gravid women. METHODS:
      Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to
      screen for OSA and describe the possible risk factors for and outcomes of OSA
      among obese (body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]2] 30 or
      higher) pregnant women. Women underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable
      home monitor. Studies were manually scored by a central masked sleep reading
      center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea
      hypopnea index of 5 or more was considered diagnostic of OSA. Perinatal outcomes 
      were compared between women with and without OSA. RESULTS: Among 175 women, OSA
      prevalence was 15.4% (13 mild, 9 moderate, 5 severe). Compared with no OSA (apnea
      hypopnea index less than 5), the OSA group had a higher BMI (46.8+/-12.2 compared
      with 38.1+/-7.5; P=.002) and more chronic hypertension (55.6% compared with
      32.4%, P=.02). Maternal complications included maternal death (n=1, amniotic
      fluid embolus [no OSA group]) and cardiac arrest (n=1, intraoperative at cesarean
      delivery [OSA group]). One previable birth and two stillbirths occurred in the no
      OSA group. Among live births, OSA was associated with more frequent cesarean
      delivery (65.4% compared with 32.8%; P=.003), preeclampsia (42.3% compared with
      16.9%; P=.005), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (46.1% compared with
      17.8%; P=.002). After controlling for BMI, maternal age, and diabetes, OSA (odds 
      ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-11.3), previous preeclampsia
      (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.09-7.19), and hypertension (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.67-10.77) were
      associated with development of preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: Obstructive sleep apnea 
      among obese pregnant women is associated with more frequent preeclampsia,
      neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and cesarean delivery. LEVEL OF
      EVIDENCE: II.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea screening and perinatal outcomes in Korean pregnant
      women.
PG  - 429-33
LID - 10.1007/s00404-012-2602-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was intended to evaluate the attributable risk of obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA) by a sleep questionnaire to adverse pregnancy outcomes.
      METHODS: This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant women. Berlin
      questionnaire was employed for symptom-based OSA screening during the third
      trimester and obstetric outcome data were obtained in 276 deliveries. The
      relationship between symptom-based OSA and outcomes were explored using SPSS
      version 18.0 and stratified by obesity (BMI strata <30 and >/=30). Our primary
      outcome was the compound occurrence of SGA (fetal) or preeclampsia (maternal).
      Multivariate models were applied in controlling for potential confounders.
      RESULTS: The overall prevalence of OSA was 32.2 % and it was significantly
      related with the higher maternal BMI, more body weight at delivery, and weight
      gain during pregnancy (p = 0.007, p = 0.003, p = 0.005, respectively). There were
      no significant differences in the primary outcomes according to the positivity of
      OSA by screening, regardless of the stratification by obesity. The cesarean
      delivery rate was significantly higher in the OSA positive group (36.0 vs 22.5 %,
      p = 0.018), but it was not significant in the each strata of obesity. In
      multivariate analysis, the outcomes of birth weight, preeclampsia, cesarean
      delivery, and small for gestational age were also not different according to the 
      positivity of OSA. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the prevalence of OSA by a sleep
      questionnaire is overestimating OSA in Korean pregnant women. Polysomnography
      might be needed to diagnose OSA and to evaluate the relationship between OSA and 
      the occurrence of SGA or preeclampsia.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in
      adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data
      from routine well-child assessments at ages 0-4 years. METHODS: Data from three
      assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11-17 
      years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0-4 years) came from the records
      of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems
      were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the
      adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years.
      Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value
      of these early indicators on trajectories. RESULTS: For boys and girls, we found 
      four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with 
      middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of
      trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or
      single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in
      boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For
      behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking
      during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single
      parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and
      attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and
      5.43). CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during
      adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data 
      from early well-child assessments.

AB  - PURPOSE: Identify epilepsy-associated factors and calculate measures of impact,
      stigma, quality of life (QOL), knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) and treatment
      gap in Prey Veng, Cambodia. METHODS: This first Cambodian population-based
      case-control study had 96 epileptologist-confirmed epilepsy cases and 192
      randomly selected matched healthy controls. Standard questionnaires, which have
      been used in similar settings, were used for collecting data on various
      parameters. Univariate and multivariate regression was done to determine odds
      ratios. Jacoby stigma, 31-item QOL, KAP etc were determined and so were the
      factors associated with them using STATA software. Treatment gap was measured
      using direct method. KEY FINDINGS: Multivariate analyses yielded family history
      of epilepsy, difficult or long delivery, other problems beside seizures (mainly
      mental retardation, hyperthermia), and eventful pregnancy of the subject's mother
      as factors associated with epilepsy. There was high frequency of seizure
      precipitants esp. those related to sleep. Population attributable risk (%) was:
      family history (15.0), eventful pregnancy of subject's mother (14.5),
      long/difficult birth (6.5), and other problem beside seizures (20.0). Mean stigma
      (1.9+/-1.1, on a scale of 3) was mainly related to treatment efficacy. Mean QOL
      (5.0+/-1.4 on a scale of 10) was mainly related to treatment regularity. Cause or
      risk factor could be determined in 56% of cases. Treatment gap was 65.8%.
      SIGNIFICANCE: Factors in pre- and perinatal period were found to be most crucial 
      for epilepsy risk in Cambodia which inturn provides major prevention
      opportunities. A global action plan for treatment, stigma reduction and
      improvement of QOL should be set-up in this country.

TI  - Obesity and male infertility: a practical approach.
PG  - 486-95
LID - 10.1055/s-0032-1328877 [doi]
AB  - Obesity in men is associated with infertility in numerous studies, and the
      temporal trend for a decline in semen parameters parallels the increasing
      prevalence of obesity in the developed world. In addition to impaired semen
      quality, fertility among obese men may be affected by decreased libido and
      erectile dysfunction. This spectrum of expression of hypogonadism among obese men
      originates from multiple interacting factors including reduced levels of
      gonadotropins and testosterone, altered androgen-to-estrogen ratios, insulin
      resistance, and sleep apnea. No evidence-based treatment that increases the
      likelihood of pregnancy for the infertility associated with male obesity has been
      demonstrated to date. Interventions associated with improvement of intermediate
      outcomes that include the endocrine profile, semen parameters, and sexual
      function may be appropriately selected based on history, physical findings, as
      well as endocrine and metabolic evaluation. Among these interventions are weight 
      loss through lifestyle change, relief from sleep apnea, use of aromatase
      inhibitors, gonadotropin administration, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and
      insulin-sensitizing agents.

TI  - Early-Onset Familial Alzheimer Disease
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by adult-onset 
      progressive dementia associated with cerebral cortical atrophy, beta-amyloid
      plaque formation, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. AD typically begins 
      with subtle memory failure that becomes more severe and is eventually
      incapacitating. Other common findings include confusion, poor judgment, language 
      disturbance, agitation, withdrawal, hallucinations, seizures, Parkinsonian
      features, increased muscle tone, myoclonus, incontinence, and mutism. Familial AD
      (FAD) characterizes families that have more than one member with AD and usually
      implies multiple affected persons in more than one generation. Early-onset FAD
      (EOFAD) refers to families in which onset is consistently before age 60 to 65
      years and often before age 55 years. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: EOFAD is diagnosed in
      families with multiple affected individuals with mean age of onset before 65
      years and/or with a documented pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to be
      associated with EOFAD. The three clinically indistinguishable subtypes of EOFAD
      based on the underlying genetic mechanism are: Alzheimer disease type 1 (AD1),
      caused by mutation of APP (10%-15% of EOFAD); Alzheimer disease type 3 (AD3),
      caused by mutation of PSEN1, (30%-70% of EOFAD); and Alzheimer disease type 4
      (AD4), caused by mutation of PSEN2 (<5% of EOFAD). Kindreds with autosomal
      dominant EOFAD with no identifiable pathogenic variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP
      have been described; thus, it is likely that variants in additional genes are
      causative. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Supportive; symptoms of
      depression, aggression, sleep disturbance, seizures, and hallucinations are
      managed on an individual basis; affected individuals eventually require assisted 
      living/nursing home care; agents that increase cholinergic activity, such as
      Aricept((R)) (donepezil), Exelon((R)) (rivastigmine), and Reminy((R))
      (galatamine), show modest but variable benefit; memantine, an NMDA receptor
      antagonist, is approved for use in AD; physical and occupational therapy help
      manage activities of daily living. Surveillance: Monthly monitoring to identify
      and manage secondary complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sudden changes
      in environment; over-sedation. GENETIC COUNSELING: EOFAD is inherited in an
      autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with EOFAD had an affected parent;
      occasionally, neither parent is identified as having had the disease, but a
      second-degree relative (e.g., an uncle, aunt, and/or grandparent) has or had
      EOFAD. Each child of an individual with EOFAD has a 50% chance of inheriting the 
      pathogenic variant and developing EOFAD. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at
      increased risk for is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known; 
      however, prenatal testing for adult-onset disorders is uncommon.

PG  - 423-8

AB  - Energy drinks have become very popular, yet they present health concerns and
      workplace safety issues related to mental and physical effects of the drinks,
      which are mainly related to the central nervous system and include heightened
      alertness, altered sleep patterns, arrhythmias and, rarely, seizures. In the
      workplace, any pharmacologic agent or substance, such as energy drinks, may
      present a risk to the delivery of health care, and the use energy drinks during
      pregnancy and lactation are a concern and patient education is warranted.

TI  - Time scales of autonomic information flow in near-term fetal sheep.
PG  - 378
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2012.00378 [doi]
AB  - Autonomic information flow (AIF) characterizes fetal heart rate (FHR) variability
      (fHRV) in the time scale dependent complexity domain and discriminates sleep
      states [high voltage/low frequency (HV/LF) and low voltage/high frequency (LV/HF)
      electrocortical activity (ECoG)]. However, the physiologic relationship of AIF
      time scales to the underlying sympathetic and vagal rhythms is not known.
      Understanding this relationship will enhance the benefits derived from using fHRV
      to monitor fetal health non-invasively. We analyzed AIF measured as
      Kullback-Leibler entropy (KLE) in fetal sheep in late gestation as function of
      vagal and sympathetic modulation of fHRV, using atropine and propranolol,
      respectively (n = 6), and also analyzed changes in fHRV during sleep states (n = 
      12). Atropine blockade resulted in complexity decrease at 2.5 Hz compared to
      baseline HV/LF and LV/HF states and at 1.6 Hz compared to LV/HF. Propranolol
      blockade resulted in complexity increase in the 0.8-1 Hz range compared to LV/HF 
      and in no changes when compared to HV/LF. During LV/HF state activity, fHRV
      complexity was lower at 2.5 Hz and higher at 0.15-0.19 Hz than during HV/LF. Our 
      findings show that in mature fetuses near term vagal activity contributes to fHRV
      complexity on a wider range of time scales than sympathetic activity. Related to 
      sleep, during LV/HF we found lower complexity at short-term time scale where
      complexity is also decreased due to vagal blockade. We conclude that vagal and
      sympathetic modulations of fHRV show sleep state-dependent and time
      scale-dependent complexity patterns captured by AIF analysis of fHRV.
      Specifically, we observed a vagally mediated and sleep state-dependent change in 
      these patterns at a time scale around 2.5 Hz (0.2 s). A paradigm of
      state-dependent non-linear sympathovagal modulation of fHRV is discussed.

TI  - Morbid obesity in pregnancy: a review.
PG  - 382-6
LID - 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32835a316b [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to draw together recent thinking on
      pregnancy and obesity, with a particular emphasis on prevention strategies and
      emerging clinical complications. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies including a large
      meta-analysis have highlighted that weight reduction strategies are not
      associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes, and there are suggestions
      that an approach of dietary modification alone may be associated with reduction
      in gestational weight gain. These findings are critically discussed with
      reference to future planned trials. New literature regarding hitherto
      under-reported complications of obesity in pregnancy such as ischaemic heart
      disease, schizophrenia and sleep disorders is highlighted. SUMMARY: There will be
      a need to focus on obesity prevention in the pregnant population as resources
      will not be adequate to the increasing incidence of the problem.

TI  - Increasing parity is associated with cumulative effects on memory.
PG  - 1038-45
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2011.3206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if reproductive
      experience is associated with cumulative effects on human memory performance
      during pregnancy and if these effects persist into the postpartum period.
      METHODS: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times
      during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and
      memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of
      covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: The data indicate that the previously documented
      adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive
      pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with
      poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences
      in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS:
      Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and
      function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the
      influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings
      provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and
      perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders have been associated with sleep disorders in
      men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints and
      disorders among pregnant women with psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A cohort of
      1,332 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We ascertained psychiatric
      diagnosis status and collect information about sleep duration, daytime
      sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress. Logistic regression procedures
      were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
      RESULTS: Approximately 5.1% of the cohort (n=68) reported having a
      physician-diagnosis of mood or anxiety disorder before interview. Compared with
      women without a psychiatric diagnosis, the multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) for
      short sleep duration in early pregnancy (</=6 hours) were 1.95 (1.03-3.69). The
      corresponding OR (95%CI) for long sleep duration (>/=9 hours) during early
      pregnancy was 1.13 (0.63-2.03). Women with psychiatric disorders had an increased
      risk of vital exhaustion (OR=2.41; 95%CI 1.46-4.00) and elevated perceived stress
      (OR=3.33; 95%CI 1.89-5.88). Observed associations were more pronounced among
      overweight/obese women. CONCLUSIONS: Women with a psychiatric disorder were more 
      likely to report short sleep durations, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived
      stress. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that
      mediate the apparent mood/anxiety-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

TI  - A clinical primer on restless legs syndrome: what we know, and what we don't
      know.
PG  - S83-8
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common
      sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse 
      group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly
      understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly
      resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies 
      have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of
      people with primary RLS possess a first-degree relative with the disorder.
      Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron
      deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately
      one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms
      experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically
      occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 
      2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased
      prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of
      life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling 
      urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that 
      is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS
      incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine
      agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including
      gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.

TI  - Sleep disturbances and binge eating disorder symptoms during and after pregnancy.
PG  - 1403-11
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compared sleep problems during pregnancy and sleep
      dissatisfaction 18 months after pregnancy in pregnant women with binge eating
      disorder (BED) symptoms and pregnant women without an eating disorder. DESIGN:
      Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Data
      were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having
      BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy 
      BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED
      symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder
      symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 
      17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We 
      collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during
      pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep 
      during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth.
      All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems
      during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio
      [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester,
      women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more
      hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED
      symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18
      months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during
      pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care 
      professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated
      with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.

TI  - Markers for severity of illness associated with decreased snoring in toddlers
      born ELGA.
PG  - e39-43
LID - 10.1111/apa.12033 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe the prevalence of paediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB)
      symptoms in extremely low gestational age infants and identify neonatal risk
      factors, including early exposure to hypoxia and hyperoxia. METHODS: Patients <28
      weeks gestation were monitored with high-resolution pulse oximetry.
      Hypoxia/hyperoxia variables were defined as percentage time of first 4 weeks of
      life that SaO(2) < 80% or SaO(2) > 98%, respectively. Parents completed part of
      the OSA-18 questionnaire for symptoms of SDB at 18-22 months. Logistic regression
      was used to test the association between risk factors and sleep symptoms.
      RESULTS: Of 182 patients recruited, 138 (76%) completed the questionnaire. The
      mean gestation was 26 weeks, and mean birth weight 887 grams. Loud snoring (21%) 
      and restless sleep (24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Female sex was
      associated with an increased risk of loud snoring (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.13-6.5).
      Prolonged mechanical ventilation, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged
      caffeine use, however, were inversely correlated with loud snoring. Neither
      neonatal hypoxia nor hyperoxia were associated with sleep symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: 
      While the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms is similar to
      reported rates, we found a sex difference not previously reported. Interestingly,
      markers for severity of illness show a pattern of being protective against loud
      snoring.

      children born 29 years apart.
PG  - 21-30

AB  - UNLABELLED: What is already known about this subject Factors associated with
      children's body mass index (BMI) include parents' BMIs, birth weight, maternal
      smoking, sleep duration and television watching. Few studies have attempted to
      quantify either changes in the association between risk factors and BMI or the
      contribution of changes in the risk factors to increases in BMI over a
      generation. What this study adds The magnitude of the association between most
      risk factors and children's BMIs has not changed over a 29-year period. Increases
      in the population level of mothers' body mass index (BMI) explains ~20% of the
      increase in children's BMI whereas the smaller increase in fathers' BMI
      contributes only 6%. Maternal smoking, despite the decrease in prevalence,
      contributes ~17%. OBJECTIVE: Using two cohorts born 29 years apart in Dunedin,
      New Zealand we aim to examine changes in risk factors and their associations with
      body mass index (BMI) at ages 3 and 7 years, and estimate their contribution to
      the secular changes in BMI at age 7 years. METHODS: Birth weight and
      anthropometric measures at ages 3, 5 and 7 years were obtained for 974
      participants in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study
      (DMHDS), born in 1972-1973, and 241 in the Family Lifestyle, Activity, Movement
      and Eating Study (FLAME), born in 2001-2002. Information about maternal age,
      education and smoking in pregnancy, as well as breastfeeding, children's
      television time and time in bed, was obtained by questionnaire. RESULTS: The
      increase in BMI over the 29-year period was 0.84 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06) kg m(-2) at 
      age 7. A 1-unit difference in the mother's BMI was associated with a 0.06 (0.03, 
      0.08) kg m(-2) difference in offspring in both studies; the 3.4 (2.8, 4.0) kg
      m(-2) increase in the mothers' BMIs accounts for a change of 0.19 kg m(-2) in the
      children's BMI. The much smaller generational increase in fathers' BMI (0.7 kg
      m(-2) ) correspondingly had a more limited effect on change in child BMI over
      time (0.06 kg m(-2) ). Although smoking in pregnancy decreased by 15% (8, 21) its
      association with BMI increased from 0.20 (-0.01, 0.42) in the DMHDS cohort to
      1.24 (0.76, 1.71) kg m(-2) in the FLAME cohort, contributing 0.18 kg m(-2) to the
      increase in children's BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Societal factors such as higher maternal
      BMI and smoking in pregnancy contribute most to the secular increase in BMI, with
      changes in behavioural factors, including sleep and television viewing, having
      little effect in this setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric
      illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not 
      always been assessed. AIMS: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral
      complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or
      did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Exposed
      and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the
      Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic
      monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal
      complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and
      analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and 
      neurobehavioral factors and exposure status. SUBJECTS: 67 infants (61 controls
      and 6 exposed to SRIs). OUTCOME MEASURES: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale,
      APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and
      tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference. RESULTS:
      Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development,
      lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to
      unexposed infants. CONCLUSION: Results of this study show differences in
      autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed 
      to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness.
      Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and
      unexposed infants of depressed mothers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to prospectively examine the impact of chronic vs
      pregnancy-onset habitual snoring on gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and
      gestational diabetes. STUDY DESIGN: Third-trimester pregnant women were recruited
      from a large, tertiary medical center from March 2007 through December 2010 and
      screened for the presence and duration of habitual snoring, as a known marker for
      sleep-disordered breathing. Clinical diagnoses of gestational hypertension,
      preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes were obtained. RESULTS: Of 1719 pregnant
      women, 34% reported snoring, with 25% reporting pregnancy-onset snoring. After
      adjusting for confounders, pregnancy-onset, but not chronic, snoring was
      independently associated with gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 2.36; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.48-3.77; P < .001) and preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.59; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.06-2.37; P = .024) but not gestational diabetes.
      CONCLUSION: New-onset snoring during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for
      gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In view of the significant morbidity
      and health care costs associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, simple 
      screening of pregnant women may have clinical utility.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Review recent research on the roles of gender, race/ethnicity,
      residential socioeconomics and age in obstructive sleep apnea syndromes (OSA) and
      their treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Men have a higher prevalence of OSA than women 
      and require higher continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressures for
      treatment, given similar severity of OSA. When comparing age, women have less
      severe apnea at all ages. Menopause, pregnancy and polycystic ovarian syndrome
      increase the risk for OSA in women. Neck fat and BMI influence apnea-hypopnea
      index (AHI) severity in women; abdominal fat and neck-to-waist ratio do so in
      men. Obesity, craniofacial structure, lower socioeconomic status and neighborhood
      disadvantage may better explain ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and
      severity of OSA. Ethnicity was no longer significantly associated with OSA
      severity when WHO criteria for obesity were used. SUMMARY: OSA has a male
      predominance; women have a lower AHI than men during certain stages of sleep;
      women require less CPAP pressure for treatment of similar severity of OSA, and
      there are ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA but
      these may be due to environmental factors, such as living in disadvantaged
      neighborhoods.

AB  - This narrative review explains the development of excess weight gain in babies
      and children. It takes a life course approach which includes genetics,
      pre-conception, pregnancy, infancy and childhood. The paper focuses on feeding
      behaviours, physical activity, parental influences and the wider social and
      environmental context. Risk factors which can cumulatively lead to excess
      childhood weight gain include: under- or overweight during pregnancy; the
      presence of diabetes during pregnancy; low or high birth weight; having obese
      parents; early weaning; prolonged formula feeding; rapid weight gain in the first
      year; disinhibited eating patterns and the consistent availability of energy
      dense food at home; feeding practices which are not responsive to the child's
      cues; insufficient sleep among preschool children; sedentary parents; low
      parental education; living in poor socio-economic circumstances; absence, or
      perceived absence, of safe play areas; parents who lack time or confidence to
      authoritatively parent; environments where there is poor access to affordable
      lower energy dense foods; and parents who do not accept that excess weight is a
      health problem. Recommendations for health professionals are made.

AB  - Carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors transduce low arterial O(2) tension into
      increased action potential activity on the carotid sinus nerves, which
      contributes to resting ventilatory drive, increased ventilatory drive in response
      to hypoxia, arousal responses to hypoxia during sleep, upper airway muscle
      activity, blood pressure control and sympathetic tone. Their sensitivity to O(2) 
      is low in the newborn and increases during the days or weeks after birth to reach
      adult levels. This postnatal functional maturation of the CB O(2) response has
      been termed "resetting" and it occurs in every mammalian species studied to date.
      The O(2) environment appears to play a key role; the fetus develops in a low O(2)
      environment throughout gestation and initiation of CB "resetting" after birth is 
      modulated by the large increase in arterial oxygen tension occurring at birth.
      Although numerous studies have reported age-related changes in various components
      of the O(2) transduction cascade, how the O(2) environment shapes normal CB
      prenatal development and postnatal "resetting" remains unknown. Viewing CB
      "resetting" as environment-driven (developmental) phenotypic plasticity raises
      important mechanistic questions that have received little attention. This review 
      examines what is known (and not known) about mechanisms of CB functional
      maturation, with a focus on the role of the O(2) environment.

AB  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change substantially as female
      mammals undergo the transition from a non-pregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we 
      examined the possibility that site-specific changes in brain regions known to
      regulate the sleep/wake cycle and body temperature might reflect altered rhythms 
      in these overt functions. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of
      immunoreactive FOS in early pregnant and diestrous rats in the medial septum
      (MS), vertical and horizontal diagonal bands of Broca (VDB and HDB), perifornical
      lateral hypothalamus (LH), and ventrolateral, medial, and median preoptic areas
      (VLPO, MPA, and MnPO, respectively). In the pregnant animals, FOS expression was 
      reduced and the daily rhythms of expression were lost or attenuated in the MS,
      VDB, and LH, areas known to support wakefulness, and in the MPA, a brain region
      that may coordinate sleep/wake patterns with temperature changes. However,
      despite the well-documented differences in sleep patterns between diestrous and
      pregnant rats, reproductive state did not affect FOS expression in the VLPO or
      MnPO, two brain regions in which FOS expression usually correlates with sleep.
      These data indicate that plasticity in sleep/wake patterns during early pregnancy
      may be driven by a reduction in wakefulness-promotion by the brain, rather than
      by an increase in sleep drive.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the continuity and discontinuity of trouble sleeping
      behaviors (TSB) from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood in a
      community-based prospective birth cohort study. METHODS: The original study
      comprised 7223 mother-offspring pairs who were followed prospectively at
      pregnancy, 6 months, 5, 14 and 21 years post-delivery. Participant numbers differ
      by follow-up stages. There were 3184 offspring for whom we have consistently
      collected information on TSB retrospectively at 2-4 years, and prospectively at
      14 and 21 years of age. RESULTS: These comprised maternal-reported offspring TSB 
      at 2-4 years and 14 years, and offspring-reported trouble sleeping at 14 and 21
      years. One in two children had persistent trouble sleeping from 2-4 to 14 years
      and two-thirds from 14 to 21 years. In the adjusted analysis, compared with
      2-4-years-old children with no trouble sleeping, those who experienced trouble
      sleeping were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.44) times more likely to have trouble
      sleeping at 21 years. Similarly, adolescents who experienced trouble sleeping
      were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.27) times more likely to experience trouble sleeping
      at 21 years. CONCLUSIONS: There is a continuity of TSB from early childhood
      through adolescence and young adulthood, although the persistence of TSB is
      strongest from adolescence to young adulthood. Interventions improving sleep in
      young children may prevent longer term difficulties in adolescents and young
      adults.

      adult mouse.
PG  - 743-51

AB  - RATIONAL: Depression is prevalent among women of childbearing age and is
      frequently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). As some 
      SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Flx), can cross the placenta, it is possible that the 
      neurodevelopment of the fetus may be affected, leading to altered behavior in
      adulthood. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the effects of perinatal Flx
      exposure on the subsequent expression of circadian rhythms in adult mice.
      METHODS: Dams were treated with 25 mg/kg/day Flx in their drinking water from
      embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 12. Circadian organization of wheel running
      rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed in the
      offspring starting at 6 weeks of age. RESULTS: We found that perinatal Flx
      exposure led to larger light-induced phase advances (1.19 +/- 0.51 vs. 0.55 +/-
      0.25 h), smaller phase advances to the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the
      mid-subjective day (0.44 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.17 h), and a shorter
      free-running period in constant darkness (23.47 +/- 0.13 vs. 23.64 +/- 0.13 h).
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that perinatal exposure to SSRIs may have
      consequences for the functioning of the circadian system later in life.

TI  - Acupuncture for insomnia.
PG  - CD005472
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD005472.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such 
      as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current 
      evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia.
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
      (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International,
      CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
      System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and
      relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We 
      screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and 
      experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating
      any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without
      additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional
      treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or
      acupuncture against other treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review
      authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds
      ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively.
      We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-three
      trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 
      98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke,
      end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They
      evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic
      acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or
      sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people
      with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI
      1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in
      sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive.
      Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment
      might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality
      (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup
      analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All
      trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of
      insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The
      effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication
      bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were
      minor. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of
      heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently
      rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger
      high-quality clinical trials are required.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome in Iranian patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1105-8
LID - 10.1007/s10072-012-1186-7 [doi]
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder that is
      often seen in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the association between RLS
      and multiple sclerosis (MS) is still unclear and RLS is not considered as one of 
      the MS symptoms. This study was conducted to assess the frequency of RLS and its 
      associated factors in patients with MS. This was a cross-sectional study
      conducted during January and April 2010. A total of 205 patients diagnosed with
      multiple sclerosis (164 females, 41 males, mean age 32.8 +/- 8.9 years) were
      enrolled in the study and underwent a medical history interview and a
      neurological examination. The diagnosis of RLS was based on International
      Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Criteria. 57 patients (27.8%) met the RLS
      diagnostic criteria. In 90.1% of the patients, the onset of RLS was simultaneous 
      with or followed by MS onset. There was no significant difference between
      patients with and without RLS in respect of age, gender, disease duration, and MS
      pattern. There was an increased incidence of leg jerks before sleep in patients
      with RLS (P = 0.04). In patients suffering from RLS, there is greater complaint
      of insomnia (P = 0.03). Body mass index, history of anemia, excessive day-time
      somnolence, consuming caffeine-containing beverages, pregnancy numbers, smoking, 
      and alcohol consumption were not associated with the presence of RLS. This study 
      revealed high prevalence of RLS in MS patients. Screening of RLS in these
      patients should always be considered to improve management of MS.

TI  - Sleep duration and disorders in pregnancy: implications for glucose metabolism
      and pregnancy outcomes.
PG  - 765-70
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2012.142 [doi]
AB  - Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by
      circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained
      significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction.
      Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk
      for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
      However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep
      duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high
      prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence
      of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated
      risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2
      diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk
      of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management
      during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature
      currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and
      impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy
      may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus
      will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated
      pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely
      affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline 
      important research questions that need to be addressed.

AB  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by
      nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by
      daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning.
      Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or 
      psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can
      increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum,
      and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral
      therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia 
      disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review
      with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when 
      present during postpartum and menopause.

TI  - [Clinical significance and intervention study of serum interleukin 18 in
      preeclampsia patients with coexisting obstructive sleep apnea].
PG  - 503-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of IL-18 in the obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome (OSAS)-induced preeclampsia (PE), by comparison of the changes of serum 
      IL-18 levels among different groups as well as before and after continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in pregnant women with both OSAS and
      PE. METHODS: In control group there were 18 normal pregnant women with apnea
      hypopnea index (AHI) < 5. In simple PE group 18 pregnant PE patients with an AHI 
      < 5 were recruited. In PE plus OSAS group 16 PE patients with coexisting OSAS
      were collected. CPAP treatment was performed for 1 week in 6 patients with AHI > 
      15 from PE plus OSAS group.Serum IL-18 levels were measured with ELISA. RESULT:
      There was a significant difference in serum IL-18 levels among control group
      [(261 +/- 95) ng/L], simple PE group [(382 +/- 121) ng/L], and PE plus OSAS group
      [(601 +/- 89) ng/L, all P < 0.001]. Following CPAP treatment, there was a
      significant decrease in AHI, systolic blood pressures, and serum IL-18 levels,
      but a significant increase in minimal SpO(2) (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study
      demonstrated that serum IL-18 levels in PE patients with OSAS were significantly 
      elevated, which suggested that OSAS might increase the incidence of PE by
      enhancing inflammatory response, while CPAP treatment could effectively improve
      the pathological process.

TI  - [Caffeine--common ingredient in a diet and its influence on human health].
PG  - 141-7
AB  - Caffeine is widely consumed by people of all ages. In the last period a market of
      caffeine-containing products, particularly energy drinks and food supplements
      increased. Caffeine for years is under discussion, whether has positive whether
      adverse impact on health. Children are a group of special anxieties. Caffeine is 
      a stimulant of central nervous system and therefore is probably the most commonly
      used psychoactive substance in the world. The physiological effect of caffeine
      and the lack of nutrition value causes a great interest its impact on health,
      especially with reference to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Results of
      scientific research are not clear. The influence of caffeine on the human body is
      conditioned with the individual metabolism of caffeine which also depends on many
      endogenic and environmental factors. According to the current knowledge moderate 
      caffeine intake by healthy adults at a dose level of 400 mg a day is not
      associated with adverse effects, but it also depends on other health determinants
      of a lifestyle. Excessive caffeine consumption can cause negative health
      consequences such as psychomotor agitation, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal 
      complaints. Adverse effect of caffeine intoxication is classified in World Health
      Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Metabolism of
      caffeine by pregnant woman is slowed down. Caffeine and its metabolites pass
      freely across the placenta into a fetus. For this reason pregnant women should
      limit caffeine intake. Children and adolescents should also limit daily caffeine 
      consumption. It results from the influence of caffeine on the central nervous
      system in the period of rapid growth and the final stage of brain development,
      calcium balance and sleep duration. Average daily caffeine consumption in
      European countries ranging from 280-490 mg. The highest caffeine intake is in
      Scandinavian countries what results from the great consumption of the coffee. As 
      far as caffeine consumption by Polish population is concerned there is very few
      data in this subject so far. In the nineties of the previous century it was 141
      mg per day, whereas according to recent survey daily caffeine intake by women
      from the Warsaw region was 251 mg and 15% of examined women consumed an excessive
      quantity of caffeine (> or = 400 mg). Smokers consume more caffeine than
      nonsmokers, similarly to persons with mental illnesses. With reference to the
      caffeine consumption it should be underline that caffeine content in coffee and
      tea beverages varies greatly depending on the method of brewing whereas the
      content of caffeine in many brands of energy drinks can much vary. This should be
      taken into account in the daily caffeine intake.

TI  - Timed maternal melatonin treatment reverses circadian disruption of the fetal
      adrenal clock imposed by exposure to constant light.
PG  - e42713
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0042713 [doi]
AB  - Surprisingly, in our modern 24/7 society, there is scant information on the
      impact of developmental chronodisruption like the one experienced by shift worker
      pregnant women on fetal and postnatal physiology. There are important differences
      between the maternal and fetal circadian systems; for instance, the
      suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master clock in the mother but not in the fetus.
      Despite this, several tissues/organs display circadian oscillations in the fetus.
      Our hypothesis is that the maternal plasma melatonin rhythm drives the fetal
      circadian system, which in turn relies this information to other fetal tissues
      through corticosterone rhythmic signaling. The present data show that suppression
      of the maternal plasma melatonin circadian rhythm, secondary to exposure of
      pregnant rats to constant light along the second half of gestation, had several
      effects on fetal development. First, it induced intrauterine growth retardation. 
      Second, in the fetal adrenal in vivo it markedly affected the mRNA expression
      level of clock genes and clock-controlled genes as well as it lowered the content
      and precluded the rhythm of corticosterone. Third, an altered in vitro fetal
      adrenal response to ACTH of both, corticosterone production and relative
      expression of clock genes and steroidogenic genes was observed. All these changes
      were reversed when the mother received a daily dose of melatonin during the
      subjective night; supporting a role of melatonin on overall fetal development and
      pointing to it as a 'time giver' for the fetal adrenal gland. Thus, the present
      results collectively support that the maternal circadian rhythm of melatonin is a
      key signal for the generation and/or synchronization of the circadian rhythms in 
      the fetal adrenal gland. In turn, low levels and lack of a circadian rhythm of
      fetal corticosterone may be responsible of fetal growth restriction; potentially 
      inducing long term effects in the offspring, possibility that warrants further
      research.

TI  - The prevalence and correlates of habitual snoring during pregnancy.
PG  - 541-7
LID - 10.1007/s11325-012-0717-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mounting evidence implicate habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of
      sleep-disordered breathing, as an important risk factor for adverse pregnancy
      outcomes including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Little, however, is
      known about the determinants of habitual snoring among pregnant women. We sought 
      to assess its prevalence and to identify maternal characteristics associated with
      habitual snoring during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women (N = 1,303) receiving 
      prenatal care provided information about habitual snoring before and during
      pregnancy in in-person interviews completed in early pregnancy. We calculated
      adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) from
      multivariable models designed to identify factors associated with snoring during 
      pregnancy. RESULTS: Approximately 7.3 % of pregnant women reported habitual
      snoring during early pregnancy. The odds of habitual snoring during pregnancy was
      strongly related with maternal reports of habitual snoring prior to the index
      pregnancy (aOR = 24.32; 95 % CI, 14.30-41.51). Advanced maternal age (>/=35
      years) (aOR = 2.02; 95 % CI, 1.11-3.68), history of pregestational diabetes (aOR 
      = 3.61; 95 % CI, 1.07-12.2), history of mood and anxiety disorders (aOR = 1.81;
      95 % CI, 1.02-3.20), and prepregnancy overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) (aOR = 2.31;
      95 % CI, 1.41-3.77) and obesity (>/=30 kg/m(2)) (aOR = 2.81; 95 % CI, 1.44-5.48) 
      status were statistically significant risk factors for habitual snoring during
      pregnancy. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy (aOR = 2.70; 95 % CI,
      1.17-6.26) was associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Identification of risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy has
      important implications for developing strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence
      of sleep-disordered breathing, promoting improved sleep hygiene and improved
      pregnancy outcomes among reproductive-age women.

PG  - 214-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare obstetric outcomes between patients with positive and
      negative Berlin Questionnaire results. METHODS: An observational study comparing 
      outcome between these two groups was carried out in seven hospitals, representing
      seven different regions of Turkey. In each center, pregnant women who were
      admitted for normal pregnancy follow-up or labor, were consecutively recruited in
      the study. Each participant completed a sleep apnea questionnaire from the Berlin
      Questionnaire. This questionnaire tests snoring and daytime sleepiness. Fetal
      outcome and pregnancy outcome are recorded from patient files. RESULTS: A total
      of 465 consecutive patients who completed the Berlin Questionnaire were analyzed.
      Patients with a positive questionnaire had a higher BMI, pre-pregnancy medical
      disorder rate and cesarean rate (68% vs 51%) than the negative group.
      Preeclampsia and gestational diabetes were more prevalent in the positive
      questionnaire group than the negative questionnaire group [19 (28%) vs. 18 (5%)
      for preeclampsia, 8 (12) vs. 13 (3%) for gestational diabetes, respectively]. At 
      logistic regression analysis, gravidity, gestational age at birth and a positive 
      questionnaire were independent predictors for preeclampsia. BMI and history of
      maternal medical disorders were independent predictors of gestational diabetes
      mellitus. CONCLUSION: Obstructive sleep apnea may be related to preeclampsia.

AB  - In March 2011, the Acromegaly Consensus Group met to revise and update the
      guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acromegaly complications. The
      meeting was sponsored by the Pituitary Society and the European
      Neuroendocrinology Association and included experts skilled in the management of 
      acromegaly. Complications considered included cardiovascular, endocrine and
      metabolic, sleep apnea, bone diseases, and mortality. Outcomes in selected,
      related clinical conditions were also considered, and included pregnancy,
      familial acromegaly and invasive macroadenomas. The need for a new disease
      staging model was considered, and design of such a tool was proposed.

LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2038 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep problems in children with fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) are reportedly common but not well characterized. Objectives
      were to: (1) assess sleep concerns in children with FASD using a caregiver-report
      survey, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ); (2) compare CSHQ
      results with those of previously reported community sample; and (3) describe
      pilot polysomnography findings in children with FASD. METHODS: Children with FASD
      were recruited from a behavioral intervention study, and participating caregivers
      completed the CSHQ. CSHQ results were compared with the original data from a
      previously published community sample of similar age. Participants with FASD and 
      elevated CSHQ scores were offered overnight polysomnography. RESULTS:
      Thirty-three children with FASD (4.1-12.1 years) were enrolled; 85% of children
      with FASD scored above the clinical cutoff Total Score of 41, reflecting marked
      sleep disturbance. Elevated subdomain scores occurred primarily in areas
      concerning for pediatric insomnia. Those with comorbid ADHD had elevated CSHQ on 
      additional subdomains with no difference in Total Scores. Compared with the
      community sample, children with FASD had higher Total Scores on the CSHQ (52 vs. 
      39, p < 0.001). Polysomnography, completed in 5 subjects, revealed mild sleep
      disordered breathing and fragmented sleep with elevated non-respiratory arousal
      indices. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant sleep problems are present in
      children with FASD on both subjective and objective measures. Further
      investigation is needed to better describe these sleep disturbances and their
      impact on overall health and daytime neurobehavioral problems in this clinical
      population.

TI  - Development of a pregnancy-specific screening tool for sleep apnea.
PG  - 389-94
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2030 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are 
      commonly used to screen for sleep apnea in non-pregnant populations. We sought to
      evaluate the Berlin and ESS in pregnancy and to determine whether an alternative 
      screening approach could better detect sleep apnea in pregnant women. METHODS:
      Pregnant women at high risk for sleep apnea (women with chronic hypertension,
      pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia)
      completed a sleep survey composed of the Berlin and ESS, and participated in an
      overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted device 
      designed to diagnose sleep apnea, defined as an apnea hypopnea index >/= 5. Using
      multivariable statistics, demographic, clinical, and subjective symptoms that
      were independently associated with sleep apnea were determined and a prediction
      rule for the presence of sleep apnea was developed. The predictive capacity of
      this newly developed system was compared to that of the Berlin and ESS using
      receiver-operating curve (ROC) statistics. RESULTS: Of the 114 women who
      participated and had a valid WP100 study, 100 completed the Berlin and 96 the
      ESS. The Berlin and ESS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this high-risk 
      pregnancy cohort, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.54 (p = 0.6) and 0.57
      (p = 0.3), respectively. Conversely, a model incorporating frequent snoring,
      chronic hypertension, age, and body mass index performed significantly better
      (AUC 0.86, p > 0.001). CONCLUSION: The Berlin and ESS are not appropriate tools
      to screen for sleep apnea in high-risk pregnant women. Conversely, our
      four-variable model more accurately predicts sleep apnea in pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the current state of knowledge regarding sleep disorders and
      their relationship to obstetric outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature
      review of the previous two decades (1991 to 2010) was conducted. The exposure was
      sleep disorders during pregnancy, and the outcomes of interest were feto-infant
      morbidity and maternal complications. RESULTS: Sleep apnea, snoring, and sleep
      quantity/duration were identified as the most frequently examined sleep disorders
      among pregnant women. Although our review found that studies examining the impact
      of sleep disorders on feto-infant outcomes were lacking, previous research
      indicates that such disorders may enhance the risk of preterm birth.
      Additionally, the current body of evidence suggests that sleep disorders
      adversely impact maternal health, increasing the likelihood of preeclampsia, and 
      gestational diabetes. CONCLUSION: Existing research points to the potentially
      harmful effects of sleep disorders on obstetric outcomes. The limited research in
      this arena highlights the need for further studies regarding the nature and
      strength of this relationship. Given the multiple dimensions of sleep and
      pregnancy, multivariate research approaches that incorporate biological and
      psychosocial factors are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether sleep disturbances during pregnancy affect
      cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state. METHODS: A cross-sectional
      study was conducted of 160 pregnant women at various stages of gestation.
      Participants were interviewed about their sleep length per night, sleep quality
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale, ESS), snoring habits, and symptoms of restless legs syndrome during the
      previous few weeks. Cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state was
      quantified by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) from short-term
      electrocardiogram monitoring. The relationship of HRV to diverse covariates was
      studied by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: No significant influences were 
      observed of short sleep duration (<7 hours per night), poor sleep quality (PSQI
      score >5), or restless legs syndrome on HRV measures. Participants with excessive
      daytime sleepiness (ESS score >9) and habitual snorers had a significantly
      elevated low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio and LF power in normalized
      units (LF norm). In multiple regression analyses, habitual snoring was strongly
      and positively associated with LF/HF ratio (P<0.001) and LF norm (P<0.001).
      CONCLUSION: Resting cardiac autonomic modulation was found to shift toward a
      sympathetic predominant state among pregnant women who are habitual snorers.

PG  - 1610-3
LID - 10.4045/tidsskr.11.1518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a generalised epilepsy with
      seizure onset in youth. The aim of this review is to present updated knowledge
      about the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of JME. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The
      review is based on a judicious selection of original English language articles,
      meta-analyses, and reviews found in PubMed, and the authors' own experience with 
      the patient group. RESULTS: Seizure onset occurs in adolescence. All have
      myoclonias, about 90 % have generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and one third have
      absences. Myoclonic jerks are frequently the debut symptom, while tonic-clonic
      seizures appear later on. Patients are particularly susceptible to seizures
      shortly after waking. It is important to ask specifically about myoclonias as
      most patients do not report jerks spontaneously. The electroencephalograms of
      44-81 % of the patients show discharges of 4-6 Hz polyspike waves. Focal EEG
      abnormalities may be seen in about 30 %. When patients are treated with valproate
      and seizure-precipitating factors are avoided, especially sleep deprivation,
      about 80 % become seizure-free. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam are alternative
      therapies for women of childbearing age. Attempts to taper off the medication
      after several years of seizure freedom entail a high risk of seizure relapse.
      INTERPRETATION: As there may be features of focal epilepsy in the seizure
      semiology and/or the EEGs, it may be difficult to diagnose JME. Thus, many
      patients are misdiagnosed as having a focal epilepsy and are given antiepileptic 
      drugs that may aggravate the tendency to seizures.

TI  - Excessive daytime sleepiness in late pregnancy may not always be normal: results 
      from a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 735-40
LID - 10.1007/s11325-012-0753-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Many changes that normally occur during pregnancy disrupt sleep and may 
      lead to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). However, given that pregnancy may
      also predispose to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), we sought
      to investigate whether EDS may be associated with snoring, gasping, or apneas,
      further suggesting SDB. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of women in the
      immediate postpartum period was conducted. Participants answered questions from
      the multivariable apnea prediction index regarding snoring, gasping, and
      witnessed apneas in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Participants were also asked 
      to answer Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questions, and a score 0-24 was
      calculated (>10 considered abnormal). Medical history and medication use were
      obtained both by history and review of the medical record. RESULTS: Out of 1,000 
      women recruited, 990 women answered the ESS questionnaire completely. Mean
      prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 +/- 6.2 with 21.7 % of the sample
      having a prepregnancy BMI >/=30. Mean ESS score was 7.1 +/- 3.9, and 1.7 % of the
      total sample scored 16 or greater. ESS increased significantly with age, BMI, and
      neck circumference. All three symptoms of SDB were associated with higher mean
      ESS scores. In a multiple linear regression analysis, loud snoring, gasping, and 
      apneas were statistically significant independent predictors of mean ESS score.
      CONCLUSIONS: EDS measured by ESS is a common finding in pregnancy. Snoring,
      gasping, and apneas appear to be independent predictors of mean ESS scores.

TI  - A prospective study of effects of psychological factors and sleep on obstetric
      interventions, mode of birth, and neonatal outcomes among low-risk British
      Columbian women.
PG  - 78
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstetrical interventions, including caesarean sections, are
      increasing in Canada. Canadian women's psychological states, fatigue, and sleep
      have not been examined prospectively for contributions to obstetric interventions
      and adverse neonatal outcomes.Context and purpose of the study: The prospective
      study was conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada with 650 low-risk pregnant
      women. Of those women, 624 were included in this study. Women were recruited
      through providers' offices, media, posters, and pregnancy fairs. We examined
      associations between pregnant women's fatigue, sleep deprivation, and
      psychological states (anxiety and childbirth fear) and women's exposure to
      obstetrical interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes (preterm, admission to
      NICU, low APGARS, and low birth weight). METHODS: Data from our cross-sectional
      survey were linked, using women's personal health numbers, to birth outcomes from
      the Perinatal Services BC database. After stratifying for parity, we used
      Pearson's Chi-square to examine associations between psychological states,
      fatigue, sleep deprivation and maternal characteristics. We used hierarchical
      logistic regression modeling to test 9 hypotheses comparing women with high and
      low childbirth fear and anxiety on likelihood of having epidural anaesthetic, a
      caesarean section (stratified for parity), assisted vaginal delivery, and adverse
      neonatal outcomes and women with and without sleep deprivation and high levels of
      fatigue on likelihood of giving birth by caesarean section, while controlling for
      maternal, obstetrical (e.g., infant macrosomia), and psychological variables.
      RESULTS: Significantly higher proportions of multiparas, reporting difficult and 
      upsetting labours and births, expectations of childbirth interventions, and
      health stressors, reported high levels of childbirth fear. Women who reported
      antenatal relationship, housing, financial, and health stressors and multiparas
      reporting low family incomes were significantly more likely to report high
      anxiety levels. The hypothesis that high childbirth fear significantly increased 
      the risk of using epidural anaesthesia was supported. CONCLUSIONS: Controlling
      for some psychological states and sleep quality while examining other
      contributors to outcomes decreases the likelihood of linking childbirth fear
      anxiety, sleep deprivation, and fatigue to increased odds of caesarean section.
      Ameliorating women's childbirth fear to reduce their exposure to epidural
      anaesthesia can occur through developing effective interventions. These include
      helping multiparous women process previous experiences of difficult and upsetting
      labour and birth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic noise is an environmental pollutant and well-known to cause
      annoyance and sleep disturbance. Its association with clinical and subclinical
      adverse health effects has been discussed. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review
      aimed to examine associations between chronic noise exposure during pregnancy or 
      childhood and health outcomes in early and late childhood. METHODS: Following a
      systematic electronic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE), an additional hand
      search and a critical evaluation of potential articles by 2 independent
      reviewers, 29 studies were included: 12 on pregnancy/birth outcomes with samples 
      ranging from 115 to 22,761 and 17 on cardiovascular and immune-mediated health
      outcomes in childhood with samples ranging from 43 to 1542. Evidence levels (3 to
      2++) were rated according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.
      RESULTS: Chronic noise exposure during pregnancy was not associated with birth
      weight, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, perinatal and neonatal death based
      on 6 cohort, 4 case-control, and 2 cross-sectional studies (highest evidence
      level 2+). There was some evidence supporting an association of chronic noise
      exposure with increased systolic blood pressure and stress hormone levels in
      urine and saliva in children evaluating 2 cohort and 15 cross-sectional studies
      (highest evidence level 2-). CONCLUSIONS: There seemed to be no associations
      between chronic noise and pregnancy outcomes based on studies with evidence
      levels up to 2+. Associations between chronic noise and health in children were
      based mainly on cross-sectional studies. However, the studies included in this
      comprehensive systematic review showed a high variation in study design, outcome,
      exposure and confounder assessments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical
      correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Taiwanese women.
      METHODS: We enrolled 461 pregnant women (18-45 years) admitted at Mackay Memorial
      Hospital for delivery from September 2010 to May 2011. The face-to-face
      questionnaire used to gather data included assessment of RLS diagnostic criteria,
      and questions related to RLS. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rate of RLS among
      the study participants was 10.4%; 2.8% were categorized as having chronic RLS.
      Participants without RLS reported higher folate and iron supplement consumption
      than those with RLS. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations of
      RLS with anemia and peptic ulcer disease. Participants with transient RLS during 
      pregnancy reported more regular coffee consumption before pregnancy, and better
      sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, than those with chronic RLS. Overall,
      81.2% of RLS sufferers reported sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
      revealed highly prevalent but poorly recognized RLS among Taiwanese pregnant
      women. The identification of predictors such as medical comorbidities, and
      protectors such as folate and iron supplements, is warranted for obstetric RLS.
      In most cases, symptoms began during the second or third trimester and resolved
      within a week after delivery. Restricted coffee consumption before pregnancy is
      encouraged, but further evidence is needed to support this recommendation.

TI  - The Healthy Start project: a randomized, controlled intervention to prevent
      overweight among normal weight, preschool children at high risk of future
      overweight.
PG  - 590
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-590 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research shows that obesity prevention has to start early. Targeting 
      interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet
      normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than
      interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions
      focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were 
      to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight 
      in children aged 2-6 years, who are yet normal weight, but have high
      predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet
      and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and
      quantity. METHODS/DESIGN: Based on information from the Danish National Birth
      Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having
      either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a 
      familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n = 5,902) were randomized 
      into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in
      registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the
      end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who
      presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study
      (n = 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the
      control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control
      group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The
      intervention took place over on average 1(1/2) year between 2009 and 2011, and
      consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical
      activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep
      quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking
      classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits,
      physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day
      questionnaire diaries and objective measurements. DISCUSSION: If the Healthy
      Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide
      valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in
      future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight 
      and obesity at an early age.

      and long sleepers.
PG  - 1079-85
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2012.06.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess characteristics of short sleepers and long sleepers and to
      assess association between sleep duration and central obesity in a
      population-based sample of women. METHOD: Non-pregnant women >/=20 years that
      were randomly selected from the population-registry of Uppsala, Sweden, answered 
      a questionnaire (n=6461) including questions on sleeping habits and somatic
      disorders. RESULTS: There was a U-shaped association between sleep duration and
      waist circumference. Short sleeping women (<5 h) had a waist circumference of
      89.2+/-14.9 cm (mean+/-SD) decreasing to 82.9+/-11.9 cm for women sleeping 7-<8 h
      and increasing to 89.0+/-16.7 cm for women sleeping >/=10 h. Both short sleepers 
      and long sleepers were more often physically inactive, smokers, ill or taking
      medication, and psychologically distressed than normal sleepers (6-<9 h). In
      women <50 years both short and long sleep duration were risk factors for central 
      obesity. Short sleep duration remained a risk factor for central obesity, whereas
      the association with long sleep duration did not reach statistical significance
      after adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Short sleepers and long sleepers showed
      differences in characteristics compared to normal sleepers. Furthermore, we
      showed an independent association between short sleep duration and central
      obesity, which was strongest in younger women. It is important to identify short 
      sleepers, especially in younger women.

TI  - Bright light therapy in the treatment of childhood and adolescence depression,
      antepartum depression, and eating disorders.
PG  - 1167-72
AB  - Circadian rhythm disorders represent an important component underlying the
      pathology of depression. One of the subtypes of depression, in which these
      disorders may play a crucial role, is the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The 
      bright light therapy (BLT) has been reported as a novel, promising treatment
      method for SAD since 1984, and most of the data revealing its efficacy has been
      referred to adult patients, without comorbid disorders. However, in the recent
      years, more and more reports have been presented, which confirm the usefulness of
      BLT in some specific subpopulations of patients, including children, adolescents 
      and pregnant women. The present review summarizes the applications of BLT in
      antepartum depression, childhood and adolescence depression as well as in
      patients suffering from eating disorders. Although the body of evidence is still 
      too small to recommend the use of BLT as the first line of treatment for the
      depression or eating disorders in these patient subpopulations; it appears that
      BLT may be a useful alternative or adjunctive therapy for these diseases.
      However, the specific clinical applications of BLT in these areas need further
      investigation.

TI  - Rhinosinusitis-related quality of life during pregnancy.
PG  - 283-6
LID - 10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3776 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy rhinitis manifests as nasal congestion, with resolution of 
      symptoms after delivery. Eighteen to 30% of pregnant patients report symptoms of 
      rhinitis. Pregnancy rhinitis may have an adverse effect on quality of life (QOL) 
      and may cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which in turn may adversely affect
      the outcome of pregnancy. Previous examinations of the prevalence of pregnancy
      rhinitis during different stages of pregnancy have been inconclusive. This study 
      aimed to determine rhinosinusitis-specific QOL during different stages of
      pregnancy. METHODS: A cross-sectional observation study of patients in the second
      and third trimesters of pregnancy using the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test
      (SNOT-22) was conducted in the obstetric clinic at McGill University Health
      Center in Montreal, Canada. Seventy-six low- risk pregnant patients were included
      in the study. Thirty-two patients were in the second trimester of pregnancy and
      44 patients were in the third trimester. RESULTS: Average item scores for the
      entire questionnaire were significantly higher (p = 0.041), indicating more
      severe impairment of QOL, in the third trimester in comparison with the second
      trimester. A comparison between women with and without preexisting allergic
      rhinitis, in both the second and the third trimesters, shows significantly higher
      SNOT-22 scores for the allergic group (p = 0.007). QOL was lower in the third
      trimester than in nonrhinosinusitis patients (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION:
      Rhinosinusitis-specific QOL is lower in the third trimester of pregnancy in
      comparison with the second trimester and also in comparison with
      nonrhinosinusitis patients. Increased awareness may enhance the QOL of pregnant
      patients, prevent OSA, and thereby positively influence the outcome of pregnancy.

AB  - Short sleep duration is associated with multiple adverse child outcomes. We
      examined associations of the built environment with infant sleep duration among
      1226 participants in a pre-birth cohort. From residential addresses, we used a
      geographic information system to determine urbanicity, population density, and
      closeness to major roadways. The main outcome was mother's report of her infant's
      average daily sleep duration at 1 year of age. We ranked urbanicity and
      population density as quintiles, categorized distance to major roads into 8
      categories, and used linear regression adjusted for socio-demographic
      characteristics, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, fetal growth, and
      television viewing at 1 year. In this sample, mean (SD) sleep duration at age 1
      year was 12.8 (1.6)h/day. In multivariable adjusted analyses, children living in 
      the highest quintile of urbanicity slept -19.2 min/day (95% CI:-37.0, -1.50) less
      than those living in the lowest quintile. Neither population density nor
      closeness to major roadways was associated with infant sleep duration after
      multivariable adjustment. Our findings suggest that living in more urban
      environments may be associated with reduced infant sleep.

AB  - Data about circadian blood pressure (BP) in normotensive patients with
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are lacking. Thus, we sought to compare
      dipper and nondipper circadian variation of BP profile between normotensive women
      complicated with GDM and normal pregnant women. Forty-two women with GDM and 33
      normal uncomplicated pregnant women who met the entry criteria for the study were
      enrolled in the study. Twenty-four-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring and echocardiography to measure the left ventricle mass index and
      diastolic parameters were performed. Nocturnal blood pressure dipping was
      calculated as follows: (awake BP - sleep BP) x 100/awake BP. Patients with a
      nocturnal reduction in average daytime systolic BP and diastolic BP of less than 
      10% were classified as nondippers. Left ventricle mass index was higher in
      normotensive pregnant women with GDM group than in normal pregnant subjects
      (101.98 +/- 24 g/m(2) vs. 90.67 +/- 15 g/m(2), P < .018). Significant nocturnal
      systolic and diastolic nondippings were observed in GDM groups compared with
      normal subjects. From diastolic variables, the mitral E velocity and
      isovolumetric relaxation time were compatible with diastolic dysfunction
      relaxation abnormalities (P = .003 and P = .015, respectively) in nondipper
      group. From all confounding factors, only E velocity (P = .002) and diagnosis of 
      GDM (P < .001) were predictive of nondipper circadian variation. This study shows
      that (i) circadian BP is impaired in normotensive pregnant subjects with GDM,
      (ii) the left ventricle mass index is higher in pregnant subjects with GDM than
      in normal pregnant subjects who despite a 24-hour BP are within normal limits,
      and (iii) in nocturnal nondipper group, the tendency to having diastolic
      relaxation abnormalities is noted.

AB  - Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that
      could prevent preterm delivery (PTD, <37 weeks gestation). We examined the
      individual and joint associations of pre-pregnancy BMI, second trimester exercise
      and sleep on PTD. We conducted a nested, population-based case-control study
      interviewing postpartum 344 cases delivering at <37 weeks, as identified by
      clinical estimate of gestational age from prenatal screening records, and 698
      term controls, excluding term low birthweight. Eligible women participated in
      California's statewide Prenatal Screening Program, worked during pregnancy, and
      delivered a singleton birth in Southern California in 2002-2003. Modeled
      separately, moderate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] =
      0.84-0.96--per hour/week) and vigorous (OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.46-0.98 for yes vs.
      no) exercise during the second trimester were associated with a reduced odds of
      PTD, and sleep duration was not (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.80-1.48 for <7 h; OR =
      0.88, 95% CI = 0.57-1.48 for >8 h vs. 7-8 h). When sleep and exercise variables
      were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 
      0.91; 95% CI 0.85-0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The 
      benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 
      24 kg/m(2) (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.79-0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No
      other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, 
      particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public
      health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both
      pre-conceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the
      United States.

LID - 10.3390/ijms13056303 [doi]
AB  - Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury at birth is associated with 1-3/1000 cases of
      moderate to severe encephalopathy. Previously, we have shown that connexin 43
      hemichannel blockade, with a specific mimetic peptide, reduced the occurrence of 
      seizures, improved recovery of EEG power and sleep state cycling, and improved
      cell survival following global cerebral ischaemia. In the present study, we
      examined the dose response for intracerebroventricular mimetic peptide infusion
      (50 mumol/kg/h for 1 h, followed by 50 mumol/kg/24 h (low dose) or 50 mumol/kg/h 
      for 25 h (high dose) or vehicle only (control group), starting 90 min after the
      end of ischaemia), following global cerebral ischaemia, induced by 30 min
      bilateral carotid artery occlusion, in near-term fetal sheep (128 +/- 1 days
      gestation). Both peptide infusion groups were associated with a transient
      significant increase in EEG power between 2-12 h after ischaemia. The
      ischaemia-low dose group showed a significant recovery of EEG power from day five
      compared to the ischaemia-vehicle and -high dose groups. In contrast, the high
      dose infusion was associated with greater secondary increase in impedance (brain 
      cell swelling), as well as a trend towards a greater increase in lactate
      concentration and mortality. These data suggest that higher doses of connexin
      mimetic peptide are not beneficial and may be associated with adverse outcomes,
      most likely attributable to uncoupling of connexin 43 gap junctions leading to
      dysfunction of the astrocytic syncytium.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is recognised as the leading cause of perinatal
      mortality and morbidity worldwide. Interest has been increasing recently as to
      the possible impact of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on the mechanisms of
      preeclampsia, possibly by augmenting placental hypoxia during sleep. A biomarker 
      of preeclampsia, sFlt-1, has also come to prominence in recent years and is
      postulated to be a good predictor of preeclampsia as well as a strong indicator
      of the severity of the disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effect of CPAP treatment for SDB on sFlt-1 concentrations during 
      pregnancy. METHODS: Patients were recruited from the outpatients' clinic in
      Campbelltown Hospital, Campbelltown, NSW in the first half of 2011. The levels of
      sFlt-1 in four pregnant women, with or without hypertensive disorders of
      pregnancy, and with or without SDB were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: Women with
      SDB and chronic hypertension or preeclampsia had higher levels of sFlt-1 and a
      greater percentage increase of this marker, and CPAP treatment appeared to
      attenuate the rise of sFlt-1 as shown in the table below. CONCLUSION: Elevated
      sFlt-1 was associated with untreated SDB in those with chronic hypertension. This
      study provides feasibility for a larger scale study to occur, to further examine 
      the validity of the hypothesis that CPAP treatment has a beneficial effect on
      sFLt-1 levels and therefore, may lower the risk and severity of preeclampsia.

      condition that is present in 4% of the general population. SDB is identified by
      snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by
      repetitive hypoxia and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke 
      and heart attack. There is not depth of knowledge examining the association
      between SDB and pregnancy outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence of self
      reported snoring in pregnancy and the potential association between self reported
      snoring and the development of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) within a
      larger cohort from a prevalence of SDB in pregnancy study. METHODS:
      Questionnaires were administered to pregnant women attending an outpatient's
      antenatal clinic. The self reported snoring is a component of the Epworth scale. 
      Pregnancy progression and outcome data were collected on all participants and
      analyse by IBM SPSS v.20 utilising Chi-square analysis, Student T test and
      logistic regression analysis. HDP diagnoses were in alignment with the SOMANZ
      (2009) diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Questionnaires were administered and
      outcomes collected on 2023 pregnancies. Snoring was reported by 49.2% of women.
      HDP affected 10.1% of the cohort, 3.3% of whom were preeclamptic. Of the
      pregnancies affected by HDP self reported snoring occurred in 57.7% in comparison
      to 43.3% who do not report snoring (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This would indicate
      that there is an association between self reported snoring and the development of
      HDP. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the effect of other potential
      risk factors such as maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI and other co
      morbidities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has not been clarified whether home blood pressure monitoring
      (HBPM) during pregnancy is useful to detect high risk pregnant women with later
      onset of gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE). OBJECTIVES: We
      thought to determine the preceding features of blood pressure (BP) in HBPM before
      the onset of GH and PE. We especially focused on the existence of the inflection 
      point, its level, when it occurs, and the increased speed of BP after the
      inflection point. We compared these features in normal pregnant women (NP), women
      with GH, and women with PE. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 361
      singleton pregnant women, among them 100 women recruited due to high risk for
      GH/PH in the second trimester, participated in a couple of tertiary perinatal
      centers between 2008 and 2010. HBPM were measured with the validated OMRON
      HEM-5001(R) automated digital oscillometric sphygmomanometer (OMRON Healthcare
      Japan). The device was programmed to take three consecutive readings at 15-second
      interval. HBPM was measured twice a day, at the time of awakening and sleep,
      through the first to third trimester, and the average systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of each gestational week (almost 42
      times a week) were calculated. We defined the data of HBPM which started before
      28 gestational weeks and continued until 2 weeks before the onset of GH/PE or
      delivery are eligible. The increased speed of systolic or diastolic BP after the 
      inflection point was defined as ("BP at the onset in GH/PE or at delivery in NP" 
      - "BP at the inflection point") / ("Gestational weeks at the onset in GH/PE or at
      delivery in NP" - "Gestational weeks at the inflection point"). If there was no
      inflection point in HBPM, the increased speed of BP was defined as zero. The
      comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
      multiple comparison. Data were shown as mean+/-SE. RESULTS: A total of 17 (4.7%) 
      women developed PE, and 12 (3.3%) GH.The systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels at 
      the inflection point in NP, GH and PE was 102.4+/-1.3, 118.7+/-2.9 and
      117.4+/-2.2mmHg, respectively (Significant pairs: NP < GH, PE); the diastolic
      blood pressure (DBP) levels at the inflection point was 59.2+/-1.0, 74.5+/-2.0
      and 73.1+/-2.0mmHg, respectively (NP < GH, PE). The inflection point in NP, GH
      and PE occurred at 31.3+/-0.9, 28.4+/-1.5 and 22.3+/-1.4weeks, respectively (PE <
      GH, NP). The increased speed of SBP in NP, GH and PE was 1.2+/-0.1, 3.0+/-0.4 and
      4.7+/-0.7mmHg/wk, respectively (NP < GH, PE); the increased speed of DBP
      was1.1+/-0.1, 2.1+/-0.3 and 2.8+/-0.4mmHg/wk, respectively (NP < GH, PE).
      CONCLUSION: In women with later onset of GH/PE, the BP level at the inflection
      points was higher than in NP. The average inflection point in PE was earlier
      gestational weeks than in GH and NP. The average increased speed of blood
      pressure after the inflection point in GH/PE was faster than in NP. The preceding
      features of BP in HBPM may be clinically useful to detect high risk women with
      later onset of GH/PE.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) are a common complication
      of pregnancy. It is widely believed that this is a more common complication of
      adolescent pregnancies. Adolescent pregnancies are generally primiparous and
      result in earlier delivery, and these factors put them at a greater risk of
      preeclampsia. However, the generally lower blood pressure of the group should act
      as a protective measure against this. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this investigation
      was to compare the adolescent age group (maternal age <20years at time of
      recruitment) to those in the 20-34years age group in terms of their change in
      blood pressure and diagnosis of HDP and preeclampsia. Immediate obstetric
      outcomes (gestation at delivery, birthweight and mode of delivery) were also
      compared. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to pregnant women at
      Campbelltown and Liverpool hospitals as part of a much broader study looking at
      sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy. Data collected included demographic
      information, pregnancy blood pressure readings, pregnancy complications, delivery
      type and neonatal outcomes. Adolescents (Group 1 age <20years) were compared to
      older women (Group 2 aged 20-34years) utilizing Student's t-tests analysed with
      IBM SPSS v.19. RESULTS: Results were available on 2306 women, 108 in Group 1 and 
      2198 in Group 2. Adolescents had a lower booking systolic blood pressure (105mmHg
      and 109mmHg, p<0.005) and diastolic blood pressure (63mmHg and 65mmHG, p<0.002)
      than older women respectively. There was no statistical difference in the highest
      recorded systolic blood pressure antenatally (119mmHg and 121mmHg, p<0.06) nor
      the highest recorded diastolic blood pressure readings between Groups 1 and 2
      respectively (74mmHg and 75mmHg, p=0.6). There was no difference in the rates of 
      HDP between the groups (8.3% and 8.2%, p=0.8) nor the rates of preeclampsia (2.8%
      and 2.9%, p=1.0). CONCLUSION: Although adolescents have lower booking blood
      pressures than their older peers, their highest antenatal blood pressure readings
      are similar and they have the same incidence of HDP and preeclampsia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Snoring is a common symptom of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), a 
      condition that is present in 4% of the general population. SDB is identified by
      snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by
      repetitive hypoxia and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke 
      and heart attack.The general risk factors associated with severe preeclampsia
      significantly overlap with those reported to increase the risk of SDB syndromes. 
      Further risk factors that need consideration include: multiple pregnancy,
      diabetes and chronic hypertension treatment. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
      prevalence of SDB in the pregnant population in a metropolitan hospital and to
      examine self-reported snoring against actual snoring as determined by Sonomat (c)
      studies and report fetal outcomes of those who snored compared to those who did
      not snore. METHODS: A questionnaire containing The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and
      the Berlin Questionnaire (which examines snoring and tiredness) was administered 
      to 3000 pregnancies over a period of two years. Women were additionally recruited
      for detailed sleep studies, which entailed continuous night time blood pressure
      monitoring, encephalogram for sleep staging and continuous night time
      cardiotocographic monitoring. RESULTS: To date, 2206 surveys have been completed.
      Sleep studies have been undertaken by 280 women, of which half have continuous
      blood pressure readings. The detailed data provided through these studies is
      currently being examined and will be completed by June 2012. CONCLUSION: This
      study is unique and unprecedented in the scope of detailed data obtained through 
      the variety of parameters measured. Coupled with pregnancy progression and
      comprehensive maternal and neonatal outcomes, it is anticipated that this
      multi-faceted study will provide a wealth of knowledge on sleep patterns, SDB and
      its effect on pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus.

TI  - Filling the treatment gap in the weight management of overweight and obese
      patients.
PG  - S39-S42
AB  - Approximately two out of three adult Americans are overweight or obese. Despite
      widespread recognition of this disorder, there has been little progress in the
      past 20 years in finding effective noninvasive treatments for weight loss. The
      consequences of obesity are increasingly well recognized and include increases in
      blood pressure, plasma lipids, the onset of type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, asthma,
      osteoarthritis and a variety of cancers. Obesity can increase the rate of
      pregnancy complications and fetal malformations in normoglycemic women. Current
      medical approaches to obesity, including intensive lifestyle interventions and
      drug therapies, have been successful in achieving modest weight loss of 4-7%,
      less than the 1998 NIH Guidelines target of 10%. Surgical approaches, including
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, vertical banded gastroplasty and
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, are much more successful, achieving weight loss of
      15-50%. A treatment gap therefore exists in the management of obese and
      overweight patients, because many patients desire and would receive great health 
      benefits by achieving weight loss of 7-15%. This review will discuss the dilemma 
      of the treatment gap and explore possible ways by which it may be filled in the
      future by the use of innovative approaches.

AB  - Sleep disruption has been suggested to contribute to postpartum mood, but few
      studies have explored differences in this relationship between nulliparous and
      multiparous mothers. This study compared the interaction of sleep and mood as a
      function of parity. Thirty-five nulliparous and 34 multiparous mothers completed 
      questionnaires on mood and sleep, and wore actigraphs for 7 days during the third
      trimester of pregnancy and within 2 weeks postpartum. Mood and objective sleep
      were better in multiparas than in nulliparas after delivery. However, other than 
      a stronger association between subjective sleep and stress in nulliparous
      mothers, the relationship between sleep and mood did not differ significantly
      between the two groups. This suggests that parity might play only a limited role 
      in the interaction between sleep and mood during the immediate postpartum period.

      prevalence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) was 61.9%, and mean BIS score 17.5
      (SD = 10.5), significantly higher than among the general population. The
      prevalence of depressive symptoms (EPDS >/= 10) was 14.6%. Depressive symptoms
      were strongly associated with insomnia during late pregnancy, especially with
      sleep durations <5 or >10 hours, sleep efficiency <75%, daytime impairment, and
      long sleep onset latency. Pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain was associated
      with insomnia, but not with depressive symptoms.

TI  - Adolescent Work Experiences and Family Formation Behavior.
PG  - 150-164
AB  - A long-standing critique of adolescent employment is that it engenders a
      precocious maturity of more adult-like roles and behaviors, including school
      disengagement, substance use, sexual activity, inadequate sleep and exercise, and
      work-related stress. Though negative effects of high-intensity work on adolescent
      adjustment have been found, little research has addressed whether such work
      experiences are associated with precocious family formation behaviors in
      adolescence, such as sexual intercourse, pregnancy, residential independence, and
      union formation. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
      Health, we find that teenagers who spend long hours on the job during the school 
      year are more likely to experience these family formation behaviors earlier than 
      youth who work moderately or not at all.

TI  - MECP2-Related Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: MECP2-related disorders in females include classic Rett
      syndrome, variant Rett syndrome, and mild learning disabilities. A pathogenic
      MECP2 variant in a male is presumed to most often be lethal; phenotypes in rare
      surviving males are primarily severe neonatal encephalopathy and manic-depressive
      psychosis, pyramidal signs, Parkinsonian, and macro-orchidism (PPM-X syndrome).
      Classic Rett syndrome, a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder primarily
      affecting girls, is characterized by apparently normal psychomotor development
      during the first six to 18 months of life, followed by a short period of
      developmental stagnation, then rapid regression in language and motor skills,
      followed by long-term stability. During the phase of rapid regression,
      repetitive, stereotypic hand movements replace purposeful hand use. Additional
      findings include fits of screaming and inconsolable crying, autistic features,
      panic-like attacks, bruxism, episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea, gait ataxia and
      apraxia, tremors, seizures, and acquired microcephaly. Atypical Rett syndrome is 
      observed increasingly as MECP2 variants are identified in individuals previously 
      diagnosed with: clinically suspected but molecularly unconfirmed Angelman
      syndrome; intellectual disability with spasticity or tremor; mild learning
      disability; or (rarely) autism. Severe neonatal encephalopathy resulting in death
      before age two years is the most common phenotype observed in affected males.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of all MECP2-related disorders relies on
      molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of classic Rett syndrome rests on
      clinical diagnostic criteria. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment 
      is mainly symptomatic and multidisciplinary and should include psychosocial
      support for family members. Risperidone may help in treating agitation; melatonin
      can ameliorate sleep disturbances. Treatment of seizures, constipation,
      gastroesophageal reflux, scoliosis, prolonged QTc, and spasticity is routine.
      Surveillance: Periodic evaluation by the multidisciplinary team; regular
      assessment of QTc for evidence of prolongation; regular assessment for scoliosis.
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs known to prolong the QT interval. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: MECP2-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. More
      than 99% are simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family), resulting
      from a de novo pathogenic variant, or possibly from inheritance of the pathogenic
      variant from a parent who has germline mosaicism. Rarely, a MECP2 variant may be 
      inherited from a carrier mother in whom favorable skewing of X-chromosome
      inactivation results in minimal to no clinical findings. When the mother is a
      known carrier, the risk to her offspring of inheriting the MECP2 variant is 50%. 
      Prenatal testing is possible in pregnancies at increased risk if the pathogenic
      MECP2 variant has been identified in the family. Because of the possibility of
      germline mosaicism, it is appropriate to offer prenatal diagnosis to couples who 
      have had a child with a MECP2-related disorder regardless of whether the
      pathogenic variant has been detected in a parent.

TI  - Smith-Magenis Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is characterized by
      distinctive physical features (particularly facial features that progress with
      age), developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and behavioral abnormalities.
      Infants have feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, hypotonia, hyporeflexia,
      prolonged napping or need to be awakened for feeds, and generalized lethargy. The
      majority of individuals function in the mild-to-moderate range of intellectual
      disability. The behavioral phenotype, including significant sleep disturbance,
      stereotypies, and maladaptive and self-injurious behaviors, is generally not
      recognized until age 18 months or older and continues to change until adulthood. 
      Sensory integration issues are frequently noted. Children and adults typically
      have inattention, distractibility, hyperactivity, impulsivity, maladaptive
      behaviors including frequent outbursts/temper tantrums, attention seeking,
      disobedience, aggression, toileting difficulties, and self-injurious behaviors
      (SIB) including self-hitting, self-biting, and/or skin picking, inserting foreign
      objects into body orifices (polyembolokoilamania), and yanking fingernails and/or
      toenails (onychotillomania). Among the stereotypic behaviors described, the
      spasmodic upper-body squeeze or "self-hug" seems to be highly associated with
      SMS. The finger lick and page flipping ("lick and flip") behavior may be less
      prevalent than initially reported. An underlying developmental asynchrony,
      specifically between intellectual functioning and emotional maturity, may also
      contribute to maladaptive behaviors in people with SMS. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The
      diagnosis of SMS is based on clinical findings and confirmed by either detection 
      of an interstitial deletion of 17p11.2 or by molecular genetic testing of RAI1. A
      visible interstitial deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 can be detected in all
      individuals with the common deletion by a routine G-banded analysis, provided the
      resolution is adequate (>/=550 band). It is not uncommon for the deletion to be
      overlooked particularly when the indication for the cytogenetic study is not SMS.
      Molecular cytogenetic analysis by FISH using a DNA probe specific for the SMS
      critical region or aCGH is required in cases of submicroscopic deletions and/or
      to resolve equivocal cases. Mutation or deletion of RAI1 accounts for the
      majority of features in SMS. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Early
      childhood intervention programs; special education; vocational training/supports 
      later in life; and speech/language, physical, occupational, behavioral, and
      sensory integration therapies. Affected individuals may also benefit from use of 
      psychotropic medication to increase attention and/or decrease hyperactivity, and 
      therapeutic management of sleep disorders. Respite care and psychosocial support 
      for family members are recommended. Surveillance: Annual multidisciplinary
      evaluations to assist in development of an individualized education program
      (IEP), evaluation of thyroid function, fasting lipid profile, routine urinalysis 
      to evaluate for occult urinary tract infection, monitoring for scoliosis,
      ophthalmologic examination, periodic neurodevelopmental assessments and/or
      developmental/behavioral pediatric consultations, otolaryngologic follow up for
      assessment and management of otitis media and other sinus abnormalities, and
      audiologic evaluation to monitor for conductive or sensorineural hearing loss
      annually or as clinically indicated. GENETIC COUNSELING: Smith-Magenis syndrome
      (SMS) is caused by deletion or mutation of RAI1 on chromosome 17p11.2. Virtually 
      all occurrences are de novo. Complex familial chromosome rearrangements leading
      to del(17)(p11.2) and SMS occur but are rare. If parental chromosome analysis is 
      normal, the risk to sibs of the proband is likely to be less than 1%. The small
      recurrence risk takes into account the possibility of germline mosaicism, which
      has been documented in at least two families. If a parent of the proband has a
      balanced chromosome rearrangement, at-risk family members can be tested by
      chromosome analysis and FISH. In the rare instance of a complex familial
      chromosome rearrangement, prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at
      increased risk using a combination of routine cytogenetic studies and FISH.

AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition found in
      pregnancy. As such, all neurologists, internists, and obstetricians should know
      how to counsel women with epilepsy as they are considering pregnancy. While all
      of the usual recommendations for women of childbearing potential apply, including
      preconceptual and ongoing use of folic acid, calcium, and vitamin D, additional
      consideration must be given to the need for adjustment or change of
      anticonvulsant therapy. Monotherapy with the lowest dose of medication needed to 
      control seizures should be prescribed prior to conception. Most anticonvulsants
      have a favorable profile when used in pregnancy; older anticonvulsants such as
      valproate and carbamazepine should be avoided, as they are associated with higher
      rates of fetal malformation, and in the case of valproate, with proven cognitive 
      deficits in children exposed to this medication in utero. With use of any
      anticonvulsant medication, dosing throughout pregnancy will need to be adjusted
      to maintain an appropriate serum concentration. Dosing of anticonvulsants needs
      to be decreased after delivery to avoid medication-related toxicity, although
      sleep deprivation and hormonal fluctuation can increase the risk of seizures in
      postpartum women. With proper management, the majority of women with epilepsy can
      have uneventful pregnancies and healthy babies.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between key variables obtained
      from ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) and the wrist-worn Watch-PAT 200 device in 
      pregnant women. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, women in their third
      trimester of pregnancy underwent full overnight home PSG using the 22-channel
      MediPalm system and the Watch-PAT 200 device. PSGs were scored by a blinded,
      experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored
      automatically by the manufacturer's proprietary software. RESULTS: A total of 31 
      pregnant women were studied. Mean age was 30.2 +/- 7.1 years; mean gestational
      age was 33.4 +/- 3.0 weeks; mean BMI was 31.9 +/- 8.1 kg/m(2); 39% of women were 
      nulliparous. Key variables generated by PSG and Watch-PAT correlated well over a 
      wide range, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.76, p < 0.001);
      respiratory disturbance index (RDI, r = 0.68, p < 0.001), mean oxygen saturation 
      (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The
      area under the curve for AHI >/= 5 and RDI >/= 10 were 0.96 and 0.94,
      respectively. Association between stage 3 sleep on PSG and deep sleep on
      Watch-PAT was poor. Watch-PAT tended to overscore RDI, particularly as severity
      increased. CONCLUSIONS: Among pregnant women, Watch-PAT demonstrates excellent
      sensitivity and specificity for identification of obstructive sleep apnea,
      defined as AHI >/= 5 on full PSG. Watch-PAT may overestimate RDI somewhat,
      especially at high RDI values.

TI  - Reduced sleep and impaired sleep initiation in adult male rats exposed to alcohol
      during early postnatal period.
PG  - 38-42
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2012.06.002 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral
      abnormalities, such as increased motor activity and elevated anxiety, that may
      last a lifetime. Persistent sleep disruption may underlie these problems. Using a
      rat model, we investigated long-term alterations of sleep-wake behavior following
      AE during a critical early developmental period. Male rats received 2.6 g/kg of
      alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a developmental 
      period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group), or were
      sham-intubated (S group). On PD52-80, they were instrumented for tethered
      electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram recording and habituated to the
      recording procedures. Sleep-wake behavior was then recorded during one 24 h-long 
      session. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were
      scored in 10 s epochs during 6h of the lights-on (rest) and 6h of the lights-off 
      (active) periods. During the active period, REMS percentage was significantly
      lower (4.7 +/- 0.9 (SE) vs. 8.2 +/- 0.9; p < 0.02) and the percentage of SWS
      tended to be lower (p = 0.07) in AE than S rats (N = 6/group). During the rest
      period, sleep and wake amounts did not differ between the groups, but AE rats had
      longer latency to both SWS and REMS onset (p = 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). Our
      data demonstrate that, in a rat model of prenatal AE, impaired sleep-wake
      behavior persists into the adulthood. Disordered sleep may exacerbate cognitive
      and behavioral disorders seen in human victims of prenatal AE.

TI  - Night work and breast cancer: a population-based case-control study in France
      (the CECILE study).
PG  - 924-31
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27669 [doi]
AB  - Night work involving disruption of circadian rhythm was suggested as a possible
      cause of breast cancer. We examined the role of night work in a large
      population-based case-control study carried out in France between 2005 and 2008. 
      Lifetime occupational history including work schedules of each night work period 
      was elicited in 1,232 cases of breast cancer and 1,317 population controls.
      Thirteen percent of the cases and 11% of the controls had ever worked on night
      shifts (OR = 1.27 [95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.64]). Odds ratios were 1.35
      [1.01-1.80] in women who worked on overnight shifts, 1.40 [1.01-1.92] in women
      who had worked at night for 4.5 or more years, and 1.43 [1.01-2.03] in those who 
      worked less than three nights per week on average. The odds ratio was 1.95
      [1.13-3.35] in women employed in night work for >4 years before their first
      full-term pregnancy, a period where mammary gland cells are incompletely
      differentiated and possibly more susceptible to circadian disruption effects. Our
      results support the hypothesis that night work plays a role in breast cancer,
      particularly in women who started working at night before first full-term
      pregnancy.

TI  - Ownership and usage of mosquito nets after four years of large-scale free
      distribution in Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 192
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a highly malaria endemic country in the
      South-West Pacific with a population of approximately 6.6 million (2009). In
      2004, the country intensified its malaria control activities with support from
      the Global Fund. With the aim of achieving 80% ownership and usage, a
      country-wide campaign distributed two million free long-lasting
      insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). METHODS: In order to evaluate outcomes of the
      campaign against programme targets, a country-wide household survey based on
      stratified multi-stage random sampling was carried out in 17 of the 20 provinces 
      after the campaign in 2008/09. In addition, a before-after assessment was carried
      out in six purposively selected sentinel sites. A structured questionnaire was
      administered to the heads of sampled households to elicit net ownership and usage
      information. RESULTS: After the campaign, 64.6% of households owned a LLIN, 80.1%
      any type of mosquito net. Overall usage by household members amounted to 32.5%
      for LLINs and 44.3% for nets in general. Amongst children under five years, 39.5%
      used a LLIN and 51.8% any type of net, whereas 41.3% of pregnant women used a
      LLIN and 56.1% any net. Accessibility of villages was the key determinant of net 
      ownership, while usage was mainly determined by ownership. Most (99.5%) of the
      household members who did not sleep under a net did not have access to a (unused)
      net in their household. In the sentinel sites, LLIN ownership increased from 9.4%
      to 88.7%, ownership of any net from 52.7% to 94.1%. Usage of LLINs increased from
      5.5% to 55.1%, usage of any net from 37.3% to 66.7%. Among children under five
      years, usage of LLINs and of nets in general increased from 8.2% to 67.0% and
      from 44.6% to 76.1%, respectively (all p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While a single 
      round of free distribution of LLINs significantly increased net ownership, an
      insufficient number of nets coupled with a heterogeneous distribution led to
      overall low usage rates. Programme targets were missed mainly as a result of the 
      distribution mechanism itself and operational constraints in this very
      challenging setting.

TI  - Considerations for imaging the adolescent brain.
PG  - 293-302
LID - 10.1016/j.dcn.2012.02.002 [doi]
AB  - In recent years the number of functional neuroimaging studies on adolescence has 
      exploded. These studies have led to important new insights about the relation
      between functional brain development and behavior. However, special consideration
      is warranted when working with adolescents. In this review, we review variables, 
      including pubertal stage, sleep patterns and pregnancy, which are particularly
      relevant for developmental cognitive neuroscience studies involving adolescents. 
      Consideration of the unique challenges associated with adolescence will help the 
      growing field of developmental neuroimaging standardize procedures and will
      eventually facilitate interpretation across studies.

PG  - 434-8
LID - 10.3109/01443615.2012.658892 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disordered breathing and its symptoms have been associated with a multitude
      of fetal and maternal complications including gestational hypertensive disorders,
      gestational diabetes and possibly pre-term labour and other markers of
      alterations in fetal wellbeing. The disease remains underdiagnosed in the general
      population but likely also in pregnancy, mostly because providers do not
      appropriately screen for the disorder. Sleep disordered breathing may manifest
      differently in women, since women report more fatigue and less snoring than men
      do. This paper discusses typical presentations of sleep disordered breathing but 
      also reports some less obvious presentations to help providers recognise those
      manifestations and screen for the disorder when warranted. Our case series
      describes patients with diagnoses such as chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia,
      pulmonary hypertension, nocturnal asthma and panic attacks, who were diagnosed
      with sleep disordered breathing and offered treatment with CPAP during pregnancy.

PG  - 246-56
LID - 10.1177/0748730412441315 [doi]
AB  - The impact of ovarian hormones on hamster ultradian rhythms (URs) is unknown. We 
      concurrently monitored URs and circadian rhythms (CRs) of home cage locomotor
      activity during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation of Syrian hamsters.
      URs with a mean period of 4-5 h were evident during the dark phase in more than
      90% of females on days 1 and 2 of the estrous cycle but were significantly less
      prevalent on cycle days 3 and 4. The period of the UR did not vary as a function 
      of estrous cycle stage, but at all stages, the UR period was longer in the dark
      than the light phase. The UR acrophase occurred significantly earlier on cycle
      day 4 than on days 1 and 2, and UR robustness and amplitude were reduced on days 
      3 and 4. Robustness, mesor, and amplitude of CRs were greater during cycle days 3
      and 4; timing of the CR acrophase was delayed on day 4 relative to all other
      cycle days. Effects of the estrous cycle on URs were evident only during the dark
      phase. The proportion of hamsters displaying dark phase URs increased
      significantly during early and late gestation and decreased during lactation.
      Pregnancy significantly increased UR complexity, robustness, and amplitude. The
      emergence of URs over gestation was paralleled by decrements in the robustness
      and amplitude of CRs, which also were absent in a significant proportion of dams 
      during lactation but re-emerged at weaning of litters. The changing endocrine
      profile of the estrous cycle, hormonal dynamics of pregnancy and lactation, and
      nursing demands placed on dams are each associated with alterations in the
      expression of ultradian and circadian locomotor rhythms. Diminution of CRs and
      augmentation of URs may afford greater behavioral flexibility during life stages 
      when interactions with mates and offspring are less predictable.

TI  - Thalidomide: chemistry, therapeutic potential and oxidative stress induced
      teratogenicity.
PG  - 1436-55
AB  - Thalidomide and its one analogue, lenalidomide (CC5103 or revlimid) are recently 
      approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized
      by an overproduction of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. The journey of
      thalidomide was started in 1956 when it was marketed as a non-barbiturate
      sedative agent. It was considered as a "wonder drug" that provided safe and sound
      sleep and hence, used to cure morning sickness in pregnant women. Later, in 1961,
      it was withdrawn from the world market due to its serious side effects, i.e.,
      teratogenic activity. However, the recent decade has witnessed a true renaissance
      in interest in its broad biological activity. In particular, thalidomide was
      reevaluated and attracted significant attention due to its selective inhibitory
      activity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which is a clinically
      important activity against serious diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's
      disease, leprosy, AIDS, and various cancers. The comeback of thalidomide to the
      legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval
      for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Recently, the drug has got 
      FDA approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the last few years, number
      of thalidomide analogues have been synthesized and are in clinical development as
      a class of immunomodulatory drugs. Among these, lenalidomide is more potent than 
      thalidomide, and is also non-neurotoxic. It was shown in vitro studies to induce 
      apoptosis or arrest growth even in resistant multiple myeloma cell lines,
      decrease binding of the cells to bone marrow stromal cells, and stimulate host
      natural killer cell immunity. It also inhibits tumour growth and decreases
      angiogenesis. Earlier reviews have described the pharmacological aspects of
      thalidomide and a review has focused only on synthetic aspect of thalidomide.
      However, review focusing on chemistry and metabolism and mechanism of biological 
      activity is still lacking. In this review, we will concisely describe the
      therapeutic aspects, metabolism and synthesis of thalidomide.

TI  - Environmental perturbation of the circadian clock disrupts pregnancy in the
      mouse.
PG  - e37668
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0037668 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The circadian clock has been linked to reproduction at many levels in
      mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have reported increased 
      rates of reproductive abnormalities and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although
      whether the cause is circadian disruption or another factor associated with shift
      work is unknown. Here we test whether environmental disruption of circadian
      rhythms, using repeated shifts of the light:dark (LD) cycle, adversely affects
      reproductive success in mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Young adult female 
      C57BL/6J (B6) mice were paired with B6 males until copulation was verified by
      visual identification of vaginal plug formation. Females were then randomly
      assigned to one of three groups: control, phase-delay or phase-advance. Controls 
      remained on a constant 12-hr light:12-hr dark cycle, whereas phase-delayed and
      phase-advanced mice were subjected to 6-hr delays or advances in the LD cycle
      every 5-6 days, respectively. The number of copulations resulting in term
      pregnancies was determined. Control females had a full-term pregnancy success
      rate of 90% (11/12), which fell to 50% (9/18; p<0.1) in the phase-delay group and
      22% (4/18; p<0.01) in the phase-advance group. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Repeated
      shifting of the LD cycle, which disrupts endogenous circadian timekeeping,
      dramatically reduces pregnancy success in mice. Advances of the LD cycle have a
      greater negative impact on pregnancy outcomes and, in non-pregnant female mice,
      require longer for circadian re-entrainment, suggesting that the magnitude or
      duration of circadian misalignment may be related to the severity of the adverse 
      impact on pregnancy. These results explicitly link disruptions of circadian
      entrainment to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mammals, which may have important
      implications for the reproductive health of female shift workers, women with
      circadian rhythm sleep disorders and/or women with disturbed circadian rhythms
      for other reasons.

AB  - Orexins play a role in many biological functions include sleep, feeding, and
      energy balance. They also regulate circadian rhythms and the way that we feel
      pain. Orexins have been identified in a variety of tissues including the
      cerebrospinal fluid, blood, hypothalamus, spinal cord, sensory ganglion, enteric 
      nervous system, pituitary, adrenal, salivary and lacrimal glands, testis,
      vestibular gland, and skin. Orexins play a role in a variety of biological
      functions including arousal, sleeping, food and fluid intake, pain, memory,
      perception of odor, and sexual activity. Orexins have also been implicated in the
      regulation of glucose metabolism. The expression of orexin is induced by
      hypoglycemia, low food, pregnancy, and hemodialysis. In contrast, factors that
      inhibit the expression of orexins include obstructive sleep apnea, aging,
      depression, obesity, traumatic brain injury, and inflammatory molecules such as
      liposaccharide. In conclusion, orexins are widely distributed and involved in a
      large variety of biological activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accidental dura mater puncture is a potential complication during
      epidural block, and may be associated with multiple factors. Our objective was to
      determine the prevalence and risk factors of accidental dural puncture in a
      university hospital, evaluating the differences in the number of complications
      during different working hours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective observational
      study was conducted on all women who requested regional anaesthesia in the
      Epidural Analgesia Unit between 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2011, and who
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The technique employed to control labour pains 
      was epidural analgesia. RESULTS: A total of 12,480 pregnant women were included. 
      The prevalence of accidental dura mater puncture was 0.4% (50 patients). Of
      these, 28% were due to medical residents. More accidental dura mater punctures
      were observed during September and in the afternoon shift. CONCLUSIONS: The
      prevalence of accidental dura mater puncture is similar to other patient series. 
      In ours, tiredness or lack of sleep did not influence the incidence of
      complications in analgesia for labour pains in a 24 hour care unit. This may be
      due to the distribution of on-call shifts not exceeding more than 6 hours.

TI  - Sleepless nights: the effect of socioeconomic status, physical activity, and
      lifestyle factors on sleep quality in a large cohort of Australian women.
PG  - 237-47
LID - 10.1007/s00737-012-0281-3 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to examine: (1) the association between
      sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and sleep quality in a population-based
      cohort of Australian women and (2) possible influence of reproductive status and 
      mental and physical health factors on these associations. Data on 3,655 women
      (mean age = 46.6 years, range 34.3-67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital
      University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study.
      Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
      For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to
      divide women into three categories: normal (65.2%), moderately poor (26.4%), and 
      very poor sleep quality (8.5%). Other covariates were measured at 21-year
      follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical
      health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality
      and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures
      of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with
      increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking
      moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality.
      Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with
      moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings
      demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion,
      socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking
      these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women.

TI  - Antidepressants may mitigate the effects of prenatal maternal anxiety on infant
      auditory sensory gating.
PG  - 616-24
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.11091365 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring's
      neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function.
      Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring
      attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The 
      authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional 
      processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety
      and antidepressant use. METHOD: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were
      classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal
      antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active
      sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD=38). RESULTS: In the absence of prenatal
      antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses
      had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the
      effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of
      response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on
      the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus. CONCLUSIONS:
      Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant
      sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant
      exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of
      antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for 
      both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors
      involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in pregnancy. The
      cause is multifactorial, including a decreased or transient lower esophageal
      sphincter relaxation, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and gastrointestinal
      motility disturbances. AIMS: Evaluate the incidence of GERD in pregnancy and
      assess predictors and predisposing factors. METHOD: This is a secondary analysis 
      of a survey of postpartum women regarding symptoms of sleep disordered breathing 
      (SDB) and GERD performed at a large tertiary care center. Patients rated
      heartburn frequency during pregnancy as either never, occasionally/sometimes, or 
      frequently/always. Pregnancy outcomes and newborn information was collected.
      Categorical variables were compared by Fisher's exact test and continuous
      variables were compared by Anova or Kruskal-Wallis test. Multinominal logistic
      regression was also performed. RESULTS: Information regarding 1000 mothers and
      1025 newborns was reviewed. The majority of mothers were Caucasian (68.8%) with
      mean age 29 +/- 6.1 years. A total of 56.7% had GERD frequently/always; and 25.5%
      had none. GERD symptoms correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), BMI 
      at delivery, maternal age, smoking and symptoms of SDB. There was no significant 
      correlation between fetal weight and maternal weight gain with GERD symptoms.
      Symptoms were more frequent in white non-Hispanic women than in other racial
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that GERD symptoms correlate with
      pre-pregnancy BMI and BMI at delivery, but not with the amount of weight gain
      during pregnancy. Maternal age, smoking, race, and SDB are also associated with
      GERD. Interestingly, fetal weight/uterine size did not seem predictive of
      developing GERD in pregnancy.

TI  - Patient and provider perceptions of sleep disordered breathing assessment during 
      prenatal care: a survey-based observational study.
PG  - 211-9
LID - 10.1177/1753465812444958 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) remains poor in the
      general population, despite evidence for association with adverse outcomes and
      improvement of certain outcomes with therapy. Data from the past decade have
      suggested an association between snoring and adverse pregnancy outcomes including
      gestational hypertensive disorders. However, it is unclear how often SDB is
      screened for in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether,
      and how, symptoms of SDB are assessed during prenatal care. METHODS: This study
      was designed as a survey-based observational study. Within 48 hours of delivery, 
      English-speaking patients were surveyed regarding prenatal conversations with
      obstetric providers about symptoms of SDB. During a similar time period,
      obstetric providers completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding how often they
      discussed the same symptoms during prenatal visits. RESULTS: A total of 776
      patients and 80 providers performing the majority of deliveries at the same
      hospital answered the survey. Nurse providers asked about sleep quality
      significantly more often than physician providers; however, responses to
      questions about snoring were similar in both groups. Resident physicians were the
      least likely to ask about sleep quality. Less than 3% of providers reported
      asking about snoring, closely matching patient responses. A total of 44% of
      patients surveyed were overweight and 21.7% were obese. Although 32% of patients 
      snored, only 5% were asked about snoring during a prenatal visit. Obese women and
      women with a history of gestational hypertensive disorders were more likely to
      report being asked about snoring. CONCLUSIONS: Based on patient and obstetric
      provider recollections of discussions, the issue of SDB is poorly assessed during
      routine prenatal care, despite an increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity
      in the pregnant population.

TI  - Association of multiple sclerosis with restless legs syndrome and other sleep
      disorders in women.
PG  - 1500-6
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182553c5b [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent
      restless legs syndrome (RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively
      examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4
      years of follow-up. METHODS: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional
      study of 65,544 women (aged 41-58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and
      pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort.
      Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria
      recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had
      restless legs >/= 5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical
      record review. RESULTS: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS
      (15+ times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and
      2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the
      presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of
      having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-3.93),
      severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65-6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness (OR =
      2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who
      had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year
      period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 
      (95% CI 1.53-8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS.
      CONCLUSION: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and
      daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future.

TI  - Sleep disturbances in Korean pregnant and postpartum women.
PG  - 85-90
LID - 10.3109/0167482X.2012.658465 [doi]
AB  - This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant and postpartum women, to 
      estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances. The survey was
      composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women's Health Initiative
      Insomnia Rating Scale, Berlin Questionnaire for sleep disordered breathing, the
      international restless leg syndrome (IRLS) Study Group criteria, and the Johns
      Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview Form (JHTDIF) for RLS. Statistical
      analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0. Six hundred eighty-nine women
      completed sleep surveys. The overall percentage of women with very poor sleep
      quality (a PSQI score greater than 10), clinically significant insomnia (a total 
      score of 9 or more), excessive daytime sleepiness (a total ESS score of 10 or
      more), short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) were 80.7%, 50.5%,
      34.0% and 29.5%, respectively, and all of three parameters became increased as
      pregnancy progressed and after delivery ( p = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001,
      respectively). The overall positive rates in Berlin and RLS questionnaires were
      25.4% and 19.4%. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are prevalent among Korean
      pregnant and postpartum women, and increase significantly as pregnancy progresses
      and after delivery.

TI  - Non drowsy obstructive sleep apnea as a potential cause of resistant
      hypertension: a case report.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1471-2466-12-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and arterial hypertension (AH) are
      common and underrecognized medical disorders. OSA is a potential risk factor for 
      the development of AH and/or may act as a factor complicating AH management. The 
      symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are considered essential for the
      initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which is a
      first line treatment of OSA. The medical literature and practice is controversial
      about the treatment of people with asymptomatic OSA. Thus, OSA patients without
      EDS may be left at increased cardiovascular risk. CASE PRESENTATION: The report
      presents a case of 42 year old Asian woman with symptoms of heart failure and
      angina like chest pain upon admission. She didn't experience symptoms of EDS, and
      the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was seven points. Snoring was reported on direct
      questioning. The patient had prior medical history of three unsuccessful
      pregnancies complicated by gestational AH and preeclampsia with C-section during 
      the last pregnancy. The admission blood pressure (BP) was 200/120 mm Hg. The
      patients treatment regimen consisted of five hypotensive medications including
      diuretic. However, a target BP wasn't achieved in about one and half month. The
      patient was offered to undergo a polysomnography (PSG) study, which she rejected.
      One month after discharge the PSG study was done, and this showed an
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 46 events per hour. CPAP therapy was initiated with
      a pressure of 11 H(2)0 cm. After 2 months of compliant CPAP use, adherence to
      pharmacologic regimen and lifestyle modifications the patients BP decreased to
      134/82 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: OSA and AH are common and often underdiagnosed medical
      disorders independently imposing excessive cardiovascular risk on a diseased
      subject. When two conditions coexist the cardiovascular risk is likely much
      greater. This case highlights a possible clinical phenotype of OSA without EDS
      and its association with resistant AH. Most importantly a good hypotensive
      response to medical treatment in tandem with CPAP therapy was achieved in this
      patient. Thus, it is reasonable to include OSA in the differential list of
      resistant AH, even if EDS is not clinically obvious.

TI  - A rhythmic placenta? Circadian variation, clock genes and placental function.
PG  - 533-9
LID - 10.1016/j.placenta.2012.03.008 [doi]
AB  - Physiological rhythms entrained by the circadian clock are present in virtually
      all organs including those of the reproductive system. In mammals, circadian
      timing is driven by a 'master clock' in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that
      influences peripheral tissue clocks via endocrine, autonomic and behavioral cues.
      The molecular clock machinery comprises a network of 'clock' genes, namely Clock,
      Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2. These clock genes generate endogenous
      oscillations that drive rhythmic expression of downstream genes and thus
      physiological and behavioral processes. Importantly, disturbances in clock gene
      expression are implicated in a range of pathologies including cancer and obesity.
      The recent recognition that clock genes are expressed in the placenta, together
      with observations linking circadian disruption with compromised placental
      function, suggests that circadian variation may be an important component of the 
      normal placental phenotype. In this review we consider this possibility in the
      context of maternal circadian physiology in pregnancy. While there is good
      evidence for rhythmic expression of several genes in the rodent placenta, the
      conventional transcriptional-translational feedback loops of the clock machinery 
      appear less robust and coordinated. Further study is needed to elucidate the
      function of the placental clock genes across gestation and among different
      species, particularly those in which greater circadian development occurs in
      utero. Such studies will likely provide important insights into placental
      physiology and pathology.

TI  - Maternal caffeine consumption and infant nighttime waking: prospective cohort
      study.
PG  - 860-8
LID - 10.1542/peds.2011-1773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in
      pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a
      dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime
      waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal
      caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal
      awakening among infants at 3 months of age. METHODS: All children born in the
      city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers
      were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine
      drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral
      characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained
      from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that
      woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using 
      Poisson regression. RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born 
      in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy
      consumers (>/=300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum.
      Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95%
      confidence interval: 11.5%-16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed
      among breastfed infants from mothers consuming >/=300 mg/day during the whole
      pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17)
      but at a nonsignificant level. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy
      and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the 
      age of 3 months.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study development of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during and after 
      pregnancy, and whether RLS is related to snoring or other pregnancy-related
      symptoms. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Antenatal care clinics in the
      catchment area of Linkoping university hospital, Sweden. POPULATION: Five hundred
      consecutively recruited pregnant women. METHODS: Sleep disturbances, including
      symptoms of RLS and snoring, were assessed with questionnaires in each trimester.
      A complementary questionnaire was sent three years after delivery to women
      experiencing symptoms of RLS during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms of
      RLS in relation to snoring in each trimester. RESULTS: Symptoms of RLS were
      reported by 17.0% of the women in the first trimester, by 27.1% in the second
      trimester and by 29.6% in the third trimester. Snoring in the first trimester was
      correlated to increased prevalence of RLS in all three trimesters (p= 0.003,
      0.017 and 0.044 in the first, second and third trimester, respectively). No
      correlation was found between RLS and anemia, parity or body mass index. Among
      the women who experienced RLS, 31% still had symptoms three years after delivery.
      Fifty-eight per cent of those whose symptoms had disappeared stated that this
      happened within one month after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of RLS progressed
      most between the first and second trimester. Women who snored in the first or
      second trimester of pregnancy had a higher prevalence of RLS in the third
      trimester, which indicates that snoring in early pregnancy might predict RLS
      later. Symptoms of RLS disappear quite soon after delivery, but about one-third
      of women with RLS during pregnancy may still have symptoms three years after
      childbirth.

TI  - Does the circadian system regulate lactation?
PG  - 394-402
LID - 10.1017/S1751731111002187 [doi]
AB  - Environmental variables such as photoperiod, heat, stress, nutrition and other
      external factors have profound effects on quality and quantity of a dairy cow's
      milk. The way in which the environment interacts with genotype to impact milk
      production is unknown; however, evidence from our laboratory suggests that
      circadian clocks play a role. Daily and seasonal endocrine rhythms are
      coordinated in mammals by the master circadian clock in the hypothalamus.
      Peripheral clocks are distributed in every organ and coordinated by signals from 
      the master clock. We and others have shown that there is a circadian clock in the
      mammary gland. Approximately 7% of the genes expressed during lactation had
      circadian patterns including core clock and metabolic genes. Amplitude changes
      occurred in the core mammary clock genes during the transition from pregnancy to 
      lactation and were coordinated with changes in molecular clocks among multiple
      tissues. In vitro studies using a bovine mammary cell line showed that external
      stimulation synchronized mammary clocks, and expression of the core clock gene,
      BMAL1, was induced by lactogens. Female clock/clock mutant mice, which have
      disrupted circadian rhythms, have impaired mammary development and their
      offspring failed to thrive suggesting that the dam's milk production was not
      adequate enough to nourish their young. We envision that, in mammals, during the 
      transition from pregnancy to lactation the master clock is modified by
      environmental and physiological cues that it receives, including photoperiod
      length. In turn, the master clock coordinates changes in endocrine milieu that
      signals peripheral tissues. In dairy cows, it is clear that changes in
      photoperiod during the dry period and/or during lactation influences milk
      production. We believe that the photoperiod effect on milk production is
      mediated, in part by the 'setting' of the master clock with light, which modifies
      peripheral circadian clocks including the mammary core clock and subsequently
      impacts milk yield and may impact milk composition.

PG  - 459-64
LID - 10.1055/s-0032-1304828 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the peripartum outcomes of yoga
      during pregnancy, including the postpartum period and lactation. The PubMed
      database was analyzed from January 1970 to January 2011. We identified five
      prospective observational studies (n = 575) and three randomized clinical trials 
      (RCTs; n = 298), which were analyzed separately. The nonrandomized trials
      indicated a significant reduction in rates of preterm labor (p < 0.0006),
      intrauterine growth retardation (p <0.003), low birth weight (p < 0.01),
      pregnancy discomforts (p = 0.01), and perceived sleep disturbances (p = 0.03) in 
      those who practiced yoga during pregnancy. Results of the RCTs indicated that
      doing yoga during pregnancy can significantly lower pain and discomfort (p <
      0.05) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) and improve quality of life in physical
      domains (p = 0.001). All three RCTs were poorly compliant with the Consolidated
      Standard of Reporting Trials statement. While awaiting an appropriately designed 
      RCT to determine the benefits of yoga during pregnancy, it remains a viable
      exercise option.

AB  - Some infants show a free-running rhythm in their rest-activity. We do not know
      why, nor do we know exactly what the entrainment factors are for the development 
      of the normal 24-h rest-activity rhythm. Actigraphic recordings on 10 primiparae 
      during late pregnancy and these mothers and their infants during the 2nd, 6th,
      and 12th wks after birth were made over 3-5 continuous days to investigate
      maternal and infant entrainment. One infant showed a free-running rest-activity
      circadian rhythm. In late pregnancy, the period in the autocorrelogram of the
      mother with the free-running infant was longer than the significant period of the
      mean autocorrelogram of the mothers with non-free-running infants. The finding of
      this study indicates the free-running rhythm of infant is not reset by maternal
      entrainment factors.

TI  - Circadian rhythms of fetal liver transcription persist in the absence of
      canonical circadian clock gene expression rhythms in vivo.
PG  - e30781
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0030781 [doi]
AB  - The cellular circadian clock and systemic cues drive rhythmicity in the
      transcriptome of adult peripheral tissues. However, the oscillating status of the
      circadian clocks in fetal tissues, and their response to maternal cues, are less 
      clear. Most clock genes do not cycle in fetal livers from mice and rats, although
      tissue level rhythms rapidly emerge when fetal mouse liver explants are cultured 
      in vitro. Thus, in the fetal mouse liver, the circadian clock does not oscillate 
      at the cellular level (but is induced to oscillate in culture). To gain a
      comprehensive overview of the clock status in the fetal liver during late
      gestation, we performed microarray analyses on fetal liver tissues. In the fetal 
      liver we did not observe circadian rhythms of clock gene expression or many other
      transcripts known to be rhythmically expressed in the adult liver. Nevertheless, 
      JTK_CYCLE analysis identified some transcripts in the fetal liver that were
      rhythmically expressed, albeit at low amplitudes. Upon data filtering by
      coefficient of variation, the expression levels for transcripts related to
      pancreatic exocrine enzymes and zymogen secretion were found to undergo
      synchronized daily fluctuations at high amplitudes. These results suggest that
      maternal cues influence the fetal liver, despite the fact that we did not detect 
      circadian rhythms of canonical clock gene expression in the fetal liver. These
      results raise important questions on the role of the circadian clock, or lack
      thereof, during ontogeny.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and
      fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories
      and associated predictors. DESIGN: A prospective, follow-up study. SETTING: A
      teaching medical center in central Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 
      121 low-risk, childbearing women. METHODS: Depressive and fatigue symptoms were
      assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum
      Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time
      2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4).
      Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features,
      health status, and sleep quality. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 31.2 
      years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three
      trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent
      conoccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in 
      the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the
      high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep
      score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial
      logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Overlapping but distinct trajectories
      of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that
      differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important
      for improving care during the early postpartum period.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy: the effect on perinatal outcomes.
PG  - 399-406
LID - 10.1038/jp.2012.14 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper
      airway obstruction, resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia and sleep fragmentation. 
      Pathophysiological sequelae include sympathetic activation, increased oxidative
      stress and a generalized inflammatory response, culminating in endothelial
      dysfunction. These are the proposed mechanisms that mediate the increased risk of
      hypertension and cardiovascular disease among patients with OSA outside of
      pregnancy. It is intriguing to consider the consequences of these events on
      pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing literature on the impact of maternal OSA
      on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes and impaired fetal
      growth. The data, while promising, require confirmation with larger numbers to
      verify the findings. OSA may be an important mediator of the poor perinatal
      outcomes associated with maternal obesity; moreover, one which may be amenable to
      treatment. This review discusses OSA and summarizes the current literature
      linking OSA with adverse perinatal outcomes.

TI  - Fulminant Type 1 diabetes in a pregnant woman as an initial manifestation of the 
      insulin autoimmune syndrome.
PG  - 1335-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-5491.2012.03623.x [doi]
AB  - Fulminant Type 1 diabetes is a subtype of Type 1 diabetes characterized by (1)
      abrupt onset of diabetes, (2) very short duration of hyperglycaemia with mildly
      elevated HbA(1c) (< 69 mmol/mol, 8.5%), (3) rapid progression to diabetic
      ketoacidosis, (4) very low C-peptide level, and (5) often associated with
      elevated serum pancreatic enzymes, and absence of diabetes-related
      autoantibodies. We encountered a case of fulminant Type 1 diabetes that developed
      with an initial manifestation of the insulin autoimmune syndrome and rapidly
      progressed to diabetic ketoacidosis during pregnancy. A 31-year-old Korean woman 
      presented with recurrent sudden onset of sweating and change of consciousness
      during sleep at 19 weeks gestation. During a 72-h fasting test, hypoglycaemia
      (1.72 mmol/l) occurred at 4 h after the start of the test. At that time, there
      was a high insulin level (370.2 muU/ml), a paradoxically low C-peptide level
      (0.01 nmol/l) and a positive insulin autoantibody test. An oral glucose tolerance
      test revealed postprandial hyperglycaemia. She was initially diagnosed as the
      insulin autoimmune syndrome. On the day 5 of admission, she developed diabetic
      ketoacidosis. Her HbA(1c) was 62 mmol/mol (7.8%). The rapid progression of
      diabetic ketoacidosis altered the diagnosis to fulminant Type 1 diabetes. This
      case differed from typical fulminant Type 1 diabetes because it presented with
      hypoglycaemia, and positive insulin and anti-phospholipid antibody tests. Her HLA
      typing was HLA-DQA1*0302, 0501, HLA-DRB1*0301 (DR3), 0901(DR9). Her glucose level
      was subsequently very well controlled with multiple insulin injections and she
      successfully delivered a healthy baby.

TI  - Does electric light stimulate cancer development in children?
PG  - 701-4
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0015 [doi]
AB  - Incidence of cancer in children has increased in recent decades, and known risk
      factors can account for only a small minority of cases. Gestation and early
      childhood are particularly vulnerable periods in human development and an
      important aspect of development is in circadian rhythmicity. Emerging evidence
      implicates the molecular circadian mechanism in a vast array of other physiologic
      functions including metabolism, DNA damage response and cell-cycle regulation.
      Electric light exposure at night can disrupt circadian rhythms and, thereby, many
      other physiologic processes that are under circadian control. On this basis, it
      is proposed that ill-timed electric light exposure to pregnant women, to
      neonates, infants, and small children may increase cancer risk in those children.
      There are practical implications and interventions that accrue from this idea
      should it later be confirmed to be true.

TI  - Lactation Biology Symposium: circadian clocks as mediators of the homeorhetic
      response to lactation.
PG  - 744-54
LID - 10.2527/jas.2011-4590 [doi]
AB  - The transition from pregnancy to lactation is the most stressful period in the
      life of a cow. During this transition, homeorhetic adaptations are coordinated
      across almost every organ and are marked by changes in hormones and metabolism to
      accommodate the increased energetic demands of lactation. Recent data from our
      laboratory showed that changes in circadian clocks occur in multiple tissues
      during the transition period in rats and indicate that the circadian system
      coordinates changes in the physiology of the dam needed to support lactation.
      Circadian rhythms coordinate the timing of physiological processes and
      synchronize these processes with the environment of the animal. Circadian rhythms
      are generated by molecular circadian clocks located in the hypothalamus (the
      master clock) and peripherally in every organ of the body. The master clock
      receives environmental and physiological cues and, in turn, synchronizes internal
      physiology by coordinating endocrine rhythms and metabolism through peripheral
      clocks. The effect of the circadian clock on lactation may be inferred by the
      photoperiod effect on milk production, which is accompanied by coordinated
      changes in the endocrine system and metabolic capacity of the dam to respond to
      changes in day length. We have shown that bovine mammary epithelial cells possess
      a functional clock that can be synchronized by external stimuli, and the
      expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like gene, a
      positive limb of the core clock, is responsive to prolactin in bovine mammary
      explants. Others showed that 7% of genes expressed in breasts of lactating women 
      had circadian patterns of expression, and we report that the diurnal variation of
      composition of bovine milk is associated with changes in expression of mammary
      core clock genes. Together these studies indicate that the circadian system
      coordinates the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain
      lactation, and we believe that the capacity of the dam to produce milk and cope
      with metabolic stresses in early lactation is related to her ability to set
      circadian rhythms during the transition period.

TI  - Prevalence and factors associated with low back pain and pelvic girdle pain
      during pregnancy: a multicenter study conducted in the Spanish National Health
      Service.
PG  - 1516-33
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
      prevalence of low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in
      pregnant Spanish women and to identify the factors associated with a higher risk.
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors
      for LBP and PGP have shown inconsistent results. METHODS: Sixty-one clinicians
      across 5 regions in Spain recruited 1158 women with a median (interquartile
      range) pregnancy of 35 (range, 31-38) weeks. Validated methods were used to
      gather data on the prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP, anthropometric and
      sociodemographic characteristics, history of LBP, obstetrical history, physical
      activity before and during pregnancy, mattress and sleep characteristics,
      disability, anxiety, and depression. Separate multiple logistic regression models
      were developed to identify the variables associated with LBP, LP, and PGP.
      RESULTS: The 4-week prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP was 71.3%, 46.2%, and 64.7%,
      respectively. Main factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting pain 
      for LBP were history of LBP related and unrelated to previous pregnancy and
      postpartum, pain augmenting with time spent in bed, and anxiety. Previous lumbar 
      surgery was associated with a lower risk. The factors associated with a higher
      likelihood of reporting LP were reporting LBP, lower academic level, younger age,
      depression, a lower number of hours of sleep per day, and a higher BMI, and for
      PGP were higher score for depression, a higher body mass index, and a more
      advanced stage of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with a higher risk
      vary between LBP and PGP. History of LBP, related or not to previous pregnancy or
      postpartum, LBP surgery, and anxiety were the factors more strongly associated
      with pregnancy-related LBP. When these variables are taken into account,
      obstetrical data from current or previous pregnancies and other variables do not 
      show a significant association with LBP. Stage of pregnancy and depression were
      associated with PGP.

TI  - Light exposure at night, sleep duration and sex hormone levels in pregnant
      Japanese women.
PG  - 393-8
AB  - The association between light exposure at night and sex hormone levels in utero
      has scarcely reported. We assessed the associations between sleep duration or
      being awake in the late evening hours, which can be as indicator of light
      exposure at night, and the maternal and umbilical blood hormone levels during
      pregnancy and at delivery among Japanese women. The data for 236 women and their 
      newborns who visited a maternal clinic in Gifu, Japan, between May 2000 and
      October 2001 were analyzed. Maternal blood samples were obtained at approximately
      the 10th weeks, 29th weeks of gestation, and at delivery. Umbilical cord artery
      blood was immediately drawn after birth. Information for sleep during pregnancy
      was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. The levels of estradiol and
      testosterone were measured using radioimmunoassay. Maternal serum testosterone
      level in the 10th week was higher among those who were awake at or after 1:00
      a.m. than among those who were asleep at that time (P = 0.032). Maternal
      estradiol level in the 29th week was inversely associated with sleep duration on 
      weekends (P = 0.043). Umbilical testosterone level at delivery inversely
      correlated with sleep duration on weekdays (P = 0.030). These associations were
      somewhat stronger among mothers with female offspring than those with male
      offspring. These results suggested that exposure to light at night might increase
      sex hormone levels during pregnancy.

TI  - Lifecourse approach to racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.3945/an.111.000919 [doi]
AB  - Eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care is a national
      priority, and obesity is a prime target. During the last 30 y in the United
      States, the prevalence of obesity among children has dramatically increased,
      sparing no age group. Obesity in childhood is associated with adverse
      cardio-metabolic outcomes such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II
      diabetes and with other long-term adverse outcomes, including both physical and
      psychosocial consequences. By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in
      obesity prevalence are already present, suggesting that disparities in childhood 
      obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life. Several
      risk factors during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of offspring
      obesity, including excessive maternal gestational weight gain, gestational
      diabetes, smoking during pregnancy, antenatal depression, and biological stress. 
      During infancy and early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, infant feeding
      practices, sleep duration, child's diet, physical activity, and sedentary
      practices are associated with the development of obesity. Studies have found
      substantial racial/ethnic differences in many of these early life risk factors
      for childhood obesity. It is possible that racial/ethnic differences in early
      life risk factors for obesity might contribute to the high prevalence of obesity 
      among minority preschool-age children and beyond. Understanding these differences
      may help inform the design of clinical and public health interventions and
      policies to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and eliminate disparities 
      among racial/ethnic minority children.

PG  - 317-21
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1298845 [doi]
AB  - Arterial blood pressure is subject to a circadian rhythm that results in a fall
      of blood pressure during the night. In patients with diabetes, renal
      insufficiency, left-ventricular hypertrophy, sleep apnea, hypertension of
      pregnancy, and different forms of secondary hypertension a nocturnal fall of
      blood pressure is even abandoned or reverted. Diagnosis is made using 24-h blood 
      pressure measurement, which is however used not frequently enough for a clinical 
      assessment or adjustment of therapy. An adaption of the selection or the time of 
      administration of antihypertensive drugs with respect to the circadian rhythm is 
      beneficial to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular morbidity. This is
      particularly true for patients with an a non- or inverted dipping blood pressure 
      pattern, in which the bedtime dosing may result in a normalization of blood
      pressure and restoration of a normal circadian rhythm. The present manuscript
      reviews the chronopharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension and grant practical
      recommendations for their translation into clinical practice.

TI  - Chronic agomelatine treatment corrects the abnormalities in the circadian rhythm 
      of motor activity and sleep/wake cycle induced by prenatal restraint stress in
      adult rats.
PG  - 323-38
LID - 10.1017/S1461145711001970 [doi]
AB  - Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant acting as an MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor
      agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. Because of its peculiar
      pharmacological profile, this drug caters the potential to correct the
      abnormalities of circadian rhythms associated with mood disorders, including
      abnormalities of the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we examined the effect of chronic
      agomelatine treatment on sleep architecture and circadian rhythms of motor
      activity using the rat model of prenatal restraint stress (PRS) as a putative
      'aetiological' model of depression. PRS was delivered to the mothers during the
      last 10 d of pregnancy. The adult progeny ('PRS rats') showed a reduced duration 
      of slow wave sleep, an increased duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an
      increased number of REM sleep events and an increase in motor activity before the
      beginning of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. In addition, adult PRS rats 
      showed an increased expression of the transcript of the primary response gene,
      c-Fos, in the hippocampus just prior to the beginning of the dark phase. All
      these changes were reversed by a chronic oral treatment with agomelatine (2000
      ppm in the diet). The effect of agomelatine on sleep was largely attenuated by
      treatment with the MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor antagonist, S22153, which caused
      PRS-like sleep disturbances on its own. These data provide the first evidence
      that agomelatine corrects sleep architecture and restores circadian homeostasis
      in a preclinical model of depression and supports the value of agomelatine as a
      novel antidepressant that resynchronizes circadian rhythms under pathological
      conditions.

TI  - Baby Business: a randomised controlled trial of a universal parenting program
      that aims to prevent early infant sleep and cry problems and associated parental 
      depression.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1471-2431-12-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infant crying and sleep problems (e.g. frequent night waking,
      difficulties settling to sleep) each affect up to 30% of infants and often
      co-exist. They are costly to manage and associated with adverse outcomes
      including postnatal depression symptoms, early weaning from breast milk, and
      later child behaviour problems. Preventing such problems could improve these
      adverse outcomes and reduce costs to families and the health care system.
      Anticipatory guidance-i.e. providing parents with information about normal infant
      sleep and cry patterns, ways to encourage self-settling in infants, and ways to
      develop feeding and settling routines before the onset of problems-could prevent 
      such problems. This paper outlines the protocol for our study which aims to test 
      an anticipatory guidance approach. METHODS/DESIGN: 750 families from four Local
      Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia have been randomised to receive the Baby
      Business program (intervention group) or usual care (control group) offered by
      health services. The Baby Business program provides parents with information
      about infant sleep and crying via a DVD and booklet (mailed soon after birth),
      telephone consultation (at infant age 6-8 weeks) and parent group session (at
      infant age 12 weeks). All English speaking parents of healthy newborn infants
      born at > 32 weeks gestation and referred by their maternal and child health
      nurse at their first post partum home visit (day 7-10 postpartum), are eligible. 
      The primary outcome is parent report of infant night time sleep as a problem at
      four months of age and secondary outcomes include parent report of infant daytime
      sleep or crying as a problem, mean duration of infant sleep and crying/24 hours, 
      parental depression symptoms, parent sleep quality and quantity and health
      service use. Data will be collected at two weeks (baseline), four months and six 
      months of age. An economic evaluation using a cost-consequences approach will,
      from a societal perspective, compare costs and health outcomes between the
      intervention and control groups. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this is the first
      randomised controlled trial of a program which aims to prevent both infant
      sleeping and crying problems and associated postnatal depression symptoms. If
      effective, it could offer an important public health prevention approach to these
      common, distressing problems.

      and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue
      using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. 
      A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the
      time-dependent association. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean
      duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 +/- 60.7 min, with 11
      (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep < 6 h. Nineteen women (50%)
      napped > 3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent
      night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P =
      0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported
      naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More
      depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep
      duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent,
      ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during
      pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue 
      and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention
      effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of children who undergo major non-cardiac surgery in the
      neonatal period are needed so that subsequent abnormal neurodevelopment can be
      better understood. OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of our study to describe the
      influence of analgesic and sedative medication on the predominant background
      pattern and the development of sleep-wake cycling (SWC), as measured on
      amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), in newborn infants born >/=
      32 weeks' gestation after major non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: This prospective
      study included infants >/= 32(+0) weeks' gestation admitted to the Neonatal
      Intensive Care Unit at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne who were
      undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. Data on morphine and midazolam given after 
      surgery were recorded and the BrainZ Monitor was applied post-operatively. The
      maximum levels of morphine and midazolam were assessed as predictors of time to
      aEEG outcomes using linear regression. RESULTS: Forty-seven eligible infants were
      included. Emergence of SWC was observed at a mean of 13 h after surgery. The
      maximum dose of morphine or midazolam was not predictive of time to either any or
      developed SWC. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high doses of morphine and midazolam, SWC was
      observed on aEEG in neonates >/= 32 weeks' gestational age soon after major
      non-cardiac surgery. The aEEG background pattern was not affected by the maximum 
      dose of either morphine or midazolam.

TI  - Regulatory cross talks of bone cells, hematopoietic stem cells and the nervous
      system maintain hematopoiesis.
PG  - 170-80
AB  - Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) continuously replenish the blood with immune
      and blood cells with a finite life span, from the bone marrow (BM) reservoir of
      immature and maturing leukocytes. Regulation of HSC migration and development is 
      essential for their function and blood cell production. These diverse and
      multiple states require a tight regulation to efficiently address host defense
      and repair requirements. Numerous recent studies disclose a central role for bone
      related cells in regulation of HSC and hematopoiesis. During ontogeny HSC home
      and seed the fetal BM in the last gestation period when the bone is already
      ossified. Ossification involves bone forming osteoblast- and bone degrading
      osteoclast activity and is considered essential for the formation of BM cavities 
      and hematopoiesis. This synchronized association implies the need for active bone
      cells and bone turnover for HSC regulation. Osteoblastic cells and SDF-
      1+/nestin+ reticular adventitial and CAR cells are crucial for regulation of HSC 
      lodgment, self-renewal and function. Bone resorbing osteoclasts regulate bone
      turnover and progenitor cell detachment and release from the BM. Sympathetic
      signals from the nervous system activated by circadian rhythms or stress
      conditions control both bone turnover and HSC migration and development. In this 
      review we discuss pathways and mechanisms involved in this orchestrated
      regulatory network. A special focus is made on the pivotal role of the
      SDF-1/CXCR4 axis as a determinant of HSC fate. Inflammation, DNA damage, cytokine
      mobilization, microgravity and aging are discussed as specific physiologic and
      pathologic events entailing dysregulation of the tightly balanced
      Bone-Brain-Blood triad.

TI  - Connexin hemichannel blockade improves outcomes in a model of fetal ischemia.
PG  - 121-32
LID - 10.1002/ana.22654 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of
      membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we
      tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may
      contribute to delayed evolution of injury. METHODS: We infused a mimetic peptide 
      that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically
      instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 +/- 1 days gestation (term is 147 days),
      starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible
      bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7
      days later. RESULTS: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in
      recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from -13 +/- 1.9
      dB (n = 7) after ischemia-vehicle to -9 +/- 1.6 dB (n = 7) after ischemia-short
      infusion and -5 +/- 1.6 dB after ischemia-long infusion (n = 6, p < 0.05).
      Peptide infusion was associated with reduced seizure activity after ischemia,
      less frequent status epilepticus (p < 0.05), and earlier return of sleep state
      cycling (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion (but not ischemia-short infusion) was 
      associated with improved survival of oligodendrocytes in intragyral and
      periventricular white matter (p < 0.05) and increased brain weight (p < 0.05).
      Ischemia-long infusion was associated with an intermediate estimate of surviving 
      neurons in the parasagittal cortex of 2.9 +/- 0.8 x 10(6), in comparison to sham 
      control (4.3 +/- 0.9 x 10(6)) or ischemia-vehicle (1.5 +/- 0.4 x 10(6); p < 0.05 
      vs sham control). INTERPRETATION: These data support the hypothesis that opening 
      of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray
      matter dysfunction and injury.

TI  - Maternal consumption of a DHA-containing functional food benefits infant sleep
      patterning: an early neurodevelopmental measure.
PG  - 531-7
LID - 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2011.12.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) is highly important during
      pregnancy for optimal development and functioning of fetal neural tissue. Infant 
      ability to organize sleep and wake states following parturition is highly
      associated with later developmental outcomes. The impact of maternal DHA intake
      on sleep organization has not been previously investigated. AIMS: To examine the 
      effect of a DHA-containing functional food consumed during pregnancy on early
      neurobehavioral development as assessed by infant sleep patterning in the first
      48 postnatal hours. STUDY DESIGN: A longitudinal, randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled design was used. SUBJECTS: Women (18-35 y) with no pregnancy
      complications consumed a cereal-based functional food (92 kcal) containing 300 mg
      DHA an average of 5 d/week or placebo bars (n=27 DHA, n=21 Placebo). The
      intervention began at 24 weeks gestation and continued until delivery (38-40
      weeks). OUTCOME MEASURES: Infant sleep/wake states were measured on postnatal
      days 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) using a pressure sensitive mattress recording respiration 
      and body movements. RESULTS: Using ANCOVA and controlling for ethnic variation,
      there were significant group differences in arousals in quiet sleep on D1
      (P=0.006) and D2 (P=0.011) with fewer arousals in the DHA intervention group
      compared to the placebo group. Similarly, arousals in active sleep on D1 were
      significantly lower in the DHA-intervention group (P=0.012) compared to the
      placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that increased prenatal supply of dietary
      DHA has a beneficial impact on infant sleep organization.

TI  - Fetal sleep organization: a biological precursor of self-regulation in childhood 
      and adolescence?
PG  - 584-90
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Fetal sleep states emerge during the third trimester of pregnancy and involve
      multiple interconnected neuronal networks. We examined whether fetal sleep
      characteristics predict child and adolescent self-regulation in a non-clinical
      sample (study group, n=25; reference group, n=48). Combined recordings of three
      sleep variables (fetal heart rate, body movements and rapid eye movements) were
      made for 2 h at 36-38 weeks' gestation. Fetuses showing synchronous change of
      sleep variables (i.e. within 3 min) at transition from quiet into active sleep
      reached a higher level of effortful control, both at 8-9 and 14-15 years, than
      fetuses not making synchronous transitions and compared with the reference group.
      Results are discussed from a Developmental Origins of Behavior, Health and
      Disease (DOBHaD) point of view. It is concluded that studying sleep ontogeny
      offers the possibility to gain insight into brain maturational processes and/or
      environmental adaptive processes that may have long term behavioral developmental
      consequences.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the different features of body
      movements for females before and after parturition. Body movement signal was
      measured by a piezoelectric sensor board which was deployed on the abdominal
      position beneath a mattress during sleep to monitor pressure changes around
      abdominal area. Body movement epochs were detected by an innovative algorithm
      based on Hilbert transform. Data were collected from two healthy pregnant females
      during sleep for 7 weeks before parturition and 6 weeks after parturition. The
      pressure signal was used to determine the duration and time interval of maternal 
      movements. Characteristics of the detected body movements before and after
      parturition were investigated through their proportion. The results showed that
      before and after parturition, the body movement which features as 0~1 min in
      interval and 0~6 sec in duration has significant difference statistically. It is 
      considered that these differences are highly correlated with the prenatal
      activities.

      disease.
PG  - 23-34
LID - 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.012 [doi]
AB  - Over the past two decades, research has identified extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor
      populations that enable neurons to sense the low ambient GABA concentrations
      present in the extracellular space in order to generate a form of tonic
      inhibition not previously considered in studies of neuronal excitability. The
      importance of this tonic inhibition in regulating states of consciousness is
      highlighted by the fact that extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are
      believed to be key targets for anesthetics, sleep-promoting drugs, neurosteroids,
      and alcohol. The neurosteroid sensitivity of these extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs may
      explain their importance in stress-, ovarian cycle-, and pregnancy-related mood
      disorders. Moreover, disruptions in network dynamics associated with
      schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease may well involve alterations in 
      the tonic GABA(A)R-mediated conductance. Extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs may therefore
      present a therapeutic target for treatment of these diseases, with the potential 
      to enhance cognition and aid poststroke functional recovery.

PG  - 2256-66
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05918.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in
      relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep
      disturbance in women of Mexican descent. BACKGROUND: Little is known about
      acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors
      such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United
      States. DESIGN: This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey
      data. METHODS: Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the
      conceptual framework of impaired sleep to guide our secondary analysis of
      self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of
      312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21-40 years) located in an
      urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to 
      depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The general sleep
      disturbance scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. 
      Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. RESULTS: Early
      socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful
      acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this
      sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher
      acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically
      significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance.
      CONCLUSION: When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems,
      clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low
      income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and
      refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a
      sleep medication.

TI  - From fresh heterologous oocyte donation to autologous oocyte banking.
PG  - 271-82
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Today, oocyte donation has become well established, giving rise to 
      thousands of children born worldwide annually. The introduction of oocyte
      cryopreservation through vitrification allows the introduction of egg banking,
      improving the efficiency and comfort of oocyte donation. Moreover, the
      vitrification technique can now enable autologous donation of oocytes to prevent 
      future infertility. METHODS: We evaluated fresh heterologous oocyte donation in
      terms of obstetrical and perinatal outcome as well as of the reproductive outcome
      of past donors. We then evaluated the efficiency of a closed vitrification device
      and its clinical applications within ART. Thirdly, we evaluated the opinion of
      women with regard to preventive egg freezing and the efficiency of a human oocyte
      in relation to age. RESULTS: Oocyte donation is associated with an increased risk
      of first trimester bleeding and pregnancy induced hypertension. Donating oocytes 
      does not seem to increase the likelihood for a later need of fertility treatment.
      The chance of an oocyte to result in live birth (utilization rate) in women <37
      years old remains constant with a mean of 4.47%. A significant proportion of
      young women would consider safeguarding their reproductive potential through egg 
      freezing or are at least open to the idea. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The
      introduction of efficient oocyte cryopreservation has revolutionized oocyte
      donation through the establishment of eggbank donation. The technique also
      enables women to perform autologous donation after preventive oocyte storage in
      order to circumvent their biological clock.

TI  - An Investigation into the Use of Stimulant Therapy during Pregnancy.
PG  - 308952
LID - 10.1155/2012/308952 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. A lack of documentation of stimulant use during pregnancy means
      that doctors have difficulty advising narcoleptic and hypersomnolent patients.
      Objectives. To investigate the use of stimulant therapy in narcoleptic and
      hypersomnolent patients during pregnancy. Method. A search of clinic letters at a
      tertiary sleep clinic identified women who became pregnant whilst receiving
      stimulant therapy between 01/09/1999 and 18/11/2010. Fifteen patients were
      included in a telephone survey. Results. There were 20 pregnancies. The reported 
      advice received with regards to stimulant use was variable. In 7 pregnancies,
      medication was stopped preconceptually: 1 had a cleft palate and an extra digit 6
      had good foetal outcomes. In 8 pregnancies, medication was stopped
      postconceptually: 1 had autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 7
      had good foetal outcomes. In 5 pregnancies, medication was continued throughout
      pregnancy: 2 ended in miscarriage; 1 was ectopic; 2 had good foetal outcomes. The
      most common symptom experienced was debilitating hypersomnolence. Conclusion.
      There are no standardised guidelines for use of stimulants during pregnancy.
      Women have significant symptoms during pregnancy for which there is an unmet
      clinical need. More research is needed into whether medication can be safely
      continued during pregnancy, and if not, when it should be discontinued. Better
      standardized advice should be made available.

TI  - Ownership and utilization of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets in Afar,
      northeast Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Afar
      Region. Distribution of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (LLINs) has
      been one of the major interventions to combat malaria. However, ownership and
      utilization of these nets are not well known. METHODS: A community based
      cross-sectional study was conducted using interviewer-administered questionnaires
      to study LLIN coverage. After systematic random sampling of the study population,
      data on utilization of LLINs and factors influencing this utilization were
      collected. Analysis of these data was done using SPSS software. RESULTS:
      Household possession of at least one LLIN in the surveyed households was found in
      648(86.1%) households. Ownership of at least two nets was found among 419(55.6%) 
      surveyed households. The proportion of children under 5 years of age who slept
      under treated nets during the night preceding the survey was 728(82.0%) and 676
      (76.1%) in the surveyed households for reported and observed respectively.
      Likewise, the proportion of pregnant women who slept under treated nets was 166
      (79.1%) and 147(70.0%) for reported and observed respectively. Among the
      potential determinants explored regarding utilization of LLINs, age, occupation, 
      and radio possession were found to be significantly associated with LLIN
      utilization. Households that did not possess radio were 0.38 times (95%CI=
      0.25-0.59) less likely to let their children under five and pregnant women sleep 
      under LLIN. CONCLUSION: The LLINs coverage and utilization among the pastoralist 
      community are promising. Strengthening of the primary health care unit and timely
      replacement of LLINs are critical for improved outcomes.

TI  - Relationship between body mass index of offspring and maternal smoking during
      pregnancy.
PG  - 554-8
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2011.255 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy 
      and the body composition of offspring. SUBJECTS: Grade 4 elementary school
      children (n=1366; boys/girls, 724/642; 9-10 years old) were enrolled in this
      study. All parents answered a lifestyle questionnaire, and children underwent
      passive smoking tests. Urinary cotinine measurement and lifestyle screening test 
      parameters (that is, body weight, body length, body mass index (BMI), obesity
      index (OI), blood tests for liver function and lipid profile and questions
      regarding maternal smoking and lifestyle) were evaluated in terms of their
      relationship with maternal smoking. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine 
      (8-OHdG) concentration was measured in 80 randomly selected children to assess
      its relationship with oxidative stress. RESULTS: Both BMI and OI were
      significantly higher in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy than in
      those whose mothers never smoked (BMI: 17.2+/-2.7 vs 16.9+/-2.5 kg m(-2),
      P=0.016; OI: 2.7+/-14.3% vs 0.4+/-14.0%, P=0.003). The degree of elevation was
      positively correlated with the duration of maternal smoking. The increases in BMI
      and OI resulted from increased body weight and reduced height. The confounding
      factors-'breakfast with family', 'watching television at dinner', 'eating and
      drinking before sleep', 'watching television for >2 h', 'sleep duration <8 h' and
      'playing sports'-were statistically significant. BMI and OI were significantly
      high in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy in these six confounders. 
      On the other hand, urinary 8-OHdG concentration was negatively correlated with
      BMI in children who had >1.3 ng ml(-1) urinary cotinine, suggesting that it may
      be related to basal metabolism due to oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Maternal
      smoking is a risk factor for higher BMI and OI in 9- to 10-year-old children
      whose mothers smoke during pregnancy and may be independent of other confounding 
      factors.

TI  - Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study: a randomised controlled trial
      of sleep, food and activity interventions for preventing overweight from birth.
PG  - 942
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-11-942 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid weight gain during the first three years of life predicts child
      and adult obesity, and also later cardiovascular and other morbidities.
      Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked
      to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult,
      the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate 
      two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that 
      could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care.
      METHODS/DESIGN: This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with
      800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of
      Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual
      care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded "Well Child"
      care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and
      support in addition to "Well Child" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding
      group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life; the 
      Sleep group which receives at least 3 extra parent contacts over the first 6
      months of life with a focus on prevention of sleep problems and then active
      intervention if there is a sleep problem from 6 months to 2 years; or the
      Combination group which receives all extra contacts. The main outcome measures
      are conditional weight velocity (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months) and body mass index
      z-score at 24 months, with secondary outcomes including sleep and physical
      activity (parent report, accelerometry), duration of breastfeeding, timing of
      introduction of solids, diet quality, and measures of family function and
      wellbeing (parental depression, child mindedness, discipline practices, family
      quality of life and health care use). This study will contribute to a prospective
      meta-analysis of early life obesity prevention studies in Australasia.
      DISCUSSION: Infancy is likely to be the most effective time to establish patterns
      of behaviour around food, activity and sleep that promote healthy child and adult
      weight. The POI.nz study will determine the extent to which sleep, food and
      activity interventions in infancy prevent the development of overweight. TRIAL

TI  - Strategies and methods to study sex differences in cardiovascular structure and
      function: a guide for basic scientists.

LID - 10.1186/2042-6410-2-14 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease remains the primary cause of death worldwide. 
      In the US, deaths due to cardiovascular disease for women exceed those of men.
      While cultural and psychosocial factors such as education, economic status,
      marital status and access to healthcare contribute to sex differences in adverse 
      outcomes, physiological and molecular bases of differences between women and men 
      that contribute to development of cardiovascular disease and response to therapy 
      remain underexplored. METHODS: This article describes concepts, methods and
      procedures to assist in the design of animal and tissue/cell based studies of sex
      differences in cardiovascular structure, function and models of disease. RESULTS:
      To address knowledge gaps, study designs must incorporate appropriate
      experimental material including species/strain characteristics, sex and hormonal 
      status. Determining whether a sex difference exists in a trait must take into
      account the reproductive status and history of the animal including those used
      for tissue (cell) harvest, such as the presence of gonadal steroids at the time
      of testing, during development or number of pregnancies. When selecting the type 
      of experimental animal, additional consideration should be given to diet
      requirements (soy or plant based influencing consumption of phytoestrogen),
      lifespan, frequency of estrous cycle in females, and ability to investigate
      developmental or environmental components of disease modulation. Stress imposed
      by disruption of sleep/wake cycles, patterns of social interaction (or degree of 
      social isolation), or handling may influence adrenal hormones that interact with 
      pathways activated by the sex steroid hormones. Care must be given to selection
      of hormonal treatment and route of administration. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for
      sex in the design and interpretation of studies including pharmacological effects
      of drugs is essential to increase the foundation of basic knowledge upon which to
      build translational approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat cardiovascular
      diseases in humans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the background characteristics of women who gave birth to 
      their first child at an advanced and very advanced maternal age, including their 
      sociodemographic background, social relationships, health behavior, physical and 
      mental health, and reproductive history. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the
      Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) conducted by the Norwegian
      Institute of Public Health. SETTING: Norway. Sample. 41 236 Norwegian-speaking
      nulliparous women. METHODS: Data were collected by the first questionnaire
      distributed in week 17 of pregnancy during the recruitment period 1999-2008. The 
      distribution of descriptive variables in relation to age was investigated, by
      means of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Advanced (33-37 years) and very advanced (>/=38 years) maternal age.
      RESULTS: Women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age
      differed from the younger women with regard to a wide range of background
      characteristics, and this difference was most pronounced for the very advanced
      group. Problems related to physical aging were more common (infertility, physical
      health problems, sleep problems, depression and fatigue). Of the sociodemographic
      factors; high annual income and low level of education were most strongly
      correlated with high maternal age, followed by single status, unemployment,
      unsatisfactory relationship with partner and unplanned pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Besides having more age-related reproductive and physical health problems, women 
      who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age constituted a
      heterogeneous group characterized by either socioeconomic prosperity or
      vulnerability.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy and are currently regarded as
      one of the most important factors determining pregnancy outcome. Detailed
      research of sleep features during pregnancy is obviously essential. In the
      present review recent data concerning changes in sleep structure and regulation
      in pregnant women and rats - main subjects of experimental sleep research, are
      given, including surmised mechanisms underlying such changes. The importance of
      women's sleep integrity preservation during pregnancy for the viability and
      normal development of the fetus is emphasized and possible ways of pathological
      influence of sleep disorders during this period are discussed.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea in infants.
PG  - 805-16
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201108-1455CI [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has a distinctive pathophysiology, natural
      history, and treatment compared with that of older children and adults. Infants
      have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction 
      and gas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased
      chest wall compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control
      instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia,
      hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may
      also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors
      predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway
      secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep
      apnea in infants has been associated with failure to thrive, behavioral deficits,
      and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography
      requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and
      postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of
      the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive 
      apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the
      underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia,
      mandibular distraction for micrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy,
      choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.

AB  - AIM: To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time
      housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the
      lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of
      working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the
      continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women. METHODS: In a
      cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who
      visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up
      during July and August 2004. RESULTS: The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were
      analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower
      mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women.
      In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep
      duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and
      the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were
      categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense
      of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often
      reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company,
      compared to those in the first and second trimesters. CONCLUSION: The lifestyle
      factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In
      particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The
      pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited
      from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during
      pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible system is needed for
      working women that adapts to the physical changes that occur during pregnancy.

PG  - 397-403

AB  - The timing and continuity of sleep in healthy individuals is regulated by the
      synchronous function of the sleep homeostasis and the endogenous circadian
      rhythms. Multiple factors affect these two processes and the way they interact.
      Sleep disorders may manifest differently in men and women and these differences
      are particularly notable during pregnancy, lactation, and menopause. Insomnia may
      occur relatively commonly during pregnancy and in the postpartum, and may be the 
      result of either a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),
      movement disorders such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), or sometimes depression,
      especially in the postpartum period. Obstructive sleep apnea may contribute to a 
      higher risk of hypertension during pregnancy and doubles the risk for
      preeclampsia and preterm birth. Snoring, a frequent symptom of OSA, increases in 
      frequency during pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome is more common in pregnant
      women, is more frequent in the third trimester of pregnancy, and tends to improve
      dramatically after delivery. Factors associated with increased RLS in pregnancy
      may be related to iron and folate metabolism. Risk for OSA increases after
      menopause and presentation with insomnia can delay the diagnosis of OSA. Various 
      treatment options for sleep disorders in women are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of maternal changes during pregnancy in diet,
      exercise, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight parameters at birth and 6 
      months. In overweight/obese (OW/OB; n = 132) mothers, greater % kcal from sweets 
      early in pregnancy was the strongest, independent predictor of higher weight for 
      age (WFA) (beta = 0.19; P = 0.004), higher odds of macrosomia (OR = 1.1
      (1.0-1.2); P = 0.004) and WFA >90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.1-1.3); P = 
      0.002) and higher WFA at 6 months (beta = 0.30; P = 0.002). In normal weight (n =
      153) mothers, higher intake of soft drinks was the strongest predictor of higher 
      offspring WFA at birth (beta = 0.16; P = 0.04) but not at 6 months. Prenatal
      physical activity, depressive symptoms, and sleep-related variables did not
      significantly predict offspring weight outcomes. Mothers' eating behaviors during
      pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in OW/OB mothers, may have a lasting
      effect on child weight.

TI  - The factors contributing to the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - 127-31
AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant
      under one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case
      investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the
      death scene and review of the clinical history. SIDS is one of the leading causes
      of infant mortality and occurs from the first month, until the first year of life
      for newborns and infants.The aim of this review was to identify and examine risk 
      factors responsible for causing the sudden infant death and to propose certain
      measures in order to protect newborns and infants from sudden death. The
      potential factors that contribute to the occurrence of SIDS include inadequate
      prenatal care, low birth weight (<2499gr), premature infants, intrauterine growth
      delay, short interval between pregnancies and maternal substance use (tobacco,
      alcohol, opiates). Moreover, factors related to infant's sleep environment such
      as the prone or side sleeping position and thick coverlet increase the risk of
      sudden death in infants. Also, the combination of risk factors such as that of
      prone sleeping position and soft bed mattress are linked to a 20-fold increased
      risk of death. Finally, polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), 
      viral respiratory infections, long Q-T (responsible for the presence of fatal
      arrhythmia) are related to the SIDS.Literature review indicates that each
      individual risk factor contributes to the appearance of SIDS and the
      establishment of certain protective measures for parents and health professionals
      has reduced its prevalence. But the precise identification of the SIDS causes and
      how these contribute to the occurrence of sudden death in neonates and infants,
      remains a challenge for health professionals.

PG  - 335-9
LID - 10.1053/j.semperi.2011.05.018 [doi]
AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a group of disorders characterized by 
      abnormal respiratory patterns or abnormal gas exchange during sleep. The most
      common type of SDB, especially among young obese women, is obstructive sleep
      apnea. SDB has clearly been linked to poor sleep and impaired daytime function,
      but there are also data linking SDB to other health outcomes, principally
      cardiovascular and metabolic disease. SDB symptoms are common in pregnancy, and
      pregnancy itself has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of SDB
      symptoms. Although a link between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to
      be biologically plausible, data exploring this relationship are only now
      emerging, and large prospective studies in which the authors use objective
      measures of sleep are lacking. Until we know more about the epidemiology and the 
      impact of SDB in pregnancy, screening efforts for SDB in pregnancy should be
      focused on identifying very symptomatic patients because treatment of these
      individuals often leads to improved sleep quality and daytime functioning.

LID - 10.1016/j.clp.2011.08.009 [doi]
AB  - Auditory perception and learning take place during the third trimester of
      gestation. Fetuses and newborns who lack typical auditory experience can go on to
      develop typical socioemotional attachment and language, given a supportive
      environment. For hospitalized preterm infants in developmentally sensitive
      neonatal intensive care units, detrimental effects of deviant early auditory
      experience may be remediated by later experience, but much is unknown about the
      causes of language deficits of prematurity. Prenatal auditory stimulation
      programs that incorporate audio speakers against the maternal belly should be
      discouraged because of possible overstimulation effects on the developing
      auditory system and sleep/wake state organization.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing: a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes?
PG  - 277-82
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1295658 [doi]
AB  - In nonpregnant populations, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated 
      with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Few studies have examined the
      relationship between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). The objective of
      this study was to examine the association between SDB and APO. Women who had a
      delivery as well as an in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) were identified.
      Demographics, PSG results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the
      medical record. Absence of SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of
      <5, mild SDB as an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and moderate to severe SDB as an AHI of
      >/=15. The primary outcome was a composite measure of APO: pregnancy-related
      hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth </=34 weeks. We identified
      143 women who had undergone a PSG and a delivery. Increasing severity of SDB was 
      associated with an increasing risk of the composite APO: AHI <5, 18.1%; AHI 5 to 
      14.9, 23.5%; AHI >/=15, 38.5% (p = 0.038). Obese women (body mass index >/=30)
      with moderate to severe SDB had the highest rate of APO, 41.7%. SDB, especially
      moderate to severe disease, may be associated with APO. However, it is unclear if
      SDB is a risk factor for APO independent of obesity.

AB  - The vast majority of females affected by hemochromatosis are asymptomatic during 
      childbearing years. We were able to provide effective obstetric anesthesia care
      to a 35-year-old woman with severe hemochromatosis. She had systolic heart
      failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, severe pulmonary
      hypertension, mitral insufficiency, a history of ventricular tachycardia,
      cirrhosis, obstructive sleep apnea, gestational diabetes, and severe scoliosis. A
      multidisciplinary approach was used to stabilize her heart failure and prepare
      her for childbirth. An arterial line and epidural analgesic were placed before
      induction of labor. Vaginal delivery was accomplished with passive decent of the 
      fetus and forceps assistance. We discuss hemochromatosis and its implications for
      the parturient.

TI  - When gender matters: restless legs syndrome. Report of the "RLS and woman"
      workshop endorsed by the European RLS Study Group.

AB  - Sleep is an essential human behavior that shows prominent gender differences.
      Disturbed sleep, in particular, is much more prevalent in females than males.
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) as one cause of disturbed sleep was observed to be
      somewhat more common among women than men in Ekbom's 1945 seminal series of
      clinical cases with the disease. He, however, reported this gender difference
      mainly for those with more severe symptoms. Since then numerous studies have
      reported that women are affected by RLS about twice as often as males for mild as
      well as moderate to severe RLS. The present review focuses on RLS in females from
      the perspectives of both epidemiology and pathophysiology. RLS will generally
      become worse or might appear for the first time during pregnancy. Parity
      increases the risk of RLS later in life suggesting that pregnancy is a specific
      behavioral risk factor for developing RLS. Some evidence suggests that
      dysfunction in iron metabolism and high estrogen levels might contribute to RLS
      during pregnancy. But, menopause does not lower the incidence of RLS nor does
      hormone replacement therapy lead to an increase, suggesting a quite complex
      uncertain role of hormones in the pathophysiology of RLS. Therefore, further,
      preferably longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the factors causing RLS in 
      women. These studies should include genetic, clinical and polysomnographic
      variables, as well as hormonal measures and variables assessing iron metabolism.

TI  - Association between sleep duration and haemoglobin A1c in young adults.
PG  - 957-61
LID - 10.1136/jech-2011-200217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate
      sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration
      in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than 
      adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose
      metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations
      between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin
      (HbA(1c)) levels. METHODS: An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in
      Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at
      ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep
      duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA(1c) levels 
      were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were
      excluded from the analyses. RESULTS: Childhood sleep duration did not predict
      adult HbA(1c). However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with
      higher levels of HbA(1c) (p=0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes
      (p=0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA(1c) was
      independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and
      symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep duration is
      associated with higher levels of HbA(1c) and an increased risk of prediabetes in 
      young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control 
      in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

TI  - Factors associated with sleep quality in pregnant women: a prospective
      observational study.
PG  - 405-12
LID - 10.1097/NNR.0b013e3182346249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: : Sleep disturbance is a significant health issue in pregnant women. 
      Although previous studies contribute to an understanding of the multifactorial
      nature of pregnancy-related sleep disturbance, objective measures of sleep were
      not included, and so data may be subject to recall and potential participant
      self-report bias. OBJECTIVE: : The aim of this study was to identify
      sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors associated with poor
      sleep quality in women during their third trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: : This
      prospective study included 30 nulliparous women who wore a wrist actigraph to
      objectively monitor sleep for 7 consecutive days and completed the Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: : Fifteen women (50%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index global score of >5, indicating poor sleep quality. Mean actigraphic
      sleep efficiency was only 80.05% +/- 6.27%. There were significant differences (p
      < .01) in sleep offset time and total nocturnal sleep time between weekdays and
      weekends. Later sleep onset time was associated with poorer sleep, including
      longer sleep latency, and reduced total nocturnal sleep time and sleep
      efficiency. DISCUSSION: : Nulliparous women experience both objective and
      subjective sleep disturbances, and their sleep patterns differ between weekdays
      and weekends during their third trimester of pregnancy. Results suggest that
      maternal sleep pattern may be improved by maintaining a regular and earlier
      bedtime so women have more opportunity to obtain sufficient nocturnal sleep and
      improved sleep quality.

TI  - Poor sleep quality is associated with preterm birth.
PG  - 1493-8
LID - 10.5665/sleep.1384 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health priority and the
      most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Several risk factors have been identified,
      but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor
      sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated 
      whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for 
      PTB. DESIGN: Observational. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Participants included 166
      pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 +/- 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires,
      including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 
      24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to
      evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep
      quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early
      pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest
      effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07).
      With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25%
      in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality,
      in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of
      delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed
      sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute
      to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with
      other established risk factors, such as stress.

PG  - 161-4
LID - 10.1007/s13577-011-0032-1 [doi]
AB  - Circadian clock controls several physiological processes such as cell
      proliferation. Extravillous trophoblast proliferation is a tightly regulated
      function playing a fundamental role in maternal vessel remodeling. We recently
      demonstrated that clock genes Per2 and Dec1 as well as the clock-controlled genes
      Dbp and Vegf are rhythmically expressed in human extravillous trophoblast-derived
      HTR-8/SVneo cells. Analyzing the time course of HTR-8/SVneo cell proliferation, a
      circadian variation in cell number was found. Moreover, we showed a rhythmic
      expression of mRNAs for Wee1 and stathmin, two genes involved in cell cycle
      progression. We suggest that circadian clockwork may orchestrate the
      functionality of the several factors involved in the control of human trophoblast
      functions that are fundamental for a successfully pregnancy outcome.

PG  - 1534-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03941.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum
      quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of
      life. BACKGROUND: Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical,
      psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of
      increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery
      mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study 
      design. METHODS: Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after
      childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A
      structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic
      characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of
      maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was
      adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical
      complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal
      communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction.
      RESULTS: The overall caeserean section rate was 70.0% (962/1375), and most of
      them (59.7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total 
      score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with
      normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit
      related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male
      gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery
      mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural
      determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life.
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Null findings in impact of delivery mode on
      postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal
      decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal 
      home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving
      postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective
      prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.

TI  - Is fetal pain a real evidence?
PG  - 1203-8
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2011.632040 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Due to the progress in fetal surgery, it is important to acquire data
      about fetal pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a Medline research from
      1995, matching the following key words: "pain" and "fetus", with the following:
      "subplate", "thalamocortical", "myelination", "analgesia", "anesthesia", "brain",
      "behavioral states", "substance p". We focused on: (a) fetal development of
      nociceptive pathways; (b) fetal electrophysiological, endocrinological and
      behavioral reactions to stimuli and pain. RESULTS: We retrieved 217 papers of
      which 157 were highly informative; some reported similar data or were only
      case-reports, and were not quoted. Most endocrinological, behavioral and
      electrophysiological studies of fetal pain are performed in the third trimester, 
      and they seem to agree that the fetus in the 3rd trimester can experience pain.
      But the presence of fetal pain in the 2nd trimester is less evident. In favor of 
      a 2nd trimester perception of pain is the early development of spino-thalamic
      pathways (approximately from the 20th week), and the connections of the thalamus 
      with the subplate (approximately from the 23rd week). Against this possibility,
      some authors report the immaturity of the cortex with the consequent lack of
      awareness, and the almost continuous state of sleep of the fetus. CONCLUSIONS:
      Most studies disclose the possibility of fetal pain in the third trimester of
      gestation. This evidence becomes weaker before this date, though we cannot
      exclude its increasing presence since the beginning of the second half of the
      gestation.

TI  - [Health consequences of shift work].
PG  - 383-7
AB  - In humans many biochemical, physiological and behavioral processes occur in a
      rhythmic manner. Accumulating experimental and epidemiological evidence indicate 
      that disturbances in biological rhythms could lead to unfavorable alterations in 
      body function, thus exerting negative health impact. In industrialized countries,
      it is estimated that between 15 and 30% of the working population is involved in 
      some kind of permanent night work and rotating shift work. Today, shift work is
      regarded as a significant occupational stressor which has marked negative effects
      on both health and well-being. This review surveys data on association between
      shift work and health problems, including sleep disorders, cardiovascular
      disease, peptic ulcer, metabolic syndrome, breast cancer and undesirable
      pregnancy outcome.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
PG  - 136.e1-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2011.09.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low
      birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), cesarean
      section (CS), low Apgar score (at 5 minutes after delivery), and preeclampsia in 
      pregnant women with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). STUDY DESIGN: Our 
      subjects included 791 women with OSA and 3955 randomly selected women without
      OSA. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to examine the risks
      of adverse pregnancy outcomes between women with and without OSA. RESULTS:
      Compared with women without OSA, adjusted odds ratios for LBW, preterm birth, SGA
      infants, CS, and preeclampsia in women with OSA were 1.76 (95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.28-2.40), 2.31 (95% CI, 1.77-3.01), 1.34 (95% CI, 1.09-1.66),
      1.74 (95% CI, 1.48-2.04), and 1.60 (95% CI, 2.16-11.26), respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with OSA are at increased risk for having LBW,
      preterm, and SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia, compared with pregnant women
      without OSA.

TI  - Prolonged-release melatonin versus placebo for benzodiazepine discontinuation in 
      patients with schizophrenia: a randomized clinical trial - the SMART trial
      protocol.
PG  - 160
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-11-160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of schizophrenia frequently includes prolonged
      benzodiazepine administration despite a lack of evidence of its use. It is often 
      difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines because of the development of
      dependence. We aim to assess if melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of
      prolonged benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia.
      Furthermore, we aim to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose
      reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep,
      psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life.
      METHODS/DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel superiority trial. We
      plan to include 80 consenting outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder, 18-55 years of age, treated with antipsychotic drug(s) 
      and at least one benzodiazepine derivative for the last three months before
      inclusion. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: currently under treatment for alcohol or drug
      abuse, aggressive or violent behavior, known mental retardation, pervasive
      developmental disorder, dementia, epilepsy, terminal illness, severe co
      morbidity, inability to understand Danish, allergy to melatonin, lactose, starch,
      gelatin, or talc, hepatic impairment, pregnancy or nursing, or lack of informed
      consent. After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin(R)) 2 mg
      daily or matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their
      benzodiazepine dose. The primary outcome measure is benzodiazepine dose at 6
      months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include sleep, psychophysiological, 
      and neurocognitive measures. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months
      follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep,
      laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality
      of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, adverse events, 
      social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months
      follow-up. DISCUSSION: The results from this trial will examine whether melatonin
      has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in
      schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult to treat and
      therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life
      expectancy of patients compared to the background population. The results will
      also provide new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine
      treatment with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality
      of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group
      of patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials NCT01431092.

TI  - Disturbed sleep, a novel risk factor for preterm birth?
PG  - 54-60
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2010.2670 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple
      factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep
      disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by
      other psychosocial risk factors. METHODS: Pregnant women (n=217) for whom we had 
      depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information
      were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed
      sleep was associated with PTB. RESULTS: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly
      associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and
      marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI
      .92-1.71). No other relationships were significant. CONCLUSIONS: We report
      preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB.
      Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute
      whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep
      does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - A new method for long-term home monitoring of fetal movement by pregnant women
      themselves.
PG  - 566-72
LID - 10.1016/j.medengphy.2011.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Fetal movement is one index of fetal well-being. We designed and built a new
      recorder based on fetal movement acceleration measurement (FMAM). The FMAM
      recorder has a newly developed, capacitive acceleration sensor that can detect
      the oscillations of the maternal abdominal wall caused by fetal movements. In
      this study, the recorder was examined for its suitability for long-term home
      monitoring of fetal movement by pregnant women themselves. Experiment I: Fourteen
      pregnant women underwent 45 examinations in the laboratory at gestational 20-39
      weeks. We simultaneously recorded fetal movement as detected by the recorder,
      ultrasonography, and maternal perception, and then calculated agreement among the
      three methods. We evaluated agreement using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted
      kappa (PABAK). Agreement for gross fetal movement as detected by FMAM and
      ultrasonography was substantial or almost perfect, while agreement between
      maternal perception and ultrasonography was moderate or substantial. Experiment
      II: Six pregnant women undertook 53 experiments at home by themselves. Fetal
      movement during maternal nocturnal sleep was successfully recorded 50 out of 53
      times at home. In conclusion, there was high agreement for gross fetal movement
      between FMAM and ultrasonography. The recorder is promising for objective,
      accurate, and long-term home monitoring of gross fetal movement by pregnant women
      themselves.

TI  - [Diagnostic of secondary hypertension in clinical practice].
PG  - 772-6
AB  - Arterial hypertension is a common worldwide disease with a prevalence of
      approximately 26%. Secondary cause is known in 5-10% of patients with
      hypertension. We should think of secondary hypertension in all patients with
      resistant hypertension, in patients with sudden deterioration in the control of
      hypertension and in patients with laboratory and clinical signs of diseases
      associated with secondary hypertension. It is important to distinguish between
      secondary hypertension and pseudo-resistance (noncompliance to treatment, white
      coat syndrome). Secondary causes of hypertension can be divided into endocrine
      (primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, hypercortisolism,
      hyperparathyreoidism), renal - renovascular and renal parenchymal hypertension,
      and other causes as sleep apnoe syndrome, hypertension in pregnancy, coarctation 
      of the aorta and intracranial tumors.

TI  - Advanced paternal age and parental history of schizophrenia.
PG  - 125-32
LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2011.08.013 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective
      psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association
      are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing
      can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the
      "de novo mutation" hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP. METHODS:
      Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental
      history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal
      history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland
      between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the
      Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population 
      birth cohort. RESULTS: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with
      schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20,
      95% confidence interval 1.12-1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a
      mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 
      0.99-1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a
      father with schizophrenia and APA. DISCUSSION: In both a general population
      cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was
      associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest
      that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between
      APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the "de novo mutation"
      hypothesis.

TI  - Sleep disturbances and their relationship to glucose tolerance in pregnancy.
PG  - 2454-7
LID - 10.2337/dc11-0780 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore relationships among sleep disturbances, glucose tolerance, 
      and pregnancy outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four validated sleep
      questionnaires were administered to 169 pregnant women at the time of 50-g oral
      glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during the second trimester. Pregnancy outcomes 
      were analyzed in 108 women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). RESULTS: Of the
      participants, 41% had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale
      [ESS] >8); 64% had poor sleep quality; 25% snored frequently; 29% had increased
      risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); 52% experienced short sleep (SS); 19%
      had both increased SDB risk and SS (SDB/SS); and 14% had daytime dysfunction.
      Reported sleep duration inversely correlated with glucose values from 50-g OGTT
      (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). Each hour of reduced sleep time was associated with a 4%
      increase in glucose levels. Increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus
      (GDM) was found in subjects with increased SDB risk (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI
      1.2-7.4]), SS (2.4 [1.0-5.9]), SDB/SS (3.4 [1.3-8.7]), and frequent snoring (3.4 
      [1.3-8.8], after adjustment for BMI). Among NGT subjects, preterm delivery was
      more frequent in those with increased ESS (P = 0.02), poor sleep quality (P =
      0.02), and SS (P = 0.03). Neonatal intensive care unit admissions were associated
      with increased ESS (P = 0.03), SDB/SS (P = 0.03), and daytime dysfunction (P <
      0.01) in mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women experience significant sleep
      disturbances that are associated with increased risk of GDM and unfavorable
      pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women with increased SDB risk, frequent snoring, and
      sleep duration of <7 h/night have increased risk of developing GDM.

TI  - ELF magnetic fields: animal studies, mechanisms of action.
PG  - 369-73
LID - 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.09.003 [doi]
AB  - Animal studies can contribute to addressing the issue of possible greater health 
      risk for children exposed to 50-60 Hz extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic
      fields (MFs), mostly in terms of teratological effects and cancer. Teratology has
      been extensively studied in animals exposed to ELF MFs but experiments have not
      established adverse developmental effects. Childhood leukaemia has been the only 
      cancer consistently reported in epidemiological studies as associated with
      exposure to ELF MFs. This association has been the basis for the classification
      as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on 
      Cancer in 2002. Animal experiments have provided only limited support for these
      epidemiological findings. However, none but one study used an animal model for
      acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the main form of childhood leukaemia, and
      exposures to ELF MFs were not carried out over the whole pregnancy period, when
      the first hit of ALL is assumed to occur. Moreover, there are no generally
      accepted biophysical mechanisms that could explain carcinogenic effects of
      low-level MFs. The radical pair mechanism and related cryptochromes (CRY)
      molecules have recently been identified in birds and other non-mammalian species,
      as a sensor of the geomagnetic field, involved in navigation. The hypothesis has 
      to be tested in mammalian models. CRY, which is part of the molecular circadian
      clock machinery, is a ubiquitous protein likely to be involved in cancer cell
      growth and DNA repair. In summary, we now have some clues to test for a better
      characterization of the interaction between ALL and ELF MFs exposure.

AB  - Research by health psychologists is changing what we know about perinatal
      depression. In this guest editorial, the author examines depression in pregnant
      and breastfeeding women in light of this recent research and describes four major
      findings that are influencing how we think about depression in new mothers:
      inflammation has an etiologic role in depression, a relationship exists between
      sleep disturbances and depression, breastfeeding protects maternal mental health,
      and all effective treatments for depression are anti-inflammatory interventions.

PG  - 272-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-5491.2011.03426.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate self-reported satisfaction and barriers to initiating real-time 
      continuous glucose monitoring in early pregnancy among women with pregestational 
      diabetes. METHODS: Fifty-four women with Type 1 diabetes and 14 women with Type 2
      diabetes were offered continuous glucose monitoring for 6 days at median 9 (range
      6-14) gestational weeks and were asked to answer a semi-structured questionnaire 
      on patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Median HbA1c was 49 (range 34-86) mmol/mol)
      [6.6 (5.3-10.0) %] and duration of diabetes was 12 (0.5-37) years. Continuous
      glucose monitoring was used for 6 (0.5-7) days, with 43 (65%) women using
      continuous glucose monitoring for at least 5 days. The women experienced 2.7
      (0-12) alarms per 24 h, of which approximately one third was technical alarms and
      one third disturbed their sleep. Sixteen women (24%) reported discomfort with
      continuous glucose monitoring during daytime and twelve (18%) during sleep. Many 
      women reported improved diabetes understanding (52%) and would recommend
      continuous glucose monitoring to others (83%). Twenty-four patients (36%) had
      continuous glucose monitoring removed earlier than planned ( before the intended 
      6 days of initial monitoring). Ten women (15%) did not wish to use continuous
      glucose monitoring again in pregnancy. Main causes behind early removal of
      continuous glucose monitoring were self-reported skin irritation, technical
      problems and continuous glucose monitoring inaccuracy. No differences were found 
      in continuous glucose monitoring use, inconvenience or compliance with respect to
      diabetes type. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pregnant women with diabetes found
      real-time continuous glucose monitoring useful and the intervention was equally
      tolerated regardless of diabetes type. Nevertheless, continuous glucose
      monitoring was frequently removed earlier than planned, primarily because of skin
      irritation, technical problems and inaccuracy.

TI  - Biochemical oxidative stress-related markers in patients with obstructive sleep
      apnea.
PG  - CR491-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition contributing to
      oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to ascertain if there is any
      connection between OSA and novel oxidative stress-related markers. Matrix
      metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), high sensitive C-reactive protein
      (hsCRP), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), soluble receptors for
      advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were measured.
      Further biochemical markers were evaluated. MATERIAL/METHODS: Fifty-one men
      suspected for OSA indicated for night polygraphy were included. Apnea/hypopnea
      index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), mean blood hemoglobin oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) and time of blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation below 90% (SpO2 
      <90%) were measured. Morning venous blood samples were taken. RESULTS: For body
      mass index (BMI) we found strong positive correlation with levels of Cu, MMP-9,
      hsCRP and fibrinogen, and negative correlation with sRAGE. Concerning ventilation
      parameters, we found positive correlation of ODI and SpO2 <90% with markers MMP-9
      and hsCRP. sRAGE level correlated with AHI and ODI negatively. SpO2 correlated
      negatively with Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fibrinogen. There was no correlation between
      ventilation parameters and markers MMP-2, PAPP-A and Zn. Compared to severity of 
      OSA, there was significant difference in levels of hsCRP and Cu between patients 
      with AHI </=5 and AHI >/=30 independent of BMI. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-9, hsCRP, sRAGE 
      and Cu seem to be strong predictors of oxidative stress in OSA patients. The
      strong correlation between oxidative stress-related markers and OSA is elucidated
      by connection of these to BMI, which is probably a primary condition of oxidative
      stress, but OSA is an additive condition.

AB  - Circadian rhythms impact on a wide range of physiological systems and this impact
      extends to fertility, such that disruptions to timing systems can impact upon
      reproductive capacity. This is highlighted most obviously in mutant mouse models 
      whereby deletion or mutation of single genes results not only in disrupted
      circadian rhythmicity, but also compromised male and female reproductive
      function. In this review, we discuss the presence of circadian clocks in female
      and male reproductive tissues and the role these clocks play in the generation of
      oestrus cycles, ovulation, sperm generation, implantation and the maintenance of 
      pregnancy. Given the increased incidence of shiftwork and international travel
      which disrupt circadian rhythmicity, and the increasing prevalence of
      reproductive technologies whereby early embryo development occurs without
      external time cues, it is important for us to consider the role of circadian
      rhythms in fertility.

AB  - THE AIM OF STUDY: To assess some risk factors and their involvement in female
      breast tumours etiology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on a
      sample of 67 patients registered with breast tumours, at family phisicians'
      offices from Iasi, Romania. RESULTS: Some risk factors were defined such as:
      nuliparity (20.8%) and first pregnancy after age 30 (34.3%); fibrous mastopathy
      in personal history (73.1% of cases with breast cancer) and breast cancer in
      siblings of first (8.9%) and second grade (11.9%). Relative to lifestyle,
      sedentary life was remarked in 59.2% of patients; modification of circadian
      rhythm in 28.3%, and excesive caffeine consumption in 80.9% of cases.
      CONCLUSIONS: Further prevention and educational programs on breast tumoural risk 
      factors are needed in Romania, even at female teenage, performed by family
      physician.

      apnea/hypopnea syndrome in pregnant women].
PG  - 1357-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible role of inflammation factors in the
      pathogenesis of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with concurrent obstructive
      sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in pregnant women. METHODS: Twenty-five
      pregnant women with IGT and concurrent OSAHS and 35 pregnant women with IGT but
      not OSAHS were monitored for all night polysomnography (PSG), and the apnea
      hypopnea index (AHI) and the lowest pulse oxygen saturation (LSpO2) were
      recorded. The body mass index, glycated serum protein (GSP), interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in these women.
      RESULTS: IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels increased significantly in women with IGT and 
      OSAHS as compared with those in women without OSAHS. AHI showed significant
      positive correlations to GSP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, whereas LSpO2 was inversely
      correlated to GSP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly
      correlated to GSP, with correlation coefficients of 0.510 and 0.476,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The inflammatory factors may play important roles in
      IGT complicated by OSAHS in pregnant women, and as a potential risk factor, OSAHS
      may contribute to the occurrence of progression of IGT.

TI  - [The features of sleep homeostasis in pregnant rats].
PG  - 365-76
AB  - To investigate the effects of short-term sleep deprivation on the sleep pattern
      during pregnancy, cortical and hippocampal EEG and locomotor activity were
      recorded within 24-hours in a "disk-over-water" paradigm in 18 Wistar rats. Rats 
      were adapted to experimental situation and were able to move across the rotating 
      disk without falling in water. Then a polysomnogram was recorded for 3 sequential
      days in the control group 1 (n = 12) without disk rotation. On the next day
      non-pregnant rats (experimental group 1, n = 6) were subjected to the sleep
      deprivation procedure with a pre-set program of disk rotation from 11:00 to 14:00
      during 3 sequential days. Other 6 rats (experimental group 2) were subjected to
      sleep deprivation on the 5-7th day of pregnancy. EEG and locomotor activity were 
      also constantly recorded during the sleep deprivation procedure. In control group
      2 (n = 6, without sleep deprivation), a polysomnogram was recorded on the 5-7th
      day of pregnancy. As compared to non-pregnant rats, sleep intensity of pregnant
      rats increased during the first hours after the deprivation, and a considerable
      rebound of REM sleep took place. Sleep pattern during the off-light 12 hours
      remained unchanged. The results suggest that homeostatic compensation of sleep
      deprivation effects in rats on the first week of pregnancy is more efficient than
      in control non-pregnant animals.

TI  - Circadian rhythms in the fetus.
PG  - 68-75
LID - 10.1016/j.mce.2011.07.039 [doi]
AB  - Throughout gestation, the close relationship between mothers and their progeny
      ensures adequate development and a successful transition to postnatal life. By
      living inside the maternal compartment, the fetus is inevitably exposed to
      rhythms of the maternal internal milieu such as temperature; rhythms originated
      by maternal food intake and maternal melatonin, one of the few maternal hormones 
      that cross the placenta unaltered. The fetus, immature by adult standards, is
      however perfectly fit to accomplish the dual functions of living in the uterine
      environment and developing the necessary tools to "mature" for the next step,
      i.e. to be a competent newborn. In the fetal physiological context, organ
      function differs from the same organ's function in the newborn and adult. This
      may also extend to the developing circadian system. The information reviewed here
      suggests that the fetal circadian system is organized differently from that of
      the adult. Moreover, the fetal circadian rhythm is not just present simply as the
      initial immature expression of a mechanism that has function in the postnatal
      animal only. We propose that the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
      hypothalamus and fetal organs are peripheral maternal circadian oscillators,
      entrained by different maternal signals. Conceptually, the arrangement produces
      internal temporal order during fetal life, inside the maternal compartment.
      Following birth, it will allow for postnatal integration of the scattered fetal
      circadian clocks into an adult-like circadian system commanded by the SCN.

      outcome.
PG  - 535-7
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2011.600370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance is common during pregnancy. The aim of this study
      was to assess the effects of sleep duration and its quality on labor and fetal
      outcome. METHOD: In a cross sectional study, primigravida women with singleton
      pregnancy (gestational age > 37 weeks) were recruited. Women with hypertension,
      diabetes mellitus, or those who needed emergency cesarean section were excluded. 
      Data regarding the type and length of delivery, the quality of sleep as well as
      the neonates' weight and Apgar scores were recorded. RESULTS: Totally, 457
      participants were recruited. There was a significant correlation between the
      sleep duration and length of delivery stages. In most participants with more than
      8 hours sleep, the first stage of delivery lasted between 6 and 10 hours. They
      had normal vaginal delivery with induction, and their neonates' Apgar score was >
      9 (p = 0.029, p = 0.018, and p = 0.001, respectively). Most mothers with
      refreshing sleep had normal vaginal delivery with induction, their neonates
      weighted >/= 2500 g and with Apgar score > 9 (p = 0.010, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Sleep duration and quality of sleep can affect the
      type of delivery, length of labor stages, as well as neonates' Apgar score and
      birth weight. Such predictors of labor and fetal outcome should be assessed
      during prenatal evaluations.

AB  - In this study, the relationship between sleep quality and type and duration of
      labour has been evaluated. A total of 88 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh 
      Sleep Questionnaire three times during their last 3 weeks of pregnancy at their
      prenatal visits and once postpartum. A mean score of >5 was considered as
      poor-quality sleep. Duration of labour, type of delivery and weight of the
      newborn at delivery was considered. Of the study population, 56.2% were
      categorised as the good-quality sleep group and 43.8% as the poor-quality sleep
      group. The reported sleeping time per day was 8.47+/-1.86 hours for the
      good-quality sleep group and 6.45+/-2.07 hours for the poor-quality sleep group. 
      The poor-quality sleep women were 20% more likely to undergo caesarean section
      and had a longer labour duration. Gestational age at delivery and mean gravidity 
      was respectively 38.53+/-1.17 weeks and 1.91+/-1.03 in the good-quality sleep
      group and 38.36+/-1.59 weeks and 1.86+/-1.07 in the poor-quality sleep group.
      Thus, it was found that women with sleep problems experience longer labour
      duration and are more likely to undergo a caesarean section.
