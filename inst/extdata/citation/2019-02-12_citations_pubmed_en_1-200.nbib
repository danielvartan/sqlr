TI  - Postnatal outcomes in lambs exposed antenatally and acutely postnatally to
      fluoxetine.
LID - 10.1038/s41390-019-0309-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1/3 of newborns exposed antenatally to selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) exhibit poor neonatal adaptation. Although 
      several potential mechanisms have been proposed, the actual mechanism has not
      been elucidated. METHODS: We investigated outcomes in neonatal lambs exposed
      prenatally or postnatally to fluoxetine (FX). Daily FX injections (50 mg) were
      given intravenously (i.v.) to five pregnant ewes via implanted catheters
      beginning at 131-132 days gestation (term = 147 days) for 2 weeks. In another
      group, lambs with implanted vascular catheters had sterile water (n = 9) or FX (1
      mg/kg, n = 12) injected i.v. on ~postnatal day (PND) 4. RESULTS: Prenatal
      FX-exposed lambs (n = 7) were hyperactive during PND 4 to 14 and their heart rate
      variability (HRV) was significantly lower than in control lambs (n = 7) on PND 2.
      In contrast, arterial pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, arterial blood
      gases, pH, glucose, lactate, cortisol, and sleep-activity cycles were not altered
      following postnatal FX injection. CONCLUSION: This abnormal postnatal
      hyperactivity with antenatal FX exposure may reflect increased maturity in terms 
      of locomotory activity. The results suggest that altered brain development may be
      involved in the poor neonatal adaptation in human infants exposed to FX in utero.

TI  - Predictors of objectively measured physical activity in 12-month-old infants: A
      study of linked birth cohort data with electronic health records.
PG  - e12512
LID - 10.1111/ijpo.12512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) levels are associated with long-term health,
      and levels of PA when young are predictive of adult activity levels. OBJECTIVES: 
      This study examines factors associated with PA levels in 12-month infants.
      METHOD: One hundred forty-one mother-infant pairs were recruited via a
      longitudinal birth cohort study (April 2010 to March 2013). The PA level was
      collected using accelerometers and linked to postnatal notes and electronic
      medical records via the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage databank.
      Univariable and multivariable linear regressions were used to examine the factors
      associated with PA levels. RESULTS: Using univariable analysis, higher PA was
      associated with the following (P value less than 0.05): being male, larger infant
      size, healthy maternal blood pressure levels, full-term gestation period, higher 
      consumption of vegetables (infant), lower consumption of juice (infant), low
      consumption of adult crisps (infant), longer breastfeeding duration, and more
      movement during sleep (infant) but fewer night wakings. Combined into a
      multivariable regression model (R(2) = 0.654), all factors remained significant, 
      showing lower PA levels were associated with female gender, smaller infant,
      preterm birth, higher maternal blood pressure, low vegetable consumption, high
      crisp consumption, and less night movement. CONCLUSION: The PA levels of infants 
      were strongly associated with both gestational and postnatal environmental
      factors. Healthy behaviours appear to cluster, and a healthy diet was associated 
      with a more active infant. Boys were substantially more active than girls, even
      at age 12 months. These findings can help inform interventions to promote
      healthier lives for infants and to understand the determinants of their PA
      levels.

TI  - Characteristics of women with different perinatal depression trajectories.
LID - 10.1002/jnr.24390 [doi]
AB  - Maternal perinatal depression (PND), a common mental disorder with a prevalence
      of over 10%, is associated with long-term health risks for both mothers and
      offspring. This study aimed at describing characteristics related to background
      and lifestyle, pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum of different PND trajectories 
      defined according to the onset of depressive symptoms. Participants were drawn
      from a large population-based cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden (n = 2,466). Five
      trajectory groups of depressive symptom onset were created using the Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale >/=13 (pregnancy) or >/=12 points (postpartum): (a)
      healthy (60.6%), (b) pregnancy depression (8.5%), (c) early postpartum onset
      (10.9%), (d) late postpartum onset (5.4%), and (e) chronic depression (14.6%). In
      multinomial logistic regressions, the associations between trajectories and the
      included characteristics were tested using the healthy trajectory as reference.
      Background characteristics (younger age, lower education, unemployment) were
      primarily associated with pregnancy depression and chronic depression.
      Characteristics associated with all PND trajectories were smoking prior to
      pregnancy, migraine, premenstrual mood symptoms, intimate partner violence,
      interpersonal trauma, negative delivery expectations, pregnancy nausea, and
      symphysiolysis. Nulliparity, instrumental delivery, or a negative delivery
      experience was associated with early postpartum onset. Postpartum factors (e.g., 
      infantile colic, lack of sleep, low partner support, and bonding difficulties)
      were associated with early and late postpartum onset together with chronic
      depression. The findings suggest that different PND trajectories have divergent
      characteristics, which could be used to create individualized treatment options. 
      To find the most predictive characteristics for different PND trajectories,
      studies with even larger and more diverse samples are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies on the relationship between sleep quantity and/or quality
      and cognition have been conducted among preschoolers from the healthy general
      population. We aimed to identify, among 3-year-old children, early
      polysomnography (PSG) sleep factors associated with estimated intelligence
      quotient (IQ) using the Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale Intelligence-III
      test (WPPSI-III) and its indicators: full-scale (FISQ), verbal (VIQ), and
      performance (PIQ) intelligence quotients. METHODS: We included full-term children
      from the French birth-cohort AuBE with PSG recording at term (M0) and/or six
      months (M6), and available WPPSI-III scores at three years. Sleep and arousal
      characteristics of these infants were evaluated during day and night sleep
      periods. Relationships between IQ scores and sleep parameters were estimated
      using models with the child as a repeated effect adjusted for time (night/day),
      maturation (M0/M6), tobacco exposure (yes/no), anxiety-depressive scores during
      pregnancy, maternal age, duration of breastfeeding and child's gender. RESULTS: A
      total of 118 PSG recordings were obtained, representing a total of 78 unique
      children (38 with one PSG and 40 with two PSG). No correlations were found
      between night and day sleep durations at M0 or M6. Mean VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ scores
      were within normal ranges. In multivariate models, longer sleep duration and
      higher sleep efficiency during the day were negatively associated with all IQ
      scores. More frequent arousals during the night were associated with lower VIQ
      scores. CONCLUSION: Early sleep characteristics such as night sleep fragmentation
      or longer naps could be associated with impaired cognitive function at three
      years of age.

TI  - Identifying clusters from multidimensional symptom trajectories in postpartum
      women.
LID - 10.1002/nur.21935 [doi]
AB  - Depressive symptoms, stress, fatigue, and lack of sleep are often experienced by 
      women in the perinatal period and are potential contributors to adverse maternal 
      and child health outcomes. To explore the evolution of symptoms and identify
      groups of women of similar severity and patterns, we utilized clustering of
      multidimensional symptom trajectories. In an observational study data were
      collected from pregnant women in the 3rd trimester (36 weeks prenatal) and in the
      postnatal period at weeks 1 and 2 as well as at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-months
      postpartum. Depressive symptoms and maternal stress were measured using the
      Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), 
      respectively. Self-reported duration of sleep and levels of fatigue also were
      collected. A model-based clustering approach was used to classify women by their 
      symptom severity. The sample included 151 pregnant women with a 6-month
      follow-up. Two clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 43) comprised women with 
      fewer depressive symptoms, less perceived stress, lower likelihood of being
      fatigued, increased sleep duration and a negative trend in EPDS (beta = -0.05, CI
      [-0.09, -0.001]), and PSS (beta = -0.09, CI [-0.17, -0.01]). Cluster 2 (n = 108) 
      comprised women with higher EPDS and PSS scores, increased likelihood of fatigue 
      and lower sleep duration with a positive trend in sleep hours (beta = -0.02, CI
      [0.01, 0.03]). Pro-inflammatory markers interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha were associated with longer sleep duration and fewer depressive
      symptoms, respectively. Using this methodology in maternal and child health
      research can potentially predict women's risk of developing severe symptoms and
      help clinicians provide timely interventions.

TI  - THE RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (REVIEW).
PG  - 74-81
AB  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common
      sleep related neurological disorder with prevalence between 1 and 10%, increasing
      with age. Women are more frequently affected than men. RLS is characterized by an
      urge to move the legs accompanied by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in
      the legs, worsening of complaints during periods of rest, improvement by movement
      and an increase of symptoms in the evening or at night. In addition, affected
      patients may also suffer from severe sleep disorders and negative effects on
      daily activities. There is often a history of RLS among first-degree relatives,
      especially with the primary form. Among other, comorbidities or causal factors
      are iron deficiency, terminal renal insufficiency, pregnancy, polyneuropathy, or 
      psychotropic drugs. The etiology of primary (idiopathic) RLS has not been
      clarified yet; however, genetic factors and dysfunctional dopaminergic
      neurotransmission as well as alterations of central iron metabolism play an
      important role. In addition to non-pharmacological treatment such as lifestyle
      modifications or behavioral strategies, levodopa, dopamine agonists, or
      anticonvulsants are effective. Opioids may be used in otherwise refractory forms.
      In the case of secondary or comorbid RLS, treatment of the underlying disease is 
      necessary.

AB  - Background Disturbances in maternal physiology can cause changes in the fetal
      condition that may lead to impaired fetal development. Synchronous monitoring of 
      cardiac autonomic tone via the assessment of the fetal and maternal heart rate
      (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) may provide an appropriate diagnostic
      window. Methods Partial rank correlation coefficients between the maternal and
      fetal HR and HRV indices were calculated and verified by testing surrogate data
      in 315 magnetocardiographic (MCG) recordings from 141 healthy women pregnant with
      singleton fetuses [18+6 to 39+2 weeks gestational age (WGA)]. We assessed
      maternal self-perceived depression, anxiety and stress by means of the
      Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales self-reporting instrument (DASS42G)
      questionnaire. Results The maternal HRV correlated positively with the fetal HRV,
      but negatively with the fetal HR. Correlation was |r|<0.2 in state-independent
      and gestational age (GA) <32 weeks, but |r|>0.2 in active sleep and GA >/=32
      weeks. The DASS42G results correlated with the maternal HRV and HR, while the
      fetal HR and HRV were not influenced. Conclusions Correlations between maternal
      and fetal autonomic activation were statistically confirmed. They depend on the
      GA and active fetal state. As far as healthy subjects are concerned, maternal
      self-perceived stress, anxiety or depression is mirrored in maternal but not in
      fetal autonomic tone.

TI  - Simulated shift work disrupts maternal circadian rhythms and metabolism, and
      increases gestation length in sheep.
LID - 10.1113/JP277186 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Shift work impairs metabolic health, although its effects during
      pregnancy are not well understood We evaluated the effects of a simulated shift
      work protocol for one-third, two-thirds or all of pregnancy on maternal and
      pregnancy outcomes in sheep. Simulated shift work changed the timing of activity,
      disrupted hormonal and cellular rhythms, and impaired maternal glucose tolerance 
      during early pregnancy. Gestation length was increased in twin pregnancies,
      whereas singleton lambs were lighter at a given gestational age if mothers were
      subjected to shift work conditions in the first one-third of pregnancy. Exposure 
      to rotating night and day shifts, even if only in early pregnancy, may adversely 
      affect maternal metabolic and pregnancy outcomes. ABSTRACT: Shift workers are at 
      increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesity; however, the impact
      during pregnancy on maternal metabolism is unknown. Using a large animal model,
      we assessed the impact of simulated shift work (SSW) exposure during pregnancy on
      maternal circadian rhythms, glucose tolerance and pregnancy outcomes. Following
      mating, ewes were randomly allocated to a control photoperiod (CON 12 h light, 12
      h dark) or to SSW, where the timing of light exposure and food presentation was
      reversed twice each week for one-third, two-thirds or all of pregnancy. Maternal 
      behaviour followed SSW cycles with increased activity during light exposure and
      feeding. Melatonin rhythms resynchronized within 2 days of the photoperiod shift,
      whereas peripheral circadian rhythms were arrhythmic. SSW impaired glucose
      tolerance (+29%, P = 0.019) and increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
      (+32%, P = 0.018) in ewes with a singleton fetus in early but not late gestation.
      SSW exposure did not alter rates of miscarriage or stillbirth, although it
      extended gestation length in twin pregnancies (+2.4 days, P = 0.032). Relative to
      gestational age, birth weight was lower in singleton progeny of SSW than CON ewes
      (-476 g, P = 0.016). These results have implications for the large number of
      women currently engaged in shift work, and further studies are required to
      determine progeny health impacts.

AB  - Periconceptional care such as lifestyle plays an important impact role in
      offspring health. The aim of the present study was to clarify the perspective of 
      Avicenna on periconceptional care. Avicenna (980-1037 A.D.) was one of the
      outstanding Persian physicians, who made great contributions to the field of
      medical sciences, in particular, obstetrics. In advance, Avicenna's book, Canon
      of Medicine, was considered to find his perspectives on periconceptional care.
      Then, his ideas and theories were compared to the current findings by searching
      the keywords in main indexing systems including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and
      Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science as well as the search engine 
      of Google Scholar. Current investigations show that gamete quality, pregnancy
      outcome, and offspring health at birth and long term depend on both parents'
      lifestyle in pre- and periconceptional period, as well as the intrauterine
      environment. Avicenna believed that seminal fluid, sperm, ovum, and developing
      conditions in utero were influenced by the stages of food digestion and the
      function of some organs. On the other hand, food digestion and function of the
      organs also depend on each parent's lifestyle and environmental factors. He
      mentioned 6 principles of healthy lifestyle: exercise, nutrition, sleep and
      awareness, excretion of body wastes and retention of necessary materials, psychic
      features, as well as air and climate. Thus, a multicomponent healthy lifestyle
      should be considered by parents of child-bearing age in an appropriate period
      before and in early pregnancy as well as elimination of any disorders in parents,
      to give birth to more healthy offspring.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Women commonly use massage therapy during pregnancy for
      pregnancy-related health conditions such as lower back and neck pain; however,
      there is little to no research related evidence on the side effects or mother or 
      child physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period.
      OBJECTIVES: This study aims to report on the side effects and mother or child
      physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period. DESIGN: An
      observational study methodology. SETTING AND TIME FRAME: Two massage clinics, one
      in Sydney and one in Melbourne recruited participants from December 2016 to
      December 2017. INTERVENTION: Massage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Side effects and
      mother or child physical harm from massage. RESULTS: One hundred and one
      participants were recruited to the study. Two fifths of the participants (n = 32,
      40%) experienced one of more post-massage side effects. There were no mother or
      child physical harm events. Low back pain was the most common condition women
      sought massage treatment for 34 (33.7.%). A significant benefit (p < 0.001) was
      seen pre-massage to post-massage and pre-massage to 1-week post massage in
      decreasing stress, decreasing pain, increasing range of motion and improving
      sleep DISCUSSION: Similar to previous research, low back pain was the most common
      condition that women sought massage treatment for followed by hip pain, shoulder 
      pain, neck pain and to improve mental health. Ninety-seven percent of the cohort 
      received a full body massage including the feet leading credence that 'massage on
      the feet during pregnancy is harmful' is mythic in nature. CONCLUSION: While our 
      findings lead credence that massage on the feet during pregnancy is a myth the
      study was not powered to determine the safety of pregnancy massage and further
      research is needed. Massage was commonly sought for low back pain with promising 
      benefits in decreased pain and improved range of movement and further research on
      the effectiveness of massage for low back pain in pregnancy.

TI  - GTP Cyclohydrolase 1-Deficient Dopa-Responsive Dystonia
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: GTP cyclohydrolase 1-deficient dopa-responsive dystonia
      (GTPCH1-deficient DRD) is characterized by childhood-onset dystonia and a
      dramatic and sustained response to low doses of oral administration of levodopa. 
      This disorder typically presents with gait disturbance caused by foot dystonia,
      later development of parkinsonism, and diurnal fluctuation of symptoms
      (aggravation of symptoms toward the evening and alleviation of symptoms in the
      morning after sleep). Initial symptoms are often gait difficulties attributable
      to flexion-inversion (equinovarus posture) of the foot. Occasionally, initial
      symptoms are arm dystonia, postural tremor of the hand, or slowness of movements.
      Brisk deep-tendon reflexes in the legs, ankle clonus, and/or the striatal toe
      (dystonic extension of the big toe) are present in many affected individuals. In 
      general, gradual progression to generalized dystonia is observed. Intellectual,
      cerebellar, sensory, and autonomic disturbances generally do not occur.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of GTPCH1-deficient DRD is established in a
      proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GCH1 by
      molecular genetic testing. In individuals with a suspected diagnosis of
      GTPCH1-deficient DRD and no identifiable GCH1 pathogenic variants, biochemical
      testing may be necessary. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Initial
      suggested dose of levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI): Children age <6 years: 
      1-10 mg/kg levodopa/DCI daily, administered in multiple doses. Children age >/=6 
      years: 25-50 mg levodopa/DCI 1-3x daily. Adults: 50 mg levodopa/DCI 1-3x daily.
      For all, dose should be changed slowly and by small increments as needed. Motor
      benefit occurs immediately or within a few days of starting levodopa; full
      benefit occurs within several days to a few months. Maximum benefit (complete or 
      near-complete responsiveness of symptoms) is generally achieved by <300-400
      mg/day of levodopa/DCI. Although dyskinesias may appear at the beginning of
      levodopa therapy, they subside following dose reduction and do not reappear when 
      the dose is gradually increased. Typically, adverse motor effects of chronic
      levodopa therapy (motor response fluctuations and dopa-induced dyskinesias) do
      not occur. Prevention of secondary complications: Early diagnosis and therapy
      (with low doses of levodopa) may prevent transient dyskinesias at initiation of
      levodopa treatment. Surveillance: Examination by a movement disorder specialist
      at least several times yearly is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid:
      Discontinuation of levodopa treatment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is
      appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and
      younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early
      as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment.
      Molecular genetic testing cannot be used to predict the occurrence of symptoms,
      age of onset, severity and type of symptoms, or rate of disease progression in
      family members who are heterozygous for a GCH1 pathogenic variant. Pregnancy
      management: Levodopa therapy is continued during pregnancy without adverse effect
      in most. GENETIC COUNSELING: GTPCH1-deficient DRD is inherited in an autosomal
      dominant manner. Affected individuals often have an affected parent with typical 
      GTPCH1-deficient DRD or adult-onset parkinsonism caused by a GCH1 pathogenic
      variant. A proband with GTPCH1-deficient DRD may have the disorder as the result 
      of a de novo pathogenic variant. Every child of an individual with autosomal
      dominant GTPCH1-deficient DRD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic
      variant. However, because of gender-related incomplete penetrance (i.e., higher
      penetrance in women than in men), it is not possible to predict whether offspring
      with a GCH1 pathogenic variant will develop symptoms.

TI  - Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Classic Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is characterized
      by coronal synostosis (unilateral or bilateral), facial asymmetry (particularly
      in individuals with unicoronal synostosis), strabismus, ptosis, and
      characteristic appearance of the ear (small pinna with a prominent superior
      and/or inferior crus). Syndactyly of digits two and three of the hand is variably
      present. Cognitive development is usually normal, although those with a large
      genomic deletion are at an increased risk for intellectual challenges. Less
      common manifestations of SCS include other skeletal findings (parietal foramina, 
      vertebral segmentation defects, radioulnar synostosis, maxillary hypoplasia,
      ocular hypertelorism, hallux valgus, duplicated or curved distal hallux),
      hypertelorism, palatal anomalies, obstructive sleep apnea, increased intracranial
      pressure, short stature, and congenital heart malformations. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      The diagnosis of SCS is established in a proband with typical clinical findings
      and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TWIST1 by
      molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Ongoing
      management by an established craniofacial team which may include cranioplasty in 
      the first year of life and midface surgery in childhood as needed for dental
      malocclusion, swallowing difficulties, and respiratory problems. If a cleft
      palate is present, surgical repair usually follows cranioplasty. As needed:
      orthodontic treatment and/or orthognathic surgery at the completion of facial
      growth; developmental intervention; routine treatment of hearing loss;
      ophthalmologic evaluation and, if ptosis is present, intervention to prevent
      amblyopia, with surgical repair during early childhood as needed. Surveillance:
      Annual ophthalmologic evaluation for papilledema; brain imaging for additional
      evaluation when there is evidence of increased intracranial pressure; clinical
      examination for facial asymmetry as needed; annual speech evaluation starting at 
      age 12 months in those with a cleft palate. Audiology evaluations every 6-12
      months; annual clinical evaluation for sleep-disordered breathing and
      developmental delays. Agents/circumstances to avoid: If cervical spine
      abnormality with instability is present in an individual, activities that put the
      spine at risk should be limited. GENETIC COUNSELING: SCS is inherited in an
      autosomal dominant manner. Many individuals diagnosed with SCS have an affected
      parent; the proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is
      unknown. The family history of some individuals diagnosed with SCS may appear to 
      be negative because of failure to recognize the disorder in family members (wide 
      phenotypic variability is observed within families with SCS) or reduced
      penetrance. Each child of an individual with SCS has a 50% chance of inheriting
      the pathogenic variant. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk and 
      preimplantation diagnosis are possible if the pathogenic variant has been
      identified in the family.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The programming of sleep architecture begins in pregnancy and depends
      upon optimal in utero formation and maturation of the neural connectivity of the 
      brain. Particulate air pollution exposure can disrupt fetal brain development but
      associations between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure during pregnancy
      and child sleep outcomes have not been previously explored. METHODS: Analyses
      included 397 mother-child pairs enrolled in a pregnancy cohort in Mexico City.
      Daily ambient prenatal PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated
      satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved prediction model. Child sleep periods 
      were estimated objectively using wrist-worn, continuous actigraphy over a 1-week 
      period at age 4-5years. Data-driven advanced statistical methods (distributed lag
      models (DLMs)) were employed to identify sensitive windows whereby PM2.5 exposure
      during gestation was significantly associated with changes in sleep duration or
      efficiency. Models were adjusted for maternal education, season, child's age,
      sex, and BMI z-score. RESULTS: Mother's average age was 27.7years, with 59%
      having at least a high school education. Children slept an average of 7.7h at
      night, with mean 80.1% efficiency. The adjusted DLM identified windows of PM2.5
      exposure between 31 and 35weeks gestation that were significantly associated with
      decreased sleep duration in children. In addition, increased PM2.5 during weeks
      1-8 was associated with decreased sleep efficiency. In other exposure windows
      (weeks 39-40), PM2.5 was associated with increased sleep duration. CONCLUSION:
      Prenatal PM2.5 exposure is associated with altered sleep in preschool-aged
      children in Mexico City. Pollutant exposure during sensitive windows of pregnancy
      may have critical influence upon sleep programming.

TI  - Sleep problems and anxiety from 2 to 8 years and the influence of autistic
      traits: a longitudinal study.
LID - 10.1007/s00787-019-01275-y [doi]
AB  - Whether or not childhood sleep problems and anxiety occur simultaneously, or one 
      precedes the other, and any effect of autistic traits on this relationship
      remains unclear. We investigated longitudinal associations between sleep and
      anxiety at 2 years and sleep and anxiety at 8 years controlling for demographic
      variables. We also examined the additional influence of autistic traits at 2
      years on sleep problems and anxiety at 8 years. Participants were from the
      Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, where 2900 pregnant women were
      recruited between 1989 and 1991 and their children assessed every 2-3 years
      thereafter. Demographic information was provided at 16-18 weeks gestation.
      Children's sleep and anxiety at 2 and 8 years and autistic traits at 2 years were
      measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. Hierarchical multiple regression
      models tested the prediction of both anxiety and sleep problems at 8 years. Sleep
      problems at 2 years and 8 years, anxiety at 2 years, and autistic traits at 2
      years were significantly associated with anxiety at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 
      years and anxiety at 8 years were significantly related to sleep problems at 8
      years. Each of these models explained about 20% of variance. Childhood sleep
      problems, anxiety and autistic traits are interrelated and can occur concurrently
      in young children, but the best predictor of poor sleep in middle childhood is
      concurrent anxiety and vice versa. Anxiety and sleep problems may be an early
      indicator of autism in young children and early autistic traits may also
      contribute to anxiety problems later in childhood.

TI  - Maternal sleep practices and stillbirth: Findings from an international
      case-control study.
LID - 10.1111/birt.12416 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Late stillbirth, which occurs >/=28 weeks' gestation, affects 1.3-8.8
      per 1000 births in high-income countries. Of concern, most occur in women without
      established risk factors. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors
      that relate to maternal behaviors remains a priority in stillbirth prevention
      research. This study aimed to investigate, in an international cohort, whether
      maternal sleep practices are related to late stillbirth. METHODS: An
      Internet-based case-control study of women who had a stillbirth >/=28 weeks'
      gestation within 30 days before completing the survey (n = 153) and women with an
      ongoing third-trimester pregnancy or who had delivered a live born child within
      30 days (n = 480). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to
      determine unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR and aOR, respectively) with 95%
      confidence intervals (95% CIs) for stillbirth. RESULTS: Sleeping >9 hours per
      night in the previous month was associated with stillbirth (aOR 1.75 [95% CI
      1.10-2.79]), as was waking on the right side (2.27 [1.31-3.92]). Nonrestless
      sleep in the last month was also found to be associated with stillbirth (1.73
      [1.03-2.99]), with good sleep quality in the last month approaching significance 
      (1.64 [0.98-2.75]). On the last night of pregnancy, not waking more than one time
      was associated with stillbirth (2.03 [1.24-3.34]). No relationship was found with
      going to sleep position during pregnancy, although very few women reported
      settling in the supine position (2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Long periods of undisturbed 
      sleep are associated with late stillbirth. Physiological studies of how the
      neuroendocrine and autonomic system pathways are regulated during sleep in the
      context of late pregnancy are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma-exposed women may be at magnified risk for posttraumatic
      stress (PTSS) and depression symptoms in the perinatal period, but few studies
      have examined symptomatology across the perinatal period in high-risk samples.
      Further, the role of sleep in perinatal symptomatology has been largely neglected
      in the violence literature, despite its well-established associations to mental
      health in other samples. This study aimed to examine the trajectory of PTSS and
      depression symptoms across the perinatal period and the effects of childhood
      adversity, intimate partner violence and prenatal sleep impairment on PTSS and
      depression symptoms across the perinatal period. METHOD: In a longitudinal,
      prospective study, 101 low-income pregnant women were interviewed during
      pregnancy, at 6-weeks postpartum, and 4months postpartum. N=83 women completed at
      least 2 interviews and were included in the analyses. Prenatal sleep, childhood
      adversity, and IPV exposure were assessed at the prenatal interview; PTSS and
      depression were assessed at all interviews. RESULTS: Past year IPV was associated
      with elevated prenatal mental health symptoms and prenatal sleep difficulties
      were associated with a worsening trajectory in perinatal PTSS. CONCLUSIONS:
      Screening for IPV and prenatal sleep difficulties may be paramount in identifying
      those at risk for the development or exacerbation of mental health symptoms in
      the perinatal period.

TI  - Feasibility of smart wristbands for continuous monitoring during pregnancy and
      one month after birth.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/s12884-019-2187-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smart wristbands enable the continuous monitoring of health
      parameters, for example, in maternity care. Understanding the feasibility and
      acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect 
      continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second
      trimester until one month postpartum. METHODS: The feasibility of a smart
      wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n =
      20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants'
      experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the
      wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The
      quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for
      repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.
      RESULTS: Participants (n = 20) were recruited at a median of 12.9 weeks of
      gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182 days during the
      seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the
      second (17.9 h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7 h, 95% CI 13.8 to
      19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4 h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p 
      = 0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the
      device 300 min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the 
      participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving
      birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any
      permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the
      devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as
      unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the
      main reasons for not using the smart wristbands. CONCLUSIONS: A smart wristband
      is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily
      use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of 
      future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart
      wristbands on pregnant women.

TI  - Long-term effects of pregnancy and childbirth on sleep satisfaction and duration 
      of first-time and experienced mothers and fathers.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsz015 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: To examine the changes in mothers' and fathers' sleep
      satisfaction and sleep duration across pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and the
      postpartum period of up to six years after birth; it also sought to determine
      potential protective and risk factors for sleep during that time. Methods:
      Participants in a large population-representative panel study from Germany
      reported sleep satisfaction and sleep duration in yearly interviews. During the
      observation period (2008-2015), 2,541 women and 2,118 men reported the birth of
      their first, second, or third child and provided longitudinal data for analysis. 
      Fixed-effects regression models were used to analyze changes in sleep associated 
      with childbirth. Results: Sleep satisfaction and duration sharply declined with
      childbirth and reached a nadir during the first three months postpartum, with
      women more strongly affected (sleep satisfaction reduction compared with
      pre-pregnancy: women, 1.81 points on a 0 to 10 scale, d = 0.79 vs. men, 0.37
      points, d = 0.16; sleep duration reduction compared with pre-pregnancy: women, 62
      min, d = 0.90 vs. men, 13 min, d = 0.19). In both women and men, sleep
      satisfaction and duration did not fully recover for up to six years after the
      birth of their first child. Breastfeeding was associated with a slight decrease
      in maternal sleep satisfaction (0.72 points, d = 0.32) and duration (14 min, d = 
      0.21). Parental age, household income, and dual vs. single parenting were
      unrelated, or only very weakly related, to improved sleep. Conclusion: Following 
      the sharp decline in sleep satisfaction and duration in the first months
      postpartum, neither mothers' nor fathers' sleep fully recovers to pre-pregnancy
      levels up to six years after the birth of their first child.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the influence of occupational stress on recurrent
      spontaneous abortion (RSA) in women of childbearing age. Methods: From January to
      December, 2017, 75 working women of childbearing age (25-35 years) who were
      admitted to a provisional hospital in Lanzhou, China and diagnosed with RSA were 
      assigned into patient group. At a 1ratio4 ratio, 300 age-matched working women
      who had normal first pregnancy were randomly selected as controls. A case-control
      study was conducted by a self-made questionnaire and the effort-reward imbalance 
      scale. The impact of occupational stress on RSA in women of childbearing age was 
      analyzed by evaluation of occupational harmful factors, regularity, effort-reward
      ratio, and sleep quality. Results: There were significant differences in the
      distribution of sleep, daily exercise, night shift, extrinsic-effort/low-reward
      score, and effort/low-reward score between the patient group and the control
      group (chi(2)=7.867, P<0.05; chi(2)=7.377, P<0.05; chi(2)=3.714, P<0.05;
      chi(2)=6.651, P<0.05; chi(2)=8.556, P<0.05) . With controlled factors such as
      general conditions and living habits, logistic regression analysis showed that
      poor sleep quality and high-effort/low-reward were risk factors for RSA (odds
      ratio[OR]=1.462, 95% confidence interval[CI]: 1.032~2.073; OR=3.253, 95%CI:
      1.169~9.053) . A regular work was a protective factor against RSA (OR=0.644,
      95%CI: 0.438-0.946) . Conclusion: In occupational stress, irregular working
      hours, lack of sleep, and high-effort/low-reward are risk factors for RSA.
      Working women of childbearing age should ensure adequate sleep, pay attention to 
      effort-reward balance, and make a regular work schedule.

LID - S1871-4021(18)30405-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.dsx.2018.10.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) means the amount of energy utilized by
      body in physical and psychological resting rate, after a night sleep, awake
      without any previous physical activity post meal (10h after last meal) & neutral 
      environment. In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) there is an increase 
      in BMR which is said to be associated with the level of glycaemic control. So,
      the objective of the study was to find out the correlation between BMR, Insulin
      resistance and Visceral fat in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy. MATERIALS &
      METHODS: A total of 50 participants with T2DM with peripheral neuropathy were
      included. Age group of 30-75 years were selected for the study. Participants with
      a known history of neurological disease, locomotor disability, and pregnancy were
      excluded from the study. Demographic details of the participants like duration of
      diabetes mellitus, age, Fasting Blood Glucose, Fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR, Glycated
      Haemoglobin (HBA1c), Neuropathy and Blood pressure values were noted. We measured
      Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by using Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation in T2DM
      with peripheral neuropathy. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants is 60.16
      +/- 10.62. The mean duration of T2DM 13.44 +/- 11.92. In the present study we
      found a statistical significant correlation between BMR and HOMA IR (r = 0.913*; 
      p = 0.000), BMR & Fasting blood sugar (FBS) (r = 0.281*; p = 0.048), BMR and
      Visceral fat (VF) (r = 0.332*; p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Basal metabolic rate is
      correlated to Homa-IR, visceral fat, fasting blood sugar and musculoskeletal mass
      among T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.

TI  - Sleep Duration and Nocturnal Awakenings in Infants Born with Gestational Risk.
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000642 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infants born with gestation-related risks (low birth weight (LBW),
      small for gestational age (SGA), and prematurely born infants) are faced with a
      cascade of developmental issues. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
      infants with gestation-related risks have different patterns of parent-reported
      sleep duration and nocturnal awakenings than children without these risk factors.
      METHODS: Information on sleep duration and nocturnal awakenings was obtained by
      parental report at age 6 and 18 months in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort
      Study, which is a population-based longitudinal pregnancy cohort study conducted 
      at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Birth weight and gestational age
      were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Outcomes were related to
      birth weight, prematurity, and to being born SGA. RESULTS: A total of 75,531
      mother-child dyads were included. Compared with children without gestational
      risks, children born SGA and with LBW had shorter sleep duration, whereas
      children born prematurely had longer sleep duration at both time points. The
      infants born SGA and with LBW, but not the prematurely born children, had fewer
      nocturnal awakenings at 6 months, but all had more awakenings at 18 months.
      CONCLUSION: Infants with gestation-related risks show distinct sleep patterns. We
      suggest that sleep assessment is included in the follow-up of high-risk infants. 
      Future studies are needed to investigate the predictive value and functional
      importance of the sleep patterns for infants with gestation-related risks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disturbance is a common issue that can arise from emotional
      distress. Women who received the complicated invasive in-vitro fertilization
      (IVF) procedures can be stressful. The purpose of this study is to understanding 
      the association between emotional distress (measured as anxiety and depression)
      and sleep quality for women undergoing IVF treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
      research was of a cross-sectional questionnaire design. Questionnaires were
      completed during the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation of IVF treatment. A
      total of 97 participants complete the survey. The questionnaires included basic
      personal information, The Chinese Traditional Childbearing Attitude
      Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Beck depression and
      anxiety scales. RESULTS: A total of 42.9% and 30% of the participants were
      determined to be anxious and depressed, respectively. Some participants (18.8%)
      required more than 30 min to fall asleep, and 56.2% of the participants had less 
      than 7 h of sleep, 43.6% of the participants had less than 85% of sleep
      efficiency, and 43.3% of the participants were determined with poor sleep quality
      (PSQI>5). The linear regression analysis indicated that the score of the Beck
      anxiety index was significantly associated with sleep quality (F = 44.85, p =
      .000, adjust R(2) = 49.4%). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that some women when 
      receiving early stage IVF treatments were anxious, depressed, and have sleep
      disturbance. Anxiety was significantly associated with sleep quality. It is
      suggested that medical care professional should understand these common issues
      when assisting women undergoing these complicated reproductive treatments.

AB  - While prolactin is most well known for its role in lactation and suppression of
      reproduction, its physiological functions are quite diverse. There are many
      etiologies of hyperprolactinemia, including physiologic as well as pathologic
      causes. Physiologic causes include pregnancy, lactation, sleep-associated, nipple
      stimulation and sexual orgasm, chest wall stimulation, or trauma. Stress is also 
      an important physiologic cause of hyperprolactinemia, and its clinical
      significance is still being explored. This review will provide an overview of
      prolactin physiology, the role of stress in prolactin secretion, as well as the
      general clinical approach to hyperprolactinemia.

TI  - Risk factors for delayed social-emotional development and behavior problems at
      age two: Results from the All Our Babies/Families (AOB/F) cohort.
PG  - e82
LID - 10.1002/hsr2.82 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: Social-emotional delays and behavioral problems at preschool
      age are associated with negative outcomes at school age, including ongoing
      behavior problems, poorer social functioning, and academic difficulties.
      Understanding modifiable risk factors for suboptimal development requires
      consideration of contemporary family circumstances to determine areas for
      effective early intervention to optimize development. This study aimed to
      identify risk factors for delayed social-emotional development and behavior
      problems at age two among participants of the All Our Babies/Families cohort
      study. Methods: Mothers (N = 1596) completed five comprehensive questionnaires
      spanning midpregnancy to 2 years postpartum. At child age two, behavior and
      competence outcomes were measured using the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and
      Emotional Assessment. Chi square analysis and multivariable logistic regression
      modeling was used to identify key risk factors for suboptimal child outcomes.
      Predicted probabilities for adverse outcomes in the presence of risk were
      calculated. Results: Risk factors for possible delayed social-emotional
      development in children included maternal depression at 2 years postpartum (OR
      2.46, 95% CI 1.63, 3.72), lower parenting self-efficacy at 2 years postpartum (OR
      2.76, 95% CI 1.51, 5.06), non-daily play-based interaction when child was 1 and 2
      years old (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02, 1.99), child delayed sleep initiation at 2 years
      of age (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05, 2.37), and playgroup non-attendance between 1 and 2
      years postpartum (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03, 1.99). Risk factors for possible behavior
      problems included lower maternal optimism during pregnancy (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.36,
      2.99), maternal depression at 2 years postpartum (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.46, 3.27),
      difficulty balancing responsibilities at 2 years postpartum (OR 2.32 95% CI 1.55,
      3.47), child second language exposure at 2 years of age (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.37,
      2.58), child delayed sleep initiation at 2 years of age (OR 1.55 95% CI 1.06,
      2.26), child frequent night wakings at 2 years of age (OR 2.95 95% CI 2.13,
      4.10), and more screentime exposure at 2 years of age (OR 1.85 95% CI 1.34,
      2.54). Conclusions: This study suggests that addressing maternal mental health
      and promoting parenting strategies that encourage play-based interaction,
      limiting screen time, preventing sleep problems, and engagement in informal
      playgroups would reduce the risk of behavior and social-emotional problems.

TI  - The fetal circadian rhythm in pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes 
      is altered by maternal glycemic control and the morning cortisol concentration.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - Circadian rhythmicity is fundamental to human physiology, and is present even
      during fetal life in normal pregnancies. The impact of maternal endocrine disease
      on the fetal circadian rhythm is not well understood. The present study aimed to 
      determine the fetal circadian rhythm in pregnancies complicated by pregestational
      diabetes mellitus (PGDM), compare it with a low-risk reference population, and
      identify the effects of maternal glycemic control and morning cortisol
      concentrations. Long-term fetal electrocardiogram recordings were made in 40
      women with PGDM at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Two recordings were made in 18
      of the women (45.0%) and one recording was made in 22 (55.0%). The mean fetal
      heart rate (fHR) and the fHR variation (root mean square of squared differences) 
      were extracted in 1-min epochs, and circadian rhythmicity was detected by cosinor
      analysis. The study cohort was divided based on HbA1c levels and morning cortisol
      concentrations. Statistically, significant circadian rhythms in the fHR and the
      fHR variation were found in 45 (100%) and 44 (95.7%) of the 45 acceptable PGDM
      recordings, respectively. The rhythms were similar to those of the reference
      population. However, there was no statistically significant population-mean
      rhythm in the fHR among PGDM pregnancies at 36 weeks, indicating an increased
      interindividual variation. The group with higher HbA1c levels (>6.0%) had no
      significant population-mean fHR rhythm at 28 or 36 weeks, and no significant
      fHR-variation rhythm at 36 weeks. Similarly, the group with a lower morning
      cortisol concentration (</=8.8 microg/dl) had no significant population-mean
      fHR-variation rhythm at 28 and 36 weeks. These findings indicate that individual 
      fetal rhythmicity is present in pregnancies complicated by PGDM. However,
      suboptimal maternal glycemic control and a lower maternal morning cortisol
      concentration are associated with a less-well-synchronized circadian system of
      the fetus.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for restless legs syndrome during pregnancy in a
      Northern Italian population.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2018.1525341 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the frequency and the risk 
      factors for restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy in an Italian
      population rarely studied, in epidemiological studies on the syndrome. A total of
      648 women (median age: 35 years; interquartile range: 32-38), who delivered on
      randomly selected days at the obstetric department of our hospital, were
      identified. One hundred and thirty-two women (20.4%, 95% confidence interval
      (CI): 17.3-23.5) met the criteria for a diagnosis of RLS. The odds ratio (OR) of 
      RLS was, in comparison with women aged <35 years, 1.69 (95% CI 1.14-2.51) in
      women aged >/=35 years. Subjective insufficient sleep (OR: 2.35, 95% CI
      1.27-4.35) and difficulty in initiating sleep (OR: 1.73, 95% CI 1.15-2.63)
      increased the risk of RLS. This study confirms the high frequency of RLS in
      pregnant women. The risk of the condition was increased in women aged >/=35 years
      and in the women reporting sleep-wake disturbances during pregnancy. Impact
      statement What is already known on this subject? Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a 
      common neurological, sensorimotor disorder, is two/three times more frequent in
      pregnant women than in the general population. The prevalence of RLS during
      pregnancy ranges widely, showing differences among populations. What do the
      results of this study add? This study adds data about the frequency and the risk 
      factors for RLS during pregnancy in a Northern Italian population, rarely
      considered in epidemiological studies on the syndrome. Older age and sleep-wake
      disturbances are the main factors associated with the condition. What are the
      implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?
      Screening for RLS might be useful for pregnant women to manage the condition.
      Further research is needed to investigate and define the potential impact of RLS 
      during pregnancy on foetal and maternal health.

AB  - Early life nutritional imbalances are risk factors for metabolic dysfunctions in 
      adulthood, but the long term effects of perinatal exposure to high versus low
      protein diets are not completely understood. We exposed C57BL/6J offspring to a
      high protein/low carbohydrate (HP/LC) or low protein/high carbohydrate (LP/HC)
      diet during gestation and lactation, and measured metabolic phenotypes between
      birth and 10 months of age in male offspring. Perinatal HP/LC and LP/HC exposures
      resulted in a decreased ability to clear glucose in the offspring, with reduced
      baseline insulin and glucose concentrations in the LP/HC group and a reduced
      insulin response post-glucose challenge in the HP/LC group. The LP/HC diet group 
      also showed reduced birth and weanling weights, whereas the HP/LC offspring
      displayed increased weanling weight with increased adiposity beyond 5 months of
      age. Gene expression profiling of hypothalamus and liver revealed alterations in 
      diverse molecular pathways by both diets. Specifically, hypothalamic
      transcriptome and pathway analyses demonstrated perturbations of MAPK and
      hedgehog signaling, processes associated with neural restructuring and
      transmission, and phosphate metabolism by perinatal protein imbalances. Liver
      transcriptomics revealed changes in purine and phosphate metabolism, hedgehog
      signaling, and circadian rhythm pathways. Our results indicate maternal protein
      imbalances perturbing molecular pathways in central and peripheral metabolic
      tissues, thereby predisposing the male offspring to metabolic dysfunctions.

TI  - Restless Legs Syndrome in Pregnant Thai Women: Prevalence, Predictive Factors,
      and Natural Course.
PG  - 97-101
LID - 10.3988/jcn.2019.15.1.97 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep-related
      neurological disorder that affects the quality of sleep. This study aimed to
      estimate the prevalence, predictive factors, and natural course of RLS, and its
      effect on sleep quality in pregnant Thai women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study 
      that included 214 pregnant women was performed. RLS was diagnosed according to
      the revised criteria of the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG). General
      demographic and antenatal-care data were reviewed. Scores on the Thai versions of
      the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the
      IRLSSG Rating Scale were determined. RESULTS: RLS was diagnosed in 24 of the
      pregnant women (11.2%): 4.2%, 25.0%, and 70.8% in the first, second, and third
      trimesters, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a
      hemoglobin level (Hb) less than 11 g/dL [odds ratio (OR)=3.21, 95% CI=1.27-8.13] 
      and a history of RLS (OR=16.62, 95% CI=1.52-181.32) were associated with RLS
      during pregnancy. Subjects with RLS significantly had higher Thai-ESS scores
      (p<0.01). All subjects with RLS had severe symptoms that subsided within 1 week
      after delivery. No immediate labor complication was associated with RLS.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study has confirmed a high prevalence of RLS and its impacts on 
      sleep in pregnant women. An Hb of less than 11 g/dL and a history of RLS are
      predictive factors for RLS developing during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related RLS has
      a benign course and usually disappears within 1 week after delivery.

TI  - Content to share with expectant fathers: Views of professionals focused on father
      involvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there is a consensus on what guidance to share with
      expectant fathers from the prenatal through early infancy period among a
      multidisciplinary group of professionals with expertise on father involvement.
      DESIGN: Consensus-building approach using mixed methods involving two rounds of
      data collection. In Round 1, participants were requested to individually generate
      content as text messages to share with expectant fathers that a father should
      know or do for his infant, his partner, and himself starting prenatally and
      through early infancy. A content analysis of Round 1 data was conducted to
      identify domain content to share with fathers. During Round 2, experts were asked
      to rate their perceived level of importance of the content generated in Round 1. 
      Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means, and standard deviations
      were calculated for Round 2. SETTING: Electronic survey. PARTICIPANTS: Nine
      multidisciplinary professionals with expertise on father involvement,
      representing psychology, pediatrics, nursing/midwifery, and sociology.
      MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: During Round 1, participants individually generated
      302 message content items across domains in the following contexts: plan
      for/participate in birth (n=71); his infant (n=95); his partner (n=107); and
      himself (n=38). During Round 2, participants achieved greatest consensus in more 
      content items in two contexts: infant support and partner support. For infant
      support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with
      for fathers included: knowledge about signs of infant illness, feeding, sleep
      patterns, and impact of second hand smoke/drug use; training on providing newborn
      care; and taking action including participating in infant care, providing verbal 
      stimulation, engaging in age-appropriate play and physical contact, supporting
      safe sleep, and making/attending doctor appointments. For partner support,
      content domains that participants perceived it important to share with fathers
      included: communicating with partners with regular check-ins, and about parenting
      styles and shared responsibilities, signs/symptoms of maternal depression, and
      hopes/dreams for infant; and taking actions to support partner's physical and
      emotional health and breastfeeding. Although less content was generated in the
      other two contexts - plan for/participate in birth and father support -
      participants achieved consensus on some content in these domains as being
      important to share with fathers. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Despite lack of professional
      guidelines for expectant fathers, experts generally agreed on the content that
      should be shared with expectant fathers from pregnancy through early infancy,
      especially in the domains of infant support and partner support. IMPLICATIONS FOR
      PRACTICE: This study can assist clinicians and practitioners on guidance to share
      with expectant fathers during their partner's pregnancy and the early postnatal
      period. Dissemination of such guidance to fathers can assist in benefiting all
      members of the family.

PG  - 295-303
LID - 10.1002/oby.22364 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to examine associations of
      objectively measured sleep duration with weight changes in black and Hispanic
      mothers over the first postpartum year. METHODS: Data were from 159 mothers (69% 
      black, 32% Hispanic). Nocturnal sleep duration was assessed using wrist
      actigraphy at 6 weeks and 5 months post partum, examined as a continuous variable
      and in categories (< 7 vs. >/= 7 hours/night, consistent with American Academy of
      Sleep Medicine recommendations). Body weights were abstracted from medical
      records in pregnancy and measured at 6 weeks, 5 months, and 12 months post
      partum. Outcomes included early postpartum (6 weeks to 5 months) and late
      postpartum (5 to 12 months) weight changes. RESULTS: The majority of participants
      slept < 7 hours/night at 6 weeks (75%) and 5 months (63%) post partum. Early
      postpartum weight change did not differ by 6-week sleep duration category. By
      contrast, adjusted average late postpartum weight gain (SE) was 1.8 (0.7) kg
      higher in participants sleeping < 7 hours/night at 5 months post partum compared 
      with those sleeping >/= 7 hours/night (P = 0.02). Results did not show
      statistically significant associations of continuous measures of sleep duration, 
      nor of measures of sleep quality, with postpartum weight changes. CONCLUSIONS:
      Sleeping < 7 hours/night was associated with late postpartum weight gain in
      minority mothers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to follow up on the reporting of neurodevelopmental
      disorders in children exposed in utero to Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG). This was
      an exploratory descriptive study whereby neurodevelopmental outcomes of 267
      children delivered by 177 mothers with HG were compared to neurodevelopmental
      outcomes from 93 children delivered by 60 unaffected mothers. Similar to at age
      8, the children (now 12) exposed in utero to HG had over 3-fold increase in odds 
      of neurodevelopmental disorders including attention, anxiety, sensory, sleep
      difficulty, and social development delay/social anxiety. However, with the longer
      follow-up, there was also a significant increase in Autism Spectrum Disorder
      (ASD), reported in 22/267 (8%) of children exposed to HG in utero and no
      unexposed children. As early intervention for ASD can be critical to prognosis,
      larger studies are urgently needed to determine whether ASD is associated with
      exposure to HG.

      and maternal holter monitoring data were analyzed. All cases were singleton
      pregnancy, cephalic position and had normal perinatal outcome. They were divided 
      into three groups based on gestational age, 29 cases (22.3%,29/130) in pregnancy 
      28-33(+6) weeks, 37 cases (28.5%,37/130) in 34-36(+6) weeks, and 64 cases (49.2%,
      64/130) in 37-40(+6) weeks. Fetal heart baseline (FHB) , fetal heart baseline
      variation (FHBV) , fetal heart rate acceleration area and maternal heart rate
      were acquired by computer, their diurnal rhythms and the differences among three 
      groups were analyzed. Results: FHBFHBVfetal heart rate acceleration area and
      maternal heart rate all presented diurnal rhythms. (1) FHB rose in daytime and
      decreased at night with the minimum value at 2:00-5:00, and didn't decline
      further at night with the advancing of gestational age (P=0.548). (2) FHBV was
      similar to FHB, which rose in daytime and decreased at night, but declined
      smaller at night with the advancing of gestational age, especially after 37 weeks
      (P<0.01). (3) Fetal heart rate acceleration area reduced in daytime and enlarged 
      at night, and enlarged more with the advancing of gestational age. (4) The
      diurnal rhythm of maternal heart rate was consistent with fetal heart rate. FHB
      lagged behind maternal heart rate for 1-2 hours when declining to the nocturnal
      nadir but been basically in sync with maternal heart rate when recovered.
      Conclusion: The basic characteristics of fetal heart rate in normal pregnancy
      exist obviously diurnal rhythms, and change in different trends with the
      advancing of gestational age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronotype is a construct contributing to individual differences in
      sleep-wake timing. Previous studies with children have found that evening-types
      exhibit greater sleep difficulties. Infant sleep quality can be modulated by
      several factors, such as parental characteristics. We examined the association
      between parental circadian preference and sleep in early childhood. METHODS: This
      study was based on a longitudinal birth cohort, with several measurement points. 
      We used information regarding parental questionnaires during pregnancy and
      children's sleep measures at three, eight, 18 and 24 months. In total, 1220
      mothers, 1116 fathers, 993 infants at three months, 990 infants at eight months, 
      958 children at 18 months, and 777 children at 24 months were analyzed. Parental 
      circadian preference was measured using the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness
      Questionnaire. Concerning children's sleep, we used the Brief Infant Sleep
      Questionnaire (BISQ) and the Infant Sleep Questionnaire (ISQ) at each time point.
      RESULTS: Maternal circadian preference was associated with infants' circadian
      rhythm development at three, eight, 18 and 24 months. Furthermore, increased
      maternal eveningness was also related to short sleep during daytime at three
      months, and nighttime at three and eight months, to long sleep-onset latency at
      three, 18 and 24 months, to late bedtime at three, eight and 18 months, and to
      sleep difficulties at eight and 24 months. Paternal circadian preference was not 
      associated with any sleep variable at any time point. CONCLUSION: Maternal
      circadian preference is related to several sleep difficulties in early childhood,
      and it may be considered a potential risk factor for the onset of early sleeping 
      problems.

TI  - Effect of Obstetric Fine Nursing on Pain during Natural Childbirth and Postpartum
      Recovery.
PG  - 1703-1708
AB  - Background: This study aimed to observe the effect of fine nursing on pain and
      postpartum recovery during natural delivery of pregnant women. Methods: The
      clinical data of 192 primiparas who were expecting labor in Nanfang Hospital,
      Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China from 2015-2016 were retrospectively
      analyzed. Among them, 100 cases were treated with fine nursing before and after
      delivery, and 92 cases were treated with routine nursing. The pain rate, the
      second stage of labor, the amount of bleeding 2 hours postpartum, and postpartum 
      recovery were compared between the two groups. Results: The number of cases of
      grade 0 and 1 pain and the good rate of pain were significantly higher in the
      observation group than in the control group, the number of cases with grade 2
      pain in the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control
      group (P<0.01). The second stage of labor and the 2h postpartum hemorrhage in the
      observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group
      (P<0.001). The number of maternal cases with good postpartum sleep, good
      lactation and good mental health in the observation group was significantly
      higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Fine nursing before
      and after delivery can reduce maternal pain rate, shorten the second stage of
      labor, reduce the amount of bleeding after 2 hours postpartum, promote good
      sleep, lactation, psychological conditions, reduce postpartum infection rate,
      which is conducive to maternal body recovery, worthy of clinical promotion.

TI  - Reasons for Late-Night Eating and Willingness to Change:A Qualitative Study in
      Pregnant Black Women.
LID - S1499-4046(18)30862-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jneb.2018.11.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-night eating during pregnancy is associated with greater risk for
      gestational diabetes. The purposes of this study were to describe reasons why
      women engage in late-night eating and to understand perceptions about changing
      this behavior. DESIGN: Focus groups using a semistructured interview script.
      SETTING: Urban university-affiliated obstetric clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Low-income
      black women (n=18) with overweight/obesity at entry to prenatal care. PHENOMENON 
      OF INTEREST: Late-night eating. ANALYSIS: Exhaustive approach coding responses to
      specific questions. RESULTS: Individual and interpersonal contributors to
      late-night eating included hunger, altered sleep patterns, fetal movement, and
      the influence of others. Food choices were largely driven by taste and
      convenience. Some women reported that they could alter nightly eating patterns,
      whereas others would consider changing only if late-night eating were associated 
      with a severe illness or disability for the child. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: 
      There was considerable heterogeneity among the participants of this study
      regarding reasons for late-night eating during pregnancy and attitudes toward
      changing this behavior. Although the themes identified from this study cannot be 
      generalized, they may be useful to inform future studies. Future research might
      develop strategies to overcome individual and social factors that contribute to
      late-night eating during pregnancy.

PG  - 186-191
LID - 10.1177/1753495X18780095 [doi]
AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with pregnancy complications
      including gestational diabetes. Mechanisms underlying the association between
      obstructive sleep apnea and gestational diabetes remain to be elucidated.
      Methods: Twenty-three participants with gestational diabetes underwent home sleep
      apnea testing. Obstructive sleep apnea was defined as an apnea hypopnea index >
      5. Fasting morning blood samples were measured using multianalyte profiling
      (xMAP) multiplexed bead array immunoassay for Interleukin 6, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, and Interleukin 8. Results: Age, body mass index, and gestational
      age at enrollment were 31 + 4.4 years, 35.7 + 7.4 kg/m(2), and 28 +/- 4 weeks,
      respectively. Participants were 52% Caucasian and 16% had obstructive sleep
      apnea. We observed positive correlations between apnea hypopnea index and
      Interleukin 6 (r = 0.62, p = 0.005), Interleukin 8 (r = 0.56, p = .56), and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (r = .58, p = .009). Women with obstructive sleep apnea had
      higher levels of Interleukin 6 (F = 5.01, p = .037) and Interleukin 8 (F = 6.33, 
      p = .021) vs. women without obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusion: These
      preliminary results indicate that in women with gestational diabetes, apnea
      hypopnea index is associated with an elevated inflammatory profile.

PG  - 91
LID - 10.1186/s12940-018-0436-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Naphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). It
      is easily emitted into the atmosphere, posing a significant risk to human health.
      However, limited studies have described the impact of naphthalene exposure on
      birth outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between the
      maternal urinary metabolites of naphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-OH NAP), and
      birth outcomes. METHOD: In the present study, four urinary PAH metabolites were
      measured in 263 pregnant women during late pregnancy. Multiple linear regression 
      analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the concentrations of 2-OH 
      NAP and birth outcomes, and restricted cubic spline models were further used to
      examine the shapes of the dose-response association. RESULT: General linear
      models showed that prenatal urinary 2-OH NAP was associated with lower birth
      weight (BW) (- 4.38% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend
      = 0.049) and higher cephalization index (CI) (4.30% for the high vs. low exposure
      group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.038). These associations were linear and
      significant when 2-OH NAP was modeled as a continuous variable in restricted
      cubic spline models (P linear = 0.0293 for 2-OH NAP and BW; P linear = 0.0326 for
      2-OH NAP and CI). Multiple linear regression data indicated that each 1 ln-unit
      increase in 2-OH NAP was significantly associated with a 2.09 g/cm increase in
      the CI. The associations among 2-OH NAP, BW, and CI were also observed in a
      subset of participants residing close to arterial traffic. CONCLUSION: Our data
      indicated that prenatal exposure to naphthalene had an adverse effect on fetal
      birth outcomes, especially the brain development index. Reduced exposure to
      naphthalene may improve newborn health outcomes. In Taiyuan, naphthalene may
      result from traffic pollution.

AB  - Motivation: Multiple biological clocks govern a healthy pregnancy. These
      biological mechanisms produce immunologic, metabolomic, proteomic, genomic and
      microbiomic adaptations during the course of pregnancy. Modeling the chronology
      of these adaptations during full-term pregnancy provides the frameworks for
      future studies examining deviations implicated in pregnancy-related pathologies
      including preterm birth and preeclampsia. Results: We performed a multiomics
      analysis of 51 samples from 17 pregnant women, delivering at term. The datasets
      included measurements from the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome and 
      metabolome of samples obtained simultaneously from the same patients.
      Multivariate predictive modeling using the Elastic Net (EN) algorithm was used to
      measure the ability of each dataset to predict gestational age. Using stacked
      generalization, these datasets were combined into a single model. This model not 
      only significantly increased predictive power by combining all datasets, but also
      revealed novel interactions between different biological modalities. Future work 
      includes expansion of the cohort to preterm-enriched populations and in vivo
      analysis of immune-modulating interventions based on the mechanisms identified.

AB  - Objective: To observe the pre-Ramadan health seeking behavior, fasting trends,
      eating pattern and, sleep cycle in pregnant women. Methods: It is a
      cross-sectional observational study, from July to September 2017, conducted at
      Tertiary Care Hospital in Karachi. The tool used for data collection was
      interviewer based closed ended questionnaire, 279 pregnant women who fasted
      during Ramadan were included in the study. Results: One to ten days of fasting
      was observed by 85.7% (198) of women. About 72.4% (202) never consulted any
      doctor for pre-Ramadan advice regarding fasting in pregnancy. Pregnant women
      81.7% (228) believed that fasting would not cause any harm to their unborn child,
      while 42.7% (119) of family members feared about the health of mother and unborn 
      child. Seventy four percent (208) of respondents had a reduced sleep cycle of
      about 3-4 hours. The food items consumed at Sehri and Iftar were rich in
      carbohydrates and fats. Conclusions: Pre-Ramadan medical consultation regarding
      safety of fasting during pregnancy should be structured and customized for women 
      and their families. Gaps in knowledge identified in this study may help
      healthcare professionals to address these issues.

TI  - Trajectories of sleep quality from late pregnancy to 36 months postpartum and
      association with maternal mood disturbances: a longitudinal and prospective
      cohort study.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsy179 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: To examine trajectories of poor sleep quality from late
      pregnancy to 36 months postpartum, baseline indicators, and association with
      prospective maternal mood disturbances. Methods: A cohort of 262 nonclinical
      women was followed at late pregnancy, 42 days, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months
      postpartum. Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at
      all time points, and mood disturbances were assessed at late pregnancy and 36
      months postpartum. Results: The rate of poor sleep quality followed an inverted
      U-shaped curve. Women reporting poor sleep quality at late pregnancy held a
      consistently higher risk of poor sleep quality at postpartum points. Three sleep 
      trajectories were distinguished, namely, the stable-low (29.4%), the
      decreasing-mild (56.5%), and the stable-high (14.1%). Poor sleep quality,
      depression, and anxiety at baseline were linked to trajectory groups with poorer 
      sleep quality. Adjusting for covariates, the trajectory of the poorer sleep
      quality group demonstrated increased mood disturbances at 36 months postpartum.
      Replicating the analyses in women without baseline symptoms of depression and
      anxiety above clinical cutoffs obtained similar results. Conclusions: Women are
      vulnerable to poor sleep quality from late pregnancy to postpartum years, but
      follow distinct trajectories. Poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety at late
      pregnancy help us to anticipate the sleep trajectories. Trajectories of poor
      sleep quality indicate increased mood disturbances at 36 months postpartum. A
      flexible suite of interventions targeting both poor sleep quality and mood
      disturbances should be implemented and tailored to women in the prenatal and
      postpartum periods.

AB  - ObjectivesThis study aimed to separately ascertain and examine the association
      between sleep and mental health among primiparas and multiparas at one month
      postpartum.MethodsThe subjects were 234 primiparas and 223 multiparas (a total of
      457) at one month postpartum who agreed to participate in the questionnaire
      survey during a health check-up at a maternity hospital. According to the
      delivery records, they had no history of mental diseases. The survey items of the
      questionnaire concerned living environment, sleep status, subjective mental
      health (depressive mood, anxiety, low motivation, irritability) and sleep-related
      lifestyle. At first, we compared these items between primiparas and multiparas.
      Next, multiple regression analysis by a general linear model was used to
      investigate the association between sleep status and mental health. The dependent
      variables were sleep satisfaction, total sleep time, the existence of sleep
      problems (difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up
      too early), irregularity of bedtime, and five kinds of sleep-related lifestyle.
      The independent variables were the four mental health indices according to a
      visual analog scale.ResultsIn primiparas, total sleep time was shorter, bedtime
      and sleeping time were later, two kinds of sleep-related lifestyle were worse,
      and the symptoms of tinnitus and tired feeling were higher than in multiparas. In
      multiparas, sleep onset latency was longer, the number of times of night
      awakening was higher, irritability was stronger, and the prevalence of headache
      was higher than in primiparas. Sleep satisfaction was related to all four indices
      of mental health for both primiparas and multiparas. In primiparas, the existence
      of sleep problems was related to depressive mood and anxiety, and the
      irregularity of bedtime was related to anxiety. "Getting up immediately after
      awakening" was related to irritability, as well as low motivation, in multiparas.
      "A nap shorter than 30 minutes before 3 PM" was related to anxiety and low
      motivation in primiparas. The irregularity of bedtime was negatively related to
      anxiety, low motivation, and irritability in multiparas.ConclusionIt is suggested
      that sleep problems, which tend to be overlooked, are related to subjective
      mental health at one month postpartum. Thus, we conclude that sleep education
      during pregnancy and sleep evaluations at postpartum check-ups are necessary for 
      postpartum women's mental health.

TI  - Association of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes With Self-Reported Measures of Sleep
      Duration and Timing in Women Who Are Nulliparous.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship of self-reported sleep during
      pregnancy with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A secondary objective was to describe 
      the concordance between self-reported and objectively assessed sleep during
      pregnancy. METHODS: In this prospective cohort, women completed a survey of sleep
      patterns at 6 to 13 weeks' gestation (visit 1) and again at 22 to 29 weeks'
      gestation (visit 3). Additionally, at 16 to 21 weeks (visit 2), a subgroup
      completed a week-long sleep diary coincident with an actigraphy recording. Weekly
      averages of self-reported sleep duration and sleep midpoint were calculated. A
      priori, sleep duration < 7 hours was defined as "short," and sleep midpoint after
      5:00 AM was defined as "late." The relationship of these sleep abnormalities with
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
      was determined. RESULTS: Of the 10,038 women enrolled, sleep survey data were
      available for 7,524 women at visit 1 and 7,668 women at visit 3. A total of 752
      women also provided >/= 5 days of sleep diary data coincident with actigraphy at 
      visit 2. We did not observe any consistent relationship between self-reported
      short sleep and HDP or GDM. There was an association between self-reported late
      sleep midpoint and GDM (visit 1 adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval
      1.17, 2.38; visit 2 adjusted odds ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.23,
      2.43). At visit 2, 77.1% of participants had concordance between their diary and 
      actigraphy for short sleep duration, whereas 94.3% were concordant for sleep
      midpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported sleep midpoint, which is more accurate than 
      self-reported sleep duration, is associated with the risk of GDM. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Evaluating Transfer of Modafinil Into Human Milk During Lactation: A Case Report.
PG  - 2087-2089
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.7546 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: We present a case of a 27-year-old woman in whom idiopathic
      hypersomnolence was diagnosed in adolescence with adequate symptomatic control on
      daily dosage of 250 mg of modafinil. She maintained this dosage throughout her
      pregnancy and during the peripartum period, but did not breastfeed her newborn
      because of a lack of information on the transmission of modafinil in human breast
      milk. Samples of her breast milk were obtained at various times over a 24-hour
      period and analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The relative
      infant dose was calculated to be 5.3%, below the threshold of concern for drug
      passage via breast milk. This is the first reported case of modafinil transfer
      into human breast milk. Given the drug's use in a variety of sleep disorders, the
      results of this case can be used to advise breastfeeding mothers prescribed
      modafinil.

TI  - A Pilot Randomized-Controlled Trial on the Effect of CPAP Treatment on Glycemic
      Control in Gestational Diabetes: Study Design and Methods.
PG  - 659
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2018.00659 [doi]
AB  - Background: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with adverse short- and
      long-term maternal and fetal outcomes. Observational data support a link between 
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy and GDM. However, it is unknown
      whether treatment of SDB with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves
      glucose control in this patient population. In addition, CPAP adherence and
      feasibility as a treatment option in pregnancy is unknown. This pilot randomized,
      controlled trial aims to primarily determine the feasibility of CPAP treatment in
      pregnant women with SDB and GDM. This study is also investigating the effect of
      SDB treatment on 24-h glucose profiles as an exploratory outcome. Objectives: To 
      describe the study methodology in this ongoing study of pregnant women with GDM
      and SDB. Patients and Methods: Pregnant women with GDM and SDB defined by
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >/=10 (Chicago Scoring Criteria) on level 2
      polysomnography are randomized to either auto titrating CPAP (experimental group)
      or a nasal dilator strip (control group) until delivery. The primary outcome,
      objectively-assessed adherence to CPAP, is measured over the course of the
      treatment period using device-specific software. Recruitment and retention rates 
      will be calculated to assess the feasibility for planning future trials.
      Twenty-four hour glucose profiles are measured over a 72-h period using the
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, before and after the intervention.
      Conclusion: The results of this study will be highly informative to determine
      whether CPAP is a feasible treatment for pregnant women with GDM and SDB, a
      specialized population at risk for substantial comorbidity. The trial results
      will ultimately be useful in planning future SDB treatment trials in pregnancy
      and GDM. The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02245659).

TI  - Developmental trajectory of movement-related cortical oscillations during active 
      sleep in a cross-sectional cohort of pre-term and full-term human infants.
PG  - 17516
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-35850-1 [doi]
AB  - In neonatal animal models, isolated limb movements during active sleep provide
      input to immature somatomotor cortex necessary for its development and are
      somatotopically encoded by alpha-beta oscillations as late as the equivalent of
      human full-term. Limb movements elicit similar neural patterns in very pre-term
      human infants (average 30 corrected gestational weeks), suggesting an analogous
      role in humans, but it is unknown until when they subserve this function. In a
      cohort of 19 neonates (31-42 corrected gestational weeks) we showed that isolated
      hand movements during active sleep continue to induce these same somatotopically 
      distributed oscillations well into the perinatal period, but that these
      oscillations decline towards full-term and fully disappear at 41 corrected
      gestational weeks (equivalent to the end of gestation). We also showed that these
      highly localised alpha-beta oscillations are associated with an increase in delta
      oscillations which extends to the frontal area and does not decline with age.
      These results suggest that isolated limb movements during active sleep could have
      an important role in experience-dependent somatomotor development up until normal
      birth in humans.

AB  - Chronotype, or morningness/eveningness, has been associated with adjustment in
      both children and adolescents. Specifically, eveningness has been linked to
      adjustment difficulties; however, the mechanism underlying this association is
      poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to test whether the associations
      between eveningness and adjustment difficulties could be explained by an
      unfavorable impact of eveningness on sleep. Links from chronotype to
      internalizing problems and problem behaviors via sleep quantity and sleep
      problems were tested in a sample from the European Longitudinal Study of
      Pregnancy and Childhood (N = 3485; 48.8% female), both when the participants were
      children (7 years at T1, 11 at T2) and when they were adolescents (15 years at
      T1, 18 at T2). The findings provided evidence that eveningness predicted greater 
      sleep problems and lower sleep quantity; however, only sleep problems predicted
      internalizing problems and problem behaviors. Sleep quantity did not mediate the 
      eveningness-adjustment link, and sleep problems did so only in children. The
      findings show that sleep problems appear to be more important in explaining the
      eveningness-adjustment link rather than altered sleep quantity, commonly
      associated with eveningness.

TI  - Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem
      disorder that affects skeletal and smooth muscle as well as the eye, heart,
      endocrine system, and central nervous system. The clinical findings, which span a
      continuum from mild to severe, have been categorized into three somewhat
      overlapping phenotypes: mild, classic, and congenital. Mild DM1 is characterized 
      by cataract and mild myotonia (sustained muscle contraction); life span is
      normal. Classic DM1 is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia,
      cataract, and often cardiac conduction abnormalities; adults may become
      physically disabled and may have a shortened life span. Congenital DM1 is
      characterized by hypotonia and severe generalized weakness at birth, often with
      respiratory insufficiency and early death; intellectual disability is common.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: DM1 is caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in
      the noncoding region of DMPK. The diagnosis of DM1 is suspected in individuals
      with characteristic muscle weakness and is confirmed by molecular genetic testing
      of DMPK. CTG repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal. Molecular genetic
      testing detects pathogenic variants in nearly 100% of affected individuals.
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Use of ankle-foot orthoses, wheelchairs,
      or other assistive devices; special education support for affected children;
      treatment of hypothyroidism; management of pain; consultation with a cardiologist
      for symptoms or ECG evidence of arrhythmia; removal of cataracts if vision is
      impaired; hormone replacement therapy for males with hypogonadism; surgical
      excision of pilomatrixoma and basal cell carcinomas. Prevention of secondary
      complications: Choice of induction agents, airway care, local anesthesia, and
      neuromuscular blockade to minimize complications during surgery; cardiac
      pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators may prevent
      life-threatening arrhythmias; continue physical activity and maintain appropriate
      weight. Surveillance: Annual ECG or 24-hour Holter monitoring; annual measurement
      of fasting serum glucose concentration and glycosylated hemoglobin concentration;
      ophthalmology examination every two years; attention to nutritional status;
      polysomnography for sleep disturbances. Agents/circumstances to avoid:
      Cholesterol-lowering medications (i.e., statins), which can cause muscle pain and
      weakness; the anesthetic agent vecuronium; succinylcholine, propofol, and
      doxorubicin; smoking; obesity; illicit drug use; excessive alcohol intake.
      Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for early diagnosis of
      relatives at risk to allow treatment of cardiac manifestations, diabetes
      mellitus, and cataracts. GENETIC COUNSELING: DM1 is inherited in an autosomal
      dominant manner. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of
      inheriting the expanded allele. Pathogenic alleles may expand in length during
      gametogenesis, resulting in the transmission of longer trinucleotide repeat
      alleles that may be associated with earlier onset and more severe disease than
      that observed in the parent. Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at
      increased risk when the diagnosis of DM1 has been confirmed by molecular genetic 
      testing in an affected family member.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea as a risk factor for preeclampsia-eclampsia.
LID - 10.1007/s11325-018-1758-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Preeclampsia-eclampsia remains one of the leading causes of maternal and
      perinatal morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence suggests that obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA), which has been linked to hypertension in the general
      population, may play role in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, including
      preeclampsia-eclampsia. However, little research has been conducted in Asia (no
      data in Thailand) on the effects of OSA on preeclampsia-eclampsia. We aimed to
      examine the association between OSA and preeclampsia-eclampsia among Thai
      pregnant women. METHODS: We conducted a large prospective cohort study among Thai
      pregnant women who were in the second trimester of singleton pregnancy. The
      Berlin Questionnaire was administered to evaluate the risk for OSA.
      Preeclampsia-eclampsia was diagnosed by standard clinical assessment.
      Multivariate models were applied in adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: 
      Enrolled were 1345 pregnant women. The overall prevalence of high risk for OSA
      was 10.1% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 8.5-11.7), and it was significantly
      associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index and score on the Perceived Stress
      Scale. An adjusted odds ratio (OR) for preeclampsia-eclampsia in women with high 
      risk for OSA was 2.72 (95% CI 1.33-5.57). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with high
      risk for OSA are at increased risks for preeclampsia-eclampsia compared to those 
      with low risk for OSA. Our results support a role for screening for OSA by BQ
      during antenatal care.

TI  - Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome Type 1
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 (SGBS1) is
      characterized by pre- and postnatal macrosomia; distinctive craniofacial features
      (including macrocephaly, coarse facial features, macrostomia, macroglossia, and
      palatal abnormalities); and commonly, mild to severe intellectual disability with
      or without structural brain anomalies. Other variable findings include
      supernumerary nipples, diastasis recti / umbilical hernia, congenital heart
      defects, diaphragmatic hernia, genitourinary defects, and gastrointestinal
      anomalies. Skeletal anomalies can include vertebral fusion, scoliosis, rib
      anomalies, and congenital hip dislocation. Hand anomalies can include large hands
      and postaxial polydactyly. Affected individuals are at increased risk for
      embryonal tumors, including Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, adrenal neuroblastoma,
      gonadoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and medulloblastoma. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      The diagnosis of SGBS1 is established in a male proband with suggestive findings 
      and/or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in GPC3, an intragenic or whole-gene
      deletion of GPC3 that may include part or all of GPC4, or a large multiexon
      duplication of GPC4 identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis is
      usually established in a female proband who has suggestive findings and a
      heterozygous pathogenic variant in GPC3, an intragenic or whole-gene deletion of 
      GPC3 that may include part or all of GPC4, or a large multiexon duplication of
      GPC4 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Prompt treatment of neonatal hypoglycemia and airway obstruction 
      resulting from micrognathia and glossoptosis. Treatment of cleft lip and/or cleft
      palate or macroglossia and related feeding difficulties, obstructive sleep apnea,
      ophthalmologic issues, hearing loss, heart defects, urogenital abnormalities,
      skeletal abnormalities, and seizures in a standard fashion by appropriate
      pediatric specialists. Speech therapy as needed. Neurodevelopmental assessment to
      determine the need for special education, occupational therapy, and/or physical
      therapy. Surveillance: Screening for Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma with
      abdominal ultrasound and serum AFP level every three months from time of
      diagnosis until age four years; renal ultrasound every three months from age four
      to seven years; no specific tumor screening protocol has been established for
      neuroblastoma, gonadoblastoma, or medulloblastoma. Annual (or as indicated)
      ophthalmologic and audiologic evaluations in childhood; sleep study if there are 
      concerns about sleep disturbance or sleep apnea; routine monitoring of renal
      function if renal anomalies are present; evaluation for scoliosis at least
      annually or during periods of rapid growth; monitoring of serum glucose level in 
      the neonatal period; monitoring of developmental progress at each visit through
      adolescence. Evaluation of relatives at-risk: It is appropriate to clarify the
      genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of 
      an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the GPC3 or GCP4
      pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those 
      who would benefit from preventive measures, such as tumor surveillance in males. 
      GENETIC COUNSELING: Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 is inherited in an
      X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a pathogenic variant, the
      chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who
      inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the
      pathogenic variant will be carriers, although due to X-chromosome inactivation,
      carrier females may have manifestations of SGBS1. Males with SGBS1 will pass the 
      pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier
      testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased
      risk are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been
      identified.

PG  - 455
LID - 10.1186/s12884-018-2087-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and
      emotional changes. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect
      the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both maternal and infant
      health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during 
      uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical 
      and psychological factors in developed countries. METHODS: A systematic review
      was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in PubMed,
      EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the
      data. Countries with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The
      quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of the STROBE criteria.
      RESULTS: In total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical
      component of QOL decreased throughout pregnancy, the mental component was stable 
      and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors associated with
      better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the
      absence of social and economic problems, having family and friends, doing
      physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic. Main
      factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction,
      complications before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting,
      epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months prior to conception, a
      history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression
      during pregnancy and sexual or domestic violence. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related
      quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the
      physical, mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of
      life of pregnant women requires better identification of their difficulties and
      guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.

LID - 10.1089/jwh.2018.7204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and childrearing can impact women's health and alter
      chronic disease trajectories in later life, including cardiovascular disease. The
      purpose of this study was to assess measures of women's cardiovascular health by 
      time since last live birth. METHODS: Data were from 4,021 nonpregnant U.S. women,
      20-44 years of age, participating in the 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey (NHANES). Cardiovascular health was assessed using physical
      measures, laboratory measures, self-reported behaviors, medical conditions, and
      selected psychosocial factors by time since last live birth. RESULTS: Women
      reported their last live birth within the past 12 months ("mothers of infants";
      7.4%), >12 months, but <3 years ago ("mothers of toddlers"; 10.0%), or >/=3 years
      ago ("mothers of older children"; 45.2%); 37.3% were nulliparous. Compared with
      nulliparous women, mothers of older children had a higher prevalence of selected 
      cardiovascular risk factors, including unhealthy diet (75.6% vs. 68.8%) and
      smoking (28.1% vs. 21.9%), after adjustment for sociodemographics (including
      age). Mothers of toddlers had a higher prevalence of unhealthy diet (78.0% vs.
      68.8%). Mothers also had poorer metabolic health as indicated by a higher
      prevalence of low HDL cholesterol among mothers of toddlers and older children
      (44.2% and 40.4%, respectively, vs. 33.6%), and a higher prevalence of high waist
      circumference among mothers of infants (65.6% vs. 53.8%). Some mothers also had a
      higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, including low physical
      activity and poor sleep. CONCLUSION: Prior pregnancy and childrearing may be
      associated with selected cardiovascular risk factors among nonpregnant
      reproductive-aged U.S. women.

TI  - Infertility Treatments and Long-Term Neurologic Morbidity of the Offspring.
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1675159 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of long-term neurologic morbidity among children
      (up to 18 years) born following in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation
      induction (OI) treatments as compared with spontaneously conceived. STUDY DESIGN:
      A population-based cohort analysis was performed, including data from the
      perinatal computerized database on all singleton infants born at the Soroka
      University Medical Center (SUMC) between the years 1991 and 2014. This perinatal 
      database was linked and cross-matched with the SUMC computerized dataset of all
      pediatric hospitalizations. RESULTS: Neurologic morbidity was significantly more 
      common in IVF (3.7%) and OI (4.1%) offspring as compared with those following
      spontaneous pregnancies (3.1%; p = 0.017). In particular, attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorders and headaches were more common in the OI group
      and sleep disorders in the IVF group, whereas autism and cerebral palsy were
      comparable between the groups. In the Weibull multivariable analysis, while
      controlling for maternal age, preterm delivery, birthweight centile, maternal
      diabetes, and hypertensive disorders, IVF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.71; p = 0.001), but not OI (adjusted HR: 1.17'
      95% CI: 0.92-1.48; p = 0.196), was noted as an independent risk factor for
      long-term pediatric neurologic morbidity. CONCLUSION: IVF offspring appear to be 
      at an increased risk of long-term neurologic morbidity up to 18 years of age.

AB  - This study sought to investigate the effects of subjectively-determined poor
      prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depression (PND), after adjusting for
      prenatal psychological distress and perceived stress. From March 2016 to December
      2017, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study using a convenience sample of
      228 perinatal women. The participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index (PSQI), the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during the third trimester (Time 1 or T1), and
      completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 1 months postpartum 
      (Time 2 or T2). Logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the
      associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depression. 
      The results showed that prenatal psychological distress (OR = 2.551, 95% CI =
      1.221 ~ 5.329, P = 0.013) and perceived stress (OR = 2.881, 95% CI = 1.398 ~
      5.938, P= 0.007) were the strongest predictors of PND. Independent of this, poor 
      subjective sleep quality (OR = 2.391, 95% CI = 1.072 ~ 5.556, P = 0.044) during
      pregnancy also predicted postnatal depressive symptoms. Treatment of
      psychological distress and perceived stress appears important for reducing the
      incidence of PND. Nonetheless, future studies might explore treatments to improve
      prenatal sleep quality.

      Difficulties: Associations With Parenting Stress.
PG  - 2103
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02103 [doi]
AB  - In the literature, increasing evidence is showing the importance of sleep
      difficulties in the development or maintenance of posttraumatic stress (PTS)
      symptoms as well as the association between childbirth-related PTS symptoms and
      early maternal emotions and perceptions of their children. However, little is
      known regarding the effects of maternal sleep difficulties on parenting or about 
      the mediational role of childbirth-related PTS symptoms in this association. The 
      present study (pregnancy: T0; 1 month postpartum: T1; 3 months postpartum: T2)
      had two aims. The first one was to explore whether maternal sleep difficulties
      could contribute to the maintenance of PTS symptoms and whether PTS symptoms
      could contribute to the maintenance of maternal sleep difficulties. The second
      purpose was to explore, at 3 months (T2), the associations among
      childbirth-related PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and the three
      dimensions of parenting stress [parental distress (PD), parent-child
      dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child] by examining the mediational role
      of both maternal sleep difficulties and childbirth-related PTS symptoms.
      Self-report questionnaires were administered to 95 women at different times (T0, 
      T1, and T2). Mediational results confirmed the bidirectional effects between
      maternal sleep difficulties and PTS symptoms and their reciprocal role of
      maintenance of symptoms. Moreover, at 3 months postpartum (T2), sleep
      difficulties mediated the association between PTS symptoms and the three
      dimensions of maternal parenting stress, while PTS symptoms mediated the
      associations among maternal sleep difficulties, PD, and difficult child
      dimensions of parenting stress. The study contributes to the understanding of the
      maintenance factors of childbirth-related PTS symptoms and of the relationships
      among PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and parenting stress.

AB  - There are in France several millions of shift-workers and night-workers (20 to
      25% of employees). These workers are therefore subject to variations in their
      working and rest schedules. These regular schedule changes are associated with
      repeated desynchronization of circadian biological clock. The negative impacts on
      sleep are insomnia, drowsiness, and reduced sleep time in 24hours. There is also 
      a proven effect on the occurrence of a metabolic syndrome, with a likely effect
      on obesity, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure and coronary artery disease. There is
      a likely effect on the occurrence of cancer (including breast cancer). Night
      working is not recommended for pregnant women because of the risk of miscarriage,
      prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess if the effects of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on heart
      rate (HR) and HR variability, as a measure of autonomic control, were more severe
      in a group of children born preterm compared with a group of children born at
      term referred to our sleep laboratory for assessment of SDB. STUDY DESIGN:
      Children (3-12 years of age) referred for polysomnographic assessment of SDB were
      recruited; 50 born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and 50 at term, matched for
      age and SDB severity. The mean HR and HR variability using power spectral
      analysis were calculated for each child for wake and sleep, and stages N1, N2,
      N3, and rapid eye movement sleep. RESULTS: Ex-preterm children were born between 
      23 and 35 weeks of gestational age (29.3 +/- 3.6; mean +/- SEM). There were no
      differences in the demographic, sleep, or respiratory characteristics between the
      groups. High-frequency power (reflecting parasympathetic activity) was greater in
      the ex-preterm children in both N2 and N3 (P < .05 for both) and total power was 
      greater in N3 (P < .05). When the children were divided by SDB severity, these
      effects were most marked in those preterm born children with moderate to severe
      disease. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm born children matched for age and SDB severity with
      children born at term showed no differences in sleep characteristics; however,
      they did exhibit increased parasympathetic tone during non-rapid eye movement
      sleep.

AB  - Importance: Approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently
      active. Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make
      people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases.
      Objective: To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for
      Americans, 2nd edition (PAG). Process and Evidence Synthesis: The 2018 Physical
      Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the
      science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38
      questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and
      quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of
      the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the
      PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific
      Report. Recommendations: The PAG provides information and guidance on the types
      and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for
      multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be
      physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children 
      and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150
      minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes
      a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent
      combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should
      also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults
      should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well
      as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women
      should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week.
      Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the
      key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening
      activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will
      benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity
      benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. 
      Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and
      muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial. Conclusions and Relevance:
      The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information
      and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide
      substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should
      facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of
      physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and
      policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of
      the US population.

AB  - Sleep quality during pregnancy affects maternal/child health. We aimed to assess 
      changes in sleep quality during pregnancy and determine its relationship to
      maternal mood, blood glucose, and work schedule among primiparous women. We
      conducted a prospective/longitudinal/observational study. Ninety-two pregnant
      women were recruited from Midwestern hospital. Mood and sleep quality data were
      collected using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale/Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index at Gestational Weeks 22 and 32. Forty-three women completed the study.
      Twenty-six women (63%) were African American and the mean age was 23.64 ( SD =
      3.82) years. Rate of poor sleep quality increased during pregnancy with 25% of
      women had scores indicative of depression symptoms. Poor sleep quality score was 
      related to mood scores ( p < .05) and work schedule. Blood glucose was not
      significantly related to sleep duration. In conclusion, poor sleep quality during
      pregnancy was associated with poor mood and work schedule, suggesting that
      interventions targeting mental health and lifestyles are needed.

AB  - Study Objectives: Short and long sleep duration are linked to reduced kidney
      function, but little research has examined how sleep is associated with hydration
      status. Our aim was to assess the relationship between sleep duration and urinary
      hydration biomarkers among adults in a cross-cultural context. Methods: Three
      samples of adults aged 20y were analyzed: 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey (NHANES; n=4,680), 2009-2012 NHANES (n=9,559), and 2012
      cross-sectional wave of the Chinese Kailuan Study (n=11,903), excluding pregnant 
      women and adults with failing kidneys. We estimated multiple linear regression
      models between self-reported usual night-time sleep duration (<6, 6, 7, 8
      (reference), 9 hrs/day) and urine specific gravity (Usg) and urine osmolality
      (Uosm) as continuous variables and logistic regression models dichotomized as
      inadequate hydration (>1.020 g/ml; >831 mOsm/kg). In primary analyses, we
      estimated models excluding diabetes and diuretic medications for healthier
      sub-populations (NHANES n=11,353; Kailuan n=8,766). Results: In the healthier
      NHANES subset, 6 hours was associated with significantly higher Usg and odds of
      inadequate hydration (adjusted OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.03) compared to 8 hours.
      Regression results were mixed using Uosm, but in the same direction as Usg. Among
      Chinese adults, short sleep duration (<6 and 6 hours) was associated with Usg and
      higher likelihood of inadequate hydration (6 hours adjusted OR: 1.42, 95% CI:
      1.26, 1.60). No consistent association was found with sleeping >/=9 hours.
      Conclusions: Short sleep duration was associated with higher odds of inadequate
      hydration in US and Chinese adults relative to sleeping 8 hours.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the association between maternal bisphenol A exposure
      during early pregnancy and sleep problems among preschool children. Methods:
      Research subjects were from one of the sub-cohorts(Ma'anshan Cohort) of the
      China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS) in Ma'anshan city. The basic situation of
      pregnant women and sleep information of preschool children were investigated. We 
      selected preschool children whose mother's maternal serum bisphenol A
      concentrations of the first trimester had been already detected between December 
      2012 to Januray 2014. 1 259 pairs of mothers and children were included. The
      concentrations of bisphenol A exposure during early pregnancy were divided into
      low, medium and high exposure groups according to 25(th) percentile (P(25)) and
      75(th) percentile (P(75)) levels. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression
      model was used to analyze the association between maternal bisphenol A exposure
      during early pregnancy and sleep-related problems in preschool children. Results:
      The P(50) (P(25)-P(75)) of serum bisphenol A exposure level during early
      pregnancy was 0.231 (0.106-0.512) ng/ml. The sleep-related problems scores of 1
      259 preschool children were (16.43+/-3.82) points. The occasional sleep-related
      problems were detected about 47.8% (602 cases) and frequent sleep-related
      problems were detected about 18.3% (230 cases). After the adjustment of the
      confounding factors such as children's gender, age, BMI, sleep position (lying
      down, sleeping on one's back), the length of time to sleep and the length of
      sleep at night, in comparison with bisphenol A low exposure group, the OR (95%CI)
      value of preschool children with occasional sleep-related problems in maternal
      bisphenol A high exposure group during early pregnancy was 1.44 (1.01-2.06).
      After the gender stratification, the results showed that in comparison with
      bisphenol A low exposure group, the OR (95%CI) value of preschool girls with
      occasional sleep-related problems in maternal bisphenol A medium and high
      exposure group during early pregnancy were 1.61 (1.05-2.46) and 2.40 (1.42-4.04),
      respectively. The OR (95%CI) value of preschool girls with frequent sleep-related
      problems in maternal bisphenol A high exposure group during early pregnancy was
      2.64 (1.34-5.17). However, in boys, there was no statistically significant
      association between maternal bisphenol A exposure during early pregnancy and
      sleep-related problems (P>0.05). Conclusion: Maternal bisphenol A exposure during
      early pregnancy might be related to sleep-related problems in preschool children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Parental incarceration (PI) is a prevalent adverse childhood
      experience (ACE) that has been linked to numerous social, emotional, and health
      problems in childhood and adulthood. A growing body of research has emphasized
      the importance of the timing of parent's incarceration on developmental outcomes.
      STUDY DESIGN: The present study uses case-control matching to examine the impact 
      of recent PI on newborn health and home safety outcomes. METHODS: Neonatal health
      and newborn sleep and home safety data, including rates of premature birth, low
      birth weight (LBW), neonatal intensive care unit admittance, breastfeeding
      initiation, safe sleep, and home environment (e.g. working smoke alarm, proper
      firearm storage), were collected from 108 women who completed the Virginia
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring survey. Half of these women (n = 54) had
      experienced the incarceration of themselves or their partner during the previous 
      12 months. Participants were matched by age, race, income, and the education
      level with those of 54 women who completed the survey and who had not experienced
      incarceration in the previous year. RESULTS: Controlling for nicotine and alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy and other stressors, path analyses show that the
      women who experienced incarceration of themselves or their husband/partner were
      significantly less likely to deliver an LBW infant and more likely to live in a
      home with a loaded firearm in the home. No other significant differences emerged 
      between the two matched groups among neonatal health or newborn sleep and home
      safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This result is considered from a public health
      perspective, as PI is an ACE which can be impacted by policy, particularly
      policies that promote practices that healthcare workers can use in correctional
      and other environments to encourage healthy pregnancies and home environments for
      newborns.

AB  - Sleep shortening during pregnancy may alter the mother's environment, affecting
      the offspring. Thus, the present study evaluated the metabolic profile of female 
      offspring from sleep-restricted rats during the last week of pregnancy. Pregnant 
      Wistar rats were distributed into two groups: control (C) and sleep restriction
      (SR). The SR was performed 20 h/day, from 14th to 20th day of pregnancy. At 2
      months, half of the offspring were subjected to ovariectomy (OVX); the others, to
      sham surgery. Studied groups were Csham, Covx, SRsham and SRovx. Cholesterol
      (HDL, LDL and C-total), triglycerides (TG) and glucose and insulin tolerance
      tests (GTT-ITT) were evaluated at 8 months. RSsham presented higher values of TG,
      while SRovx presented higher TG, LDL and C-total. Basal glucose concentration was
      increased in SRsham and SRovx. These data suggest that SR during pregnancy may be
      a risk factor for the development of diseases in adult female offspring.

TI  - Seasonal and gestational variation in perinatal depression in a prospective
      cohort in New Zealand.
LID - 10.1111/ajo.12912 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression has wide-ranging impacts on the health of
      mothers, babies and their families. Previously published data suggest seasonal
      variation in the prevalence of perinatal depression, as well as possible
      variation with gestation. AIMS: To describe the prevalence of perinatal
      depression in a New Zealand population; to describe the trend in depression over 
      gestational age; and to assess the influence of season on perinatal depression.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a
      prospective cohort of 260 women in Dunedin, New Zealand. Edinburgh Depression
      Scores were collected at four antenatal time points and at six months postpartum.
      RESULTS: Prevalence of depression decreased from 8.1% to 4.6% antenatally, and to
      6.6% postnatally, but the variation was non-significant. Prevalence was
      significantly higher in winter and spring antenatally (odds ratio (OR) 3.15, 95% 
      CI 1.01-9.82 and OR 3.16, CI 1.05-9.55), and in spring postnatally (OR 8.40, 95% 
      CI 1.01-69.52) compared to autumn. Antenatal depression was associated with poor 
      sleep quality (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.22-14.93), while postnatal depression was
      associated with caesarean delivery (OR 5.03, 95% CI 1.29-19.64). CONCLUSIONS:
      This is the first NZ cohort to assess depression over multiple antenatal and
      postnatal time points. A significantly higher rate of depression was identified
      in winter and spring antenatally and in spring postnatally, corresponding to a
      higher risk of postnatal depression with autumn deliveries. These findings should
      prompt greater awareness at these higher risk time periods.

AB  - The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most common sleep disorders and
      is associated with increased risk for obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular
      event. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of OSA in shift
      workers. The systematic literature review was performed using the descriptors
      "sleep apnea" and "shift work", in the databases PubMed, PubMed Central,
      Biblioteca Virtual em Saude, Web of Science and Scopus, including studies that
      presented the frequency of OSA in shift workers; published between 2004 and 2014;
      in English, Portuguese or Spanish; only with human beings, older than 18 years
      old; using the polysomnography. Review articles or those including participants
      with previous comorbidities (except overweight/obesity), treated for sleep
      disorders or pregnant women were excluded. From 1,428 studies identified, four
      were included in the analysis, resulting in 819 participants, with a predominance
      of men. The prevalence of OSA in shift workers varied from 14.3% to 38.1%, higher
      than that estimated for the general population, suggesting an important
      association with shift work and the need for prevention, diagnostic and
      intervention on the possible negative impacts of working range on the health of
      shift workers.

TI  - Poor Sleep Quality Is Associated with Higher Hemoglobin A1c in Pregnant Women: A 
      Pilot Observational Study.
LID - E2287 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15102287 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that poor sleep quality exacerbates glucose intolerance
      manifested as elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which increases the risk 
      for gestational diabetes. To test this, 38 pregnant and 22 non-pregnant (age,
      18(-)35 years; body-mass index, 20(-)35 kg/m(2)) otherwise healthy women were
      enrolled in the study. Sleep quality was assessed during gestational week 24
      (pregnant), or outside of the menstrual period (non-pregnant), using qualitative 
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and objective (actigraphic wrist-watch)
      measures. Blood glucose, total cortisol, and depression status were evaluated.
      Eight pregnant and one non-pregnant women were lost to follow-up, or withdrew
      from the study. There was a higher incidence of poor sleep quality in pregnant
      (73%) relative to non-pregnant women (43%). Although actigraphic data revealed no
      differences in actual sleep hours between pregnant and non-pregnant women, the
      number of wake episodes and sleep fragmentation were higher in pregnant women.
      Poor sleep quality was positively correlated with higher HbA1c in both pregnant
      (r = 0.46, n = 26, p = 0.0151) and non-pregnant women (r = 0.50, n = 19, p =
      0.0217), reflecting higher average blood glucose concentrations. In contrast,
      poor sleep was negatively correlated with cortisol responses in pregnant women (r
      = -0.46, n = 25, p = 0.0167). Three pregnant women had elevated one-hour oral
      glucose tolerance test results (>153 mg/dL glucose). These same pregnant women
      exhibited poor sleep quality. These results support the suggestion that poor
      sleep quality is an important risk factor that is associated with glucose
      intolerance and attendant health complications in pregnancy.

TI  - Free versus purchased mosquito net ownership and use in Budondo sub-county,
      Uganda.
PG  - 363
LID - 10.1186/s12936-018-2515-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the distribution of mosquito bed nets is a widely adopted
      approach for malaria prevention, studies exploring how the usage of a net may be 
      influenced by its source and other factors remain sparse. METHODS: A standardized
      questionnaire and home-visit observations were used to collect data from 9
      villages in Budondo sub-county, Uganda in 2016. Household- and individual-level
      data were collected, such as bed net ownership (at least one net versus none),
      acquirement source (free versus purchased), demographics, as well as knowledge of
      malaria and preventative measures. Net-level data, including alternative uses,
      and bed net quantity and integrity, were also collected. Mixed effects logistic
      regression models were performed to identify the key determinants of bed net use.
      RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of households with at least one bed net was 40%,
      while bed net availability was only reported among 27% of all household members. 
      Awareness of the benefits of bed net use was statistically significantly
      associated with ownership of at least one net (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.11-2.68, p =
      0.02). Among those who own net(s), the odds of a bed net being correctly used
      (i.e., to sleep under) after adjusting for potential confounders were
      significantly lower for nets that were obtained free compared to nets that were
      purchased by the owners themselves (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.51, p < 0.01),
      resulting in an alternative use of the net. Other factors such as female gender, 
      children </= 5 years old, and pregnancy status were also significantly associated
      with having a net to sleep under (all p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Understanding inter-
      and intra-household net-use factors will help malaria control programmes more
      effectively direct their efforts to increase public health impact. Future studies
      may additionally consider socioeconomic status and track the lifetime of the net.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether specific perinatal
      factors are associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children. 
      METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. All cases of OSAS were
      obtained from a tertiary pediatric hospital between April 2013 and April 2016. A 
      total of 823 children who had been diagnosed with OSAS were designated as the
      case group, and 823 children without OSAS were selected with strict criteria to
      match with the case group by age, gender and body mass index. Logistic regression
      models were used to determine the perinatal factors associated with childhood
      OSAS. RESULTS: Preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.87, 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 1.13-3.08) and cesarean section (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.68)
      were significantly associated with OSAS. Exposure of the mother to smoke (aOR:
      2.59, 95% CI: 1.57-4.26) was also associated with an increased risk of childhood 
      OSAS. Mothers aged 35 years and above, performing manual labor, and living in
      suburban areas significantly increased the risk of childhood OSAS. Multiparous
      mothers decreased the risk of childhood OSAS (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.83).
      Maternal education, gravidity, prenatal care times, pregnancy-induced
      hypertension, multiple pregnancies, sex of the child and birth weight were not
      significantly associated with OSAS in children. CONCLUSION: Perinatal risk
      factors are important for predicting childhood OSAS. Our findings provide
      evidence regarding several potentially useful factors for recognizing OSAS in
      children, which could be important in diagnosis of pediatric OSAS by physicians.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Given the increasing number of women service members and veterans
      of childbearing age, it is important to understand the preconception risks in
      this potentially vulnerable population. This study compared the prevalence of
      modifiable preconception risk factors among women with and without a history of
      service. METHODS: Analyses included data from the 2013 and 2014 Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
      Preconception risk factors included health behaviors, chronic conditions, and
      mental health among women of childbearing age. Multivariate logistic regressions 
      were used to compare the adjusted prevalence of each outcome among women with and
      without a history of service. Interaction terms assessed variation by age and
      history of service. RESULTS: Compared with women without a history of service,
      women with a history of service reported higher prevalence of insufficient sleep 
      (49.6% vs. 36.3%; p < .001) and diagnosed depression (26.5% vs. 21.6%; p < .01). 
      Women with a history of service were overall less likely to have obesity (19.8%
      vs. 26.5%; p < .001). Age-stratified results suggested that, compared with women 
      without a history of service, women with a history of service were more likely to
      smoke in the 25 to 34 age group and reported comparable levels of obesity in the 
      35 to 44 age group. CONCLUSIONS: Women with a history of service demonstrated a
      preconception health profile that differs from women without a history of
      service. It is critical that providers are aware of their patients' military
      status and potential associated risks.

TI  - Knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy, and their association with insecticidal net
      use among pregnant women in a secondary health centre in Maiduguri, Nigeria.
PG  - 359

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of malaria among pregnant women and its
      associated complications, the level of compliance with insecticide-treated nets
      (ITN) remains very low. Motivation and self-efficacy have been reported as
      important determinants of health behaviour, and may be important factors to
      consider in developing health intervention programmes. The aim of this study was 
      to determine the knowledge, motivation and self-efficacy of ITN use, and their
      association with its practice, among pregnant women in a secondary health centre 
      in Maiduguri. METHODS: The study utilized a cross-sectional study design, using a
      structured and pre-tested questionnaire to obtain information from 380
      respondents. Respondents were classified as ITN users if they slept under an ITN 
      for at least 3 days in a week, while those who did not at all, or slept under it 
      less frequently were classified as ITN non-users. Chi squared test was performed 
      to test the bivariate association between ITN use and each of the items of the
      questionnaire. A further multivariate logistic regression was performed to
      determine the predictors of ITN use. RESULTS: The respondents' ages ranged from
      15 to 45 years, with median (interquartile range) age of 25 (8) years. Eighty
      percent of them were aware of ITN, but 50.5% believed ITNs could be dangerous.
      Only 5.5% and 0.8% respectively felt that sleeping under and ITN was either just 
      bad or very bad for their health. Thirty-five percent of the respondents were ITN
      users. Not having a previous miscarriage (OR = 2.38; 95% CI 1.41-4.03, p =
      0.001), knowledge that ITNs were not to be washed after every 1 month (OR = 3.60;
      95% CI 1.18-11.06), significant others thinking they should sleep under an ITN
      (OR = 3.06; 95% CI 1.35-6.96), ability to effectively persuade others to sleep
      under an ITN (OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.94) were significantly associated with ITN
      use. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of pregnant women in this study were not
      sleeping under ITNs. The development of health promotion interventions aimed at
      boosting their self-efficacies for ITN use, and improving social support from
      their spouses are, therefore, recommended. Health education on ITN use should
      also be incorporated into post-abortal management.

TI  - Correlations between the active straight leg raise, sleep and somatosensory
      sensitivity during pregnancy with post-partum lumbopelvic pain: an initial
      exploration.

AB  - Background and aims For some women, lumbopelvic pain (LPP) developed during
      pregnancy becomes a continuing post-partum problem. Increased understanding of
      potential prognostic factors is required. This study investigated whether active 
      straight leg raise (ASLR), sleep dysfunction and pressure pain sensitivity during
      pregnancy are correlated with LPP intensity and quality, disability, and physical
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) post-partum. Methods An exploratory,
      prospective cohort study design was used. Baseline factors of interest were: (1) 
      ASLR, (2) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and (3) pressure pain thresholds (PPTs)
      collected from pregnant women from sites local and distal to the lumbopelvic
      area. Follow-up data collected 11-18 months post-partum (n=29) were: (1) pain
      intensity score (numerical rating scale), (2) pain quality (McGill Pain
      Questionnaire), (3) disability (Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire), and (4) HRQoL
      (36-item Short Form Health Survey). Correlation analysis was performed. Results
      Greater difficulty with an ASLR during pregnancy correlated with lower
      post-partum physical HRQoL scores (r=-0.563, p=0.002). Likewise, reduced PPTs at 
      the sacrum during pregnancy was correlated with a higher post-partum pain quality
      score (r=-0.384, p=0.040). Conclusions In this cohort, findings indicate that
      poor ASLR performance and localised pressure pain hypersensitivity at the pelvis 
      during pregnancy are correlated with post-partum physical HRQoL and pain quality,
      respectively. Implications Pain sensitivity may contribute to the prognosis of
      women with LPP during pregnancy. These explorative findings may be important for 
      designing larger prognostic studies and may assist in directing potential pain
      management in post-partum LPP.

TI  - Peripheral Neuroimmunoendocrine Interactions: Contribution of TNFRp55 to the
      Circadian Synchronization of Progesterone and Cytokine Production in Joints of
      Mice in Late Pregnancy.
PG  - 153-162
LID - 10.1159/000493143 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Circadian rhythms are generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the 
      hypothalamus and involve rhythmic expression of clock genes and proteins. This
      rhythmicity is transferred to peripheral tissues by neural and hormonal signals. 
      Late pregnancy is considered a state of inflammation which impacts on peripheral 
      tissues such as joints. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediates inflammatory and
      circadian responses through its p55 receptor (TNFRp55). Neuroimmunoendocrine
      interactions in joints have not been studied completely. The purpose of this
      study was to analyze these interactions, investigating the circadian rhythms of
      progesterone (Pg) and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the joints at the
      end of pregnancy (gestational day 18). Moreover, the impact of TNFRp55 deficiency
      on these temporal oscillations was explored. METHODS: Wild-type and
      TNFRp55-deficient (KO) C57BL/6 mice were kept under constant darkness in order to
      study their endogenous circadian rhythms. The expression of the clock genes Bmal1
      and Per1 at circadian time 7 was studied by reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction in the ankle joints of nonpregnant and pregnant (gestational day
      18) mice. In late pregnancy, Pg and the cytokines interleukin 17 (IL-17), IL-6,
      and IL-10 were measured in the joints throughout a 24-h period by
      radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: A 
      significant increase in Bmal1 and Per1 mRNA expression was detected in the joints
      of pregnant KO mice. Furthermore, KO mice displayed a desynchronization of
      articular Pg and cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TNF, via
      TNFRp55 signaling, modulates articular Pg and cytokine circadian rhythms in late 
      pregnancy. These findings suggest a temporal neuroimmunoendocrine association in 
      peripheral tissues in late pregnancy.

TI  - Effects of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed child: a systematic
      review.
PG  - w14665

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutrition in the first 1000 days between pregnancy and 24 months of
      life is critical for child health, and exclusive breastfeeding is promoted as the
      infant's best source of nutrition in the first 6 months. Caffeine is a central
      nervous system stimulant occurring naturally in some foods and used to treat
      primary apnoea in premature babies. However high caffeine intake can be harmful, 
      and caffeine is transmitted into breastmilk. AIM: To systematically review the
      evidence on the effects of maternal caffeine consumption during breastfeeding on 
      the breastfed child. METHOD: A systematic search was conducted to October 2017 in
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. The British
      Library catalogue, which covers doctoral theses, was searched and PRISMA
      guidelines followed. Two reviewers screened for experimental, cohort, or
      case-control studies and performed independent quality assessment using the
      Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The main reviewer performed data extraction, checked by
      the second reviewer. RESULTS: Two cohort, two crossover studies, and one N-of-1
      trial were included for narrative synthesis. One crossover and two cohort studies
      of small sample sizes directly investigated maternal caffeine consumption. No
      significant effects on 24-hour heart rate, 24-hour sleep time, or frequent night 
      waking of the breastfed child were found. One study found a decreased rate of
      full breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum. Two studies indirectly investigated
      caffeine exposure. Maternal chocolate and coffee consumption was associated with 
      increased infant colic, and severe to moderate exacerbation of infant atopic
      dermatitis. However, whether caffeine was the causal ingredient is questionable. 
      The insufficient and inconsistent evidence available had quality issues impeding 
      conclusions on the effects of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed
      child. CONCLUSION: Evidence for recommendations on caffeine intake for
      breastfeeding women is scant, of limited quality and inconclusive. Birth cohort
      studies investigating the potential positive and negative effects of various
      levels of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed child and breastfeeding 
      mother could improve the knowledge base and allow evidence-based advice for
      breastfeeding mothers. Systematic review registration number: CRD42017078790.

TI  - Maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness and child neuropsychiatric and
      neurocognitive development.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1017/S003329171800291X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of sleep problems among pregnant women is over 50%,
      and daytime sleepiness is among the most common sleep problems. Previous studies 
      have associated antenatal sleep problems with adverse maternal health and
      neonatal outcomes, but the consequences of antenatal sleep problems and
      particularly daytime sleepiness on child psychological development have not been 
      assessed prospectively. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study including 111
      mother-child dyads, we examined the associations of maternal daytime sleepiness
      during pregnancy, assessed at 17 and 28 weeks of gestation using the Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale, with child neuropsychiatric problems and neuropsychological
      development, assessed with mother-rated questionnaires and individually
      administered neuropsychological tests, at child age 2.6-5.7 years (mean = 4.3
      years). RESULTS: Independently of sociodemographic and perinatal covariates and
      maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during and/or after pregnancy, maternal 
      antenatal daytime sleepiness was associated with increased total [unstandardized 
      regression coefficient (B) = 0.25 standard deviation (s.d.) units; 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.01-0.48] and internalizing (B = 0.25 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.01-0.49)
      psychiatric problems and ADHD symptoms (B = 0.27 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.04-0.50) in
      children, and with poorer executive function, particularly in the areas of
      attention, working memory and inhibitory control (B = -0.39 s.d.s: 95% CI -0.69
      to -0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness carries adverse
      consequences for offspring psychological development. The assessment of sleep
      problems may be an important addition to standard antenatal care.

TI  - NKX6-2-Related Disorder
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: NKX6-2-related disorder is characterized by a spectrum 
      of progressive neurologic manifestations resulting from diffuse central nervous
      system hypomyelination. At the severe end of the spectrum is neonatal-onset
      nystagmus, severe spastic tetraplegia with joint contractures and scoliosis, and 
      visual and hearing impairment, all of which rapidly progress resulting in death
      in early childhood. At the milder end of the spectrum is normal achievement of
      early motor milestones in the first year of life followed by slowly progressive
      complex spastic ataxia with pyramidal findings (spasticity with increased muscle 
      tone and difficulty with gait and fine motor coordination) and cerebellar
      findings (nystagmus, extraocular movement disorder, dysarthria, titubation, and
      ataxia) with loss of developmental milestones. To date NKX6-2-related disorder
      has been reported in 25 individuals from 13 families. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The
      diagnosis of NKX6-2-related disorder is established in a proband with typical
      clinical and neuroimaging findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in NKX6-2
      identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations:
      Treatment is symptomatic and typically involves a multidisciplinary team of
      specialists in the areas of developmental pediatrics, neurology, pediatric
      rehabilitation, orthopedics, PT/OT, social work, nutrition, pulmonary/sleep
      medicine, ophthalmology, audiology, and palliative care. Surveillance: Sleep
      studies for evidence of apnea. Routine assessment of: nutritional status and
      safety of oral intake; development; progression of spasticity and contractures.
      GENETIC COUNSELING: NKX6-2-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal
      recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25%
      chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the NKX6-2 pathogenic
      variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for
      at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep is critical for glucose metabolism. Pregnant women often have
      sleep disturbances and extreme sleep duration. Investigations of the relationship
      between sleep duration during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
      have reported inconsistent results. The present study aimed to meta-analyze the
      relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. METHODS: We
      performed a systematic search of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO
      databases for studies that were published up to October 2017, that reported
      associations between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Odds ratios
      (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes for 
      all studies. Heterogeneity and potential publication biases were assessed.
      RESULTS: A total of 4366 papers were retrieved, among which seven studies
      assessed the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM
      development. The seven articles included 18,203 subjects at baseline and 1294 GDM
      cases during follow-up. Compared to normal sleep duration, extreme sleep duration
      during early and middle pregnant stages had a close relationship with GDM based
      upon pooled data from prospective and cross-sectional studies. Prospective
      results showed that long sleep duration during pregnancy was a risk factor for
      GDM, but not short sleep duration. Publication biases were found when analyzing
      the relationship between extreme sleep duration and GDM. CONCLUSIONS: Extreme
      sleep duration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. Moreover, long
      but not short sleep duration can predict the risk of developing GDM. These
      findings remind us of the importance of sleep duration control during pregnancy
      and help optimize early strategies for the prevention of GDM.

TI  - Infant nocturnal wakefulness: a longitudinal study comparing three sleep
      assessment methods.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsy191 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: To examine the convergence between actigraphy, sleep diaries,
      and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) in the assessment of infant
      nocturnal wakefulness (i.e. minutes awake after sleep onset [WASO] and number of 
      night-wakings [NW]) in the context of a longitudinal study. Methods: The sample
      included 226 families, who were recruited during pregnancy. Data were collected
      at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum. Infants' sleep was monitored at home for
      five nights using actigraphy, sleep diaries, and the BISQ. Outcome measures
      included WASO and NW, as well as sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep onset. 
      Results: Trajectory analyses demonstrated that all three methods showed declines 
      in NW and WASO from 3 to 18 months. Statistically significant correlations were
      found between the three methods at all assessment points for all sleep variables.
      However, agreement rates (using Krippendorff's alpha and Bland-Altman analyses)
      between actigraphy and parental reports were poor. For NW, agreement between
      actigraphy and parental reports at 18 months was lower than that at 3 and 6
      months. Diaries and BISQ showed satisfactory agreement for sleep latency.
      Conclusions: Although the three methods' measures of infant nocturnal wakefulness
      are significantly correlated during infancy, absolute agreement between these
      methods is poor overall. The growing disagreement between actigraphy and parental
      reports (in NW) across development probably suggests that parents become less
      aware of infants' awakenings, due to the increasing ability of infants to
      self-soothe. Using both objective and subjective assessment methods seems
      especially important after the age of 6 months.

AB  - To investigate effects of Ca level varying with feeding time daily in sows during
      late pregnancy on placental lipid metabolism and transport in pigs, sixty
      pregnant sows were assigned to 3 groups: the CON group was fed low-Ca diet with
      11.25g CaCO3 at 0600h and 1500h, H-L group was fed low-Ca diet with 22.5g CaCO3
      at 0600h and low-Ca diet at 1500h, and L-H group was fed low-Ca diet at 0600h and
      low-Ca diet with 22.5g CaCO3 at 1500h, respectively. Serum from sows and
      umbilical cord and placenta were collected during delivery. Results showed that, 
      compared with the CON group, H-L feeding significantly increased maternal serum
      total triglyceride (TG) and umbilical serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      (P<0.05). The results showed that long chain fatty acid (FA) contents in placenta
      were significantly increased in H-L and L-H groups (P<0.05). Experiments on genes
      involved in glycolipid metabolism showed that H-L or L-H feeding inhibited mRNA
      expression of GLUT3, GLUT4, FAS, FABP1, FABPpm, FAT/CD36, while activated the
      mRNA expression of FASD1, FASD2 and SCD in placenta (P<0.05). In addition,
      experiments on genes involved in biological clock showed that L-H feeding
      sequence activated the mRNA expression of per1 and clock, while H-L and L-H
      feeding sequence inhibited mRNA expression of per2 in placenta (P<0.05). It is
      concluded that maternal supplementation with Ca varying with feeding time daily
      during late pregnancy affects placental lipid metabolism and transport in pigs by
      regulating the mRNA expression related to lipid metabolism and the circadian
      clock.

TI  - The Fourth Trimester of Pregnancy: Committing to Maternal Health and Well-Being
      Postpartum.
PG  - 30-33
AB  - The postpartum period is a time of significant challenge and need as women adapt 
      to hormonal and physical changes, recover from delivery, experience shifting
      family responsibilities, and endure sleep deprivation, all while caring for and
      nourishing their newborn. It is also a period of significant maternal health
      risk. Recent data on U.S. maternal mortality indicate a shift in the timing of
      maternal deaths over the past 10 years, with the majority of maternal deaths now 
      occurring postpartum, from one day to one year after delivery. Postpartum care
      also marks a period of transition, as women shift from pregnancy-centered care to
      interpregnancy and primary care, yet current systems of care are marked by poor
      coordination of care between providers and patient care settings. Suboptimal
      postpartum follow-up is particularly worrisome for women with chronic health
      conditions or pregnancy complications who face both short- and long-term health
      risks. Given known challenges and medical risks, the single, 6-week postpartum
      visit women receive is woefully inadequate in addressing maternal health needs.
      Postpartum visits often fail to address the unique postpartum needs identified by
      mothers, inadequately connect women with primary care services, and have low
      attendance. Recognition of these unmet needs of "the Fourth Trimester" have led
      national organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists (ACOG), to call for a restructuring of postpartum care to reduce
      postpartum and long-term morbidity and improve postpartum well-being. Rhode
      Island has several recent initiatives with the potential to improve outcomes for 
      mother-baby dyads including the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), the
      provision of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) immediately postpartum, 
      and the addition of HPV immunization postpartum. These initiatives remove
      barriers of access to care and provide vital women's health services prior to
      discharge. The Fourth Trimester provides a rich opportunity for maternal risk
      reduction and health promotion at a time when women are motivated and engaged
      with health care.

TI  - Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as
      Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The vast majority of affected individuals
      are male; on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings. Age of onset, 
      disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among affected
      males. In those with early progressive disease, CNS involvement (manifest
      primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration), progressive airway disease,
      and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of
      life. In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) 
      affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be
      early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive
      decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common
      in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms 
      of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating
      hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing
      loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal
      tunnel syndrome. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a
      male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme
      activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal
      activity of at least one other sulfatase. Detection of a hemizygous pathogenic
      variant in IDS confirms the diagnosis in a male proband with an unusual phenotype
      or a phenotype that does not match the results of GAG testing. The diagnosis of
      MPS II is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical
      features by identification of a heterozygous IDS pathogenic variant on molecular 
      genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Interventions commonly 
      include: developmental, occupational, and physical therapy; shunting for
      hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; positive pressure ventilation
      (CPAP or tracheostomy); carpal tunnel release; cardiac valve replacement;
      inguinal hernia repair; hip replacement. Prevention of primary manifestations:
      Weekly enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with infusions of idursulfase
      (Elaprase((R))), a recombinant form of human iduronate 2-sulfatase, is approved
      to treat somatic manifestations and prolong survival. Pretreatment with
      anti-inflammatory drugs or antihistamines may be needed for mild or moderate
      infusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (using
      umbilical cord blood or bone marrow) could provide sufficient enzyme activity to 
      slow or stop the progression of the disease; however, no controlled clinical
      studies have been conducted in MPS II. Prevention of secondary complications:
      Anesthesia is best administered in centers familiar with the potential
      complications in persons with MPS II. Surveillance: Depends on organ system and
      disease severity and usually includes annual: cardiology evaluation and
      echocardiogram; pulmonary evaluation including pulmonary function testing;
      audiogram; ophthalmology examination; developmental assessment; neurologic
      examination. Additional studies may include: sleep study for obstructive apnea;
      nerve conduction velocity to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome; head/neck MRI to 
      document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing; opening pressure on
      lumbar puncture; and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease. Evaluation of 
      relatives at risk: While clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of
      at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes
      and often before significant disease progression, it is unclear at present
      whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ERT justify early diagnosis
      by either newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends
      on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has the
      pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males
      who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the
      pathogenic variant will be carriers. Germline mosaicism has been observed.
      Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of 
      their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for
      pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the
      family is known.

TI  - Childhood adversity and sleep are associated with symptom severity in perinatal
      women presenting for psychiatric care.
LID - 10.1007/s00737-018-0914-2 [doi]
AB  - This study leverages psychiatric intake data from treatment-seeking perinatal
      women aiming to explore the understudied associations between childhood
      adversity, sleep quality, and severity of perinatal mental illness in this
      population. The sample is 578 perinatal women presenting for initial evaluation
      to a university-based perinatal psychiatry clinic. At intake, we collected
      demographics, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), sleep quality, and diagnosis 
      and symptom severity of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Clinician-rated diagnoses showed that 65% of women met criteria for major
      depression, 23% for generalized anxiety disorder and 4% for PTSD; almost 30% of
      women had childhood adversity and 98.2% reported poor perinatal sleep quality.
      Regression analyses revealed differential associations between ACEs and sleep
      quality and perinatal mood symptoms; ACEs were significantly associated with
      pregnancy and postpartum PTSD, whereas sleep quality was associated with
      perinatal depression and generalized anxiety. Screening for ACEs and sleep
      quality during perinatal intake has high clinical utility, as these two factors
      significantly contribute to symptom severity across peripartum.

TI  - Empathy in pregnant women and new mothers: a systematic literature review.
PG  - 84-103
LID - 10.1080/02646838.2018.1525695 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and
      influence on maternal behaviours and child development. BACKGROUND: The
      well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers'
      capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and
      childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may
      disrupt empathic processing. METHODS: Original research papers (n = 7413)
      published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by
      searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL.
      Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from
      pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general
      tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking.
      Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills
      Programme criteria. RESULTS: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to
      high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of
      children and was partially explained by mothers' aversive response to infant
      crying. CONCLUSION: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a
      paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on 
      brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based,
      incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity
      toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

TI  - The politics of female pain: women's citizenship, twilight sleep and the early
      birth control movement.
LID - medhum-2017-011419 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/medhum-2017-011419 [doi]
AB  - The medical intervention of 'twilight sleep', or the use of a
      scopolamine-morphine mixture to anaesthetise labouring women, caused a furore
      among doctors and early 20th-century feminists. Suffragists and women's rights
      advocates led the Twilight Sleep Association in a quest to encourage doctors and 
      their female patients to widely embrace the practice. Activists felt the method
      revolutionised the notoriously dangerous and painful childbirth process for
      women, touting its benefits as the key to allowing women to control their birth
      experience at a time when the maternal mortality rate remained high despite
      medical advances in obstetrics. Yet many physicians attacked the practice as
      dangerous for patients and their babies and antithetical to the expectations for 
      proper womanhood and motherly duty. Historians of women's health have rightly
      cited Twilight Sleep as the beginning of the medicalisation and depersonalisation
      of the childbirth process in the 20th century. This article instead repositions
      the feminist political arguments for the method as an important precursor for the
      rhetoric of the early birth control movement, led by Mary Ware Dennett (a former 
      leader in the Twilight Sleep Association) and Margaret Sanger. Both Twilight
      Sleep and the birth control movement represent a distinct moment in the early
      20th century wherein pain was deeply connected to politics and the rhetoric of
      equal rights. The two reformers emphasised in their publications and appeals to
      the public the vast social significance of reproductive pain-both physical and
      psychological. They contended that women's lack of control over both pregnancy
      and birth represented the greatest hindrance to women's fulfilment of their
      political rights and a danger to the healthy development of larger society. In
      their arguments for legal contraception, Dennett and Sanger placed women's pain
      front and centre as the primary reason for changing a law that hindered women's
      full participation in the public order.

TI  - Associations of snoring frequency and intensity in pregnancy with
      time-to-delivery.
PG  - 504-511
LID - 10.1111/ppe.12511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is linked to adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. However, little is known about the association of SDB with timing of
      delivery. We examined the association of snoring frequency, a key SDB marker, and
      snoring intensity, a correlate of SDB severity, with time-to-delivery among a
      cohort of pregnant women. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 1483 third
      trimester pregnant women were recruited from the University of Michigan prenatal 
      clinics. Women completed a questionnaire about their sleep, and demographic and
      pregnancy information was abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of
      those with hypertension or diabetes, 954 women were classified into two groups by
      their snoring onset timing, chronic or pregnancy-onset. Within each of these
      groups, women were divided into four groups based on their snoring frequency and 
      intensity: non-snorers; infrequent-quiet; frequent-quiet; or frequent-loud
      snorers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the
      association between snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery,
      adjusting for maternal characteristics. RESULTS: Chronic snoring was reported by 
      half of the pregnant women, and of those, 7% were frequent-loud snorers.
      Deliveries before 38 weeks' gestation are completed occurred among 25% of women
      with chronic, frequent-loud snoring. Compared with pre-pregnancy non-snorers,
      women with chronic frequent-loud snoring had an increased hazard ratio for
      delivery (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.45).
      CONCLUSIONS: Snoring frequency and intensity is associated with time-to-delivery 
      in women absent of hypertension or diabetes. Frequent-loud snoring may have a
      clinical utility to identify otherwise low-risk women who are likely to deliver
      earlier.

TI  - Shortening day length: a potential risk factor for perinatal depression.
PG  - 690-702
LID - 10.1007/s10865-018-9971-2 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine whether seasonal light
      exposure, categorized by type of day length, is associated with or predictive of 
      depressive symptoms in late pregnancy and the first 3 months postpartum. Women (n
      = 279) expecting their first child were recruited from prenatal clinics and
      childbirth education classes. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center
      for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Day lengths were categorized into
      short, lengthening, long and shortening. Data analysis included linear mixed
      models and multiple linear regression. When days were shortening (August to first
      4 days of November) in late third trimester, depressive symptom scores were
      highest (35%) and continued to be higher at each postpartum assessment compared
      to other day length categories. Implications for clinical practice include
      increased vigilance for depressive symptoms, particularly if late pregnancy and
      birth occurs during the 3 months around the Autumn equinox when day length is
      shortening. Strategies that increase light exposure in late pregnancy and
      postpartum should also be considered.

TI  - The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea and its association with
      pregnancy-related health outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s11325-018-1714-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common during pregnancy. Nevertheless, 
      prevalence estimates of OSA have varied widely due to variabilities in the
      assessment methods. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the prevalence of
      objectively assessed OSA and its association with pregnancy-related health
      outcomes in pregnant women. METHODS: This review was developed following the
      PRISMA guideline. A systematic search was conducted in major electronic databases
      to identify studies conducted from inception to January 2018. The pooled
      estimates with 95% confidence interval were calculated using the inverse variance
      method. Forest plots were used to present the results of individual studies and
      the pooled effect sizes. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included. The mean
      gestational age was between 21.2 (8.5) and 37.3 (2.1) weeks. The pooled worldwide
      prevalence of OSA was 15% (95% CI 12-18%). The prevalence estimates ranged from
      5% in the European Region to 20% in the Region of Americas. The prevalence
      estimates for different trimesters ranged from 15 to 19%. OSA was related to an
      increased risk for gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia,
      C-section, postoperative wound complication, and pulmonary edema. The pooled
      adjusted odds ratio (aOR) values were 1.97, 1.55, 2.35, 1.42, 1.87, and 6.35,
      respectively. OSA was also related to an increased risk for preterm birth (aOR = 
      1.62) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (aOR = 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: OSA
      is a common health issue in pregnant women. OSA is associated with various
      pregnancy-related health outcomes. Routine screening, early diagnosis, and
      effective treatment of OSA are recommended in pregnant women, particularly during
      mid and late pregnancy.

TI  - Physical Activity and Sleep Quality and Duration During Pregnancy Among Hispanic 
      Women: Estudio PARTO.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/15402002.2018.1518225 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Poor sleep during pregnancy is common and is associated
      with pregnancy complications. Physical activity (PA) is associated with better
      sleep in nonpregnant populations. However, studies among pregnant women are
      sparse, conflicting, and none have been conducted among Hispanic women, who face 
      a disproportionate burden of poor sleep and pregnancy complications. Therefore,
      our objective was to examine the relationship between intensity- and
      domain-specific PA, respectively, on sleep quality and duration among Hispanic
      pregnant women. PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated these associations among participants 
      (n = 251) in Estudio PARTO, an ongoing randomized controlled trial aimed at
      reducing type 2 diabetes among women at high risk. METHODS: We assessed the
      cross-sectional relationship between PA (via Pregnancy PA Questionnaire) and
      sleep quality and duration (via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) using baseline
      data (26.5 +/- 6.9 weeks gestation). RESULTS: In multivariable logistic models,
      household and caregiving activities were associated with higher odds of very poor
      sleep quality (OR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.04 to 7.04) and with short (vs. medium)
      sleep duration (OR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.07 to 7.56). In contrast, occupational PA
      was associated with lower odds of very poor sleep quality (OR = 0.39; 95% CI =
      0.17 to 0.89). Light-intensity PA was associated with lower odds of long (vs.
      medium) sleep duration (OR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.52). There were no
      statistically significant relationships between PA in any other domain and sleep.
      CONCLUSIONS: Prospective studies will be critical in evaluating the potential
      adverse impact of household and caregiving activities on poor sleep quality.

TI  - Blunted Overnight Blood Pressure Dipping in Second Trimester; A Strong Predictor 
      of Gestational Hypertension and Preeclampsia.
PG  - 70-75
LID - 10.2174/1573402114666180924143801 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a global burden with 10 million incidences annually
      and 210 daily deaths worldwide. Diagnosis is mainly based on the features
      following full presentation. OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether early
      pregnancy circadian changes of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) could 
      predict preeclampsia and hypertension. METHODS: In a prospective study, 294
      pregnant women who were referred to Sarem Women's Hospital, Iran were recruited. 
      Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were recorded (diurnally
      and nocturnally) in each trimester. Dipping was defined as a minimum 10% decrease
      in blood pressure. RESULTS: Of the 251 women who completed the study, 25 percent 
      (n=63) experienced blunted MAP dipping during sleep phases in the second
      trimester. Eighty-nine percent (n=56) experienced hypertensive disorder in the
      third trimester, one-third of which experienced preeclampsia. Of the women with
      normal MAP dipping (n=188), 5 percent (n=10) had gestational hypertension and 1
      percent (n=2) became preeclamptic. (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study clearly
      demonstrated blunted blood pressure dipping overnight during the second trimester
      which is a strong predictor of forthcoming pregnancy-induced hypertension and
      preeclampsia. A scoring system was developed to predict hypertensive disorder and
      it was significantly correlated with preeclampsia occurrence.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Maternal antenatal stress may influence offspring development
      and behavior, but any association with child sleep is unknown. METHODS: From 2007
      to 2011, we recruited pregnant women in Mexico City to the Programming Research
      in Obesity, Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors prebirth cohort. Mothers
      completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS, a 4-item questionnaire assessing
      past-month stress) and the Crisis in Family Systems measure assessing negative
      life events (NLEs; how many domains among the 11 assessed in which the mother
      experienced a stressful event in the prior 6 months)-with higher scores
      reflecting higher stress-and provided 5 timed salivary samples per day on 2
      consecutive days, from which we derived cortisol area under the curve, slope, and
      awakening response. At age 4-6 years, children's sleep was estimated using
      accelerometry over a 7-day period. We performed secondary analysis of
      associations of antenatal maternal stress with child sleep duration and
      efficiency (time asleep/time in bed) using linear regression adjusted for
      maternal and child characteristics. RESULTS: Among 594 mother-child dyads, mean
      antenatal PSS score was 5.2 (SD = 3.2) out of 16, and mean NLE was 3.2 (SD = 2)
      out of 11; child sleep duration was 7.7 hours (SD = 0.7), and sleep efficiency
      was 79% (SD = 6). There was no association between any of the stress
      measures-PSS, NLE, or salivary cortisol-and sleep duration or sleep efficiency in
      adjusted or unadjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Among mother-child dyads in a Mexico 
      City cohort, antenatal stress was not associated with important changes in child 
      sleep at 4-6 years.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare different actigraphy scoring settings with polysomnography
      (PSG) for 1 night of total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), wake after
      sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset latency (SOL) in healthy pregnant women
      between 6 and 7 months of gestation. DESIGN: Secondary analysis using data from a
      case-control study. SETTING: A large university-affiliated hospital in the
      Midwestern United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 78 pregnant women were
      recruited, among which 38 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies were
      included for this analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Participants had an overnight PSG
      assessment at a sleep center while simultaneously wearing an actigraph
      (Minimitter; Philips Respironics, Andover, MA). Sleep parameters from both
      devices included TST, SE, WASO, and SOL. Four scoring settings were used to
      obtain these parameters from actigraphy. Bland-Altman tests were used to evaluate
      the agreement between sleep variables scored independently from actigraphy and
      PSG. RESULTS: The default scoring setting (10-by-40) yielded significantly
      different results from the PSG (P < .01). The 10 immobile/mobile minutes for
      sleep onset/end with an activity threshold of 10 (10-by-10) produced estimations 
      of TST, SE, and WASO closest to those produced by PSG. When this setting was
      used, the mean differences between PSG- and actigraphy-assessed TST, SE, and WASO
      were -1.9 minutes, -0.4%, and 7.4 minutes. When the 10 and 15 immobile/mobile
      minutes for sleep onset/end were used, the difference between PSG- and
      actigraphy-assessed SOL was approximately 4 to 5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
      from this study do not support the use of default actigraph settings in pregnant 
      women. In contrast, the 10-by-10 scoring setting provided the greatest agreement 
      and least bias in comparison with PSG for sleep measurements. The 10-by-10
      scoring setting is recommended to be used in studies consisting of pregnant
      women.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy: performance of a rapid screening tool.
LID - 10.1007/s11325-018-1724-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The Sleep Apnea Symptom Score (SASS) has been commonly used to assess
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of this study was to examine the
      psychometric properties of the SASS and the predictive value of SASS
      incorporating bedpartner-reported information in identifying OSA in pregnant
      women. METHODS: A cohort of healthy pregnant women completed the SASS and
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Participants underwent overnight laboratory
      polysomnography (PSG) monitoring. Reliability and validity of the SASS were
      evaluated. A multivariable predictive model, incorporating the SASS score along
      with BMI, age, and bedpartner-reported information, was developed to assess the
      risk for OSA (AHI >/= 5 events/h). Receiver operating characteristic curves for
      OSA were constructed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the
      predictive model. RESULTS: A total of 126 and 105 participants completed the PSG 
      during the first and third trimester, respectively. The SASS demonstrated
      adequate validity and acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.72 during the 
      third trimester). When the combined model consisting of SASS, age, BMI, and
      bedpartner-reported information was used, the area under the curve for AHI >/= 5 
      for the first and third trimester was 0.781 (95%CI 0.648, 0.914) and 0.842 (95%CI
      0.732, 0.952), respectively; the sensitivity/specificity was 76.9%/72.4% and
      82.4%/78.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The SASS alone has acceptable reliability
      and validity, but limited predictive values. A new tool, combining the SASS and
      other patient characteristics (i.e., age, BMI, and bedpartner-reported snoring
      and breathing pauses), demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity, and
      thus may have greater utility in clinical practice for predicting OSA in pregnant
      women.

AB  - Circadian rhythms, endogenous and entrainable adaptations to 24-hour cycles of
      light and dark, influence almost all physiologic functions. Emerging evidence
      suggests that the disruption of normal circadian rhythms, termed
      chronodisruption, could affect a wide range of disease-related processes. In this
      review, we describe the molecular generation of circadian rhythms, the effects of
      chronodisruption on human health, the circadian timing of birth in multiple
      species, the possible effects of chronodisruption on preterm birth, and some of
      the open questions in this field.

AB  - Objective: To compare perinatal outcomes, blood pressures throughout pregnancy,
      rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes 
      mellitus, and immediate obstetric outcomes in adolescents younger than 20 years
      at delivery and those in the 20- to 34-year age group. Patients and Methods:
      Questionnaires were administered to pregnant women at Campbelltown and Liverpool 
      hospitals within South West Sydney, Australia, as part of a broader study of
      sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy between February 1, 2009, and February
      28, 2013. Data collected included demographic data, blood pressure readings,
      pregnancy complications, delivery type, and neonatal outcomes. Adolescents were
      compared with older women using Student t tests and chi(2) statistics. Results: A
      total of 103 adolescents were compared with 2291 women aged 20 to 34 years.
      Adolescents were more likely to be primiparous, had longer average gestations,
      and had lower pre-pregnancy body mass index. Adolescents had lower rates of
      cesarean section delivery and gestational diabetes mellitus. There was no
      significant difference in smoking rates, perinatal mortality rate, small for
      gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, Apgar score of less than 7 at 5
      minutes, admission to special care nursery, or hypertensive disorder of pregnancy
      rates. Adolescents had lower booking systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and 
      their highest antenatal systolic blood pressures were lower. Conclusion:
      Adolescents have birth outcomes to similar to those of their older counterparts. 
      Adolescents had lower booking blood pressures. This may have implications for the
      screening and diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in adolescents.

TI  - Characteristics and Outcomes of Ptyalism Gravidarum.
PG  - 573-575
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ptyalism gravidarum (PG) is a condition of hypersalivation that
      affects pregnant women early in gestation. Symptoms include massive saliva
      volumes (up to 2 liters per day), swollen salivary glands, sleep deprivation,
      significant emotional distress, and social difficulties. OBJECTIVES: To examine
      maternal and fetal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of patients with PG.
      METHODS: Patients diagnosed with PG in our clinic during the years 2001-2016 were
      identified and contacted. Demographic data were extracted from patient charts and
      clinical and outcome data was collected via telephone interviews. RESULTS: The
      incidence of PG was 1/963 (0.09%) in our sample. Eleven out of 22 women (40%)
      with PG were also diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum. Fetal gender did not
      increase the risk. Of the mothers presenting with PG, 37% had a positive family
      history for this condition. There was no associated increase in the rate of fetal
      or maternal complications. Two women reported a resolution of the symptoms
      immediately following hypnosis with acupuncture treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      PG represents an unpleasant mental and physical condition, it does not pose any
      specific risk to the health of the mother or increase adverse perinatal outcomes 
      for the fetus. Alternative medicine could play a role in the treatment of PG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States;
      obstructive sleep apnea is highly comorbid with obesity and is associated with
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. Screening for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant
      women has remained a challenge because of a lack of validated screening tools.
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate established obstructive
      sleep apnea screening tools, a sleepiness scale, and individual component items
      in a cohort of pregnant women with extreme obesity in mid pregnancy with the use 
      of objective testing to determine obstructive sleep apnea status and to describe 
      the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among women with extreme obesity. STUDY
      DESIGN: Adult pregnant subjects, between 24 and 35 weeks gestation, with a body
      mass index >/=40 kg/m(2) at the time of enrollment completed obstructive sleep
      apnea screening tools (Berlin Questionnaire, American Society of
      Anesthesiologists checklist, and STOP-BANG questionnaire) and the Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale; they also underwent physical examination of the neck, mouth,
      and airway. The published obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy prediction score
      was calculated for each subject. Obstructive sleep apnea status for each subject 
      was determined by the results of an overnight, unattended type III home sleep
      apnea test. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of pregnant women with extreme obesity
      had obstructive sleep apnea on home sleep apnea testing in mid pregnancy
      (Apnea-Hypopnea Index, >/=5 events per hour]. Established obstructive sleep apnea
      screening tools performed very poorly to screen for obstructive sleep apnea in
      this cohort. Age, body mass index, neck circumference, frequently witnessed
      apneas, and highly likely to fall asleep while driving were associated most
      strongly with obstructive sleep apnea status in this cohort. CONCLUSION: We found
      that 24% of pregnant women with body mass index >/=40 kg/m(2) between 24 and 35
      weeks gestation have obstructive sleep apnea, defined as Apnea-Hypopnea Index
      >/=5 events per hour on an overnight type III home sleep apnea test. We found the
      Berlin Questionnaire, American Society of Anesthesiologists checklist, STOP-BANG,
      obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy score by Facco et al, and the Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale were not useful screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea in a
      cohort of obese pregnant women. However, age, body mass index, neck
      circumference, frequently witnessed apneas, and likely to fall asleep while
      driving were associated with obstructive sleep apnea in this cohort. Further
      studies are needed to adjust the criteria and thresholds within the available
      screening tools to better predict obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women with 
      obesity.

AB  - Women who have experienced significant adversities during childhood and adulthood
      are at risk for excessive inflammation during pregnancy, but the mechanisms are
      unclear. Using structural equation modeling, we examined pathways from childhood 
      abuse history and current socioeconomic status (SES) to inflammatory markers
      through indicators of health risk, recent stressors, and psychological distress
      in 214 women assessed at mid-pregnancy (5-31weeks gestation). Self-reported data 
      on socioeconomic indicators, childhood trauma history, pre-pregnancy body mass
      index (BMI), smoking, sleep quality, interpersonal conflict, recent life events, 
      perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were collected, and serum levels of
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. In separate
      models, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep quality, and interpersonal conflict
      statistically explained the relationship between adversity and inflammation.
      These three intermediate variables were then entered into a multiple mediation
      analysis to examine unique effects. Childhood abuse history and current SES both 
      demonstrated significant indirect effects on CRP through pre-pregnancy BMI, and
      current SES showed a significant indirect effect on IL-6 through all intermediate
      variables. When examining each indirect pathway individually, pre-pregnancy BMI
      and interpersonal conflict emerged as parallel pathways by which low current SES 
      leads to elevated IL-6; the indirect pathway through sleep quality was no longer 
      significant. Pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict are two independent
      mechanisms by which adversity is associated with increased inflammation during
      pregnancy. Women who have been exposed to significant adversity may be at
      particular risk for obesity, sleep disruption, and interpersonal conflict, with
      implications for immune dysregulation during pregnancy.

AB  - Animal studies strongly suggest that timed feeding can have beneficial
      physiological effects, including protection against the obesogenic and metabolic 
      consequences of a high-fat diet. However, the relationship between variables
      related to the timing of eating and diet quality in pregnancy women, which is
      considered as a period of nutritional vulnerability, is still poorly described in
      the literature. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the
      associations between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet
      quality of pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 100
      pregnant women in the first gestational trimester (</=12 weeks of gestation). The
      information regarding food intake was obtained by three 24-Hour Dietary Recall
      (24HR). Time-related eating patterns, i.e., the interval between the first and
      the last meal (eating duration), nightly fasting, time of the first and last
      meals, and number of meals eating on a day were determined. Chronotype was
      derived using the mid-sleep time on free days on weekends, with a further
      correction for calculated sleep debt. Diet quality was evaluated using the
      Brazilian Healthy Eating Index-Revised (BHEI-R), validated for the Brazilian
      population. Linear regression modeling analyses adjusted for confounders were
      used to investigate the association between time-related eating patterns and
      chronotype with diet quality. The BHEI-R total score was negatively associated
      with time of the first meal (beta = -0.355; p = 0.002; r(2) adjusted = 0.141),
      and positively associated with eating duration (beta = 0.262; p = 0.024; r(2)
      adjusted = 0.086) and number of meals (beta = 0.273; p = 0.019; r(2) adjusted =
      0.091). In addition, the score of total fruit component was negatively associated
      with chronotype (beta = -0.236; p = 0.033; r(2) adjusted = 0.078), time of the
      first meal (beta = -0.393; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.171), and positively
      associated with eating duration (beta = 0.259; p = 0.022; r(2) adjusted = 0.087) 
      and number of meals (beta = 0.376; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.159). The score
      for whole fruit component was negatively associated with time of the first meal
      (beta = -0.388; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.152), and positively associated with
      number of meals (beta = 0.403; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.164). A longer eating
      duration, earlier time of the first meal, higher number of meals and morningness 
      tendency are associated with a better diet quality in the first gestational
      trimester - higher scores of the total BHEI-R and/or fruit components. We suggest
      that nutritional guidelines should consider time-related eating patterns and
      chronotype to ensure good diet quality of pregnant women since the beginning of
      gestation, contributing on prevention of metabolic-nutritional complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cross-sectional associations between
      musculoskeletal pain experience and measures of pressure and cold pain
      sensitivity in young adults from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) 
      Study. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In total, 917 participants were eligible for
      analysis if they provided data pertaining to musculoskeletal pain status at the
      22-year follow-up and had data for at least 1 valid pain sensitivity test.
      Standardized protocols were used to assess pressure pain threshold (4 sites:
      lumbar spine, tibialis anterior, upper trapezius, and wrist) and cold pain
      threshold (wrist). Four pain experience groups ("No pain" [n=562, 61.3%], "Low"
      [n=84, 9.2%], "Medium" [n=147, 16.0%], "High" [n=124, 13.5%]) were determined by 
      latent class analysis using parameters of pain chronicity, frequency, intensity, 
      and number of pain areas. Variables considered as confounders included sex, age, 
      ethnicity, waist-hip ratio, psychological symptoms, sleep quality, physical
      activity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and income. RESULTS: There were no
      associations between pain experience and pressure pain sensitivity after
      adjusting for confounders. The "Medium" and "High" pain experience groups
      demonstrated heightened cold pain sensitivity compared with the "No pain" group
      (P=0.023), adjusted for sex and smoking. DISCUSSION: This study provides the most
      extensive investigation of the relationship between musculoskeletal pain
      experience and pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults. Heightened
      cold pain sensitivity in those classified as "Medium" and "High" pain experience 
      may suggest altered nociceptive processing and has implications for clinical
      management.

AB  - We herein present the case of a 27-year-old woman with clinical and biochemical
      features of virilism. Imaging studies revealed the presence of a bilateral
      adrenal tumor. Although the secretion of androgens was remarkable, the autonomous
      production of cortisol was also evident because of a loss of circadian rhythm and
      the absence of cortisol suppression by dexamethasone. The surgical excision of
      both adrenal tumors was performed, and the histological examination showed no
      malignancy. We also report the successful pregnancy and delivery of the patient
      who showed evolving adrenocortical insufficiency along with virilization and
      Cushing's syndrome and who continued to receive glucocorticoid replacement
      therapy during pregnancy.

AB  - Time of day is a critical factor for most biological functions, but concepts from
      the field of chronobiology have yet to be fully translated to clinical practice. 
      Circadian rhythms, generated internally and synchronised to the external
      environment, promote function and support survival in almost every living
      species. Fetal circadian rhythms can be observed in utero from 30weeks gestation,
      coupled to the maternal rhythm, but synchronise to the external environment only 
      after birth. Important cues for synchronisation include the light/dark cycle, the
      timing of feeding, and exposure to melatonin in breast milk. Disruption to these 
      cues may occur during admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. This can
      impair the development of circadian rhythms, and influence survival and function 
      in the neonatal period, with a potential to impact health and well-being
      throughout adult life. Here we outline the rationale and evidence to support a
      chronobiological approach to neonatal care.

TI  - Canavan Disease
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Most individuals with Canavan disease have the
      neonatal/infantile form. Although such infants appear normal early in life, by
      age three to five months, hypotonia, head lag, macrocephaly, and developmental
      delays become apparent. With age, children with neonatal/infantile-onset Canavan 
      disease often become irritable and experience sleep disturbance, seizures, and
      feeding difficulties. Swallowing deteriorates, and some children require
      nasogastric feeding or permanent feeding gastrostomies. Joint stiffness
      increases, so that these children resemble individuals with cerebral palsy.
      Children with mild/juvenile Canavan disease may have normal or mildly delayed
      speech or motor development early in life without regression. In spite of
      developmental delay most of these children can be educated in typical classroom
      settings and may benefit from speech therapy or tutoring as needed. Most children
      with mild forms of Canavan disease have normal head size, although macrocephaly, 
      retinitis pigmentosa, and seizures have been reported in a few individuals.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Canavan disease is established in a proband
      with typical clinical findings and elevated N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in urine 
      and/or with biallelic pathogenic variants in ASPA identified by molecular genetic
      testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Neonatal/infantile Canavan
      disease. Treatment is supportive and directed to providing adequate nutrition and
      hydration, managing infectious diseases, and protecting the airway. Hospice care 
      is a resource used by the families of the individuals affected by the disease.
      Physical therapy minimizes contractures and maximizes motor abilities and seating
      posture; special education programs enhance communication skills. Seizures are
      treated with antiepileptic drugs. Gastrostomy may be needed to maintain adequate 
      food intake and hydration when swallowing difficulties exist. Mild/juvenile
      Canavan disease. May require speech therapy or tutoring but no special medical
      care. Surveillance: Neonatal/infantile Canavan disease. Follow up every six
      months to evaluate developmental status and evidence of any new problems.
      Mild/juvenile Canavan disease. Annual routine follow up by a pediatric
      neurologist or a developmental pediatrician is indicated. GENETIC COUNSELING:
      Canavan disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each pregnancy of 
      a couple in which both partners are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in ASPA
      has a 25% chance of resulting in a child with Canavan disease, a 50% chance of
      resulting in a child who is an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of
      resulting in a child who is unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing is
      available on a population basis for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.
      Carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at
      increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible when the
      pathogenic variants in the family are known.

AB  - Prokineticins are involved in many physiological processes including circadian
      rhythms, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer. Recently, they have been found
      to play a role in regulating food intake. Historically, proteins that increase
      feeding behavior in mammals decrease reproductive behavior to prevent pregnancy
      and lactation when food is scarce. In the current study, prokineticin-2 (PK2) had
      pronounced effects on reproductive and ingestive behaviors when given to female
      Syrian hamsters. Administration of PK2 prevented ingestive behaviors induced by
      food restriction, such as the amount of time spent with food and eating. Hamsters
      given PK2 preferred to engage in reproductive behaviors, including spending time 
      with a male and lordosis. Furthermore, analysis of blood plasma revealed that
      changes to behavior persisted despite similar levels of des-acyl ghrelin (DAG)
      and reduced glucose concentrations in the blood. Additionally, administering
      10mg/kg of acyl ghrelin (AG) to a different cohort of animals significantly
      decreased the amount of time females spent with a potential mating partner,
      increased the amount of time females spent with food, decreased the duration of
      lordosis, and increased the duration of eating. Results from the current study
      support the need for further research investigating the reproductive and
      ingestive roles of PK2 and ghrelin.

AB  - Infant mortality remains a problem in the United States with sleep-related deaths
      accounting for a significant portion. Known risk reduction strategies include
      breastfeeding, avoiding tobacco use and following the American Academy of
      Pediatrics' safe sleep guidelines. The purpose of this project was to evaluate
      outcomes of Safe Sleep Instructor-led community baby showers, which included safe
      sleep promotion, breastfeeding promotion and tobacco cessation education.
      Certified Safe Sleep Instructors (n = 35) were trained on how to plan and host a 
      Community Baby Shower to provide education to pregnant women of low socioeconomic
      status or with high risk of infant mortality. Eighteen Community Baby Showers
      were held across two urban and eight rural counties in Kansas. Surveys were
      administered pre- and post-event to assess participant knowledge, confidence and 
      intentions to follow through with planned action related to safe sleep,
      breastfeeding and reducing tobacco risk. Matched data were summarized and
      evaluated for differences using McNemar's and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests.
      Significant increases were observed in Baby Shower participants' (n = 845)
      reported plans to follow the AAP Safe Sleep guidelines (all p < 0.001),
      likelihood to breastfeed (p < 0.001), confidence in ability to breastfeed for
      more than 6 months (p < 0.001), knowledge of local breastfeeding support
      resources (p < 0.001), knowledge of ways to avoid second-hand smoke exposure (p <
      0.001) and knowledge of local tobacco cessation services (p = 0.004). Based on
      the result of the pre- and post-event surveys, certified Safe Sleep Instructors
      were able to plan and host successful events to increase knowledge and confidence
      related to risk reduction strategies to reduce sleep-related infant deaths.

TI  - Association of Prenatal Maternal Depression and Anxiety Symptoms With Infant
      White Matter Microstructure.
PG  - 973-981
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.2132 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Maternal depression and anxiety can have deleterious and lifelong
      consequences on child development. However, many aspects of the association of
      early brain development with maternal symptoms remain unclear. Understanding the 
      timing of potential neurobiological alterations holds inherent value for the
      development and evaluation of future therapies and interventions. Objective: To
      examine the association between exposure to prenatal maternal depression and
      anxiety symptoms and offspring white matter microstructure at 1 month of age.
      Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads
      used a composite of depression and anxiety symptoms measured in mothers during
      the third trimester of pregnancy and measures of white matter microstructure
      characterized in the mothers' 1-month offspring using diffusion tensor imaging
      and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging performed from October 1, 
      2014, to November 30, 2016. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an
      academic research facility during natural, nonsedated sleep. Main Outcomes and
      Measures: Brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate
      the association between maternal depression and anxiety and 1-month infant white 
      matter microstructure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and neurite
      orientation dispersion and density imaging findings. Results: In the 101
      mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] age of mothers, 33.22 [3.99] years; mean age of
      infants at magnetic resonance imaging, 33.07 days [range, 18-50 days]; 92 white
      mothers [91.1%]; 53 male infants [52.5%]), lower 1-month white matter
      microstructure (decreased neurite density and increased mean, radial, and axial
      diffusivity) was associated in right frontal white matter microstructure with
      higher prenatal maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. Significant sex x
      symptom interactions with measures of white matter microstructure were also
      observed, suggesting that white matter development may be differentially
      sensitive to maternal depression and anxiety symptoms in males and females during
      the prenatal period. Conclusions and Relevance: These data highlight the
      importance of the prenatal period to early brain development and suggest that the
      underlying white matter microstructure is associated with the continuum of
      prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.

TI  - Making sleep easier: pharmacological interventions for insomnia.
PG  - 1465-1473
LID - 10.1080/14656566.2018.1511705 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The disorder insomnia represents a relevant and frequent condition 
      in clinical care. Cognitive behavioral therapy of insomnia (CBT-I) is regarded as
      first line treatment. Pharmacotherapy can be considered if CBT-I is not available
      or effective. Therefore, pharmacological approaches for disturbed sleep are still
      among the most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments in clinical care.
      Areas covered: In this review, the authors highlight basic physiological pathways
      of sleep regulation to understand fundamental pharmacological principles of sleep
      medicine. Available guidelines and reviews are summarized and recommendations
      formulated regarding the use of benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine
      receptor agonists, melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, sedating
      antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines, and orexin receptor
      antagonists in insomnia disorder. Variations in the treatment of insomnia
      disorder in subpopulations with increased prevalence of sleep disorders -
      childhood, pregnancy and old age - are specified. Expert opinion: The
      well-established off-label use of hypnotic drugs should evocate a debate about a 
      better alignment of clinical practice and scientific evidence and guidelines.
      Better understanding of sleep regulation could help in the development of
      completely new substance classes. Focusing subjective sleep disturbances, such as
      superficial sleep perception might help identify novel pathways.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: There is limited evidence about the role of
      herbal and traditional medicine in pregnancy-related insomnia. Extant documents
      on traditional Persian medicine refer to many plants which could induce sleep and
      which were used by pregnant women. In Iran, local herbal shops continue to
      provide these herbs to pregnant women to treat insomnia. One such herb is Lactuca
      sativa L. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lettuce seed on
      pregnant women for the treatment of insomnia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a
      prospective randomized clinical trial, 100 pregnant women with insomnia aged
      20-45 years were assigned to receive capsules containing 1000mg of lettuce seed
      or a placebo daily for two weeks. The main outcome was the quality of sleep,
      which was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: Each
      group contained 50 participants. An improvement in the PSQI score was
      significantly greater in patients receiving lettuce seed than those receiving the
      placebo. Linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for the other 
      variables, the average sleep score of the experimental group was significantly
      lower than for the placebo group (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this
      study suggest that lettuce seed decreased insomnia during pregnancy and could be 
      recommended as a safe natural remedy for treatment of pregnancy-related insomnia.

TI  - Modifying maternal sleep position in the third trimester of pregnancy with
      positional therapy: a randomised pilot trial.
PG  - e020256
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020256 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the percentage of time spent supine during sleep
      in the third trimester of pregnancy could be reduced using a positional therapy
      device (PrenaBelt) compared with a sham device. DESIGN: A double-blind,
      randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over pilot trial. SETTING: Conducted between
      March 2016 and January 2017, at a single, tertiary-level centre in Canada.
      PARTICIPANTS: 23 participants entered the study. 20 participants completed the
      study. Participants were low-risk, singleton, third-trimester pregnant women aged
      18 years and older with body mass index <35 kg/m(2) at the first antenatal
      appointment for the index pregnancy and without known fetal abnormalities,
      pregnancy complications or medical conditions complicating sleep. INTERVENTIONS: 
      A two-night, polysomnography study in a sleep laboratory. Participants were
      randomised by computer-generated, one-to-one, simple randomisation to receive
      either a PrenaBelt or a sham-PrenaBelt on the first night and were crossed over
      to the alternate device on the second night. Allocation concealment was by
      unmarked, security-tinted, sealed envelopes. Participants, the recruiter and
      personnel involved in setting up, conducting, scoring and interpreting the
      polysomnogram were blinded to allocation. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:
      The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent supine during sleep.
      Secondary outcomes included maternal sleep architecture, respiration,
      self-reported sleep position and feedback. RESULTS: The median percentage of
      sleep time supine was reduced from 16.4% on the sham night to 3.5% on the
      PrenaBelt night (pseudomedian=5.8, p=0.03). We were unable to demonstrate
      differences in sleep architecture or respiration. Participants underestimated the
      time they spent sleeping supine by 7.0%, and six (30%) participants indicated
      they would make changes to the PrenaBelt. There were no harms in this study.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the percentage of sleep time supine
      during late pregnancy can be significantly reduced via positional therapy. TRIAL

TI  - Neuroimmune Alterations in Autism: A Translational Analysis Focusing on the
      Animal Model of Autism Induced by Prenatal Exposure to Valproic Acid.
PG  - 285-299
LID - 10.1159/000492113 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent developmental disorder
      characterized by deficits in communication and social interaction and in
      stereotyped or repetitive behaviors. Besides the classical behavioral dyad,
      several comorbidities are frequently present in patients with ASD, such as
      anxiety, epilepsy, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction.
      Although the etiology of ASD remains unclear, there is supporting evidence for
      the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors. Valproic acid (VPA) is
      an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer that, when used during the gestational
      period, increases the risk of ASD in the offspring. The animal model of autism
      induced by prenatal exposure to VPA demonstrates important structural and
      behavioral features that can be observed in individuals with autism; it is thus
      an excellent tool for testing new drug targets and developing novel behavioral
      and drug therapies. In addition, immunological alterations during pregnancy could
      affect the developing embryo because immune molecules can pass through the
      placental barrier. In fact, exposure to pathogens during the pregnancy is a known
      risk factor for ASD, and maternal immune activation can lead to autistic-like
      features in animals. Interestingly, neuroimmune alterations are common in both
      autistic individuals and in animal models of ASD. We summarize here the important
      alterations in inflammatory markers, such as cytokines and chemokines, in
      patients with ASD and in the VPA animal model.

TI  - Cognitive functioning of female nurses during the night shift: The impact of age,
      clock time, time awake and subjective sleepiness.
PG  - 1595-1607
LID - 10.1080/07420528.2018.1497642 [doi]
AB  - Decline in cognitive functioning in the workplace is a major concern for health
      care systems. Understanding factors associated with nighttime functioning is
      imperative for instituting organizational risk management policies and developing
      personalized countermeasures. The present study aims to identify individual
      factors associated with cognitive functioning during the night shift of hospital 
      nurses working on irregular rotating-shift schedules. Ninety-two female nurses
      were recruited from 17 wards in two general hospitals, using convenience sampling
      by clusters. Inclusion criteria were working at least 28 h a week (75% of full
      time) and one night shift per week. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, diagnosed 
      sleep disorders or medical conditions that may affect sleep and/or function.
      Cognitive performance was measured during the middle (03:00 h) and at the end
      (07:00 h) of the night shift using the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) and 
      the Letter Cancellation Task (LCT) over two night shifts. Subjective sleepiness
      was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at the same time points.
      All participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Munich
      ChronoType Questionnaire for Shift-Workers (MCTQShift) and the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep duration 24 h before the night shift and time awake
      since last sleep opportunity were monitored by actigraphy. Univariate repeated
      measures ANOVA found main effects for clock time (p<0.001), age (p<0.05), time
      awake (p<0.05) and sleepiness (p<0.01) for DSST correct responses; main effects
      for clock time (p<0.001) and sleepiness (p<0.001) for LCT capacity; and main
      effects for clock time (p<0.001) and age (p<0.01) for LCT omission errors. All
      factors remained significant in a mixed-model analysis for DSST. Cognitive
      performance among hospital nurses is low during the middle of the night shift and
      increases at the end of the shift; decreased functioning is associated with
      increased subjective sleepiness, older age and prolonged time awake. Identifying 
      factors contributing to performance during the night shift may provide a basis
      for the development of risk management policies and preventative interventions.

TI  - Arsenic Exposure Contributes to the Bioenergetic Damage in an Alzheimer's Disease
      Model.
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00278 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide, every year there is an increase in the number of people exposed to
      inorganic arsenic (iAs) via drinking water. Human populations present impaired
      cognitive function as a result of prenatal and childhood iAs exposure, while
      studies in animal models demonstrate neurobehavioral deficits accompanied by
      neurotransmitter, protein, and enzyme alterations. Similar impairments have been 
      observed in close association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to
      determine whether iAs promotes the pathophysiological progress of AD, we used the
      3xTgAD mouse model. Mice were exposed to iAs in drinking water from gestation
      until 6 months (As-3xTgAD group) and compared with control animals without
      arsenic (3xTgAD group). We investigated the behavior phenotype on a test battery 
      (circadian rhythm, locomotor behavior, Morris water maze, and contextual fear
      conditioning). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive oxygen species, lipid
      peroxidation, and respiration rates of mitochondria were evaluated, antioxidant
      components were detected by immunoblots, and immunohistochemical studies were
      performed to reveal AD markers. As-3xTgAD displayed alterations in their
      circadian rhythm and exhibited longer freezing time and escape latencies compared
      to the control group. The bioenergetic profile revealed decreased ATP levels
      accompanied by the decline of complex I, and an oxidant state in the hippocampus.
      On the other hand, the cortex showed no changes of oxidant stress and complex I; 
      however, the antioxidant response was increased. Higher immunopositivity to
      amyloid isoforms and to phosphorylated tau was observed in frontal cortex and
      hippocampus of exposed animals. In conclusion, mitochondrial dysfunction may be
      one of the triggering factors through which chronic iAs exposure exacerbates
      brain AD-like pathology.

TI  - Sleeping problems during pregnancy-a risk factor for postnatal depressiveness.
LID - 10.1007/s00737-018-0903-5 [doi]
AB  - In the general population, sleeping problems can precede an episode of
      depression. We hypothesized that sleeping problems during pregnancy, including
      insomnia symptoms, shortened sleep, and daytime tiredness, are related to
      maternal postnatal depressiveness. We conducted a prospective study evaluating
      sleep and depressive symptoms, both prenatally (around gestational week 32) and
      postnatally (around 3 months after delivery) in the longitudinal CHILD-SLEEP
      birth cohort in Finland. Prenatally, 1667 women returned the questionnaire, of
      which 1398 women participated also at the postnatal follow-up. Sleep was measured
      with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ) and depressive symptoms with a
      10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
      (CES-D). Altogether, 10.3% of the women had postnatal depressiveness (CES-D >/=
      10 points). After adjusting for main background characteristics and prenatal
      depressiveness (CES-D >/= 10), poor general sleep quality (AOR 1.87, 95% CI
      1.21-2.88), tiredness during the day (AOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.41-3.38), short sleep
      </= 6 and </= 7 h, sleep latency > 20 min, and sleep loss >/= 2 h were associated
      with postnatal depressiveness (all p < .050). Postnatally, after the adjustment
      for background characteristics, virtually all sleeping problems (i.e., difficulty
      falling asleep (AOR 7.93, 95% CI 4.76-13.20)), except frequent night awakenings
      per week or severe sleepiness during the day, were related to concurrent
      postnatal depressiveness. Thus, several prenatal and postnatal sleeping problems 
      are associated with increased depressive symptoms 3 months postnatally. Screening
      of maternal prenatal sleeping problems, even without depressive symptoms during
      pregnancy or lifetime, would help to identify women at an increased risk for
      postnatal depressiveness.

LID - 10.1113/JP276083 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Light at night is essential to a 24/7 society, but it has negative
      consequences on health. Basically, light at night induces an alteration of our
      biological clocks, known as chronodisruption, with effects even when this occurs 
      during pregnancy. Here we explored the developmental impact of gestational
      chronodisruption (chronic photoperiod shift, CPS) on adult and fetal adrenal
      biorhythms and function. We found that gestational chronodisruption altered fetal
      and adult adrenal function, at the molecular, morphological and physiological
      levels. The differences between control and CPS offspring suggest
      desynchronization of the adrenal circadian clock and steroidogenic pathway,
      leading to abnormal stress responses and metabolic adaptation, potentially
      increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases. ABSTRACT: Light at night is
      essential to a 24/7 society, but it has negative consequences on health.
      Basically, light at night induces an alteration of our biological clocks, known
      as chronodisruption, with effects even when this occurs during pregnancy. Indeed,
      an abnormal photoperiod during gestation alters fetal development, inducing
      long-term effects on the offspring. Accordingly, we carried out a longitudinal
      study in rats, exploring the impact of gestational chronodisruption on the
      adrenal biorhythms and function of the offspring. Adult rats (90 days old)
      gestated under chronic photoperiod shift (CPS) decrease the time spent in the
      open arm zone of an elevated plus maze to 62% and increase the rearing time to
      170%. CPS adults maintained individual daily changes in corticosterone, but their
      acrophases were distributed from 12.00 h to 06.00 h. CPS offspring maintained
      clock gene expression and oscillation, nevertheless no daily rhythm was observed 
      in genes involved in the regulation and synthesis of steroids. Consistent with
      adult adrenal gland being programmed during fetal life, blunted daily rhythms of 
      corticosterone, core clock gene machinery, and steroidogenic genes were observed 
      in CPS fetal adrenal glands. Comparisons of the global transcriptome of CPS
      versus control fetal adrenal gland revealed that 1078 genes were differentially
      expressed (641 down-regulated and 437 up-regulated). In silico analysis revealed 
      significant changes in Lipid Metabolism, Small Molecule Biochemistry, Cellular
      Development and the Inflammatory Response pathway (z score: 48-20). Altogether,
      the present results demonstrate that gestational chronodisruption changed fetal
      and adult adrenal function. This could translate to long-term abnormal stress
      responses and metabolic adaptation, increasing the risk of developing chronic
      diseases.

TI  - Sleep, nutrition, and physical activity interventions to prevent obesity in
      infancy: follow-up of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) randomized
      controlled trial at ages 3.5 and 5 y.
PG  - 228-236
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqy090 [doi]
AB  - Background: Our Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study suggested that a 
      brief sleep intervention in infancy reduced the risk of obesity at age 2 y. In
      contrast, we observed no benefit from the nutrition and activity intervention.
      Objective: The objective of the study was to determine how these interventions
      influenced growth at ages 3.5 and 5 y compared with usual care (Control). Design:
      A follow-up of a parallel, 4-arm, single-blind, 2-y, randomized controlled trial 
      in 802 women (86% European, 48% primiparous) recruited in pregnancy (58% response
      rate) was undertaken. All groups received standard Well-Child care with
      additional support for 3 intervention groups: FAB (promotion of breastfeeding,
      healthy eating, physical activity: 8 contacts, antenatal, 18 mo); Sleep
      (prevention of sleep problems: antenatal, 3 wk); Combination (both
      interventions). Follow-up measures were collected by staff blinded to group
      allocation. The primary outcome was child body mass index (BMI) z score, and
      secondary outcomes were prevalence of obesity (BMI >/=95th percentile),
      self-regulation (psychological measures), sleep, physical activity
      (accelerometry, questionnaires), and dietary intake (food-frequency
      questionnaire). Analyses were conducted through the use of multiple imputation.
      Results: Retention was 77% at age 3.5 y and 69% at age 5 y. Children in the FAB
      group had significantly higher BMI z scores than did Controls at age 5 y
      (adjusted difference: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47) but not at age 3.5 y (0.15; 95%
      CI: -0.04, 0.34). Children who received the Sleep intervention (Sleep and
      Combination groups) had significantly lower BMI z scores at age 3.5 y (-0.24; 95%
      CI: -0.38, -0.10) and at age 5 y (-0.23; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.07) than children who 
      did not (Control and FAB groups). Conclusions: A conventional intervention had
      unexpected adverse long-term weight outcomes, whereas positive outcomes from a
      less conventional sleep intervention remained promising at age 5 y. More
      intensive or extended sleep intervention might have larger or longer-lasting
      effects and should be investigated. This trial was registered at
      clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00892983.

AB  - Women often experience sleep disturbances and worsening sleep quality throughout 
      pregnancy and postpartum. Circadian rhythms are closely linked to sleep problems 
      and mood disorders. This systematic review provides a summary of studies of
      circadian rhythms and associated sleep problems and maternal distress, among
      postpartum women. Articles were idenitfied through a systematic literature
      search. Circadian rhythm disturbances were strongly correlated with depression,
      social factors and mothers`s exposure to light postpartum. Future research should
      include larger, prospective studies as well as randomized controlled trials for
      measuring effect of circadian rhythm interventions on postpartum mental health

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy can present as snoring and/or
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and the prevalence is increasing due to the
      increase in maternal obesity. Pregnant women often present with fatigue and
      daytime sleepiness rather than the classic symptoms. Habitual snoring, older age,
      chronic hypertension, and high prepregnancy body mass index are reliable
      indicators of increased risk for SDB and should trigger further testing. The gold
      standard for diagnosis of OSA is an overnight laboratory polysomnography.
      Although there are no studies linking SDB to poor fetal outcomes, fetal
      well-being remains paramount throughout the course of pregnancy.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease is a common disorder during pregnancy
      that may significantly impact on the health of affected women, leading to
      negative consequences in the short and long term. An accurate diagnosis helps to 
      recognize the syndrome and choose the optimal therapeutic strategy, based on the 
      characteristics and needs of the patient. This article summarizes the main
      treatment options recommended by the consensus clinical guidelines of the
      International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group and provides a short guide to
      the management of restless leg syndrome during pregnancy in clinical practice.

AB  - Using scoping review methodology, this article investigates the literature on
      sleep duration, continuity/efficiency, timing, daytime sleepiness/alertness, and 
      perceived sleep quality in each trimester of a healthy pregnancy. Data suggest
      significant variability in sleep between women, with less evidence to support
      major changes in sleep health across trimesters. There is a need for further
      research on this topic to better inform women and their health providers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main aim of this study was to examine the prospective impact of
      maternal postpartum PTSD on several standardized child sleep variables two years 
      postpartum in a large, population-based cohort of mothers. Moreover, we
      investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child
      factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child
      sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum.
      METHODS: This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a
      prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the
      hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks
      and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original 
      participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n=1480. All
      child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were
      entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding
      factors. RESULTS: Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep
      variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding
      factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD
      symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night
      wakings (beta=0.10 and beta=0.08, respectively), duration of settling time
      (beta=0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (beta=0.12, all 
      p<.01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to
      maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight
      weeks. LIMITATIONS: Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be 
      influenced by maternal mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed for the
      first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated
      with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or
      behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway. Early detection
      and treatment of maternal postpartum PTSD may prevent or improve sleep problems
      and long-term child development.

      Review.
PG  - e2756
LID - 10.7759/cureus.2756 [doi]
AB  - Sugar-sweetened beverages containing caffeine are widely used among humans
      nowadays and can have negative consequences on the overall health. Our study aims
      to discuss the effects of these sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and how they can 
      impact the health in different ways particularly on the brain. Some of the
      mechanisms by which soft drinks can exert adverse effects include an increase in 
      glutathione-6-dehydrogenase level, increased levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA), glutamate and dopamine alteration in brain waves on
      electroencephalography (EEG) eventually leading to stroke and dementia. They can 
      increase the oxidative stress by a decreasing monoamine oxidase and acetylcholine
      esterase and antioxidants such as glutathione and catalase. The sleep quality and
      duration of sleep is also significantly affected by their increased consumption. 
      Also, the consumption of sodium benzoate (found in beverages) on impairing
      memory, motor coordination, affecting reduced glutathione (GSH), increasing the
      malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the brain and producing attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children is emphasized. Finally, we will
      highlight how diet drinks can also be harmful and the maternal consumption of
      chocolate or soft drinks during pregnancy and postnatal period can be linked to
      cognitive impairment and child obesity.

TI  - Screening for Mental Health Disorders among Pregnant Women Availing Antenatal
      Care at a Government Maternity Hospital in Bengaluru City.
PG  - 343-348
LID - 10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_41_18 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Antepartum anxiety and depression are two of the most common risk
      factors for the development of postpartum depression. Women are at a higher risk 
      of developing depression and suffering from mental disorders during pregnancy and
      the postnatal period. Psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy have
      physiological consequences for the fetus, such as impaired blood flow leading to 
      low birth weight, as well as cognitive delay and behavioral problems. Objectives:
      To screen antenatal women for common mental health disorders and to determine the
      factors associated with mental health disorders during pregnancy. Methods: A
      cross-sectional study among 208 pregnant mothers in the third trimester attending
      the antenatal clinic at a Government Maternity Home in a low-income urban area of
      Bengaluru was conducted using clinical interview schedule-revised (CIS-R)
      questionnaire as a screening tool for detecting the presence of mental morbidity.
      Data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Results: In the study
      population, 12 (5.8%) screened positive for antepartum mental morbidities, of
      which depression was the most common. 3.8% of all women screened positive for
      depression, with 15.4% demonstrating depressive symptoms. Overall, 82 (39.4%) had
      the presence of one or more psychological symptoms, including fatigue,
      irritability, anxiety, and problems with sleep and concentration but scored less 
      than the CIS-R cutoff score of 12. Factors associated with the presence of
      antepartum mental morbidities included poor relationships with their spouse,
      poor/satisfactory relationship with siblings or in-laws, as well as the desire to
      have a male child. Conclusion: In the study population, 12 (5.8%) screened
      positive for antepartum mental morbidities. Considering the effects on quality of
      life for these women as well as poor fetal outcomes associated with maternal
      mental morbidity, it is important to include screening and treatment of mental
      morbidity as a part of routine antenatal care.

AB  - Changes in sleep are ubiquitous in the perinatal period and it is important to be
      able to determine when these changes are significant enough to indicate sleep
      deficiency associated with increased risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes. 
      Guidelines for identifying sleep deficiency include insomnia symptoms,
      excessively shortened sleep duration, and perception of insufficient or
      nonrestful sleep. Causes and complicating factors related to such sleep problems 
      have been well-documented and are used to tailor behavioral and pharmacologic
      treatments for women who are pregnant or in the early postpartum period.

TI  - Modifying Maternal Sleep Position in Late Pregnancy Through Positional Therapy: A
      Feasibility Study.
PG  - 1387-1397
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.7280 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To test whether a customized positional therapy device,
      PrenaBelt, would reduce time spent sleeping supine and evaluate any change in
      maternal or fetal parameters, in a group of healthy pregnant women in the third
      trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: Participants underwent an in-home, overnight
      sleep study during late pregnancy (32-38 weeks). Participants were observed over 
      2 nights: 1 night when the PrenaBelt was not worn (nonintervention or control)
      and 1 night when it was (intervention). The intervention night was randomly
      allocated, and the study nights were consecutive. On the control night,
      participants were filmed using a night-capable (infrared) video camera, maternal 
      sleep was measured by the Watch-PAT200, and the fetus was continuously monitored 
      using the Monica AN24. On the intervention night, video, maternal, and fetal
      monitoring were repeated with the addition of the mother wearing the PrenaBelt.
      RESULTS: A total of 25 healthy pregnant women were studied. Four had missing data
      for the Watch-PAT or Monica, and eight had missing or disrupted video data.
      Video-determined time in bed was not significantly different during intervention 
      and control nights (P = .196, r = -.23). Median time spent supine during the
      intervention night was reduced from 48.3 minutes, to 28.5 minutes during the
      control night (P = .064, r = -.33). The difference in the proportion of time
      spent supine was significant (P = .039). There was no significant difference in
      objectively estimated sleep time (P = .651, r = -.07). Improvement was observed
      in both maternal and fetal parameters during the intervention night with an
      increase in median minimum maternal oxygen saturations (control = 91.6%,
      intervention = 92.4%, P = .006, r = -.42), fewer maternal oxygen desaturations
      (control = 7.1, intervention = 5.9, P = .095, r = -.26), and fewer fetal heart
      rate decelerations (control = 14.0, intervention = 10.4, P = .045, r = -.31)
      compared to the control night. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide preliminary evidence 
      that an intervention to reduce supine sleep in late pregnancy may provide
      maternal and fetal health benefits, with minimal effect on maternal perception of
      sleep quality and objectively estimated sleep time. Further research to explore
      relationships between objectively determined maternal sleep position, maternal
      respiratory indices, and fetal well-being is warranted.

TI  - Elective cesarean delivery at term and the long-term risk for respiratory
      morbidity of the offspring.
PG  - 1653-1659
LID - 10.1007/s00431-018-3225-8 [doi]
AB  - Maternal morbidity is associated with cesarean deliveries. However, new evidence 
      suggests that short- and long-term neonatal morbidity is also associated. This
      includes respiratory morbidity with conflicting results. To determine whether
      mode of delivery has an impact on the long-term risk for respiratory morbidity in
      the offspring, a population-based cohort analysis was conducted including all
      singleton term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single tertiary
      medical center. A comparison was performed between children delivered via
      elective cesarean delivery (CD) and those delivered vaginally. Multiple
      gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded from the
      analysis as were all cases of urgent CDs. Pediatric hospitalizations involving
      respiratory morbidity of offspring up to the age of 18 years were evaluated. A
      Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity 
      incidence and a Cox regression model to control for confounders. During the study
      period, 132,054 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 8.9% were via
      elective CDs (n = 11,746) and 91.1% (n = 120,308) were vaginal deliveries.
      Hospitalizations of the offspring involving respiratory morbidity were
      significantly more common in offspring delivered by CDs (5.2 vs. 4.3% in vaginal 
      deliveries, p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a
      significantly higher cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity in the
      elective CD group (log rank p < 0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model,
      while controlling for maternal age, gestational age, and birthweight, CD
      exhibited a significant and independent association with long-term respiratory
      morbidity of the offspring (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.22 (CI, 1.12-1.33), p <
      0.001).Conclusion: Elective cesarean delivery at term is a significant risk
      factor for long-term pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring. What is
      Known: * Cesarean delivery is a major surgery with known possible complications. 
      * Cesarean delivery has possible immediate complications for the newborn
      including respiratory complications. What is New: * Our study shows more long
      term respiratory morbidity in the CD group including asthma and obstructive sleep
      apnea. * Different possible explanations have been proposed including exposure to
      maternal flora during vaginal delivery and the stress hormones secreted during
      contractions and delivery.

TI  - [Circadian rhythms of antioxidant enzyme's activity in young and adult rats under
      light deprivation conditions.]
PG  - 211-222
AB  - We studied the age-related features of circadian rhythms of superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD) and catalase activity in the liver of rats under light deprivation. In
      standard light conditions (LD), significant daily fluctuations in SOD activity
      with a maximum at 07:00 am was detected only in young animals (1,5 months) but
      catalase activity was observed in young (1,5 months) and in adults (7,5 months)
      with peak at 04:00 am. The daily dynamics of total and specific activity of SOD
      and catalase in the liver in young and adult rats differed depending on the
      period of ontogeny in which the impact of light deprivation began. When the
      females and offspring were moved to darkness after birth (group LD/DD), the
      circadian rhythms of SOD and catalase activitys were observed in young and were
      absent in adult rats. However, circadian rhythms of the antioxidant enzymes (AOE)
      activities were inherent only adult rats when light deprivation impacted on
      pregnant females (group DD/DD). Changes in circadian rhythms under light
      deprivation were characterized either by a phase shift of the enzymes activity
      (in the LD/DD group) or by a violation of their develpoment in ontogeny (in the
      DD/DD group). During aging significant decreasing of catalase activity was
      compensated by an increase in the amplitude of circadian rhythms of activity of
      this enzyme in animals of all groups. A distinctive feature of daily fluctuations
      in AOcapital IE, Cyrillic activity in young rats in LD and LD/DD groups can be
      considered the presence of an ultradian rhythm in the general circadian cycle,
      which had a second peak with a smaller amplitude and shorter period.

TI  - Effect of skin-to-skin contact on parents' sleep quality, mood, parent-infant
      interaction and cortisol concentrations in neonatal care units: study protocol of
      a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e021606
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-021606 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Separation after preterm birth is a major stressor for infants and 
      parents. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is a method of care suitable to use in the
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to minimise separation between parents and
      infants. Less separation leads to increased possibilities for parent-infant
      interaction, provided that the parents' sleep quality is satisfactory. We aimed
      to evaluate the effect of continuous SSC on sleep quality and mood in parents of 
      preterm infants born <33 weeks of gestation as well as the quality of
      parent-infant interaction and salivary cortisol concentrations at the time of
      discharge. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised intervention study with two
      arms-intervention versus standard care. Data will be collected from 50 families. 
      Eligible families will be randomly allocated to intervention or standard care
      when transferred from the intensive care room to the family-room in the NICU. The
      intervention consists of continuous SSC for four consecutive days and nights in
      the family-room. Data will be collected every day during the intervention and
      again at the time of discharge from the hospital. Outcome measures comprise
      activity tracker (Actigraph); validated self-rated questionnaires concerning
      sleep, mood and bonding; observed scorings of parental sensitivity and emotional 
      availability and salivary cortisol. Data will be analysed with pairwise, repeated
      measures, Mann Whitney U-test will be used to compare groups and analysis of
      variance will be used to adjust for different hospitals and parents' gender.
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Regional Research Ethics
      Board at an appropriate university (2016/89-31). The results will be published in
      scientific journals. We will also use conferences and social media to disseminate
      our findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03004677.

TI  - Prenatal stress and the development of psychopathology: Lifestyle behaviors as a 
      fundamental part of the puzzle.
PG  - 1129-1144
LID - 10.1017/S0954579418000494 [doi]
AB  - Maternal psychological stress, depression, and anxiety during pregnancy (prenatal
      stress; PNS) are thought to impact fetal development with long-term effects on
      offspring outcome. These effects would include physical and mental health,
      including psychopathology. Maternal sleep, diet, and exercise during pregnancy
      are lifestyle behaviors that are understudied and often solely included in PNS
      studies as confounders. However, there are indications that these lifestyle
      behaviors may actually constitute essential mediators between PNS and fetal
      programming processes. The goal of this theoretical review was to investigate
      this idea by looking at the evidence for associations between PNS and sleep,
      diet, and exercise, and by piecing together the information on potential
      underlying mechanisms and causal pathways through which these factors may affect 
      the offspring. The analysis of the literature led to the conclusion that sleep,
      diet, and exercise during pregnancy, may have fundamental roles as mediators
      between PNS and maternal pregnancy physiology. By integrating these lifestyle
      behaviors into models of prenatal programming of development, a qualitatively
      higher and more comprehensive understanding of the prenatal origins of
      psychopathology can be obtained. The review finalizes by discussing some of the
      present challenges facing the field of PNS and offspring programming, and
      offering solutions for future research.

TI  - Body Weight Status and Sleep Disturbances During Pregnancy: Does Adherence to
      Gestational Weight Gain Guidelines Matter?
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2017.6892 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the effect of preconception body mass index (BMI) and/or
      gestational weight gain (GWG) on the occurrence of sleep disorders over the whole
      pregnancy. METHODS: A sample of 2,366 pregnant women, recruited in their 1st
      trimester (TM), was evaluated until delivery for their sleeping characteristics, 
      using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Mixed or multinomial logistic
      modeling was applied, as appropriate. RESULTS: When compared with TM 1, PSQI
      score was the lowest at TM 2 (beta = -1.03; 95% CI: -1.17 to -0.89) and highest
      in TM 3 (beta = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10-0.45). Obese (beta = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.17-0.78) 
      and overweight women (beta = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.00-0.48) exhibited an overall
      greater PSQI than normal-weight women over the whole pregnancy. When
      sociodemographic factors were accounted for, the effect size was reduced by 25%
      among obese women (beta = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.06-0.68), but was no more not
      significant in overweight women (beta = 0.06; 95% CI: -0.17 to 0.30). Both obese 
      and overweight women still exhibited, although at a lower extend, a greater PSQI 
      than normal-weight women. Further adjustment for GWG had no effect on these
      observations. Obese women almost had a four-fold increased risk (OR = 3.89; 95%
      CI: 2.50-6.06) of being snorers in the three TMs. While GWG had only a minor
      effect (aOR = 3.83; 95% CI: 2.43-6.03), sociodemographic factors increased the
      odds of being habitual snorer (aOR = 4.04; 95% CI: 2.57-6.35). CONCLUSIONS: High 
      prepregnancy BMI together with sociodemographic correlates appear as the most
      critical for sleep disturbances across pregnancy. GWG is of marginal importance, 
      especially regarding snoring. These findings confirm the importance of
      considering the initial body weight status of women in tailoring sleep hygiene
      advises irrespective of the recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy. The
      results also underscore the need to providing as early as possible during a
      pregnancy, supportive tools to ethnic minorities, multiparous, and women from
      deprived socioeconomic neighborhoods.

TI  - Are serum ferritin and transferrin saturation risk markers for restless legs
      syndrome in young adults? Longitudinal and cross-sectional data from the Western 
      Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study.
PG  - e12741
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12741 [doi]
AB  - Restless legs syndrome has been associated with serum iron deficiency in clinical
      studies. However, studies investigating this relationship have had inconsistent
      results and there are no studies in young adults. Therefore, we investigated the 
      relationship between serum measures of iron stores and restless legs syndrome in 
      young adults in the community. Participants in the Western Australian Pregnancy
      Cohort (Raine) Study answered questions on restless legs syndrome (n = 1,100, 54%
      female) at age 22 years, and provided serum measures of iron stores (ferritin and
      transferrin saturation) at ages 17 and 22 years. Restless legs syndrome was
      diagnosed when four International RLS Study Group criteria were met (urge to
      move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening during evening/night) and these
      symptoms occurred >/=5 times per month. Logistic regression was used to assess
      associations between serum iron stores and restless legs syndrome, adjusting for 
      potential confounders. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome at age 22 years
      was 3.0% (n = 33, 70% female). Among those who provided restless legs syndrome
      and iron data at age 22 years (n = 865), the median (interquartile range)
      ferritin was not different between the restless legs syndrome (55 [29.5-103.5]
      microg L(-1) ) and the non-restless legs syndrome group (65.0 [35.0-103.3] microg
      L(-1) , p = 0.2), nor were there differences in iron deficiency prevalence (p =
      0.36). There was no association between restless legs syndrome (22 years) and
      iron stores (17, 22 years) before or after adjustment for potential confounders. 
      There was no association between restless legs syndrome at 22 years and iron
      stores at 17 or 22 years in this cohort. Serum iron stores may not be a useful
      indicator of restless legs syndrome risk in young adults in the community.

AB  - AIM: To assess stress level and coping strategies in chronic insomnia as its
      potential psychological factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included
      29 patients (19 women), aged 18-55 years old (mean age 33.1+/-2.1 years), with
      chronic insomnia diagnosed in accordance with the International Classification of
      Sleep Disorders III. The control group was formed by 32 subjects (11 men), aged
      18-55 years old (mean age 31.5+/-2.0 years), without sleep disorders. Insomnia
      Severity Index and polysomnography were used to evaluate sleep quality. Stress
      level and coping strategies were assessed via an interview (stressfull life
      events during last year, their duration, their controllability, unexpectedness,
      and outcome), and by 'Level of subjective control' and 'Ways of coping
      questionnaires'. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable by the mean number of
      significant events during last year (4.97+/-0.34 vs 4.72+/-0.23, p=0.54).
      Patients with insomnia more often reported the loss of a relative (p=0.04), while
      controls more frequently reported positive events, such as pregnancy (p=0.007) or
      wedding (p=0.02) among close ones. Insomniacs more often described the stressful 
      events as uncontrolled (p<0.001) and prolonged (p<0.001). They demonstrated lower
      indices of all the scales of the 'Level of subjective control', questionnaire
      except the scale of interpersonal attitudes. They rarely implemented confrontive 
      coping (p=0.001), seeking social support (p<0.001), accepting responsibility
      (p<0.001) and positive reappraisal (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The interpretation of 
      stressful events and personal response in insomnia patients might be considered
      as psychological risk factors for insomnia development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of relaxation exercises on subjective sleep
      quality of in third-trimester pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pretest 
      posttest randomized controlled trial recruited 84 pregnant women in the third
      trimester. Following random assignment of subjects, the treatment group (n=46)
      performed relaxation exercises for four weeks and the control group (n=46)
      received standart cares. At baseline and after the intervention sleep quality was
      assessed. Data obtained were analyzed in SPSS. RESULTS: The mean score of the
      global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was 7.12+/-3.66. It was determined that
      relaxation exercises improved some sleep quality subscales including subjective
      sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency, sleep
      disturbances, daytime dysfunction and global sleep quality. The difference
      between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05).
      CONCLUSION: A four -week compact disc guide relaxation exercises program can be
      effective in improving sleep quality.

TI  - Depletion of embryonic microglia using the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 has adverse
      sex-specific effects on mice, including accelerated weight gain, hyperactivity
      and anxiolytic-like behaviour.

AB  - Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS).
      Originally thought to be primarily responsible for disposing of cellular debris
      and responding to neural insults, emerging research now shows that microglia are 
      highly dynamic cells involved in a variety of neurodevelopmental processes. The
      hypothalamus is a brain region critical for maintaining homeostatic processes
      such as energy balance, thirst, food intake, reproduction, and circadian rhythms.
      Given that microglia colonize the embryonic brain alongside key steps of
      hypothalamic development, here we tested whether microglia are required for the
      proper establishment of this brain region. The Colony-stimulating factor-1
      receptor (Csf1r) is expressed by microglia, macrophages and osteoclasts, and is
      required for their proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Therefore, to
      eliminate microglia from the fetal brain, we treated pregnant dams with the CSF1R
      inhibitor PLX5622. We showed that approximately 99% of microglia were eliminated 
      by embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) after pregnant dams were placed on a PLX5622 diet
      starting at E3.5. Following microglia depletion, we observed elevated numbers of 
      apoptotic cells accumulating throughout the developing hypothalamus. Once the
      PLX5622 diet was removed, microglia repopulated the postnatal brain within 7days 
      and did not appear to repopulate from Nestin+precursors. Embryonic microglia
      depletion also resulted in a decreased litter size, as well as an increase in the
      number of pups that died within the first two postnatal days of life. In pups
      that survived, the elimination of microglia in the fetal brain resulted in a
      decrease in the number of Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and a concomitant
      accelerated weight gain starting at postnatal day 5 (P5), suggesting that
      microglia could be important for the development of cell types key to
      hypothalamic satiety centers. Moreover, surviving PLX5622 exposed animals
      displayed craniofacial and dental abnormalities, perhaps due to non-CNS effects
      of PLX5622 on macrophages and/or osteoclasts. Finally, depletion of microglia
      during embryogenesis had long-term sex-specific effects on behaviour, including
      the development of hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behaviour in juvenile and
      adult female mice, respectively. Together, these data demonstrate an important
      role for microglia during the development of the embryonic hypothalamus, and
      perhaps the CNS more broadly.

TI  - Preparing parents for parenthood: protocol for a randomized controlled trial of a
      preventative parenting intervention for expectant parents.
PG  - 311
LID - 10.1186/s12884-018-1939-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Becoming the parent of a new baby comes with a range of challenges
      including difficulties with emotional adjustment, couple relationship issues and 
      difficulty managing common infant behaviors, such as crying and sleep problems.
      This time can be especially challenging for couples who experience a range of
      risk factors. Previous parenting interventions for parents of babies have shown
      mixed results. This protocol paper describes a randomized controlled trial of a
      group-based parenting intervention for high-risk parents expecting their first
      baby. METHODS/DESIGN: Participants will be randomized to either Group Baby Triple
      P or Care as Usual (CAU). Group Baby Triple P involves 4 x 2 h group sessions
      delivered during pregnancy and 4 individual telephone sessions of 30 min each in 
      the early postnatal period. Outcomes will be assessed via parent self-report
      questionnaire, home observations and a baby diary 10 weeks and 6 months
      post-birth. Primary outcomes will be parental confidence and perceived
      competence. Secondary outcomes will include parental responsiveness and bonding
      with the baby, relationship happiness, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety and
      stress, and infant crying and sleep. Analyses will involve a series of rANOVA and
      rMANOVAs, t-tests and a multilevel modeling approach. DISCUSSION: A brief
      summary, strengths and potential implications are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Correlates of physical activity and sedentary time in young adults: the Western
      Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study.
PG  - 916
LID - 10.1186/s12889-018-5705-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The socioecological model proposes a wide array of factors that
      influence behaviours. There is a need to understand salient correlates of these
      activity behaviours in a specific population. However, few studies identified
      socio-demographic, behavioural, physical, and psychological correlates of
      objectively-assessed physical activity and sedentary time in young adults.
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants in the Raine Study
      (a pregnancy cohort started in 1989). Australian young adults (mean 22.1 years
      +/- SD 0.6) wore Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip 24 h/day for seven
      days to assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time
      (n = 256 women, n = 219 men). Potential correlates were assessed via clinical
      assessment and questionnaire and included socio-demographic variables (ethnicity,
      relationship status, work/study status, education, mothers education), health
      behaviours (food intake, alcohol consumption, smoking status, sleep quality), and
      physical and psychological health aspects (anthropometrics, diagnosed disorders, 
      mental health, cognitive performance). Backwards elimination (p < 0.2 for
      retention) with mixed model regressions were used and the gender-stratified
      analyses were adjusted for demographic variables, waking wear time and number of 
      valid days. RESULTS: Increased time spent in MVPA was associated with: being
      single (IRR 1.44 vs in a relationship living together, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.77, p =
      .001) in women; and better sleep quality in men (lower scores better IRR 0.97,
      95%CI: 0.93, 1.00). Less time spent sedentary was associated with: lower mother's
      education (- 32.1 min/day, 95%CI -52.9, 11.3, p = 0.002 for having mother with no
      university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and smoking (- 44.3
      min/day, 95%CI: - 72.8, - 15.9, p = .0002) for women; lower education status (-
      32.1 min/day, 95%CI: -59.5, - 4.8, p = 0.021 for having no university degree vs
      at least a baccalaureate degree) and lower depression scores in men (- 2.0,
      95%CI: - 3.5, - 0.4, p = 0.014); more alcoholic drinks per week for women (- 1.9 
      min/day, 95%CI: -3.1, - 0.6, p = 0.003) and men (- 1.0, 95%CI: -1.8, - 0.3, p =
      0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Less desirable correlates were associated with positive
      levels of activity in young Australian adult women and men. Interventions to
      increase MVPA and decrease sedentary activity in young adults need to
      specifically consider the life stage of young adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intramuscular immunisation with a vaccine composed of three
      recombinant Helicobacter pylori antigens-vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA),
      cytotoxin-associated antigen (CagA), and neutrophil-activating protein
      (NAP)-prevented infection in animal models and was well tolerated and highly
      immunogenic in healthy adults. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the vaccine in 
      prevention of a H pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain
      (BCM 300) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this randomised phase 1/2,
      observer-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study, healthy non-pregnant
      adults aged 18-40 years who were confirmed negative for H pylori infection were
      randomly assigned (3:4) to three intramuscular doses of either placebo or vaccine
      at 0, 1, and 2 months. Randomisation was via a computer-generated list with study
      numbers ensuring the correct ratio within a block size of seven. Participants
      were consecutively assigned in a double-blind manner to existing study numbers of
      the study protocol. Investigators and participants were blinded to allocation
      throughout the study. One month after the third immunisation, participants
      underwent challenge with a CagA-positive H pylori strain, which, for safety
      reasons, was initially administered in a subset of participants. The primary
      efficacy outcome was the efficacy of the vaccine as measured by the proportion of
      participants infected with H pylori 12 weeks after the challenge. At the end of
      the study, participants infected with H pylori were treated for 14 days with
      combination therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics
      twice daily. Safety and immunogenicity were monitored at pre-established visits. 
      This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00736476, and is
      completed. FINDINGS: 63 patients were randomly assigned, 27 to placebo and 36 to 
      the vaccine. 34 participants (19 in the vaccinated group and 15 in the placebo
      group) underwent infectious challenge, all but one of whom experienced transient 
      mild-to-moderate epigastric symptoms. 12 weeks after infectious challenge, six
      (32%) of 19 people in the vaccinated group and six (40%) of 15 people in the
      placebo group remained positive for H pylori. Eradication was successful in
      everyone who remained infected at 12 weeks. The geometric mean concentrations of 
      antibodies specific to CagA (202 [95% CI 69-588] vs 4.73 [95% CI 1.41-16];
      p=0.001), VacA (1469 [838-2577] vs 73 [39-138]; p=0.001), and NAP (208 [139-313] 
      vs 8.01 [5.05-13]; p=0.001) were significantly higher in the vaccine group than
      in the placebo group 12 weeks after infectious challenge. INTERPRETATION:
      Compared with placebo, the vaccine did not confer additional protection against H
      pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain, despite increased
      systemic humoral responses to key H pylori antigens. The finding of spontaneous
      clearance of H pylori infection in more than half the participants in the placebo
      group is remarkable and suggests important immune protection in the healthy adult
      population. FUNDING: Novartis Vaccine and Diagnostics.

TI  - The Genetics of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
BTI - SIDS Sudden Infant and Early Childhood Death: The Past, the Present and the
      Future
CP  - Chapter 31
AB  - Despite a decrease in the mortality rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 
      over the past decades, SIDS is still one of the leading causes of post-neonatal
      and infant death. In the United States, 8% of all infant deaths are attributed to
      SIDS, only behind congenital malformations and chromosomal abnormalities (21%)
      and disorders relating to prematurity and low birth weight (17%) (1). While
      efforts have been made to reduce the role of environmental factors, such as sleep
      environment and smoking, this persistent mortality highlights the importance of
      intrinsic factors involved in SIDS, including genetic changes that predispose
      infants to, or are directly responsible for, SIDS (2, 3). In addition, the
      incidence of SIDS in families where one infant has died from SIDS is increased by
      over fivefold, providing further evidence of a role for genetic factors (4, 5). A
      role for genetic factors in SIDS is consistent with the Triple Risk Model of
      SIDS, with genetic factors contributing to the "vulnerable infant". The Triple
      Risk Model hypothesizes that three elements are present for SIDS to occur (6): 1.
      Critical developmental period: Mortality from SIDS clusters during certain ages. 
      Developmental changes in autonomic control co-incide with periods of increased
      susceptibility to SIDS. 2. Vulnerable infant: Understood largely in terms of
      associated risk factors such as race or exposure to alcohol or tobacco during
      pregnancy; infants dying from SIDS have been shown to have differences in
      autonomic responses that impair their ability to respond to challenges in the
      sleep environment. In addition, genetic conditions, such as a cardiac
      channelopathy, a metabolic condition, or a seizure disorder, may cause the infant
      to be vulnerable and at greater risk of SIDS. 3. Exogenous stressor(s): Stressors
      associated with SIDS include overheating, secondhand tobacco smoke, upper
      respiratory tract infection, bed sharing, and prone sleeping position (6).
      According to the Triple Risk Model, although most babies encounter and survive
      environmental stressors, a vulnerable infant who becomes challenged during a
      critical period may not be able to overcome the stressor, leading to SIDS. Thus, 
      SIDS can be seen as representing a severe, lethal phenotype with genetic causes
      that contribute to the vulnerable infant. Genomic approaches to SIDS attempt to
      understand genetic mechanisms causing or contributing to this infant
      vulnerability.

CP  - Chapter 33
AB  - Three research areas derived from human studies of epidemiology, pathology, and
      sleep in infants have made contributions to our understanding of sudden infant
      death syndrome (SIDS). Epidemiological studies of infants who died of SIDS have
      identified a variety of risk factors associated with increased and decreased risk
      of SIDS (1-7), including prone sleeping position (8, 9), maternal cigarette
      smoking during pregnancy, and heat stress in the infant, often related to
      overheated environments, excessive bed clothing, or other unsafe sleeping
      practices (8, 10, 11). Additional risk factors include a recent upper respiratory
      tract infection, bed sharing, prematurity, and intrauterine and/or postnatal
      hypoxic stress. Similar progress in understanding the origins of SIDS has been
      made by pathologists analysing the brains of infants who died and were classified
      as SIDS. Analyses of brain tissue from these infants have consistently revealed a
      high prevalence of abnormalities in the brainstem serotoninergic system including
      an increased number of serotonergic neurons, a higher proportion of serotonergic 
      neurons displaying immature morphology, decreased tissue levels of serotonin
      (5-HT) and its synthetic enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), and decreased
      5-HT receptor binding intensity both in serotonergic nuclei themselves and in
      several nuclei that are important in cardiorespiratory control (9, 12-16).
      Similar serotonin system deficits have been described in infants who died of
      asphyxia (17). There has been persistent speculation that infants who died of
      SIDS suffered from hypoxia (i.e. low oxygen levels) at some time preceding death 
      (18-22), and hypoxia appeared to delay maturation of the brain in infants who
      died of SIDS (19-21, 23, 24). Finally, sleep studies in the infants who
      subsequently died of SIDS have revealed a sequence of repetitive episodes of
      hypoxia preceding, or following, apnea and/or bradycardia, followed by
      autoresuscitative efforts to restore normal breathing and arouse from sleep
      (25-28). Death occurred when the autoresuscitation or arousal following prolonged
      apnea failed to restore regular breathing and adequate oxygenation. Many infants 
      experienced sequences of multiple hypoxic apneic events from which they
      recovered, only to succumb to a final event in which autoresuscitation and/or
      arousal failed.

TI  - Neonatal Monitoring: Prediction of Autonomic Regulation at 1 Month from Newborn
      Assessments
BTI - SIDS Sudden Infant and Early Childhood Death: The Past, the Present and the
      Future
CP  - Chapter 21
AB  - It has been nearly 30 years since the publication of a seminal book that defined 
      the state of knowledge related to the epidemiology of, and mechanisms underlying,
      sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (1). Despite decades of subsequent research, 
      much of which is summarized in other chapters in this book, we must acknowledge
      that SIDS remains an enigma. Indeed, two longstanding definitions of SIDS (2, 3) 
      are testament to our lack of understanding of why infants die of SIDS - that is, 
      these deaths remain unexplained after thorough investigation. Although
      infrequent, SIDS remains the most common cause of infant death between 1 month
      and 1 year of age, and the deaths of 2,000 infants annually in the United States 
      (US) alone are unimaginable tragedies for these 2,000 families. At the heart of
      the reason why we have such an incomplete understanding of SIDS is, fortunately, 
      its rarity. In the US, the 2014 estimates suggest that SIDS is the cause of death
      for about 3.9 of every 10,000 infants born each year (4). Over the past few
      decades, our understanding of the external factors that contribute to why infants
      die of SIDS has come from numerous, worldwide, epidemiological studies.
      Associations gleaned from these studies have led to recommendations including
      strong discouragement for mothers not to smoke during pregnancy paired with
      specific guidance for safe sleeping practices. Subsequent to these
      recommendations, the rate of SIDS was reduced in many countries (5). However, the
      physiological mechanisms that underlie SIDS remain unknown. By definition, SIDS
      deaths are unexpected. While there may be evidence of low-grade infection prior
      to the time of death (6) in general, there are no overt, chronic signs of the
      impending demise. These deaths do not seem to be "programmed", in the sense that 
      they are inevitable; rather, they appear to be due to suboptimal physiological
      regulatory responses to what may be rather common challenges faced by infants
      during the first year of life. Nonetheless, these deaths are not random. Some
      infants are more likely to experience the failure of adequate physiological
      responses to environmental challenges than others, hence the concept of the
      vulnerable infant. Infants born prematurely are at greater risk for SIDS (7), as 
      are infants of mothers who smoked or drank during pregnancy (8, 9). Yet we still 
      do not understand how such factors create physiological vulnerability, and
      investigations of risk factor mechanisms remain a mainstay of SIDS research. An
      extremely important area of SIDS research that reinforces the non-random nature
      of SIDS deaths is based on anatomical and biochemical differences between SIDS
      infants and infants dying of known causes (10). Results from post-mortem studies,
      reviewed in other chapters of this book, provide compelling evidence for
      differences in brain structure and function that are linked to vulnerability for 
      SIDS. These studies have largely focused on brainstem anomalies, with many
      revealing differences in serotonergic systems within brainstem areas associated
      with the regulation of breathing, the cardiovascular system, temperature
      regulation, and sleep-wake cycles (11). These findings strongly support the
      hypothesis that SIDS is the result of dysregulation of the autonomic nervous
      system (ANS). However, it is important to note that anomalies also are found in
      other regions of the brain, including the forebrain, suggesting deficits in brain
      development of SIDS infants that may be quite widespread (12). The major function
      of the ANS is to provide organisms with integrated physiological responses to a
      wide variety of environmental challenges, requiring adjustments to body
      temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory activity. These challenges
      frequently occur during sleep and the transitions between sleep states. While
      population-based research strategies have sought to identify specific
      environmental factors that place infants at greater risk, other researchers have 
      worked to identify physiological markers linked to the vulnerability to SIDS. In 
      general, it is believed that SIDS infants appear to have increased vulnerability 
      to triggering events which ordinarily should not be life-threatening (13). During
      specific critical periods of development, characterized by major changes in sleep
      organization and autonomic balance, all infants, particularly those with adverse 
      prenatal histories, may have a diminished capacity to adequately respond to
      autonomic challenges (14). As examples, physiologic deficits associated with this
      risk status may be the inability to mount adequate cardiovascular responses to
      hypotensive and thermal challenges during the vulnerable period for SIDS (15-17),
      adequate respiratory activation in response to hypoxic and/or hypercarbic
      challenges (18, 19), and appropriate cortical arousals from sleep to a variety of
      physiologic challenges (20, 21). Thus, many SIDS researchers have proposed that
      the maturation of brainstem regions involved in the integration of cardiac and
      respiratory functions underlies these vulnerabilities. The overall premise of our
      own research is that at least some SIDS victims are unable to mount rescue
      responses to homeostatic challenges in the extrauterine environment, and that
      assessments of ANS activity will reveal vulnerabilities in this system prior to
      death. Our working model is that many SIDS cases, and infants at the greatest
      risk, will exhibit altered baseline autonomic activity and atypical responses to 
      cardiorespiratory challenges. Several years ago we published the case of a SIDS
      infant with abnormalities in the brainstem serotonergic system who also exhibited
      extreme values for cardiorespiratory variables measured on the second day of life
      (22). This was the first reported case of a SIDS infant with a documented
      brainstem abnormality and clear evidence of neonatal dysfunction in
      cardiorespiratory respiratory control. Consistent with this finding, infants who 
      subsequently die of SIDS have been shown to have higher heart rates, reduced
      heart rate variability, disturbed co-ordination between cardiac and respiratory
      measures, increased variability and rate of breathing during quiet sleep, fewer
      short respiratory pauses, and abnormalities in the beat-to-beat dynamics of
      cardiac control (23-29). Several studies have assessed the ability of infants to 
      respond to respiratory, thermal, and autonomic challenges (30-32). Based on
      studies demonstrating the presence of functioning baroreceptor reflexes during
      the neonatal period in many species (33), we and others have studied heart rate
      and electrocortical responses associated with blood pressure changes following
      postural adjustment and have shown that these baroreceptor-mediated reflexes are 
      present in newborn infants within the first few days after birth (32, 34-40).
      These homeostatic responses, which can be assessed in the neonate, provide
      measures of the competence of neural mechanisms to process, and respond to, a
      frequently encountered stimulus. Unfortunately, there are still no widely
      accepted animal models with the determining characteristics of SIDS. Nonetheless,
      as reviewed in other chapters of this volume, animal model studies can provide
      important information about mechanisms and risk factors that influence
      cardiorespiratory control during early development. As examples, much has been
      learned from animal models about how cardiorespiratory control mechanisms are
      affected by nicotine exposure (41, 42), various neurotransmitter systems
      (including serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) (43-49), repeated
      hypoxic experiences (50), chemo- and baroreceptor feedback (51, 52), and
      interactions with endotoxins (53, 54). Despite the impressive advances in
      understanding that animal models have provided about cardiorespiratory control
      during early development, we still do not know exactly how these mechanisms are
      related to SIDS. However, as noted previously, there is wide agreement that
      deficits in regulation of these systems underlie the vulnerability to SIDS.
      Dysfunction in autonomic control may underlie SIDS, with a window of increased
      risk starting as early as 1 month of age (1). A central question is, however,
      whether measurements of autonomic function, including heart rate and heart rate
      variability at an age prior to the age of increased risk for SIDS, can be used to
      predict possible deficits in autonomic function and response to environmental
      challenge during the high-risk period. As mentioned above, in a report of a
      single case of SIDS, we found evidence of parasympathetic/sympathetic imbalance
      during sleep, as well as several cardiorespiratory variables with extreme values 
      (22). The remainder of this chapter focuses on results of a study where we
      explored data from a set of infants collected over the past few years in which
      such measurements were made in newborns and again at 1-month postnatal age. These
      new longitudinal analyses suggest that extremes in certain measures of ANS
      function at the beginning of the high-risk window for SIDS (1 month) may be
      predicted by the same measurements in the neonatal period, prior to the time of
      increased risk for SIDS.

TI  - Snoring and Blood Pressure in Third-Trimester Normotensive Pregnant Women.
PG  - 522-529
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12416 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the association between snoring, sleep quality, quantity, and
      blood pressure in third-trimester normotensive pregnant women. DESIGN: This study
      was a cross-sectional analysis of two cohorts of healthy pregnant women recruited
      from a prenatal clinic in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. METHODS: A total
      of 322 women reported sociodemographic and health characteristics in a structured
      interview and wore a wrist actigraph on their nondominant wrist for 7 consecutive
      days to assess objective sleep patterns. The women's resting blood pressures were
      measured while seated in the clinic by trained personnel using an electronic
      sphygmomanometer. FINDINGS: One hundred thirty-three (41.3%) women reported
      snoring. Ninety-three women (28.9%) had <6 hr of nighttime sleep, with only 95
      (29.5%) women averaging 7 or more hours of nighttime sleep. In the univariate
      analyses, snoring was positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure as well as mean arterial pressure levels (p < .05). In the multivariate 
      analyses, snoring remained as a significant predictor of higher diastolic blood
      pressure (beta = 2.07, p < .05) and mean arterial pressure levels (beta = 2.00, p
      < .05), after adjustment for age, parity, gestational age, body mass index before
      pregnancy, and sleep quantity and quality by actigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: Snoring is 
      a highly prevalent condition experienced by healthy third-trimester pregnant
      women and is associated with elevated blood pressure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
      Clinical assessment and screening of snoring are of utmost importance in
      obstetric nursing practice to potentially prevent or reduce the associated
      adverse cardiovascular consequences in women during pregnancy.

TI  - Predictors of very early postpartum weight loss in women with recent gestational 
      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2018.1487937 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women with gestational diabetes (GDM) have a 7-12-fold increased risk 
      for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Postpartum weight retention is
      highly predictive for future obesity, and further increases risk for type 2
      diabetes. We sought to identify predictors of losing at least 75% of gestational 
      weight gain by very early postpartum in women with recent GDM. METHODS: We
      recruited women with GDM during pregnancy or just after delivery. Prepregnancy
      weight was self-reported at recruitment; gestational weight gain, mode of
      delivery, and insulin use were extracted from medical records. At a mean of 7.2
      (+/-2.1) weeks postpartum we measured weight and height and administered
      questionnaires, including demographics, breastfeeding, Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale, sleep, Harvard Food Frequency, and the International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire. We modeled the odds of 75% loss of gestational weight
      gain at the study visit using multivariable logistic regression models and
      selected the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) as our
      final model. Analyses were conducted using JMP 10-13 Pro (SAS Institute Inc.)
      Results: Seventy-five women with recent GDM were included in the study. The mean 
      age of study participants was 33 (SD +/-5) years old, of whom 57% were white, 30%
      were African American, and 20% of the women identified as Hispanic. The mean
      prepregnancy BMI was 31.4 kg/m(2) (SD +/-5.6) and the mean pregnancy weight gain 
      was 12.5 kg (SD +/-7.8). Fifty-two percent of participants lost at least 75% of
      their pregnancy weight gain by the early postpartum study visit. Thirty-seven
      women (49%) exceeded Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for gestational
      weight gain. In a multivariate model adjusting for weeks postpartum at the time
      of the study visit, less gestational weight gain (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.73),
      increased age (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.13-2.20), and lack of insulin use during
      pregnancy (OR 0.08 for use of insulin; 95% CI 0.00-0.73) were associated with at 
      least 75% postpartum weight loss. Prepregnancy BMI and sleep were not retained in
      the model. Race/ethnicity, education, breastfeeding, nulliparity, cesarean
      section, depressive symptoms, dietary composition, glycemic index, and physical
      activity did not meet criteria for inclusion in the model. CONCLUSIONS: A
      substantial proportion of women with recent GDM lost at least 75% of their
      gestational weight gain by early postpartum. Older women, those who did not use
      insulin during pregnancy and those who gained less weight during pregnancy were
      significantly more likely to have lost 75% of gestational weight by very early
      postpartum.

AB  - Circadian disruptions impair reproductive health in human populations and in
      animal models. We tested the hypothesis that mistimed food, a common disruptive
      feature of shift work, impairs reproductive success in mice. Male and female
      mPer2(Luc) mice on a C57BL/6 background were fed during the light or dark phase
      in two experiments. Food-induced internal misalignment of the liver clock was
      verified by in vivo bioluminescence in anesthetized mice in both experiments. In 
      Experiment 1, food-restricted pairs were monitored for litters for 18weeks. In
      the light-fed group, birth of the first litter was significantly delayed, and
      total reproductive output was significantly reduced by 38%. In Experiment 2,
      estrous cycling was monitored for 3weeks, and then after pairing, copulatory
      plugs, pregnancy, litter sizes, and uterine implantation sites were measured.
      Fewer light-fed females birthed litters (25% versus 73%). This was attributable
      to a difference in behavior as mating success was significantly reduced in
      light-fed mice: 42% were observed with a copulatory plug compared to 82% for
      dark-fed mice. The proportion of mice displaying uterine implantation sites was
      the same as the proportion observed with copulatory plugs, suggesting no deficit 
      in initiating pregnancy after mating. Estrous cycling and pregnancy maintenance
      did not differ between the groups. We conclude that mistimed feeding inhibits
      reproduction in mice by reducing successful mating behavior.

AB  - Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is the largest modifiable risk factor for
      adverse outcomes in the infant. Investigations have focused on the psychoactive
      component of cigarettes, nicotine. One proposed mechanism leading to adverse
      effects is the interaction between nicotine and its nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptors (nAChRs). Much data has been generated over the past three decades on
      the effects of cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) on the expression of the nAChRs in 
      the brainstem and physiological parameters related to cardiac, respiration and
      sleep, in the offspring of smoking mothers and animal models of nicotine
      exposure. This review summarises this data and discusses the main findings,
      highlighting that findings in animal models closely correlate with those from
      human studies, and that the major brainstem sites where the expression level for 
      the nAChRs are consistently affected include those that play vital roles in
      cardiorespiration (hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus,
      nucleus of the solitary tract), chemosensation (nucleus of the solitary tract,
      arcuate nucleus) and arousal (rostral mesopontine sites such as the locus
      coeruleus and nucleus pontis oralis). These findings provide evidence for the
      adverse effects of CSE during and after pregnancy to the infant and the need to
      continue with the health campaign advising against CSE.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and symptoms of
      depression and anxiety in women studied in pregnancy and postpartum. Scores on
      standardized measures of sleep (PSQI) at 6 months postpartum, and symptoms of
      anxiety and depression (OASIS, the PHQ9, and EPDS) were assessed by structured
      interviews in 116 women in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Poor sleep quality was
      significantly associated with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women
      who had significantly higher OASIS (anxiety) scores (beta = .530, p < .001), PHQ9
      (depression) scores (beta = .496, p < .001), and EPDS (postpartum depression and 
      anxiety) scores (beta = .585, p < .001) also had elevated total PSQI scores after
      adjustment for covariates, including prenatal depression and anxiety scores.
      Though inferences about causality are not feasible, these results support
      emerging research showing sleep quality is a risk factor for negative maternal
      affect in the postpartum period. Assessment of maternal sleep hygiene is worth
      consideration as a component of identifying women at risk for postpartum
      depression and anxiety.

PG  - 154-159
LID - 10.1080/10641955.2018.1498879 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OSA and
      preeclampsia. METHODS: Between 30 and 39 weeks gestation, objective sleep apnea
      were evaluated in 38 normal pregnant and 40 preeclamptic women. Preeclampsia was 
      defined by having a blood pressure (BP) > 140/90 mmHg on two occasions after the 
      20th week of pregnancy with excess protein in the urine (> 300 mg in 24 h) or 30 
      mg persistent proteinuria (+ 1 in dipsticks) in random samples. Objective sleep
      apnea was evaluated using an overnight in-hospital sleep evaluation using the
      SOMNOwatch plus Respiratory Screener. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index 
      (AHI) >/= 5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9),
      moderate (15-29.9), and severe (>/= 30). RESULTS: Mean AHI was 33.3 +/- 12.1 in
      preeclamptic women and was 23.8 +/- 15.8 in normal pregnant women (p = 0.008).
      There was significant difference in prevalence of OSA severity (none, mild,
      moderate, or severe) between groups. Out of 33 preeclamptic women, 11 women had
      moderate and 22 women had severe OSA. Whereas, among 33 normal pregnant women, 8,
      13, and10 women had mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. Two normal
      pregnant women had no OSA (AHI< 5). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests women are
      susceptible to developing OSA during pregnancy that is associated with an
      increased risk of preeclampsia.

LID - 10.1111/jog.13729 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To elucidate the changes in the daily variation seen in the autonomic
      nervous system during pregnancy brought about by maternity yoga and to evaluate
      how maternal yoga affects stress and sleep. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal 
      study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014. Pregnant women who
      were attending maternity yoga classes at Palmore Hospital between 20 and 23
      weeks' gestation were enrolled as the yoga group, and a matched control group was
      also enrolled. Study participants completed questionnaires, including a perceived
      stress scale and sleep logs, during their second and third trimesters. Heart rate
      variability and salivary alpha-amylase levels were evaluated as stress indices at
      20-23 weeks' gestation, 28-31 weeks' gestation and 36-40 weeks' gestation.
      RESULTS: A total of 38 women were in the yoga group, with 53 in the control
      group. At 28-31 weeks' gestation, heart rate variability during night and
      late-night periods was significantly higher in the yoga group than in the control
      group. At 36-40 weeks' gestation, variability between the morning, afternoon and 
      late night was significantly higher in the yoga group. Salivary alpha-amylase
      levels decreased significantly immediately after practicing yoga during all
      evaluation periods in the yoga group. Night-time sleep duration was significantly
      longer in the yoga group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that practicing yoga
      activates the parasympathetic nervous system during the third trimester of
      pregnancy, consolidating sleep during the night and decreasing alpha-amylase
      levels, which indicates reduced stress.

      Fetal Growth.
PG  - 10768
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-29052-y [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy is rising. OSA
      during pregnancy has been associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and
      gestational diabetes. The effect of maternal OSA on the fetus, particularly on
      fetal growth, is less apparent. Most of the currently available human data is
      based on non-objective assessment of OSA and includes heterogeneous populations
      with inadequate control on confounders, such as maternal obesity and pregnancy
      complications. Using objective tools in non-obese women with uncomplicated
      pregnancies, we aimed to investigate the association between maternal OSA and
      fetal growth. A total of 155 non-obese pregnant women were recruited.
      Birth-weight percentile of the newborns of women with mild OSA was significantly 
      higher compared with the newborns of non-OSA controls (72% vs. 57%, respectively,
      P < 0.01). Birth-length and triceps thickness measurements were significantly
      higher among the newborns of women with OSA compared with controls (P = 0.02 for 
      both). The proportion of large for gestational age (LGA) newborns was higher
      among women with OSA compared with controls (28% vs. 8%, respectively, P = 0.04).
      Our results suggest that maternal OSA during the third trimester of pregnancy -
      even in a mild form -is associated with accelerated fetal growth.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-28974-x [doi]
AB  - The study aimed to investigate the associations between maternal lifestyles and
      antenatal stress and anxiety. 1491 pregnant women were drawn from the Guangxi
      birth cohort study (GBCS). A base line questionnaire was used to collect
      demographic information and maternal lifestyles. The Pregnancy Stress Rating
      Scale (PSRS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to assess prenatal
      stress and anxiety, respectively. Regression analyses identified the relationship
      between maternal lifestyles and prenatal stress and anxiety: (1) Hours of phone
      use per day was positively correlated to prenatal stress and anxiety and
      increased with stress and anxiety levels (all P trend < 0.05). In addition, not
      having baby at home was positively correlated to prenatal stress. (2)
      Self-reported sleep quality was negative with prenatal stress and anxiety, and
      decreased with stress and anxiety levels (all P trend < 0.01). Moreover, not
      frequent cooking was negatively correlated to prenatal stress and having pets was
      negatively correlated to prenatal anxiety (P < 0.05). However, having pets was
      not correlated to prenatal stress (P > 0.05). Our results showed that adverse
      lifestyles increase the risk of antenatal stress and anxiety, a regular routine
      and a variety of enjoyable activities decreases the risk of prenatal stress and
      anxiety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) of normal-to-normal (NN) beat
      intervals provides high-temporal resolution access to assess the functioning of
      the autonomic nervous system (ANS). AIM: To determine critical periods of fetal
      autonomic maturation. The developmental pace is hypothesized to change with
      gestational age (GA). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study.
      SUBJECTS: 60 healthy singleton fetuses were followed up by fetal
      magnetocardiographic heart rate monitoring 4-11 times (median 6) during the
      second half of gestation. OUTCOME MEASURE: FHRV parameters, accounting for
      differential aspects of the ANS, were studied applying linear mixed models over
      four predefined pregnancy segments of interest (SoI: <27; 27+0-31+0; 31+1-35+0;
      >35+1 weeks GA). Periods of fetal active sleep and quiescence were accounted for 
      separately. RESULTS: Skewness of the NN interval distribution VLF/LF band power
      ratio and complexity describe a saturation function throughout the period of
      interest. A decreasing LF/HF ratio and an increase in pNN5 indicate a concurrent 
      shift in sympathovagal balance. Fluctuation amplitude and parameters of
      short-term variability (RMSSD, HF band) mark a second acceleration towards term. 
      In contrast, fetal quiescence is characterized by sequential, but low-margin
      transformations; ascending overall variability followed by an increase of
      complexity and superseded by fluctuation amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in
      sympathetic activation, connected with by a higher ability of parasympathetic
      modulation and baseline stabilization, is reached during the transition from the 
      late 2nd into the early 3rd trimester. Pattern characteristics indicating fetal
      well-being saturate at 35 weeks GA. Pronounced fetal breathing efforts near-term 
      mirror in fHRV as respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low parental tolerance for crying has been associated with infant
      sleep problems, yet the directionality of this link remained unclear. This
      longitudinal study aimed to assess the synchronous and prospective bidirectional 
      links between parental cry-tolerance, soothing, and infant sleep from pregnancy
      through six months postpartum. METHODS: Sixty-five couples were recruited during 
      pregnancy and assessed for cry-tolerance using a paradigm in which participants
      were shown a videotape of a crying infant and were asked to stop the video when
      they feel it is necessary to intervene. Infant sleep was assessed objectively
      using actigraphy for five nights at three and six months postpartum. Parental
      soothing techniques were reported by parents at both assessment points, and
      cry-tolerance was reassessed at six months. RESULTS: Concomitant associations
      were found between maternal cry-tolerance and infant sleep at six months,
      indicating that lower maternal cry-tolerance was correlated with poorer
      actigraphic sleep quality. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modeling analyses
      yielded significant prospective associations, showing that lower cry-tolerance at
      pregnancy predicted better infant sleep at three months, whereas more disrupted
      sleep at three months predicted lower cry-tolerance at six months. Moreover,
      fathers showed higher cry-tolerance compared to mothers, and parents became more 
      similar to each other across time in their reactivity to infant crying.
      CONCLUSION: Consistent with the transactional model of infant sleep, the findings
      of this study highlight the role of parental cry-tolerance in infant sleep
      development, and demonstrate bidirectional links between this construct and
      infant sleep throughout the first six months of life.

TI  - Maternal parity and perinatal cortisol adaptation: The role of pregnancy-specific
      distress and implications for postpartum mood.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Compared to women who have given birth before (i.e., multiparas),
      those giving birth for the first time (i.e., primiparas) show higher cortisol
      levels. Psychological factors may play a role; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      activation is a well-described stress response. Primiparity also predicts greater
      risk for postpartum depression, which may be related to greater correspondence
      between cortisol and mood following prenatal cortisol elevations. The current
      study examined associations among parity, perinatal cortisol adaptation,
      pregnancy-specific distress, and postpartum mood. METHODS: This longitudinal
      study assayed serum cortisol levels among 137 women at early, mid-, and late
      pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy-specific distress and depressive symptoms
      were assessed. Maternal age, race, body mass index, sleep quality, depressive
      symptoms, and sampling time of day were statistically controlled. RESULTS:
      Primiparous women showed higher cortisol levels than multiparous women during
      mid- (chi(2)=11.8, p<0.01) and late pregnancy (chi(2)=18.9, p<0.01) and higher
      distress across pregnancy (F1,126=22.1, p<0.01). Mediation analyses demonstrated 
      that the association between parity and prenatal cortisol (per area under the
      curve; AUC) was partially accounted for by distress (ab=1.0, 95%CI [0.05, 2.9]). 
      Prenatal cortisol (per AUC) did not predict postpartum depressive symptoms
      (b*=0.03, p=0.81), with no difference by parity (b*=0.03, p=0.91). At postpartum,
      a significant interaction between parity and cortisol (b*=0.40, p=0.03) revealed 
      no significant association between cortisol and mood among multiparas (b*=-0.11, 
      p=0.28) but a trend toward a positive association among primiparas (b*=0.24,
      p=0.06). DISCUSSION: Cortisol levels and pregnancy-specific distress are higher
      in primiparas versus multiparas, with pregnancy-specific distress partially
      mediating the association between parity and cortisol levels. Cortisol levels and
      mood display correspondence at postpartum in primiparous but not multiparous
      women. While observational studies must be interpreted with caution due to
      potential unmeasured confounders, these findings suggest that future studies
      examining mechanisms underlying perinatal and postpartum
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal perturbations and designing interventions aimed at
      preventing related complications should carefully consider potential differences 
      by parity.

LID - 10.5664/jcsm.7216 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Few studies have objectively evaluated sleep characteristics
      during pregnancy or investigated the relationship between altered spectral
      electroencephalogram (EEG) bands and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The study 
      aimed to describe changes in sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG) and
      spectral EEG bands during pregnancy and to examine the relationship between delta
      power in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and SDB. METHODS: This is a
      secondary analysis of a prospective study. One hundred twenty-three women
      underwent full PSG in early pregnancy, and 97 repeated PSG in late pregnancy.
      Spectral analysis of the EEG in NREM sleep was performed. We used linear and
      logistic mixed-model regression to analyze the sleep measures and linear
      regression to explore the association between delta power and apnea-hypopnea
      index (AHI) changes during pregnancy. RESULTS: In late pregnancy, women had
      shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep efficiency, more awakenings, more stage N2
      sleep, less slow wave sleep, less REM sleep, higher AHI, and higher periodic limb
      movement index compared to early pregnancy. The percentage of stage N1 sleep,
      sleep latency, REM sleep latency, and arousal index frequency did not change.
      Regarding EEG-spectra, delta and theta powers decreased, but beta-2 power
      increased during pregnancy. In multivariable analyses, greater reduction of delta
      power was associated with larger increases in AHI (beta [95% confidence interval]
      = -0.038 [-0.073, -0.002], P = .040). Estimates suggest that each one-unit
      increase in AHI reduces delta power by 4% in late pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS:
      PSG-measured sleep characteristics change during pregnancy. Delta power decreases
      when the severity of SDB increases during pregnancy. COMMENTARY: A commentary on 
      this article appears in this issue on page 1095.

      for 7 consecutive days, and complete a sleep survey at the end of the study
      period. Actigraphy was used to determine rest and sleep intervals, sleep onset
      latency, and wake time after sleep onset. RESULTS: A total of 40 participants
      were recruited, and 28 had >/= 5 nights of data for a total of 177 nights of
      antepartum sleep data. Mean gestational age was 30 weeks. Median sleep duration
      was 7.05 h +/- 1.71 h. In all, 43.5% of women had an average sleep duration of <7
      h per night. In all, 28.2% of the study nights had a bedtime between midnight and
      5 am. Going to bed between midnight and 5 am was significantly associated with
      sleep durations of <7 h (70.7 vs. 32.5%, p < .001). Participants reported an
      average of 2.4 awakenings per night due to hospital-related events. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Prolonged antepartum hospitalization has a negative impact on sleep duration and 
      quality.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tests of the relationship between sleep and overweight/obesity
      (OW/OB) among women have been inconsistent. Few studies reporting such
      associations have focused on women of childbearing age. This paper investigates
      this association among Canadian women of childbearing age. METHODS: Data were
      from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2011-2014. The sample consisted of
      women aged 18-44 years. All variables were self-reported. Sleep duration was
      dichotomized as insufficient (< 7 h/night) or adequate (>/= 7 h/night). A
      composite score of sleep quality was used and dichotomized as poor none/little of
      the time or some/most/all of the time. Height and weight were used to calculate
      body mass index. Associations between sleep and OW/OB were assessed using
      logistic regression analyses with survey weights. Three models were computed for 
      sleep duration/quality: model without covariates, model adjusted for demographics
      (age, ethnicity, level of education, household income, marital status,
      employment, parity, region, and season), and model adjusted for demographics and 
      variables associated with OW/OB (mood disorder, fruit and vegetable intake,
      physical activity, smoking, and alcohol). RESULTS: Total sample consisted of 9749
      women of childbearing age. Thirty-eight percent had insufficient sleep duration. 
      Sleep duration was significantly associated with OW/OB in the model with no
      covariates and discriminated 52.8% of women of childbearing age, but this
      association was no longer significant in the models adjusted for covariates.
      Sleep quality was not significantly linked to OW/OB in any of the models.
      CONCLUSION: Targeting sleep alone would likely not contribute to lower risk of
      OW/OB among Canadian women of childbearing age. Additional studies, especially
      longitudinal ones, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association between nightly,
      napping, and 24-h sleep duration throughout pregnancy and birth weight z-score
      among nulli- and multiparous women. METHODS: Nightly,napping, and 24-h sleep
      duration and birth weight z-score (calculated on thebasis of the International
      Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st century standards) were studied 
      in a cohort of 176 pregnant women from Brazil. Linear mixed-effect analyses were 
      performed to assess the longitudinal evolution of sleep duration and the best
      unbiased linear predictors of the random coefficients were estimated. The best
      unbiased linear predictor estimates of sleep duration intercept and slope were
      included in the linear regression models with birth weight z-score as the
      outcome. RESULTS: The mean hours of nightly sleep decreased during pregnancy in
      nulliparous women (beta = -0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.83 to -0.27)
      but the decrease was not statistically significant in multiparous women (beta =
      -0.19; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.01). Twenty-four hour sleep duration decreased during
      pregnancy in both multiparous (beta = -0.50; 95% CI, -0.76 to -0.25) and
      nulliparous women (beta = 0.77; 95% CI, -1.06 to -0.48). Napping sleep duration
      did not change in either group. Among the nulliparous women, both first-trimester
      24-h sleep duration and its change throughout pregnancy were inversely associated
      with birth weight (beta = -0.44; 95% CI, -0.68 to -0.21; beta = -1.75; 95% CI,
      -3.17 to -0.30, respectively). No associations were detected in multiparous women
      for nightly and napping sleep duration. CONCLUSIONS: Nulliparous women with
      greater decreases in sleep duration throughout their pregnancy gave birth to
      newborns with lower birth weight z-scores.

AB  - Objective: Prematurely born children have been reported to have more sleep
      problems throughout childhood than children born at term. The aim of this study
      was to explore if prenatal or neonatal factors can predict sleep problems at age 
      11 years in children born extremely preterm (EPT). Method: A prospective
      observational study of all infants who were born EPT in Norway in 1999 and 2000. 
      Prenatal and neonatal data were collected by all Norwegian obstetric and
      pediatric departments. Parental questionnaire mapped sleep problems and sleep
      habits at the age of 11 years. Results: Of the 372 eligible children, 221
      participated. Of those, 28.1% snored, 27.5% had difficulty falling asleep or
      frequent awakenings and 17.2% suffered from daytime sleepiness. The mean sleep
      duration was 9.4 h (range 4.3-11.0 h). Smoking in pregnancy predicted snoring
      (odds ratio 4.3). Neonatal cerebral hemorrhage and being born small for
      gestational age predicted difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings (odds 
      ratio 2.2 and 2.3). Other morbidities during pregnancy or the newborn period,
      gestational age or the burden of treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit
      did not predict sleep problems. None of the studied prenatal or neonatal factors 
      predicted daytime sleepiness or sleep duration <9 h. Conclusion: Of numerous
      prenatal and neonatal factors, only smoking during pregnancy, being born small
      for gestational age and cerebral hemorrhage predicted sleep problems at 11 years 
      of age among these children born EPT.

AB  - Aim: We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum pregnancy-associated 
      plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
      Materials and Method: 44 patients with OSAS and 44 healthy adults were included
      in this study. The participants having rheumatic or systemic inflammatory
      disease, advanced liver or kidney failure, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension,
      pregnancy, prerenal azotemia, known history of coronary artery disease, any
      pulmonary disease, rhinitis, or atopy, history of major trauma or surgery within 
      the last six 6 months, and inhaled nasal or systemic corticosteroid use or other 
      anti-inflammatory medications and those with <18 years of age were excluded.
      Serum PAPP-A levels were determined by the Elisa method with the immune sandwich 
      measuring method. Statistical analysis of the study was performed with SPSS 17.0 
      statistical analysis package program, and p < 0.05 was considered as significant.
      Results: Serum PAPP-A levels of patients with OSAS (2.350 ng/ml (0.641-4.796))
      were significantly higher (p < 0.001) when compared with healthy controls (0.971 
      ng/ml (0.109-2.679)). There was a statistically significant difference in serum
      PAPP-A levels between groups of OSAS patients according to the classification of 
      OSAS severity. Between the groups of patients with OSAS, serum levels of PAPP-A
      in moderate group was significantly higher when compared with severe OSAS group
      (p < 0.001). There was positive correlations between PAPP-A levels and night
      minimum (p=0.042, r=0.309), and average oxygen levels (p=0.006, r=0.407). There
      was a negative correlation between PAPP-A levels and AHI (p=0.002, r=-0.460).
      Conclusion: Higher PAPP-A levels in OSAS patients that were found in this study
      show inflammatory component in OSAS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a commonly occurring
      disease, particularly among young women of child-bearing age. The underlying
      pathophysiology for this disease has remained largely unclear; however, the
      recent literature suggests that focal outflow obstruction of the transverse sinus
      may be the cause. The purpose of this study was to report one group's early
      experience with transverse venous sinus stenting in the treatment of IIH and
      assess its effectiveness. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart
      review to identify patients who had undergone stenting of an outflow-obstructed
      transverse venous sinus for the treatment of IIH at Gates Vascular Institute
      between January 2015 and November 2017. Patient demographic data of interest
      included age, sex, BMI, and history of smoking, hypertension, obstructive sleep
      apnea, hormonal contraceptive use, and acetazolamide therapy. Each patient's
      presenting signs and symptoms and whether those symptoms improved with treatment 
      were reviewed. The average opening lumbar puncture (LP) pressure preprocedure,
      average pressure gradient across the obstructed segment prior to stenting,
      treatment failure rate (need for shunt placement), and mean follow-up period were
      calculated. RESULTS Of the 18 patients who had undergone transverse venous
      stenting for IIH, 16 (88.9%) were women. The mean age of all the patients was
      38.3 years (median 38 years). Mean BMI was 34.2 kg/m(2) (median 33.9 kg/m(2)).
      Presenting symptoms were headache (16 patients [88.9%]), visual disturbances (13 
      patients [72.2%]), papilledema (8 patients [44.4%]), tinnitus (3 patients
      [16.7%]), and auditory bruit (3 patients [16.7%]). The mean opening LP pressure
      pre-procedure was 35.6 cm H2O (median 32 cm H2O). The mean pressure gradient
      measured proximally and distally to the area of focal obstruction within the
      transverse sinus was 16.5 cm H2O (median 15 cm H2O). Postprocedurally, 14
      patients (77.8%) continued to have headaches; 6 (33.3%) continued to have visual 
      disturbances. No patients continued to have auditory bruit (0%) or papilledema
      (0%). One patient (5.6%) had new-onset tinnitus postprocedure. Overall
      improvement of symptoms was noted in 16 patients (88.9%) postprocedure, with 1
      patient (5.6%) requiring shunt placement and 2 other patients (11.1%) requiring
      postprocedural LP to monitor intracranial pressure to determine candidacy for
      further surgical interventions to treat residual symptoms. The mean duration of
      follow-up was 194.2 days. CONCLUSIONS Transverse sinus stenting is a rapidly
      developing technique that has shown good effectiveness and safety in the
      literature. Authors of the present study found that stenting a flow-obstructed
      transverse sinus in patients with IIH was a safe and effective way to treat the
      condition.

AB  - There is a growing realization that proper sleep during pregnancy is essential
      for the health of the mother and the offspring. However, there are no reports on 
      the effects of maternal sleep restriction on the sleep-wake profiles of newborns.
      So, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during 
      the third term of pregnancy on the sleep-wake profiles of neonates born to them. 
      The female pregnant Wistar rats were sleep restricted for 5h/day on gestational
      days 15-20 by gentle handling. Sleep-wake profiles of the pups born to them and
      to the control rats were recorded on postnatal days 1-21. Pups of sleep
      restricted dams had higher active sleep (AS) and lower quiet sleep (QS) as well
      as wakefulness. Higher ratio of AS to QS, longer duration of sleep cycles, lesser
      bout frequency and reduced EEG delta power were also observed in these pups, all 
      of which indicated brain immaturity. All these signs of delayed maturation,
      usually found in premature babies, were observed in the pups of sleep restricted 
      mothers, who had longer gestation period. This report not only shows the
      importance of sleep during pregnancy, but it also suggests that neonatal sleep
      monitoring can be used as a tool for early assessment of retarded brain
      development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Snoring, the symptom of partial airway obstruction during sleep, is
      a common complaint during pregnancy and is associated with adverse perinatal
      outcomes. Mechanisms underlying this association have not been studied. We
      investigated the relationship between snoring in pregnancy and maternal serum
      markers of feto-placental wellbeing. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis
      of a cross sectional study designed to investigate perinatal outcomes of
      sleep-disordered breathing. Women admitted for delivery were systematically
      selected and answered a questionnaire about snoring using the Multivariable Apnea
      Prediction Index. Participants who had screening markers measured were included
      and divided into snorers and non -snorers. Markers measured included first and
      second trimester Down syndrome screening markers, reported as multiples of the
      median (MoM). An additional analysis was performed with snorers categorized as
      acute or chronic snorers based on duration of snoring in relation to pregnancy.
      RESULTS: While significant differences were noted in co-morbid maternal medical
      conditions between snorers and non-snorers, there were no significant differences
      in the neonatal outcomes assessed between the two groups. No significant
      differences were noted in any of the first trimester (PAPP-A) or second trimester
      (AFP, uE3, hCG, inhibin-A) markers between snorers and non-snorers, p>0.25. In
      addition, no significant differences in marker levels were noted between acute
      and chronic snorers. CONCLUSION: Snoring is not associated with alterations in
      the markers of fetal or placental wellbeing tested here and suggests that there
      are alternative mechanisms underlying the association between snoring and adverse
      perinatal outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though more than 20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for an
      anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, very little is known about the
      predictors of these problems. As a result, we systematically reviewed the
      literature on risk factors for new onset anxiety and maternal anxiety
      exacerbation in the perinatal period. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL,
      Ovid, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science were searched for studies assessing
      risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety or anxiety worsening in
      women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. RESULTS: 11,759 citations were 
      identified, with 11 studies meeting eligibility criteria. New onset anxiety was
      assessed in 7 studies, anxiety worsening in 3, and 1 assessed both. Lower
      educational attainment, living with extended family members, multiparity, a
      family history of psychiatric disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, comorbid sleep
      disorders, and prenatal oxytocin exposure were risk factors for new onset
      perinatal anxiety, while presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and prenatal 
      oxytocin were risk factors for anxiety worsening. LIMITATIONS: Studies not
      explicitly stating whether participants had pre-existing anxiety disorders were
      excluded. As a result, meta-analysis was not possible for several risk factors.
      CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during the 
      perinatal period include psychological, social, and biological exposures. Given
      the lack of studies differentiating women with and without pre-existing anxiety
      disorders, additional research is required in order to determine whether these
      factors differ from the non-puerperal population, as well as from each other.

AB  - Prolactin is an important protein hormone that is in charge of milk production,
      and also contributes to breast development. Chemically, prolactin is similar to a
      growth hormone composing of 199 amino acids, and is formed after a 28-amino acid 
      signal peptide is proteolytically cleaved from the prolactin prohormone
      (pre-prolactin). During pregnancy and lactation, prolactin levels are
      physiologically elevated consistent with the hormone function to grow breast
      tissues and to produce milk. The secretion of prolactin by the anterior pituitary
      is tonically inhibited by dopamine produced by the hypothalamus to maintain a
      basal level of prolactin. Other factors that stimulate prolactin production
      include thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), estrogen (pregnancy), suckling,
      dopamine antagonists (antipsychotics), stress, and sleep. The level of prolactin 
      is low in males and non-lactating non-pregnant females.

AB  - Preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation die of sudden infant death
      syndrome (SIDS) at a rate more than double that of term infants. There is a need 
      for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of
      high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online
      educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations (RRRs) for
      parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional
      care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used.
      Two weeks before discharge, mothers completed a survey, addressing knowledge and 
      plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring
      about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule 
      evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen
      mothers, mean age 26.4 years, participated; 8 (53%) returned the postdischarge
      survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high.
      Mothers' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the
      module (P = .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home (P = .012). Mothers found the 
      use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans
      for caring for their infant, with 28.6% of mothers always offering a pacifier
      before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7% who had planned to do this
      before discharge. However, only 71% of infants slept in parents' room after
      discharge and only 41% were receiving at least some breast milk, which are not
      consistent with SIDS RRRs.

AB  - Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; 15-20% of obese
      pregnant women have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of obstructive sleep 
      apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other
      co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a
      range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies
      suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at
      significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or
      of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension;
      preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal
      morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for
      cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea
      with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several
      pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a
      comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between
      obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed
      mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of
      pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse
      outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Being overweight constitutes a health risk, and the proportion of
      overweight and obese children is increasing. It has been argued that road traffic
      noise could be linked to adiposity through its influence on sleep and stress. Few
      studies, to our knowledge, have investigated whether noise and adiposity are
      associated. Most of them were on adults, and we are not aware of any longitudinal
      study using repeated measures. OBJECTIVES: The present longitudinal study
      investigated whether road traffic noise exposures in pregnancy (N = 6,963; obs = 
      22,975) or childhood (N = 6,403; obs = 14,585) were associated with body mass
      index (BMI) trajectories in children. METHODS: We obtained information on BMI and
      covariates from questionnaires used in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort
      Study, Statistics Norway, and Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We modeled road
      traffic noise for the most exposed facade of children's present and historical
      addresses at 6 time points from pregnancy to age 8. We investigated effects on
      BMI trajectories using repeated measures and linear mixed models. RESULTS: The
      results indicated that BMI curves depended on road traffic noise exposure during 
      pregnancy, but not on exposure during childhood. Children in the highest decile
      of traffic noise exposure had increased BMI, with 0.35 kg/m more than children in
      the lowest decile, from birth to age 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate
      that exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy may be associated with
      children's BMI trajectories. Future studies should investigate this further,
      using anthropometric measures such as waist-hip ratio and skinfold thickness, in 
      addition to BMI.

PG  - 719-725
LID - 10.1080/14740338.2018.1491546 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization recommends newborns to be breastfed
      but this may be challenging if the mother needs to be treated for depression,
      since strong evidence to inform treatment choice is missing. Areas covered: We
      provide a critical review of the literature to guide clinicians who are
      considering sertraline for the management of depression during postpartum. Expert
      opinion: Sertraline is one of the safest antidepressants during breastfeeding. In
      most cases, women already taking sertraline should be advised to breastfeed and
      continue the medication. We recommend to begin with low doses and to slowly
      increase the dose up, with careful monitoring of the newborn for adverse effects 
      (irritability, poor feeding, or uneasy sleep, especially if the child was born
      premature or had low weight at birth). The target dose should be the lowest
      effective. When feasible, child exposure to the medication may be reduced by
      avoiding breastfeeding at the time when the antidepressant milk concentration is 
      at its peak. A decision to switch to sertraline from ongoing and effective
      treatment should be taken only after a scrupulous evaluation of the potential
      risks and benefits of switching versus continuing the ongoing medication while
      monitoring the infant carefully.

TI  - A cohort study on risk factors for preterm births in rural Gujarat.
PG  - 111-116
LID - 10.4103/ijph.IJPH_337_16 [doi]
AB  - Background: Prematurity is one of the leading causes of neonatal and under-five
      mortalities globally and also in India. It is an important determinant of short- 
      and long-term morbidities in infants and children. Unfortunately, risk factors of
      majority of preterm births (PTBs) remain unexplained which calls for appropriate 
      action. There is a dearth of community-based research on PTB and its risk
      factors, especially in high burden countries like India. Objectives: The
      objective of the study was to explore different risk factors for PTB. Methods: : 
      A cohort of 1977 antenatal mothers was enrolled at household level by trained
      field investigators and was followed up in four districts of Gujarat, India, to
      document the outcome of pregnancy. Pretested and structured questionnaires were
      used to collect information. A hierarchical regression model was used to analyze 
      the risk factors for PTB. Results: Proportion of PTB was 9% among the enrolled
      cohort. Risk factors which were found to be significant on applying the
      hierarchical model were periodontal disease, long sleep duration, and sex during 
      any trimester. Conclusions: The study suggests an urgent need for strengthening
      of existing guidelines for effective, evidence-based, and culturally appropriate 
      interventions for prevention of PTB. Maintenance of good oral hygiene should find
      a place in routine recommendations for pregnant women, and antenatal examinations
      should include screening for oral hygiene also.

TI  - Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is generally 
      considered the least severe type of EDS, although significant complications,
      primarily musculoskeletal, can and do occur. The skin is often soft and may be
      mildly hyperextensible. Subluxations and dislocations are common; they may occur 
      spontaneously or with minimal trauma and can be acutely painful. Degenerative
      joint disease is common. Chronic pain, distinct from that associated with acute
      dislocations, is a serious complication of the condition and can be both
      physically and psychologically disabling. Easy bruising, functional bowel
      disorders, and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction are common. Aortic root
      dilation, when present, is typically of a mild degree with no increased risk of
      dissection in the absence of significant dilation. Psychological dysfunction,
      psychosocial impairment, and emotional problems are common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      The diagnosis of hEDS is based entirely on clinical evaluation and family
      history. The gene(s) in which mutation causes hEDS are unknown and unmapped.
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Physical therapy tailored to the
      individual; assistive devices (braces to improve joint stability; wheelchair or
      scooter to offload stress on lower-extremity joints; suitable mattress to improve
      sleep quality); pain medication tailored to symptoms; appropriate therapy for
      gastritis/reflux/delayed gastric emptying/irritable bowel syndrome; psychological
      and/or pain-oriented counseling. Prevention of primary manifestations:
      Low-resistance exercise to increase both core and extremity muscle tone for
      improved joint stability; appropriate writing utensils to reduce finger and hand 
      strain. Prevention of secondary complications: Calcium, vitamin D, low-impact
      weight-bearing exercise to maximize bone density. Surveillance: DEXA every other 
      year if bone loss is confirmed. Pregnancy management: Labor and delivery may
      progress very rapidly, even in primigravid women. There is no clear advantage to 
      vaginal vs cesarean delivery. Pregnant women with known aortic root dilation
      should have an echocardiogram in each trimester. Agents/circumstances to avoid:
      High-impact activity increases the risk of acute subluxation/dislocation, chronic
      pain, and osteoarthritis. GENETIC COUNSELING: Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an 
      autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with the syndrome have an
      affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant
      is unknown. Each child of an individual with hEDS has a 50% chance of inheriting 
      the disorder. Because the gene(s) and pathogenic variant(s) responsible for hEDS 
      have not been identified, prenatal testing is not possible.

      literature with meta-analysis.

AB  - There is a wealth of evidence to say that sleep impacts maternal health during
      pregnancy, however, little has been published on fetal health and maternal sleep.
      This scoping review summarises current literature on maternal sleep including
      sleep disordered breathing, sleep quality, sleep duration and supine sleep
      position, as these relate to fetal outcomes specifically birth weight, growth,
      preterm birth and stillbirth. An overall interpretation of the studies evaluated 
      shows that events occurring during maternal sleep such as obstructive sleep
      apnea, sleep disruption and sleep position may have a negative effect on the
      fetus resulting in altered growth, gestational length and even death. These
      effects are biologically and physically plausible. In conclusion, there is
      limited and often conflicting information on maternal sleep and fetal outcomes.
      However, existing evidence suggests that this is an important area for future
      research. This area is ripe for investigation if there is to be reduction in the 
      physical, emotional, and financial burden of poor fetal outcomes related to
      maternal sleep.

TI  - Health related quality of life of preterm born children at three years in a sub
      urban district in Sri Lanka: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 193
LID - 10.1186/s12887-018-1162-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth leads to multiple morbidities affecting the health of a
      child. Lack of information on the health impact of prematurity hinders the
      possibility of any effective public health interventions in this regard. Our aim 
      was to determine the association between preterm birth and Health-Related Quality
      of Life (HRQOL) among 3 years old children in the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka.
      METHODS: A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 790
      preterm and term born children who were 03 years old. Multi-stage cluster
      sampling technique was used to identify children. The exposure status, a preterm 
      birth, was established using the maternal pregnancy records. Outcome status was
      measured using a validated health related quality of life questionnaire (prepared
      in Sinhala) for preschool-aged children. Mothers of the children responded to an 
      interviewer-administered questionnaire which had variables on the exposure
      status, outcome and additional variables such as child development status and
      birth related information. Quality of life was measured in twelve different
      domains of health (subscales). The impact was analyzed using the multiple linear 
      regression. RESULTS: Response rate was 95.5% (n = 379) for preterm group and
      95.2% (n = 378) for term-born group. Health-Related Quality of Life scores
      obtained by preterm children were lower than the term born children in eight
      subscales. Preterm birth showed statistically significant association with
      subscales on sleep wellbeing, general wellbeing and abdominal symptoms in the
      adjusted analysis (p < 0.05). Among preterm children prolonged illness, delayed
      development status, socio economic status and maternal perception on the health
      status of the child were common predictors of quality of life. CONCLUSION:
      Preterm birth affected health related quality of life of preschool aged children.

TI  - Association between Sleep-Disordered Breathing during Pregnancy and Maternal and 
      Fetal Outcomes: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 91
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2018.00091 [doi]
AB  - Background: Due to the high prevalence in pregnant women and potential
      association with pregnancy complications or perinatal outcomes, sleep-disordered 
      breathing (SDB) has become an increasing concern. Methods: Pubmed and Embase were
      retrieved from inception until 2017 to conduct a meta-analysis to explore the
      association of SDB and several outcomes during gestation. A stratified analysis
      differentiated by the type of SDB [snoring alone/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)]
      was also performed. Pooled odds ratios were produced for binary outcomes.
      Weighted mean differences were also produced for continuous outcomes. Sensitivity
      analysis was performed to identify the impact of individual studies on summary
      results and estimation of publication bias was performed by funnel plot. Results:
      35 studies with a total of 56,751,837 subjects were included. SDB during
      pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), and preeclampsia
      (PEC), but not significantly associated with fetal maternal outcomes, namely
      APGAR score and birth weight. Moreover, OSA was linked with an increasing risk of
      GDM, PIH, PEC and preterm birth while snoring appeared to increase the risk of
      GDM, PIH, and PEC. Conclusion: The finding provided potential evidence for
      association between SDB and adverse perinatal outcomes. SDB increased the risk of
      some pregnancy complications while its influence to fetal outcomes was not clear.

TI  - Perinatal maternal depression, antidepressant use and infant sleep outcomes:
      Exploring cross-lagged associations in a pregnancy cohort study.

LID - S0165-0327(18)30396-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both perinatal depression and infant sleep problems are common
      concerns in many communities, with these problems often coinciding. Findings in
      this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep
      and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant
      treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined
      the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep. METHODS: This study
      draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 
      months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing 
      Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy
      in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine
      reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep.
      RESULTS: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not
      significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems 
      were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However,
      maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to
      immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal
      effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum.
      LIMITATIONS: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample
      were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to
      other cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not 
      found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant
      sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum 
      maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night
      may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.

TI  - Urofacial Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Urofacial syndrome (UFS) is characterized by prenatal
      or infantile onset of urinary bladder voiding dysfunction, abnormal facial
      movement with expression (resulting from abnormal co-contraction of the corners
      of the mouth and eyes), and often bowel dysfunction (constipation and/or
      encopresis). Bladder voiding dysfunction increases the risk for urinary
      incontinence, megacystis, vesicoureteric reflux, hydroureteronephrosis,
      urosepsis, and progressive renal impairment. In rare instances, an individual who
      has (a) a molecularly confirmed diagnosis and/or (b) an affected relative meeting
      clinical diagnostic criteria manifests only the characteristic facial features or
      only the urinary bladder voiding dysfunction (not both). Nocturnal lagophthalmos 
      (incomplete closing of the eyes during sleep) appears to be a common and
      significant finding. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of UFS is based on
      investigations of the urinary tract that reveal characteristic urinary tract
      abnormalities and physical examination that reveals characteristic facial
      movement with expression. UFS is a heterogeneous condition resulting from
      biallelic pathogenic variants in either HPSE2 or LRIG2. In some instances no
      pathogenic change has been identified. Note that the majority of individuals with
      UFS reported to date have not had molecular confirmation of their diagnosis.
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Rapid and complete treatment of urinary 
      tract infections and routine treatment of urosepsis. For urinary incontinence and
      bladder dysfunction: use of anticholinergic and alpha1-adrenergic blockers;
      intermittent catheterization or vesicostomy; surgical management of
      hydroureteronephrosis and bladder augmentation should be considered. Management
      of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease relies on the standard
      optimal options. Surveillance: Monitor for evidence of urinary tract features
      including vesicoureteric reflux and hydroureteronephrosis. Renal function should 
      be monitored at intervals determined by urinary tract features at presentation
      and their subsequent progression. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nephrotoxic
      substances. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to examine sibs of
      an affected individual as soon as possible after birth to determine if facial
      and/or urinary tract manifestations of UFS are present to allow prompt evaluation
      of the urinary tract and renal function and prompt initiation of necessary
      treatment. Pregnancy management: Although no guidelines for prenatal management
      of UFS exist, it seems appropriate to perform ultrasound examination of
      pregnancies at risk to determine if urinary tract involvement of UFS is present, 
      as this may influence the timing and/or location of delivery (e.g., in a tertiary
      medical center that could manage renal/urinary complications immediately after
      birth). GENETIC COUNSELING: UFS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At
      conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being
      affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of
      being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives,
      prenatal testing of pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic
      diagnosis are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

TI  - An analysis of whether sleep disorder will result in postpartum depression.
PG  - 25304-25314
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.25219 [doi]
AB  - Postpartum depression has become an important topic of concern in recent years.
      However, very few studies on the causes of postpartum depression exist, and the
      effects of prenatal sleep disorders on the development of postpartum depression
      among pregnant women have not been elucidated. This study aimed to understand the
      association between prenatal sleep disorders and postpartum depression. The
      National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan (between 2000 and 2010) was
      used to assess the effects of prenatal sleep disorder on the risk of postpartum
      depression using Cox regression analyses. Prenatal sleep disorder in pregnant
      women increased the risk of developing postpartum depression (the risk in the
      sleep disorder cases was 5.359-fold increased compared with control cases). In
      addition, regardless of postpartum week (</= 6 weeks, 6-12 weeks, or > 12weeks), 
      the risk of developing postpartum depression in pregnant women with prenatal
      sleep disorders were increased, by 5.461-fold (P < 0.001), 3.490-fold (P =
      0.010), and 3.416-fold (P = 0.015), respectively, compared with pregnant women
      without sleep disorders. Pregnant women with prenatal sleep disorders exhibited
      increased risks of developing postpartum depression. For pregnant women with
      prenatal sleep disorder, postpartum intervention measures should be provided as
      early as possible to reduce the risk of developing postpartum depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inspiratory flow limitation is a breathing pattern during sleep
      caused by upper airway (UA) narrowing that occurs during snoring and various
      degrees of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Clinical examination of flow limitation
      relies on identifying patterns of airflow contour, however this process is
      subjective and lacks physiological evidence of UA narrowing. Our objective is to 
      derive the temporal features of nasal airflow contour that characterize flow
      limitation. The features that correlate with UA narrowing can be used to develop 
      machine learning classifiers to detect flow limitation with physiological
      support. METHODS: Sixteen healthy adult men underwent full daytime
      polysomnography where the nasal airflow was recorded. Before and after sleep, we 
      measured UA anatomical parameters including neck circumference (NC) and
      upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA). We extracted various temporal
      features of airflow and investigated their relationships with the UA anatomical
      parameters. RESULTS: We found that three features were correlated with the
      anatomical parameters associated with UA narrowing: deviation index vs. baseline 
      UA-XSA (r = -0.67, p = 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. baseline UA-XSA (r =
      -0.69, p < 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. DeltaNC (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and
      peak number vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.54, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Temporal
      features of airflow were associated with UA narrowing. Future studies could
      utilize the features to develop classifiers to detect flow limitation and assess 
      the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in high-risk populations such as
      pregnant women and children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although afternoon napping is very common, particularly in China,
      there are limited data regarding the potential health effects of afternoon
      napping during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. We aimed to investigate the
      relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and low birth weight
      (LBW). METHODS: A total of 10,111 women aged 15-50 years were recruited from the 
      ongoing Healthy Baby Cohort study in China, in 2012-2014. Information on sleep
      habits during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaires at the time of
      institutional delivery. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds
      ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Compared with women who
      reported no napping, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for LBW were 0.83 (95% CI
      0.58-1.18) and 0.61 (0.44-0.83) for those who reported </=1 h and >1 h of
      napping, respectively (P for trend <0.001). LBW risk reached a threshold at
      approximately 1.5 h of afternoon napping. The inverse relationship between
      afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW was stronger among women with
      lower educational level (P for interaction = 0.011). For frequency of afternoon
      napping, the multivariate analysis suggested a significant inverse association
      between LBW and napping 5-7 days/week (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92). CONCLUSION: To
      our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association between
      afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping during late pregnancy and
      LBW risk. Our findings suggest that appropriate afternoon napping and frequency
      of afternoon napping for pregnant women might reduce the risk of LBW.

AB  - Introduction The Maternal Infant Health Outreach Worker (MIHOW) program is a home
      visiting program, utilizing peer mentors to improve maternal/child health
      outcomes in underserved communities. Findings are presented from a randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the MIHOW model in a sample of
      Hispanic women in Tennessee. We hypothesized maternal and infant outcomes would
      be better in women assigned to MIHOW than women assigned to the minimal education
      intervention (MEI) group (receipt of educational materials). Methods Women
      entered the study during pregnancy (< 26 weeks gestation) and were followed
      through 6 months postpartum. A total of 188 women were enrolled and randomly
      assigned (MEI = 94; MIHOW = 94), with 178 women completing the study (MEI = 87;
      MIHOW = 91). Results Positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effects of
      MIHOW were observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, levels of
      depressive symptoms and parenting stress, safe sleep practices, and infant
      stimulation in the home. No statistically significant differences were noted in
      number of prenatal visits. Discussion Results expand limited empiric evidence and
      provide strong support of the effectiveness of MIHOW on improving health outcomes
      in this sample of Hispanic mothers and their infants. MIHOW is a viable option
      for providing culturally sensitive services to immigrant and underserved
      families.

AB  - Introduction Although home-visiting programs typically engage families during
      pregnancy, few studies have examined maternal and child health outcomes during
      the antenatal and newborn period and fewer have demonstrated intervention
      impacts. Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing
      evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on
      childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on
      birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care
      practices. Methods 312 young (M = 18.4 years), pregnant women across four
      communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or
      case management. Women were African American (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and
      multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and
      3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to
      attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR = 9.82, p < .01), but there
      were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or
      postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use
      epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR = 0.49, p < .01) and more
      likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR = 1.72, p < .05), although the
      breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were
      more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR = 1.64, p <
      .05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR = 3.16, p < .05).
      Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated
      with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting
      programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth,
      incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.

TI  - Sudden infant death syndrome: Knowledge and practise in parents of preterm
      infants.
PG  - 710-713
LID - 10.1111/ped.13605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome
      (SIDS) compared with term born infants and the risk is inversely proportional to 
      the gestational age and birthweight. Parents of these infants should have
      adequate knowledge and practise the recommended SIDS risk reduction measures.
      METHODS: A survey was conducted between December 2016 and August 2017 at
      Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. Parents of preterm
      infants </=36 weeks' gestation were invited to answer a self-administered
      questionnaire to assess their knowledge and practise regarding SIDS risk
      reduction. RESULTS: Forty-nine (61.33%) of the 80 parents had heard of SIDS prior
      to the interview, with social media being the commonest source of information
      (67.3%). Only 35 (43.7%) correctly answered at least five of nine questions on
      knowledge of SIDS risk reduction ("good knowledge"). When compared with the group
      of parents who answered less than five questions correctly ("poor knowledge"),
      there was no significant difference in the demographic and infant characteristics
      between the groups. The majority (68.8%) of parents practised bed sharing with
      their infants, and this was significantly more common in the group of parents
      with poor knowledge (P = 0.01). Household smoking was also significantly more
      common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.048). CONCLUSION:
      Knowledge on SIDS risk reduction measures was generally poor among parents of
      preterm infants in this study. Cigarette smoking, bed sharing and non-supine
      sleep positions, which are associated with increased risk of SIDS, were common
      practise among the present subjects.

AB  - Pregnant women experience more sleep disturbances and greater systemic
      inflammation than non-pregnant women. However, the few studies that have examined
      the links between sleep and inflammation in pregnant women have been in clinical 
      samples. We examined whether sleep duration is associated with C-reactive protein
      (CRP) levels, a marker of inflammation, in pregnant and non-pregnant women in a
      population-based sample of US women. Participants were 2865 women of reproductive
      age (aged 20-44 years) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of Americans. Sleeping <5h on
      weeknights or workdays was significantly associated with increased CRP levels
      among both pregnant and non-pregnant women in unadjusted analyses; however, after
      adjustment for demographic, and health-related variables (depressive symptoms,
      self-rated health status, body mass index (BMI), diabetes), sleeping <5h was no
      longer significantly related to CRP levels. Pregnant women had significantly
      higher CRP levels, after adjusting for sleep duration, demographic, and
      health-related variables. Our findings suggest that pregnancy is associated with 
      increased peripheral CRP, after adjustment for sleep duration, demographic, and
      health factors. Further, in both pregnant and non-pregnant U.S. women of
      reproductive age, short sleep duration is associated with higher CRP levels, but 
      this link is explained by self-rated health, BMI, and diabetes. Further studies
      are needed to investigate links of other sleep parameters (e.g., sleep
      fragmentation) with CRP in these populations.

TI  - Energy Expenditure in Pregnant Women with Obesity Does Not Support Energy Intake 
      Recommendations.
PG  - 992-999
LID - 10.1002/oby.22194 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors that may predispose women to
      excess gestational weight gain (GWG). METHODS: Seventy-two healthy women with
      obesity (30 class I, 24 class II, 18 class III) expecting a singleton pregnancy
      were studied at 13 to 16 weeks gestation. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured
      during sleep (SleepEE, average EE from 0200-0500 hours) in a whole-room
      calorimeter, and total daily EE (TDEE) over 7 days using doubly labeled water.
      Glucose, insulin, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines were measured. RESULTS:
      Body composition explained 70% variability in SleepEE, and SleepEE accounted for 
      67% to 73% of TDEE. Though there was no evidence of consistent low metabolism,
      there was considerable variability. Low SleepEE was associated with insulin
      resistance and low triiodothyronine concentrations (both P = 0.01). Physical
      activity level was 1.47 +/- 0.02. For women with SleepEE within 100 kcal/d of
      their predicted EE, TDEE was significantly less than the estimate (2,530 +/- 91
      vs. 2,939 kcal/d; P < 0.001) provided from the most recent gestational energy
      requirement model. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with obesity are inactive,
      possibly predisposing them to excess GWG. Current energy requirement models
      overestimate activity and may promote excess GWG in women with obesity.
      Furthermore, the observed large interindividual variability in basal metabolism
      may be important to consider when assessing the risk for excess GWG.

TI  - Maternal Weight, Snoring, and Hypertension: Potential Pathways of Associations.
PG  - 1133-1138
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are linked to excessive
      maternal weight and frequent snoring. However, pathways between maternal
      excessive weight, pregnancy-onset snoring, and HDP are only partially estimated. 
      We examined and quantified the total and direct associations between excessive
      maternal weight and incident HDP and their indirect pathway through
      pregnancy-onset snoring. METHODS: Third trimester pregnant women enrolled from
      prenatal clinics of a large tertiary medical center. Sleep data were collected
      through a questionnaire. Demographic and pregnancy information and first
      trimester maternal weight were abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of
      women with prepregnancy hypertension and/or chronic snoring, causal mediation
      analysis was used to estimate the total and direct association between maternal
      weight and incident HDP and their indirect association through pregnancy-onset
      snoring. The proportion of the mediated association through pregnancy-onset
      snoring from the total association of maternal weight and HDP was also
      quantified. RESULTS: After excluding those with chronic hypertension and/or
      snoring, the final sample included 1,333 pregnant women. In adjusted analysis,
      excessive maternal weight was directly associated with incident HDP; odds ratio
      (OR) = 1.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30, 2.70). Pregnancy-onset snoring
      significantly mediated the association between maternal weight and incident HDP; 
      OR = 1.08 (95% CI 1.01, 1.17). The mediated pathway accounted for 15% of the
      total association between maternal weight and incident HDP. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pregnancy-onset snoring mediates the association between maternal weight and
      incident HDP in women without prepregnancy snoring or hypertension. These
      findings demonstrate the relative contributions of excessive maternal weight and 
      pregnancy-onset snoring to incident HDP.

AB  - There is mounting evidence for an association between sleep disorders and
      hypertension. In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there are plausible biological
      reasons for the development of hypertension, and treatment of OSA results in
      modest (2-3 mm Hg), adherence-dependent decreases in blood pressure, with larger 
      effects evident in those with resistant hypertension. However, prospective,
      population-based cohort studies have not yet convincingly demonstrated a link
      between OSA and incident hypertension, and adequately powered controlled trials
      of CPAP for the prevention or treatment or hypertension are lacking. While
      associations have been identified between short sleep duration, insomnia,
      restless legs syndrome (RLS), shift work, and hypertension, the causative role of
      these conditions/circumstances is not proven, and further well-designed
      pathophysiological and/or interventional studies are needed. Particular emphasis 
      should be placed on defining subgroups of hypertensive OSA patients that stand to
      benefit most from OSA treatment and in understanding the link between sleep apnea
      and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Well-controlled intervention studies are
      needed in populations with short sleep duration, insomnia, shift work sleep
      disorder, and RLS to confirm their putative links with hypertension.

LID - 10.1080/03630242.2017.1414101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance and fatigue are frequent complaints during
      pregnancy and postpartum. We assessed the effectiveness of Lavender cream and
      footbath on sleep quality and fatigue in pregnancy and postpartum. METHODS: In
      this trial, 141 women with sleep disturbance at 25-28 weeks gestation were
      recruited from public health centers in Tabriz, Iran, from May 2013 until January
      2014 and randomized into one of three groups receiving: Lavender and footbath,
      Lavender alone, or placebo cream. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh
      sleep quality index at the 4th and 8th weeks after intervention and the 6th week 
      postpartum. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional assessment of fatigue 
      scale at the 6th week after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Repeated
      measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group,
      the global sleep quality score post-intervention in pregnancy and the postpartum 
      were significantly lower in the Lavender and footbath and the Lavender cream only
      groups. Fatigue in both intervention groups was significantly improved only at
      the 6th week postpartum. No statistically significant differences were observed
      between the two intervention groups. CONCLUSION: Lavender cream with or without
      footbath may improve sleep quality in pregnancy and postpartum.

AB  - Background: Physical inactivity and inadequate amounts of sleep are two potential
      causes for excessive weight gain in infancy. Thus, parents and caregivers of
      infants need to be educated about decreasing infant sedentary behavior,
      increasing infant unrestrained floor time, as well as age specific recommended
      amounts of sleep for infants. The aims of this study were to determine if
      maternal knowledge about infant activity and sleep changed over time and to
      evaluate maternal compliance rates with expert recommendations for infant sleep
      in a two-arm, randomized, controlled, comparative impact trial. Methods: Pregnant
      women at least 18 years of age, less than 19 weeks pregnant, and residing in a
      lower Mississippi Delta county were recruited between March 2013 and December
      2014. Postnatal data was collected from 54 participants between September 2013
      and May 2016. McNemar's test of symmetry was used to determine if maternal
      knowledge changed over time, while generalized linear mixed models and
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess compliance with expert
      recommendations for infant sleep. Results: The postnatal retention rate was 85%. 
      Maternal knowledge significantly increased for correct infant sleep position
      (back) and beginning tummy time by one month of age. Odds of meeting sleep
      duration recommendations increased by 30% for every one month increase in infant 
      age. Only 20% of the participants were compliant with the back to sleep
      recommendation for the first 12 months of their infant's life; median time to
      noncompliance was 7.8 months. Conclusions: Although baseline knowledge concerning
      infant activity and sleep was high in this cohort of rural, Southern, African
      American mothers, compliance with recommendations was not optimal. Trial
      registration: The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01746394) on
      December 5, 2012.

TI  - Effects of maternal obstructive sleep apnea on fetal growth: a case-control
      study.
PG  - 982-988
LID - 10.1038/s41372-018-0127-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether maternal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is
      associated with changes in fetal growth trajectory. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective
      review of pregnant women who underwent overnight polysomnography. Fetal growth
      was estimated using sonographic biometric measurements obtained during routine
      prenatal care. Customized estimated fetal weight and birth weight centiles were
      calculated and impaired fetal growth was defined as birth weight <10th centile or
      a slowing of fetal growth by >33% during the last trimester. Logistic regression 
      models were used to determine the relationship between maternal OSA and altered
      fetal growth after adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: There were 48
      women without and 31 women with OSA. There were no differences in the proportion 
      of infants with birth weight <10th centile between women with and without OSA (23
      vs. 25%, p = 1.0), However, the presence of maternal OSA was predictive of
      impaired fetal growth (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.6). Logistic regression models were
      repeated using only a slowing of fetal growth in the 3rd trimester (excluding
      birth weight <10th centile) and OSA predicted a slowing in fetal growth across
      the 3rd trimester (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.4). Fourteen additional women were
      treated with positive airway pressure during pregnancy; fetal growth was not
      significantly different in these women compared to controls. CONCLUSION:
      Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with altered fetal growth,
      which appears to be ameliorated with use of positive airway pressure.

TI  - Fetal assessment in buprenorphine-maintained women using fetal
      magnetoencephalography: a pilot study.
PG  - 1895-1904
LID - 10.1111/add.14266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In-utero exposure to opioids including buprenorphine (BUP)
      has been shown to affect fetal activity, specifically heart-rate variability
      (FHRV) and fetal movement (FM). Our objective was to extract simultaneous
      recordings of fetal cardiac and brain-related activity in BUP-maintained and
      non-opioid exposed pregnant women using a novel non-invasive biomagnetic
      technique. DESIGN: A pilot study was conducted, recording and analyzing
      biomagnetic data from fetuses of BUP-maintained and non-opioid exposed pregnant
      women. Signals were acquired with the non-invasive 151-channel SARA (SQUID-Array 
      for Reproductive Assessment) system. Advanced signal-processing techniques were
      applied to extract fetal heart and brain activity. SETTING: University of
      Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). PARTICIPANTS:
      Eight BUP-maintained pregnant women from UAMS Women's Mental Health Program
      between gestational ages (GA) of 29-37 weeks who were treated with 8-24 mg of BUP
      daily. Sixteen pregnant women with no known opioid exposure in the same GA range 
      were also included. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures from the fetal heart and brain
      signals included: heart rate (FHR), FM, FHR accelerations, FHR-FM coupling, FHRV,
      fetal behavioral states (FBS) and power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous
      brain activity. These measures were analyzed at three GA intervals. FINDINGS:
      Fetal heart and brain activity parameters were extracted and quantified
      successfully from 18 non-opioid and 16 BUP recordings. Overall analysis in both
      groups show that: FHR and FM ranged from 131 to 141 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and
      5 to 11 counts, respectively. In the 35-37 weeks GA, the coupling duration (~9 s)
      was the shortest, while three of the FHRV parameters were the highest. The PSD of
      brain activity revealed highest power in 0.5-4 Hz bandwidth. Transitions in FBS
      from quiet to active sleep were > 50% of sessions. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study 
      showed that a novel biomagnetic technique allows simultaneous quantification of
      cardiac and brain activities of a group of buprenorphine-exposed and non-exposed 
      fetuses in the third trimester.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between poor sleep quality during
      pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: A total
      of 4066 singleton pregnant women from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort
      (TMCHC) without overt diabetes before pregnancy were analyzed. Sleep quality and 
      duration during early pregnancy were self-reported by enrolled women at their
      first antenatal care visit before 16 weeks of gestation. Gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) was assessed with a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28
      weeks of gestation. Information about self-reported sleep quality and duration in
      mid-pregnancy were also collected at this time. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were
      calculated by multivariable logistic regression models, and adjusted for
      potential confounders to estimate the effect of poor sleep quality and the
      interaction between sleep quality and duration on the development of GDM.
      Stratified analyses were performed according to age, parity, family history of
      diabetes and napping. RESULTS: A total of 335 (8.2%) participants were diagnosed 
      with GDM. Poor sleep quality was reported in 259 (6.4%) women during early
      pregnancy and 248 (6.1%) in mid-pregnancy. The risk of GDM was increased in women
      with poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20-2.61). No
      association was found between poor sleep quality during mid-pregnancy and the
      risk of GDM. The risk of GDM was highest in women with poor sleep and longer
      nighttime sleep duration during early pregnancy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.29) when 
      compared with those who reported good sleep and 7.0-8.5 h of sleep duration per
      night. Stratified analysis found that the association between poor sleep quality 
      in early pregnancy and the risk of GDM was stronger among women aged >/=30 years 
      (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.35-4.09) and those with a family history of diabetes (OR 4.02,
      95% CI 1.54-10.48). CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality during early pregnancy was
      associated with an increased risk of GDM. Screening for and treating sleep
      problems in early pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk of GDM.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep, including habitual snoring and
      insomnia. The co-occurrence among non-pregnant cohorts is 30%-50% with increased 
      risk for adverse health outcomes. To date, no study has examined the comorbid
      status or impact in pregnant women. METHODS: The prevalence of insomnia (INS) and
      habitual snoring (HS) were examined in 439 women in the third trimester (34.1 +/-
      3.7 weeks). Habitual snoring (snoring >/=3 times/week) was self-reported.
      Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ). RESULTS: 
      Four groups emerged: HS-/ISQ- (n = 161; 36.7%), HS-/ISQ+ (n = 146; 33.3%),
      HS+/ISQ- (n = 63; 14.4%), and HS+/ISQ+ (n = 69; 15.7%). Logistic regression
      models revealed both independent associations, as well as comorbid HS/INS status 
      with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3-6.5, p < 0.001; aOR 2.2,
      95%CI 1.1-4.4, p = 0.02; aOR 7.2, 95%CI 3.7-14.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Only 
      comorbid HS/INS was associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 3.2 95%CI
      1.0-10.6, p = 0.048). Insomnia alone and HS alone were associated with a baby
      born large for gestational age (aOR 2.9 95%CI 1.2-7.1, p = 0.019 and aOR 3.5,
      95%CI 1.1-11.1, p = 0.034 respectively) but however, the comorbid state was not
      significantly associated with LGA. Only women with HS alone were at increased
      odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.2 95%CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.046). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both insomnia alone and comorbid insomnia/habitual snoring were
      associated with adverse outcomes even after accounting for confounders. These
      findings are clinically relevant since adverse pregnancy outcomes may have severe
      consequences for both mother and baby. In order to mitigate these outcomes,
      identifying viable treatment(s) for women at risk should be considered a high
      priority.

TI  - The effect of supine positioning on maternal hemodynamics during late pregnancy.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2018.1478958 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have demonstrated an association between maternal
      supine sleep position and an increased risk of late stillbirth. During late
      pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava (IVC) when a woman
      lies in the supine position. The azygos system of veins is the dominant pathway
      of collateral venous return back to the heart in the event of acute obstruction
      of the IVC. It is suggested that this pathway provides adequate collateral venous
      circulation in the event of IVC compression in the supine position during late
      pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effect of supine positioning on maternal
      hemodynamics during late pregnancy and the role of collateral venous circulation.
      METHODS: Ethics approval was obtained and 12 women with singleton pregnancies
      between 35- and 38-week gestation underwent magnetic resonance imaging in the
      supine and left lateral decubitus positions using a Skyra 3T system (Siemens).
      Phase-contrast images were evaluated to measure cardiac output, blood flow
      through the azygos vein, and blood flow through the abdominal aorta (AA) and IVC 
      at two levels: at the level of aortic bifurcation and immediately above the renal
      veins. RESULTS: The supine position was associated with a 16.4% reduction in
      cardiac output when compared to the left lateral position. In addition, blood
      flow through the IVC decreased at its origin by 85.3% and by 44.4% at the level
      of the renal veins. Blood flow through the azygos vein increased in the supine
      position by 220%. Blood flow through the AA at the level of the renal veins did
      not differ significantly; however, it is reduced by 32.3% at the level of the
      aortic bifurcation. CONCLUSIONS: Women in late pregnancy experience an increase
      in collateral venous blood flow when lying supine, likely as a response to marked
      compression of the IVC in this position. However, cardiac output and aortic blood
      flow were found to decrease while in the supine position.

TI  - Propensity for adverse pregnancy outcomes in African-American women may be
      explained by low energy expenditure in early pregnancy.
PG  - 957-964

AB  - Background: African-American (AA) women have poorer pregnancy outcomes, and
      studies in nonpregnant women suggest a different etiology of weight gain in AA
      compared with white women. We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low
      energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with
      white women in pregnancy. Objective: We aimed to identify physiologic risk
      factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy.
      Design: This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity,
      between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the
      intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions 
      [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled 
      water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body
      composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical
      activity by accelerometers. Markers of metabolic health were obtained from
      fasting blood and urine. Results: AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were
      comparable in age (mean +/- SEM: 27.7 +/- 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index
      [mean +/- SEM (in kg/m2): 36.9 +/- 0.7], and body fat (mean +/- SEM: 45.0% +/-
      0.6%). AA women had more fat-free mass (P = 0.01) and tended to be more
      insulin-resistant (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.06).
      Energy intake was significantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 +/- 76
      compared with 2769 +/- 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was
      comparable (AA: 2590 +/- 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 +/- 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After
      adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231
      +/- 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 +/- 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical
      activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and
      thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly
      different between groups. Conclusions: Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is
      significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake
      recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore
      overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional
      overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and 
      postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women. This trial was
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01954342.

TI  - Emergence of mature cortical activity in wakefulness and sleep in healthy preterm
      and full-term infants.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsy096 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: Cortical activity patterns develop rapidly over the equivalent 
      of the last trimester of gestation, in parallel with the establishment of sleep
      architecture. However, the emergence of mature cortical activity in wakefulness
      compared with sleep states in healthy preterm infants is poorly understood.
      Methods: To investigate whether the cortical activity has a different
      developmental profile in each sleep-wake state, we recorded 11-channels
      electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and respiratory movement 
      for 1 hr from 115 infants 34 to 43 weeks-corrected age, with 0.5-17 days of
      postnatal age. We characterized the trajectory of delta, theta, and alpha-beta
      oscillations in wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep by
      calculating the power spectrum of the EEG, averaged across artifact-free epochs. 
      Results: delta-Oscillations in wakefulness and REM sleep decrease with corrected 
      age, particularly in the temporal region, but not in non-REM sleep.
      theta-Oscillations increase with corrected age in sleep, especially non-REM
      sleep, but not in wakefulness. On the other hand, alpha-beta oscillations
      decrease predominantly with postnatal age, independently of sleep-wake state,
      particularly in the occipital region. Conclusions: The developmental trajectory
      of delta and theta rhythms is state-dependent and results in changed cortical
      activity patterns between states with corrected age, which suggests that these
      frequency bands may have particular functional roles in each state.
      Interestingly, postnatal age is associated with a decrease in alpha-beta
      oscillations overlying primary visual cortex in every sleep-wake state,
      suggesting that postnatal experience (including the first visual input through
      open eyes during periods of wakefulness) is associated with resting-state visual 
      cortical activity changes.

AB  - Pregnancy often predisposes women to new-onset sleep disturbances, as well as
      exacerbations of preexisting sleep disorders. The goals of treating perinatal
      sleep disorders include the promotion of restorative sleep and the benefits it
      brings to both mother and fetus. The prescribing of any sleep aid in pregnancy
      must include consideration of the risks and benefits for both the patient and her
      fetus. Although data on the perinatal use of sleep aids is limited, there may be 
      effects on fetal development, timing and duration of delivery, and postnatal
      outcomes.

TI  - Antepartum Care of Women Who Are Obese During Pregnancy: Systematic Review of the
      Current Evidence.
PG  - 259-272
LID - 10.1111/jmwh.12758 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nearly 40% of US women of childbearing age are obese. Obesity
      during pregnancy is associated with multiple risks for both the woman and fetus, 
      yet clinicians often feel unprepared to provide optimal antepartum care for this 
      group of women. We collected and reviewed current evidence concerning antepartum 
      care of women who are obese during pregnancy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic 
      review using PRISMA guidelines. Current evidence relating to the pregnancy care
      of women with a prepregnancy body mass index of 30kg/m(2) or higher was
      identified using MEDLINE databases via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science Core
      Collection between January 2012 and February 2018. RESULTS: A total of 354
      records were located after database searches, of which 63 met inclusion criteria.
      Topic areas for of included studies were: pregnancy risk and outcomes related to 
      obesity, communication between women and health care providers, gestational
      weight gain and activity/diet, diabetic disorders, hypertensive disorders,
      obstructive sleep apnea, mental health, pregnancy imaging and measurement, late
      antepartum care, and preparation for labor and birth. DISCUSSION: Midwives and
      other health care providers can provide better antepartum care to women who are
      obese during pregnancy by incorporating evidence from the most current clinical
      investigations.

TI  - Toward a Shared-Care Model of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Role of the
      Primary Care Practitioner.
PG  - 304-312
LID - 10.1017/cjn.2018.7 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a shared-care model to enable
      primary-care physicians to participate more fully in meeting the complex,
      multidisciplinary healthcare needs of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      DESIGN: The design consisted of development of consensus recommendations and a
      shared-care algorithm. PARTICIPANTS: A working group of 11 Canadian neurologists 
      involved in the management of patients with MS were included in this study. MAIN 
      MESSAGE: The clinical management of patients with multiple sclerosis is
      increasing in complexity as new disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) become
      available, and ongoing safety monitoring is required. A shared-care model that
      includes primary care physicians is needed. Primary care physicians can assist in
      the early detection of MS of individuals presenting with neurological symptoms.
      Additional key roles for family physicians are health promotion, symptom
      management, and safety and relapse monitoring of DMT-treated patients. General
      principles of health promotion include counseling MS patients on maintaining a
      healthy lifestyle; performing standard screening measures; and identifying and
      treating comorbidities. Of particular importance are depression and anxiety,
      which occur in >20% of MS patients. Standard work-ups and treatments are needed
      for common MS-related symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, bladder dysfunction,
      sexual dysfunction, spasticity, and sleep disorders. Ongoing safety monitoring is
      required for patients receiving specific DMTs. Multiple sclerosis medications are
      generally contraindicated during pregnancy, and patients should be counseled to
      practice effective contraception. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sclerosis is a complex,
      disabling illness, which, similar to other chronic diseases, requires ongoing
      multidisciplinary care to meet the evolving needs of patients throughout the
      clinical course. Family physicians can play an invaluable role in maintaining
      general health, managing MS-related symptoms and comorbidities, monitoring for
      treatment-related adverse effects and MS relapses, and coordinating allied health
      services to ensure continuity of care to meet the complex and evolving needs of
      MS patients through the disease course. RESUME: Elaborer un modele de soins
      partages dans les cas de sclerose en plaques recurrente-remittente. Objectif:
      Elaborer un modele de soins partages afin de permettre aux medecins de premiere
      ligne de mieux repondre aux besoins complexes et multidisciplinaires de patients 
      atteints de la sclerose en plaques (SP). Conception : Recommandations resultant
      d'un consensus et elaboration d'un algorithme en matiere de soins partages.
      PARTICIPANTS: Un groupe de travail forme de onze neurologues canadiens impliques 
      dans la prise en charge de patients atteints de la SP. Message-cle : La prise en 
      charge clinique de patients atteints de la SP est de plus en plus complexe dans
      la mesure ou des medicaments modificateurs de l'evolution de la maladie (MMSP)
      deviennent accessibles et ou un suivi permanent en matiere de securite est
      necessaire. Soulignons aussi qu'un modele de soins partages incluant les medecins
      de premiere ligne est necessaire. Ces professionnels peuvent permettre un
      depistage plus rapide de la SP chez des individus presentant des symptomes
      neurologiques. Ils peuvent aussi jouer un role de premier plan en matiere de
      promotion de la sante, de soulagement des symptomes et de suivi de patients
      traites avec des MMSP en ce qui a trait a leur securite et a de possibles
      rechutes. Parmi les principes generaux de promotion de la sante, on peut inclure 
      les suivants : offrir aux patients atteints de la SP des conseils leur permettant
      de maintenir de saines habitudes de vie ; adopter des mesures de depistage
      standards ; identifier et traiter les comorbidites. A cet egard, l'anxiete et la 
      depression sont d'une importance particuliere et sont frequemment signalees (> 20
      %) chez les patients atteints de SP. Des demarches d'investigation et des
      traitements standards sont necessaires dans le cas des symptomes courants relies 
      a la SP, par exemple de la fatigue, des douleurs, une dysfonction vesicale, des
      dysfonctions sexuelles, de la spasticite et des troubles du sommeil. On l'a dit, 
      un suivi permanent s'impose dans le cas de patients beneficiant d'un traitement
      specifique avec des MMSP. Les medicaments associes a la SP sont generalement
      contre-indiques durant la grossesse de sorte qu'on devrait conseiller aux
      patients d'adopter des methodes de contraception efficaces. CONCLUSIONS: La SP
      est une maladie complexe et invalidante qui, a l'instar d'autres maladies
      chroniques, exige des soins multidisciplinaires continus afin de repondre, en
      lien avec un tableau clinique precis, aux besoins en constante evolution des
      patients. Les medecins de premiere ligne peuvent jouer un role irremplacable a
      plusieurs egards : dans le maintien d'une bonne sante ; le suivi et le
      soulagement des symptomes et des comorbidites relies a la SP ; le suivi des
      rechutes et des effets indesirables associes aux traitements. N'oublions pas non 
      plus la coordination des services paramedicaux afin d'assurer, durant l'evolution
      de la SP, une continuite des soins repondant aux besoins complexes et en
      constante evolution des patients atteints de cette maladie.

AB  - AIM: The knowledge on biological rhythms is rapidly expanding. We aimed to define
      the longitudinal development of the daily (24-hour) fetal heart rate rhythm in an
      unrestricted, out-of-hospital setting and to examine the effects of maternal
      physical activity, season and fetal sex. METHODS: We recruited 48 women with
      low-risk singleton pregnancies. Using a portable monitor for continuous fetal
      electrocardiography, fetal heart rate recordings were obtained around gestational
      weeks 24, 28, 32 and 36. Daily rhythms in fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate
      variation were detected by cosinor analysis; developmental trends were calculated
      by population-mean cosinor and multilevel analysis. RESULTS: For the fetal heart 
      rate and fetal heart rate variation, a significant daily rhythm was present in
      122/123 (99.2%) and 116/121 (95.9%) of the individual recordings respectively.
      The rhythms were best described by combining cosine waves with periods of 24 and 
      8 hours. With increasing gestational age, the magnitude of the fetal heart rate
      rhythm increased, and the peak of the fetal heart rate variation rhythm shifted
      from a mean of 14:25 (24 weeks) to 20:52 (36 weeks). With advancing gestation,
      the rhythm-adjusted mean value of the fetal heart rate decreased linearly in
      females (P < .001) and nonlinearly in males (quadratic function, P = .001). At 32
      and 36 weeks, interindividual rhythm diversity was found in male fetuses during
      higher maternal physical activity and during the summer season. CONCLUSION: The
      dynamic development of the daily fetal heart rate rhythm during the second half
      of pregnancy is modified by fetal sex, maternal physical activity and season.

AB  - Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder characterized by the presence 
      of orthostatic symptoms (including lightheadedness, palpitations, nausea,
      dyspnea, and tremulousness) as well as excessive upright tachycardia. POTS
      predominantly affects women of childbearing age. Treating POTS involves a
      multi-faceted approach using non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      interventions. There are no pharmacological treatments that are currently United 
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for POTS due to lack of
      randomized controlled trials. Yet, several medications can improve POTS symptoms 
      and are supported by small prospective studies or retrospective case series.
      Drugs that are most commonly used for POTS target the following mechanisms 1)
      blood volume expansion, 2) reduction of heart rate, 3) peripheral
      vasoconstriction and 4) sympatholysis. Pharmacological approaches can also be
      used to target specific symptoms including "brain fog," fatigue, sleep, and
      depression. This review outlines pharmacological approaches for treating POTS and
      summarizes evidence supporting each treatment approach.

TI  - Gender difference in the effects of lead exposure at different time windows on
      neurobehavioral development in 5-year-old children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the association between lead exposure and children's
      neurodevelopment has been studied, gender differences remain to be investigated. 
      We examined the effects of lead exposure on the neurobehavioral development of
      5-year-old children to identify the vulnerable time window of exposure and
      potential gender difference. METHOD: A total of 1751 pregnant women and children 
      participated in the prospective birth cohort study, Mothers and Children's
      Environmental Health study, since 2006. Lead levels were measured in the maternal
      blood in early and late pregnancies, in cord blood at birth, and in 2-, 3-, and
      5-year-old children's blood. The behavior of 575 children aged 5years were
      assessed using the Korean Child Behavior Checklist. The association between the
      blood lead level at each time window and behavior was examined using a
      generalized linear model adjusted for potential confounders and covariates.
      RESULTS: Lead levels at late pregnancy were significantly associated with
      increased risk of behavioral problems in males. Lead levels in 2- and 5-year-old 
      children's blood significantly increased behavioral risks in females: for a
      1-mug/dL increase in blood lead levels, the score for total behavioral problems
      increased by 3.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-5.45) during the late
      pregnancy in males, whereas it increased by 3.82 (95% CI: 1.25-6.39) at 2years
      and by 5.72 (95% CI: 0.44-10.99) at 5years in females with a stronger effect in
      attention and sleep problems. CONCLUSION: Effects of lead toxicity on children's 
      neurobehavioral development showed gender differences. Males were more
      susceptible to prenatal exposure, while females were more susceptible to
      postnatal exposure with stronger effects in attention and sleep problems.

AB  - The spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) ranges from mild snoring to
      obstructive sleep apnea, the most severe form of SDB. Current recommendations are
      to treat these women with continuous positive airway pressure despite limited
      data. SDB in early and mid-pregnancy is associated with preeclampsia and
      gestational diabetes. Pregnant women with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea 
      at delivery were at significantly increased risk of having cardiomyopathy,
      congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and in-hospital death. These
      effects were exacerbated in the presence of obesity. Postpartum, these women are 
      at risk for respiratory suppression and should be monitored.
