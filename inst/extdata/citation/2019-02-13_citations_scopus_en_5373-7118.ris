AB  - Although opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) is the treatment of choice for pregnant opioid-dependent patients, some professionals argue that tapering the medication dose will reduce the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This case description is based on the patient's detailed blog, and medical records from her general practitioner and the hospital. The patient is an employed, 32-year-old drug-abstinent woman in OMT. Her taper from 24 mg of buprenorphine started at 14 weeks' gestation and is slow, with withdrawal symptoms increasing gradually. In pregnancy week 31, she is off buprenorphine but she has severe withdrawal symptoms. She chose to go back on 4 mg of buprenorphine. The patient's son was born in pregnancy week 38+3, weighs 2950 g and does not require pharmacological treatment for NAS. The fetus most probably did experience fetal stress during the patient's tapering. It was the right decision by the patient to go back on buprenorphine. Copyright 2014 BMJ Publishing Group.

AB  - Background: There is emerging research to suggest that supine maternal sleep position in late pregnancy may adversely affect fetal wellbeing. However, these studies have all been based on maternal report of sleeping position. Before recommendations to change sleep position can be made it is important to determine the validity of these studies by investigating how accurate pregnant women are in reporting their sleep position. If avoiding the supine sleeping position reduces risk of poor pregnancy outcome, it is also important to know how well women can comply with the instruction to avoid this position and sleep on their left.
Method: Thirty women in late pregnancy participated in a three-night observational study and were asked to report their sleeping position. This was compared to sleep position as recorded by a night capable video recording. The participants were instructed to settle to sleep on their left side and if they woke overnight to settle back to sleep on their left.
Results: There was a moderate correlation between reported and videodetermined left-side sleep time (r50.48), mean difference53 min (SD53.5 h). Participants spent an average of 59.60% (SD516.73%) of time in bed on their left side (ICC across multiple nights50.67). Those who included left side among their typical sleep positions reported significantly longer sleep during the study (p,0.01).
Conclusions: On average participant reports of sleep position were relatively accurate but there were large individual differences in reporting accuracy and in objectively-determined time on left side. Night-to-night consistency was substantial. For those who do not ordinarily sleep on that side, asking participants to sleep on their left may result in reduced sleep duration. This is an important consideration during a sleep-critical time such as late pregnancy. © 2014 Warland, Dorrian.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether poor sleep quality of third-trimester pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depression.
Material/Methods: Third-trimester pregnant women (T0, n=293) were tested using the first socio-demographic, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale assessments, and received a diagnosis of depression. Three months (T1, n=223) after delivery, scale filling was finished and the structured interview was performed again.
Results: We found that 73 persons (32.7%) were low income, 84 persons (37.7%) were middle-income, and 66 persons (29.6%) were higher income. The overall prevalence of postpartum depression was 9.4% (21 persons). After controlling for other factors, age, household income, marital satisfaction, and sleep quality were significantly related to postpartum depression, in which age and sleep quality scores (a higher score was associated with poorer sleep quality) were positively related to postpartum depression, and household income and marital satisfaction were negatively related to postpartum depression. Moreover, third-trimester sleep quality score was positively related to postpartum depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: Poor third-trimester subjective sleep quality is a risk factor for postpartum depression. © Med Sci Monit, 2014.

AB  - Background: Non-supine infant sleep positions put infants at risk for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Disparities in safe sleep practices are associated with maternal income and race/ethnicity. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a nutrition supplement program for low-income (≤185% Federal Poverty Level) pregnant and postpartum women. Currently in Massachusetts, approximately 40% of pregnant/postpartum women are WIC clients. To inform the development of a SUID intervention strategy, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) investigated the association between WIC status and infant safe sleep practices among postpartum Massachusetts mothers using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey. Methods: PRAMS is an ongoing statewide health surveillance system of new mothers conducted by the MDPH in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). PRAMS includes questions about infant sleep position and mothers’ prenatal WIC status. Risk Ratio (RR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for infant supine sleep positioning by WIC enrollment, yearly and in aggregate (2007–2010). Results/Outcomes: The aggregate (2007–2010) weighted sample included 276,252 women (weighted n ≈ 69,063 women/year; mean survey response rate 69%). Compared to non-WIC mothers, WIC mothers were less likely to usually or always place their infants in supine sleeping positions [RR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.81)]. Overall, significant differences were found for each year (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010), and in aggregate (2007–2010) by WIC status. Conclusion: Massachusetts WIC mothers more frequently placed their babies in non-supine positions than non-WIC mothers. While this relationship likely reflects the demographic factors associated with safe sleep practices (e.g., maternal income and race/ethnicity), the finding informed the deployment of an intervention strategy for SUID prevention. Given WIC’s statewide infrastructure and the large proportion of pregnant/postpartum women in Massachusetts that are enrolled in WIC, a WIC-based safe sleep intervention may be an effective SUID reduction strategy with potential national application. © 2014, Treadway et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep contributes to the developmental problems seen in preterm infants. We evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants 6 months of post-gestational age using the subjective Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and objective sleep tests. We also compared the sleep of premature infants with that of full-term infants. Methods: The study included 68 6-month-old full-term healthy infants and 191 premature infants born at <37 weeks gestation. All parents completed the BISQ-Chinese version and sleep diaries. At the same time, all premature infants were submitted to one night of polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory and also were set up with an actigraph kept for 7 days. Statistical analyses were performed using correlation coefficients and the t-test with SPSS version 18 to compare questionnaire responses with other subjective and objective measures of sleep. Results: The sleep problems indicated in the subjective questionnaire for the premature infants, particularly: "the nocturnal sleep duration, number of night awakenings, daytime sleep duration, duration of time with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing" had significant correlations with sleep diaries, actigraphy and PSG results. The BISQ showed that duration of infant's sleeping on one side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, daytime sleep duration, subjective consideration of sleep problems, loud-noisy breathing, and duration spent crying during the night were significantly different between the premature infants and the term infants. PSG confirmed the presence of a very high percentage (80.6%) of premature infants with AHI > 1 event/hour as indicated by the questionnaire. Conclusion: Premature infants have more sleep problems than full-term infants, including the known risk of abnormal breathing during sleep, which has been well demonstrated already with the BISQ-Chinese (CBISQ). © 2014 Huang et al.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common illness, but due to the underlying processes and the diversity of symptoms, some variability is exhibited. The risk of postpartum depression is great if the mother has previously suffered from depression, but there is some evidence that a certain subgroup of women only experience depression during the postpartum period. Methods: The study group consisted of 104 mothers with postpartum major depression and a control group of 104 postpartum mothers without depression. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was used for data collection. The severity of depression and other mental symptoms were assessed using several validated rating scales. Results: A history of past depression (82%), including depression during pregnancy (42%) and during the postpartum period (53%), was very common in those with current PPD. Eighteen per cent of mothers with current PPD had previously not had any depressive episodes and four per cent had experienced depression only during the postpartum period. Therefore, pure PPD was rare. The onset of PPD was usually (84%) within six weeks of childbirth. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, depressed mood, diminished pleasure/interest, decreased energy, and psychomotor agitation/retardation were common with all kinds of depression histories. Pure PPD was the most similar to the first depressive episode. Nevertheless, the severity of depression, the level of hopelessness, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation were lower, appetite changed less, and concentration was better than in other recurrent depressions. Conclusions: According to this study, PPD is not a homogenous disorder. The time of onset, severity, symptoms, level of hopelessness, and the course of depression vary. Recurrent depression is common. All mothers must be screened during the sixth week postpartum at the latest. Screening alone is not effective; it is also important to give mothers information about PPD and to discuss the symptoms with them in order for them to recognise this disorder and possible new episodes in the future. © Kettunen et al.

AB  - Objective: Government funders of biomedical research are under increasing pressure to demonstrate societal benefits of their investments. A number of published studies attempted to correlate research funding levels with the societal burden for various diseases, with mixed results. We examined whether research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is well aligned with current and projected veterans' health needs. The organizational structure of the VA makes it a particularly suitable setting for examining these questions.
Methods: We used the publication patterns and dollar expenditures of VA-funded researchers to characterize the VA research portfolio by disease. We used health care utilization data from the VA for the same diseases to define veterans' health needs. We then measured the level of correlation between the two and identified disease groups that were under- or over-represented in the research portfolio relative to disease expenditures. Finally, we used historic health care utilization trends combined with demographic projections to identify diseases and conditions that are increasing in costs and/or patient volume and consequently represent potential targets for future research investments.
Results: We found a significant correlation between research volume/expenditures and health utilization. Some disease groups were slightly under- or overrepresented, but these deviations were relatively small. Diseases and conditions with the increasing utilization trend at the VA included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hearing loss, sleeping disorders, complications of pregnancy, and several mental disorders.
Conclusions: Research investments at the VA are well aligned with veteran health needs. The VA can continue to meet these needs by supporting research on the diseases and conditions with a growing number of patients, costs of care, or both. Our approach can be used by other funders of disease research to characterize their portfolios and to plan research investments.

AB  - Background. True findings about schizophrenia remain elusive; many findings are not replicated and conflicting results are common. Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia.
Method. Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias.
Results. High- and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent.
Conclusions. We conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our understanding of it remains limited. Copyright © 2014 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - In most species, self-sustained molecular clocks regulate 24-h rhythms of behavior and physiology. In mammals, a circadian pacemaker residing in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives photic signals from the retina and synchronizes subordinate clocks in non-SCN tissues. The emergence of circadian rhythmicity during development has been extensively studied for many years. In mice, neuronal development in the presumptive SCN region of the embryonic hypothalamus occurs on days 12-15 of gestation. Intra-SCN circuits differentiate during the following days and retinal projections reach the SCN, and thus mediate photic entrainment, only after birth. In contrast the genetic components of the clock gene machinery are expressed much earlier and during midgestation SCN explants and isolated neurons are capable of generating molecular oscillations in culture. In vivo metabolic rhythms in the SCN, however, are observed not earlier than the 19th day of rat gestation, and rhythmic expression of clock genes is hardly detectable until after birth. Together these data indicate that cellular coupling and, thus, tissue-wide synchronization of single-cell rhythms, may only develop very late during embryogenesis. In this mini-review we describe the developmental origin of the SCN structure and summarize our current knowledge about the functional initiation and entrainment of the circadian pacemaker during embryonic development. © 2014 Landgraf, Kochand Oster.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic sensorimotor disease; it is the most significant movement disorder of sleep and causes significant sleep and quality-of-life disturbances. RLS is a clinical diagnosis; therefore, the patient interview is sufficient in most cases to make the diagnosis. Behavioral interventions, such as regular exercise, maintaining good sleep hygiene, heating pads, warm or cold baths, massage, and mental distraction, can be sufficient in treating RLS symptoms, especially if symptoms are mild and/or infrequent. Pharmacologic interventions include dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opiates, sedative hypnotics, clonidine, and amantadine. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The season of birth risk factor for schizophrenia exerts a pervasive effect on the global population, particularly at northerly latitudes. The winter infection hypothesis and the low vitamin D hypothesis are both compelling but lack conclusive clinical data. The present work develops a maternal-fetal chronobiological hypothesis for this season of birth risk factor and its prevention by maternal bright light treatment. Around the winter solstice, due to decreased sunlight, the chronobiological apparatus of the at-risk second trimester mother is characterized by a reduced amplitude circadian pacemaker, and a reduced maximum of her nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations (MTmax) and an increased minimum of her nocturnal core body temperatures (Tmin)-both of which exert adverse effects on the fetal hippocampus and dorsal striatum. The consequences for the fetus include reduced volume and increased excitability of the hippocampus, ventral striatal dysfunction, increased presynaptic nigrostriatal dopamine transmission, and increased propensity for pathological nigrostriatal neuronal phasic firing. Thus, the maternal-fetal chronobiological hypothesis fully accounts for the fetal precursors of the major pathognomonic abnormalities in adults with schizophrenia. Bright light treatment for the second trimester mother around the winter solstice, by increasing maternal circadian amplitude, could possibly prevent the fetal hippocampal and striatal abnormalities and eliminate the season of birth risk factor for schizophrenia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective: To study the state of the cardiovascular system (CVS) in the early neonatal period in children with a history of hypoxia/ischaemia and/or acute asphyxia, in different methods of delivery, and also to evaluate the capability of electrocardiography (ECG) and 24-hour (Holter) monitoring to reveal CVS dysfunction. Patients and methods: 252 examined newborns of varied gestational age comprised three groups: group 1-100 children born by caesarean section; group 2-102 children after natural delivery. Children of groups 1 and 2 had a history of chronic intrauterine hypoxia/ischaemia and/or acute asphyxia during delivery. The control group (3) comprised 50 healthy full-term children of women with a physiological course of pregnancy and labour. In all children a standard 12-lead ECG was recorded at day 1-2 of life. At day 7 of life, 24-hour (Holter) monitoring was performed according to the standard technique with assessment of dynamics: mean HR in sleep and wake periods; minimal and maximal HR; duration of rhythm pauses; manifestation of disorders of rhythms and conductivity; the character of circadian rhythm organization was determined (calculation of the circadian index - CI). Results: ECG significantly more often revealed ischaemia-mediated disorders of the ST-T interval in children of group 1 as compared with other groups (86, 49 and 0% in groups 1-3, respectively, p ≤ 0.001), they often had a disseminated character and correlated with the CI degree (r = 0.908, p ≤ 0.05). The mean index of total deviation of?-wave amplitude (ITD-T) was also higher in patients of group 1 (3.3 ± 0.61 and 2.2 ± 0.68 mm, respectively, p ≤ 0.005). In all children with a history of hypoxia/ischaemia or asphyxia during delivery, disorders of sinus-node automatism prevailed (10 vs 2% in the control group, p ≤ 0.05); pathological duration (more than 440 ms) of the corrected QT interval (15 vs 6% in the control group; p ≤ 0.05) was recorded more often, which reflected electric instability of the myocardium. Analysis of the Holter monitoring parameters showed disorders of neurovegetative regulation of cardiac rhythm in children after operative delivery as distinct from children of the control group: low levels of cardiac rhythm reactivity to various exposures - decreased variability of HR (112.1 ± 5.4 vs 137.7 ± 3.5 beats/min, p ≤ 0.001), lower values of maximal HR (204.4 ± 3.9 vs 217.6 ± 3.5 beats/min, p ≤ 0.05) and CI with formation of a rigid circadian profile (CI < 1.1) in 72% of cases. The mean duration of rhythm pauses in children with signs of cerebral ischaemia, irrespective of the type of delivery, exceeded their duration in healthy children (821.8 ± 32.13 and 861.1 ± 26.61 ms vs 764.2 ± 32.1 ms, respectively, p ≤ 0.05), which is especially significant for premature babies. Conclusions: The early adaptation period in newborn children with a history of chronic hypoxia-ischaemia and/or acute asphyxia during delivery takes a more tense course than in healthy children, which finds reflection in the functional activity of the CVS. High risk groups are both premature children, and newborn children extracted by caesarean section, irrespective of terms of gestation. Administration of standard ECG on the first day of life, supplemented, if required, by 24-hour Holter monitoring, widens diagnostic possibilities of paediatricians in revealing dysfunction in newborns from risk groups.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the prevalence of self-reported abnormal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness in pregnancy among Māori (indigenous New Zealanders) and non-Māori women versus the general population, and to examine the influence of socio-demographic factors. Methods: Self-reported total sleep time (TST) in 24-hrs, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and socio-demographic information were obtained from nullipara and multipara women aged 20-46 yrs at 35-37 weeks pregnant (358 Māori and 717 non-Māori), and women in the general population (381 Māori and 577 non-Māori). Results: After controlling for ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and employment status, pregnant women average 30 min less TST than women in the general population. The distribution of TST was also greater in pregnant women, who were 3 times more likely to be short sleepers (≤6 h) and 1.9 times more likely to be long sleepers (>9 h). In addition, pregnant women were 1.8 times more likely to report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Pregnant women >30 years of age experienced greater age-related declines in TST. Identifying as Māori, being unemployed, and working at night increased the likelihood of reporting abnormal sleep duration across all women population in this study. EDS also more likely occurred among Māori women and women who worked at night. Conclusions: Pregnancy increases the prevalence of abnormal sleep duration and EDS, which are also higher among Māori than non-Māori women and those who do night work. Health professionals responsible for the care of pregnant women need to be well-educated about the importance of sleep and discuss sleep issues with the women they care for. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n-3) is a major structural component of neural tissue critical to neurotransmission and mood regulation. Poor maternal dietary intake coupled with accelerated maternal-fetal transfer of DHA compound risk for maternal deficiency. The objective of this investigation was to determine if maternal DHA supplementation is efficacious in reducing symptoms of postpartum depression. Methods This pilot investigation was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled investigation of the role of DHA in preventing risk for postpartum depression. Women were assigned to: i) Placebo (no DHA, corn oil capsule), ii) DHA (300 mg DHA, fish oil capsule). Capsules were consumed from 24 to 40 weeks gestation (1 capsule 5 days/week). Forty-two participants were recruited (n = 20, intervention; n = 22, placebo). Maternal DHA status and depressive symptoms were followed from 24 to 40 weeks gestation using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) from 2 weeks to 6 months postpartum. Results PDSS total scores were significantly lower (p = 0.016; 46.03 ± 2.17, intervention vs. 52.11 ± 2.4, placebo) in the intervention group with less anxiety/insecurity (p = 0.03), emotional lability (p = 0.04) and loss of self (p = 0.02). Conclusions Women in the DHA intervention group had fewer symptoms of postpartum depression compared to the placebo group. These results support the notion that the consumption of DHA by pregnant women can be efficacious in preventing depressive symptoms and highlight a need for further larger-scale investigations using the PDSS in tandem with a diagnostic evaluation.

AB  - The hypothalamus is one of the oldest and smallest parts of the brain, constituting just 4 gm of the 1400 gm of adult human brain weight. And yet this tiny area contains highly conserved neural circuitry that controls basic life functions: these include energy metabolism, from feeding through digestion, metabolic control, and energy expenditure; fluid and electrolyte balance, from drinking through fluid absorption and excretion; thermoregulation, from choice of environment through heat production and conservation, and fever responses; wake-sleep cycles and emergency responses to stressors in the environment; and reproduction, from reproductive hormone control through mating, pregnancy, birth, and suckling. In this Primer, we will give an overview of the structure of the hypothalamus, and outline what we know about how that relates to its functional circuitry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is caused by an interstitial microdeletion of chromosome 17p11.2. A few patients with the typical SMS phenotype have RAI1 gene mutations. The syndrome is characterized by minor craniofacial anomalies, short stature, sleep disturbances, behavioural and neurocognitive abnormalities, as well as variable multisystemic manifestations. Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a genetically heterogeneous neuronal migration disorder characterized by subependymal heterotopic nodules, and is variably associated with other brain malformations, epileptic seizures and intellectual disability. Here we report on two patients harboring deletions of the 17p11.2 region in whom the SMS typical phenotype was associated with bilateral PNH. Our observations expand the spectrum of chromosomal rearrangements associated with PNH and indicate that abnormal neuronal migration may contribute to the neurocognitive phenotype of SMS. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Disturbances of fetal autonomic brain development can be evaluated from fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) reflecting the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Although HRP analysis from cardiotocographic (CTG) recordings is established for fetal surveillance, temporal resolution is low. Fetal magnetocardiography (MCG), however, provides stable continuous recordings at a higher temporal resolution combined with a more precise heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. A direct comparison of CTG and MCG based HRV analysis is pending. The aims of the present study are: (i) to compare the fetal maturation age predicting value of the MCG based fetal Autonomic Brain Age Score (fABAS) approach with that of CTG based Dawes-Redman methodology; and (ii) to elaborate fABAS methodology by segmentation according to fetal behavioral states and HRP. We investigated MCG recordings from 418 normal fetuses, aged between 21 and 40 weeks of gestation. In linear regression models we obtained an age predicting value of CTG compatible short term variability (STV) of R2 = 0.200 (coefficient of determination) in contrast to MCG/fABAS related multivariate models with R2 = 0.648 in 30 min recordings, R2 = 0.610 in active sleep segments of 10 min, and R2 = 0.626 in quiet sleep segments of 10 min. Additionally segmented analysis under particular exclusion of accelerations (AC) and decelerations (DC) in quiet sleep resulted in a novel multivariate model with R2 = 0.706. According to our results, fMCG based fABAS may provide a promising tool for the estimation of fetal autonomic brain age. Beside other traditional and novel HRV indices as possible indicators of developmental disturbances, the establishment of a fABAS score normogram may represent a specific reference. The present results are intended to contribute to further exploration and validation using independent data sets and multicenter research structures. © 2014 Frontiers Research Foundation.

AB  - Changes in the maternal environment can induce fetal adaptations that result in the progression of chronic diseases in the offspring. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of maternal chronic sleep restriction on blood pressure, renal function and cardiac baroreflex response on male offspring at adult age. Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in two experimental groups: control (C) and chronic sleep restricted (CSR). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. Chronic sleep restricted females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily, between the 1st and 20th day of pregnancy. After birth, the litters were reduced to 6 rats per mother, and were designated as offspring from control (OC) and offspring from chronic sleep restricted (OCSR). Indirect blood pressure (BPi - tail cuff) was measured by plethysmography in male offspring at 3 months old. Following, the renal function and cardiac baroreflex response were analyzed. Values of BPi in OCSR were significantly higher compared to OC [OC: 12762.6 (19); OCSR: 14462.5 (17) mmHg]. The baroreflex sensitivity to the increase of blood pressure was reduced in OCSR [Slope: OC: 22.660.15 (9); OCRS: 21.660.13 (9)]. Hypothalamic activity of ACE2 was significantly reduced in OCSR compared to OC [OC: 97.4 615 (18); OSR: 60.263.6 (16) UAF/min/protein mg]. Renal function alteration was noticed by the increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) observed in OCSR [OC: 6.460.2 (10); OCSR: 7.4 60.3 (7)]. Chronic sleep restriction during pregnancy caused in the offspring hypertension, altered cardiac baroreflex response, reduced ACE-2 activity in the hypothalamus and renal alterations. Our data suggest that the reduction of sleeping time along the pregnancy is able to modify maternal homeostasis leading to functional alterations in offspring. ©2014 Lima et al.

AB  - Despite huge efforts from public sectors to educate society as to the deleterious physiological consequences of smoking while pregnant, 12-25% of all babies worldwide are born to mothers who smoked during their pregnancies. Chief among the negative legacies bestowed to the exposed individual is an enhanced proclivity postnatally to addict to drugs of abuse, which suggests that the drug exposure during gestation changed the developing brain in such a way that biased it towards addiction. Glutamate signalling has been shown to be altered by prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter within the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), which is a brainstem region importantly involved in responding to motivational stimuli and critical in development of drug addiction-associated behaviours, however, it is unknown whether PNE alters glutamate signalling within this nucleus. Accordingly, we used calcium imaging, to evaluate AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated calcium responses in LDT brain slices from control and PNE mice. We also investigated whether the positive AMPA receptor modulator cyclothiazide (CYZ) had differential actions on calcium in the LDT following PNE. Our data indicated that PNE significantly decreased AMPA receptor-mediated calcium responses, and altered the neuronal calcium response to consecutive NMDA applications within the LDT. Furthermore, CYZ strongly potentiated AMPA-induced responses, however, this action was significantly reduced in the LDT of PNE mice when compared with enhancements in responses in control LDT cells. Immunohistochemical processing confirmed that calcium imaging recordings were obtained from the LDT nucleus as determined by presence of cholinergic neurons. Our results contribute to the body of evidence suggesting that neurobiological changes are induced if gestation is accompanied by nicotine exposure. We conclude that in light of the role played by the LDT in motivated behaviour, the cellular changes in the LDT induced by exposures to nicotine prenatally, when combined with alterations in other reward-related regions, could contribute to the increased susceptibility to smoking observed in the offspring. © Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2014.

AB  - Individual differences in sleep patterns of children may have developmental origins. In the present study, two factors known to influence behavioural development, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype and prenatal Fe-deficient (ID) diet, were examined for their influences on sleep patterns in juvenile rhesus monkeys. Sleep patterns were assessed based on a threshold for inactivity as recorded by activity monitors. Pregnant monkeys were fed diets containing either 100 parts per million (ppm) Fe (Fe sufficient, IS) or 10 ppm Fe (ID). At 3-4 months of age, male offspring were genotyped for polymorphisms of the MAOA gene that lead to high or low transcription. At 1 and 2 years of age, sleep patterns were assessed. Several parameters of sleep architecture changed with age. At 1 year of age, monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype demonstrated a trend towards more sleep episodes at night compared with those with the high-MAOA genotype. When monkeys reached 2 years of age, prenatal ID reversed this trend; ID in the low-MAOA group resulted in sleep fragmentation, more awakenings at night and more sleep episodes during the day when compared with prenatal IS in this genotype. The ability to consolidate sleep during the dark cycle was disrupted by prenatal ID, specifically in monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that the time of day (TD) of glucose measurement and the fasting duration (FD) influence the glucose levels in adults. Few studies have examined the effects of the TD and FD on the glucose level following a 1-hour, 50-gram glucose challenge test (GCT) in pregnant women in screening for or diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the TD (morning, afternoon, night) and the FD (the time of the last food ingestion as follows: ≤1 hour, 1-2 hours, and >2 hours) by examining their combined effects on the glucose levels following a 50-gram GCT in pregnant women. Copyright:
Methods and Results: We analyzed the data of 1,454 non-diabetic pregnant Taiwanese women in a prospective study. Multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression were used to estimate the relationships between the 9 TD-FD groups and the continuous and binary glucose levels (cut-off at 140 mg/dL) following a 50-gram GCT, after adjusting for maternal age, nulliparity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, and weight gain. Different TD and FD groups were associated with variable glucose responses to the 50-gram GCT, some of which were significant. The estimate coefficients (β) of the TDFD groups ''night, ≤1 hr'' and ''night, 1-2 hr'' revealed significantly lower glucose concentrations [β (95% confidence interval [CI]): 26.46 (212.53, 20.38) and 26.85 (212.50, 21.20)] compared with the ''morning, >2 hr'' group. The TD-FD groups ''afternoon, ≤1 hr'' and ''afternoon, 1-2 hr'' showed significantly lower odds ratios (OR) of a positive GCT; the adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 0.54 (0.31-0.95) and 0.58 (0.35-0.96), respectively.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the importance of standardizing the TD and FD for the 1-hour, 50-gram GCT. In screening for and diagnosing GDM, the TD and FD are modifiable factors that should be considered in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. © 2014 Wang et al.

AB  - The circadian molecular clock is an internal time-keeping system composed of centrally synchronized tissue-level pacemakers. Here, we explored the ontogeny of the clock machinery in the developing kidney. Pregnant rats were housed at 12-12 h light-dark cycles. Offsprings were killed at 4-h intervals on embryonic day 20 and at postnatal weeks 1, 4, and 12. Canonical clock gene (Clock, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Cry1, Cry2, Per1, Per2) and kidney-specific clock-controlled gene (αENaC, SGK1, NHE3, AVPR2) expression was profiled by RT-PCR. To investigate the role of nutritional cues, the feeding pattern was modified postpartum. Clock, Rev-erbα, Per2, αENaC, SGK1, NHE3, and AVPR2 showed circadian expression at the end of intrauterine development. By 1 week, all genes oscillated with a distinct acrophase shift toward the time of peak feeding activity. Daily 4-hour withdrawal of mothers induced a 12-hour phase shift of Clock and Bmal1 expression, while disrupting oscillations of the other genes. After weaning, oscillation phases shifted back toward the adult pattern, which was fully expressed at 12 weeks. Thus, functional circadian molecular clockwork evolves in the late fetal and early postnatal kidney. During the nursing period, oscillations are entrained by nutritional cues. The coupling of the circadian expression of tubular regulators of fluid and electrolyte excretion to the feeding-entrained clockwork may be important to maintain homeostasis during this critical period. © 2014 International Society of Nephrology.

AB  - Despite huge efforts from public sectors to educate society as to the deleterious physiological consequences of smoking while pregnant, 12-25% of all babies worldwide are born to mothers who smoked during their pregnancies. Chief among the negative legacies bestowed to the exposed individual is an enhanced proclivity postnatally to addict to drugs of abuse, which suggests that the drug exposure during gestation changed the developing brain in such a way that biased it towards addiction. Glutamate signalling has been shown to be altered by prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter within the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), which is a brainstem region importantly involved in responding to motivational stimuli and critical in development of drug addiction-associated behaviours, however, it is unknown whether PNE alters glutamate signalling within this nucleus. Accordingly, we used calcium imaging, to evaluate AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated calcium responses in LDT brain slices from control and PNE mice. We also investigated whether the positive AMPA receptor modulator cyclothiazide (CYZ) had differential actions on calcium in the LDT following PNE. Our data indicated that PNE significantly decreased AMPA receptor-mediated calcium responses, and altered the neuronal calcium response to consecutive NMDA applications within the LDT. Furthermore, CYZ strongly potentiated AMPA-induced responses, however, this action was significantly reduced in the LDT of PNE mice when compared with enhancements in responses in control LDT cells. Immunohistochemical processing confirmed that calcium imaging recordings were obtained from the LDT nucleus as determined by presence of cholinergic neurons. Our results contribute to the body of evidence suggesting that neurobiological changes are induced if gestation is accompanied by nicotine exposure. We conclude that in light of the role played by the LDT in motivated behaviour, the cellular changes in the LDT induced by exposures to nicotine prenatally, when combined with alterations in other reward-related regions, could contribute to the increased susceptibility to smoking observed in the offspring. © 2014 Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.

AB  - Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) is a risk factor for developing an addiction to nicotine at a later stage in life. Understanding the neurobiological changes in reward related circuitry induced by exposure to nicotine prenatally is vital if we are to combat the heightened addiction liability in these vulnerable individuals. The laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), which is comprised of cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, is importantly involved in reward mediation via demonstrated excitatory projections to dopamine-containing ventral tegmental neurons. PNE could lead to alterations in LDT neurons that would be expected to alter responses to later-life nicotine exposure. To examine this issue, we monitored nicotine-induced responses of LDT neurons in brain slices of PNE and drug naive mice using calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamping. Nicotine was found to induce rises in calcium in a smaller proportion of LDT cells in PNE mice aged 7-15 days and smaller rises in calcium in PNE animals from postnatal ages 11-21 days when compared with age-matched control animals. While inward currents induced by nicotine were not found to be different, nicotine did induce larger amplitude excitatory postsynaptic currents in PNE animals in the oldest age group when compared with amplitudes induced in similar-aged control animals. Immunohistochemically identified cholinergic LDT cells from PNE animals exhibited slower spike rise and decay slopes, which likely contributed to the wider action potential observed. Further, PNE was associated with a more negative action potential afterhyperpolarization in cholinergic cells. Interestingly, the changes found in these parameters in animals exposed prenatally to nicotine were age related, in that they were not apparent in animals from the oldest age group examined. Taken together, our data suggest that PNE induces changes in cholinergic LDT cells that would be expected to alter cellular excitability. As the changes are age related, these PNE-associated alterations could contribute differentially across ontogeny to nicotine-mediated reward and may contribute to the particular susceptibility of in utero nicotine exposed individuals to addict to nicotine upon nicotine exposure in the juvenile period. © Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2014.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy among high-risk women. Study Design This was a prospective, observational study. We recruited women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, history of preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9) and severe (≥30). Subjects who had a normal AHI at the baseline (AHI < 5), but an abnormal study in the third trimester (AHI ≥5) were classified as having new-onset SDB. Results A total of 128 women were recruited. In early pregnancy 21, 6 and 3% had mild, moderate, or severe SDB, respectively. These frequencies increased to 35, 7, and 5% in the third trimester (p < 0.001). About 27% (n = 34) experienced a worsening of SDB during pregnancy; 26 were cases of new-onset SDB, while the other 8 had SDB in early pregnancy that worsened in severity. The incidence of new-onset SDB was 20%. The majority of these new-onset cases were mild. Conclusions SDB in early pregnancy is common in high-risk women and new-onset SDB occurs in 20% of these women. Copyright © 2014 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Physical activity is associated with improved sleep quality and duration in the general population, but its effect on sleep in postpartum women is unknown. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hours/week of self-reported domain-specific and overall moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep quality and duration at 3- and 12-months postpartum among a cohort of 530 women in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Postpartum Study. MVPA was not associated with sleep quality or duration at 3-months postpartum. At 12-months postpartum, a 1 h/week increase in recreational MVPA was associated with higher odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.03-1.27) and a 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA was associated with lower odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.88-0.99). A 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00-1.16) was associated with higher odds of long sleep duration and 1 h/week increases in indoor household (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.18) and overall MVPA (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) were associated with higher odds of short (vs. normal) sleep duration. Comparing 3-months postpartum to 12-months postpartum, increased work MVPA was associated with good sleep quality (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.12-5.15) and increased indoor household MVPA was associated with short sleep duration (OR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.05-3.27) as measured at 12-months postpartum. Selected domains of MVPA and their longitudinal increases were associated with sleep quality and duration at 12-months postpartum. Additional research is needed to elucidate whether physical activity can improve postpartum sleep.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of physical activity before and during pregnancy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from the cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) (N = 80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) (N = 258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D, with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity, education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI 0.003-0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04-3.78), ability to handle their usual activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29-3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.22-3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03-4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Maternal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal-axis function regulates production of the stress hormone cortisol, which during pregnancy can cross the placenta and have lasting impacts on fetal growth and development. This article provides a preliminary test of the hypothesis that a woman's socioeconomic status (SES) predicts her cortisol during pregnancy and her offspring's cortisol during the early postnatal period among an ethnically diverse sample in Auckland, New Zealand to evaluate whether differences in cortisol contribute to the intergenerational inheritance of health disparities within this population.
METHODS: Maternal saliva samples were collected at waking and prior to sleep on 2 days in late pregnancy (34-36 weeks gestation; N = 55), and a subset of offspring saliva was collected before (N = 48) and 20 min after a standard vaccination at 6 weeks of age (N = 19). SES was quantified using a locally validated index of material deprivation, the NZ Deprivation Index for individuals (NZiDep).
RESULTS: We found that, after controlling for ethnicity and other covariates, women with higher NZiDep scores had significantly higher evening but similar morning cortisol, consistent with a pattern of chronic strain. Infants of women reporting greater material deprivation had elevated cortisol response to vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that maternal SES experience impacts maternal cortisol in pregnancy and offspring cortisol reactivity soon after birth, with potential long-term effects on offspring biology and health. Additional research is needed to clarify how biological and behavioral factors in both the prenatal and postnatal period facilitate this relationship. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy brings about many changes in a woman's life in somatic, psychological and social spheres. Therefore, many women decide to participate in childbirth education classes. The aim of study was to determine the differences in emotional distress between women who participated in childbirth education classes and these who did not. Material and Methods: Seventy first-time mothers after labor were examined. Based on a survey carried out, the women were divided into two equal groups. Group I consisted of women who had participated in childbirth education classes and Group II of women who had not. The data was gathered by means of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) adapted to Polish conditions. Results: There were no differences either in age or in BMI rates among the examined women. The level of education and knowledge about labor was significantly higher among the participants of childbirth classes. The results of the GHQ-12 revealed that women from Group I had a better mental status than women from Group II. Significant differences were observed in terms of sleep deprivation, overcoming difficulties and in the ability to enjoy daily activities. Conclusions: Participation in childbirth classes has a significant influence on psychological well-being in pregnant women as measured by the GHQ-12.

AB  - Pudendal nerve block is a safe and effective pain relief method for vaginal birth. Providing analgesia to the vulva and anus, it is used for operative vaginal birth and subsequent repair, late second stage pain relief with spontaneous vaginal birth, repair of complex lacerations, or repair of lacerations in women who are unable to achieve adequate or satisfactory pain relief during perineal repair with local anesthesia. Key to its efficacy is the knowledge of pudendal nerve anatomy, the optimal point of infiltration of local anesthetic, and an understanding of the amount of time necessary to effect adequate analgesia. © 2014 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - A 28-year-old right-handed female came to the clinic 3 days after her first seizure. The seizure occurred out of sleep and was described by her boyfriend as a convulsion. The emergency medical service took her to the nearest hospital where she was diagnosed with new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient was amnestic for the event and was without memory recall until she arrived at the hospital. She had no significant past medical history and did not use alcohol or illicit drugs. She worked in marketing and had been very successful in her career. Her routine and neurological examinations were unrevealing, excepting the post-ictal state. A CT of the head and routine laboratory assessment, including a urine drug screen, were normal. She recovered gradually to baseline and was discharged from the emergency department with neurological consultation planned. There were no definite triggers and she had no risk factors for epilepsy. She lived alone but had a steady boyfriend with whom she planned to marry and have children. She was seen for neurological evaluation and discussion of family planning. A brain MRI was performed and was normal. A routine outpatient EEG was performed and showed bursts of generalized anterior-predominant 3 Hz spike-and-slow-waves, consistent with Genetic Generalized Epilepsy (Fig. 23.1). The patient was subsequently started on lamotrigine (LTG) and told to refrain from operating a motor vehicle. During titration of LTG, she experienced a second generalized tonic-clonic seizure 2 weeks later, which occurred at work. Her employer was nervous about her returning to work, due to concerns that she would have a seizure at work, and that a diagnosis of epilepsy would impact her ability to perform her job. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Interventions to prevent sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) have generally been population wide interventions instituted after case-control studies identified specific childcare practices associated with sudden death. While successful overall, in New Zealand (NZ), the rates are still relatively high by international comparison. This study aims to describe childcare practices related to SUDI prevention messages in a New Zealand community, and to develop and explore the utility of a risk assessment instrument based on international guidelines and evidence. Methods: Prospective longitudinal study of 209 infants recruited antenatally. Participant characteristics and infant care data were collected by questionnaire at: baseline (third trimester), and monthly from infant age 3 weeks through 23 weeks. Published meta-analyses data were used to estimate individual risk ratios for 6 important SUDI risk factors which, when combined, yielded a "SUDI risk score". Results: Most infants were at low risk for SUDI with 72%at the lowest or slightly elevated risk (combined risk ratio ≤1.5). There was a high prevalence of the safe practices: supine sleeping (86-89%over 3-19 weeks), mother not smoking (90-92%over 3-19 weeks), and not bed sharing at a young age (87%at 3 weeks). Five independent predictors of a high SUDI risk score were: higher parity (P =0.028), younger age (P =0.030), not working or caring for other children antenatally (P =0.031), higher depression scores antenatally (P =0.036), and lower education (P =0.042). Conclusions: Groups within the community identified as priorities for education about safe sleep practices beyond standard care are mothers who are young, have high parity, low educational levels, and have symptoms of depression antenatally. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing maternal depression as a modifiable risk factor in pregnancy. © 2014 Galland et al.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the first or second pregnancy. To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and third trimesters. Objectives: To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive regimens for Plasmodium vivax. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists up to 1 June 2014. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality, severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice, three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment. For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, high quality evidence), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials, 3662 participants, high quality evidence). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, high quality evidence), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (low quality evidence). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (very low quality evidence). For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, moderate quality evidence), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, moderate quality evidence), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials, 2830 participants, high quality evidence). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences. In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, high quality evidence)but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes. In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (defined by authors, but at least < 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, low quality evidence), but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes. In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar. A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against P. vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants). Authors' conclusions: Routine chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in the mother, and on birthweight in infants. © 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - Objectives: We used linked existing data from the 2006-2008 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), the Current Population Survey (CPS, a federal survey that provides on-going U.S. vital statistics, including employment rates) and self-reported body mass index (BMI) to answer: How does BMI vary across full time occupations dichotomized as sedentary/non-sedentary, accounting for time spent in sleep, other sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities?.
Methods: We classified time spent engaged at a primary job (sedentary or non-sedentary), sleep, and other non-work, non-sleep intensity-defined behaviors, specifically, sedentary behavior, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities. Age groups were defined by 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64 years. BMI groups were defined by 18.5-24.9, 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and ≥35.0 kg/m2. Logistic and linear regression were used to examine the association between BMI and employment in a sedentary occupation, considering time spent in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age race/ethnicity, and household income.
Results: The analysis data set comprised 4,092 non-pregnant, non-underweight individuals 20-64 years of age who also reported working more than 7 hours at their primary jobs on their designated time use reporting day. Logistic and linear regression analyses failed to reveal any associations between BMI and the sedentary/non-sedentary occupation dichotomy considering time spent in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income.
Conclusions: We found no evidence of a relationship between self-reported full time sedentary occupation classification and BMI after accounting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income and 24-hours of time use including non-work related physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The various sources of error associated with self-report methods and assignment of generalized activity and occupational intensity categories could compound to obscure any real relationships.

AB  - Melatonin is an indoleamine produced by the pineal gland and secreted in a circadian manner. In the past few decades, research over this topic has been enhanced. Melatonin has many important roles in the human physiology: regulator of the circadian rhythms, sleep inducer, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic. This paper reviews the involvement of melatonin in embryo fetal development. The pineal gland develops completely postpartum, so both the embryo and the fetus are dependent on the maternal melatonin provided transplacentally. Melatonin appears to be involved in the normal outcome of pregnancy beginning with the oocyte quality and finishing with the parturition. Its pregnancy night-time concentrations increase after 24 weeks of gestation, with significantly high levels after 32 weeks. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the embryo and fetus since early stages. There is solid evidence that melatonin is neuroprotective and has a positive effect on the outcome of the compromised pregnancies. In addition, chronodisruption leads to a reproductive dysfunction. Thus, the influence of melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to the entertaining of circadian rhythmicity, but further studies are needed.

AB  - Background Man, since ancient times, has been convinced of, and has researched scientific evidence that the barometric and gravitational forces play an important role in structural and biological variation of the planets, influencing the various forms of life. In particular, the synergistic relationships between variations in atmospheric pressure and gravitational forces on human gestation period have been the subject of rigorous observations and statistical calculations, which have not led to a universal conclusion in literature. Objectives The aim of our work was to check whether there is a higher incidence of spontaneous deliveries, during the periods of full Moon than during the other phases of the Moon. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 327 non-induced vaginal deliveries in a year, divided by month. We subsequently analyzed the incidence of these deliveries during periods of full Moon Vs other lunar phases. Results We evidenced a statistically significant difference between the annual total spontaneous deliveries happened in full Moon periods Vs all other Moon phases (T= 2,3946; p=0,0256). However, we reported a discordant trend of deliveries in full Moon period, depending on each considered month. Conclusion Since these differences were found both in increase and decrease, it is unacceptable the assumption of a linear correlation between periods of full Moon and increased frequency of spontaneous deliveries. For this reason, our data allow us to conclude that there is no need to increase the number of doctors and midwives in obstetric units during these periods. © 2014, Kathmandu University.

AB  - This book is a practical and useful tool for getting your sleep back on track. Even if you have suffered from insomnia for many years, this book contains simple, easy to learn strategies to manage your sleep loss through evidence-based techniques such as cognitive therapy and stimulus control. Dr. Sacre will guide you through these approaches and explain how they work and why they are recommended above other approaches. There is a chapter on special populations that tells you what to do if you are a shift worker, long distance traveller, parent, older adult, woman (including pregnancy and menopause) or an elite athlete. If you want to enjoy natural, healthy and satisfying sleep again, this handbook gives you all the tools you need to achieve it. You only need to have the motivation and discipline to apply the strategies and stick to them over time. This handbook first explains what normal sleep is all about and challenges some myths about sleep and insomnia. Then you will be guided through a thorough sleep assessment. Insomnia is then described in detail including different types of insomnia and the kinds of factors that contribute to sleep loss. Through the following chapters, you will be shown step-by-step what to do to bring about change in your sleeping patterns and habits, through addressing the factors that perpetuate poor sleep. These factors mainly revolve around unhelpful thinking, compensatory behaviors, poor sleep hygiene and environmental influences. These are all things that are within your control and Dr. Sacre will show you how. Dr. Sacre has worked in the fields of sleep health, mental health and addictive disorders for 25 years and over that time, she has encountered hundreds of people who have struggled with insomnia and sleep loss due to other causes. She currently heads the Therapy Programs department at Belmont Private Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, where there is an emphasis on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, including a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-i) program. A psychologist and nurse, Dr. Sacre is a long-time member of the Australasian Sleep Association and the Australian Psychological Society. She has conducted research into the function of dreaming, online sleep surveys and the usefulness of sleep self-help guides for students, older adults and carers of people with dementia. She has also published on diverse topics, including the management of nightmares in war veterans. She is an Adjunct Associate Professor at Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane and lectures professionals, including psychologists, school counselors and psychiatrists, on sleep disorders and their management as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Objective To review national data on HIV and malaria as causes of maternal death and to determine the importance of looking at maternal mortality at a subnational level in Mozambique. Methods Three national data surveys were used to document HIV and malaria as causes of maternal mortality and to assess HIV and malaria prevention services for pregnant women. Data were collected between 2007 and 2011, and included population-level verbal autopsy data and household survey data. Results Verbal autopsy data indicated that 18.2% of maternal deaths were due to HIV and 23.1% were due to malaria. Only 19.6% of recently pregnant women received at least two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment, and only 42.3% of pregnant women were sleeping under an insecticide-treated net. Only 37.5% of recently pregnant women had been counseled, tested, and received an HIV test result. Coverage of prevention services varied substantially by province. Conclusion Triangulation of information on cause of death and coverage of interventions can enable appropriate targeting of maternal health interventions. Such information could also help countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to recognize and take action against malaria and HIV in an effort to decrease maternal mortality. © 2014 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - The circadian clock plays a significant role in many aspects of female reproductive biology, including estrous cycling, ovulation, embryonic implantation, onset of puberty, and parturition. In an effort to link cell-specific circadian clocks to their specific roles in female reproduction, we used the promoter that controls expression of Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF1) to drive Cre-recombinase-mediated deletion of the brain muscle arnt-like 1 (Bmal1) gene, known to encode an essential component of the circadian clock (SF1-Bmal1-/-). The resultant SF1-Bmal1-/-females display embryonic implantation failure, which is rescued by progesterone supplementation, or bilateral or unilateral transplantation of wild-type ovaries into SF1-Bmal1-/-dams. The observation that the central clock, and many other peripheral clocks, are fully functional in thismodel allows the assignment of the implantation phenotype to the clock in ovarian steroidogenic cells and distinguishes it from more general circadian related systemic pathology (e.g., early onset arthropathy, premature aging, ovulation, late onset of puberty, and abnormal estrous cycle). Our ovarian transcriptome analysis reveals that deletion of ovarian Bmal1 disrupts expression of transcripts associated with the circadian machinery and also genes critical for regulation of progesterone production, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory factor (Star). Overall, thesedata provide apowerful model to probe the interlocking and synergistic network of the circadian clock and reproductive systems.

AB  - Background: Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) has persistent high rates in deprived indigenous communities and much of this mortality is attributable to unsafe sleep environments. Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Maori community in New Zealand has reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device. Methods/Design: This two arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from Maori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related) touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal sleep patterns. Discussion: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken worldwide.

AB  - The mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and their intrinsic rhythmicity develop gradually during ontogenesis. In the rat, the SCN forms between embryonic day (E) 14 and E17, with gestation terminating at E21-22. Overt SCN rhythmicity is already present in the late embryonic stage. The aim of the present study was to determine when the fetal SCN clock develops in vivo and whether overt rhythmicity results from a functional fetal clock. To achieve this goal, the prenatal development of rhythmic expression of clock genes was measured with a more sensitive method for detection of the clock gene expression than previously. Fetal SCN were collected at 3 h intervals during the 24 h period on E19 and E21 by laser dissection and expression of clock genes (Per2, Nr1d1 and Bmal1) and genes related to cellular activity (c-fos, Avp and Vip) was measured by qRT PCR. At E19, the expression of canonical clock genes Per2 and Bmal1 was not rhythmic; however, the expression of all other studied genes followed clear circadian rhythms. At E21, Per2 and Bmal1 expression exhibited low amplitude but significant rhythmicity. From E19 to E21, the levels of the non-rhythmic transcripts (Per2 and Bmal1) decreased; however, the levels of the rhythmic transcripts (Nr1d1, c-fos, Avp and Vip) increased. In summary, these data demonstrate that at E19, rhythms in Per2 and Bmal1 expression were absent in the fetal SCN; however, the expression of Nr1d1 and other genes related to cellular activity was driven rhythmically. Therefore, at the early stage in vivo, the developing fetal SCN clock could theoretically be entrained by oscillation of Nr1d1 which may be driven by the maternal rather than fetal circadian system. © 2014 Houdek, Sumová.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, resulting in a pressing need to identify risk factors leading to effective interventions. Limited evidence suggests potential relationships between maternal sleep or vital exhaustion and preterm birth, yet the literature is generally inconclusive.Methods: We examined the relationship between maternal sleep duration and vital exhaustion in the first six months of pregnancy and spontaneous (non-medically indicated) preterm birth among 479 Peruvian women who delivered a preterm singleton infant (&lt;37 weeks gestation) and 480 term controls who delivered a singleton infant at term (≥37 weeks gestation). Maternal nightly sleep and reports of vital exhaustion were ascertained through in-person interviews. Spontaneous preterm birth cases were further categorized as those following either spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. In addition, cases were categorized as very (&lt;32 weeks), moderate (32-33 weeks), and late (34- &lt;37 weeks) preterm birth for additional analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: After adjusting for confounders, we found that short sleep duration (≤6 hours) was significantly associated with preterm birth (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.19) compared to 7-8 hours of sleep. Vital exhaustion was also associated with increased odds of preterm birth (aOR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.79-3.23) compared to no exhaustion (Ptrend &lt;0.001). These associations remained significant for spontaneous preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. We also found evidence of joint effects of sleep duration and vital exhaustion on the odds of spontaneous preterm birth.Conclusions: The results of this case-control study suggest maternal sleep duration, particularly short sleep duration, and vital exhaustion may be risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. These findings call for increased clinical attention to maternal sleep and the study of potential intervention strategies to improve sleep in early pregnancy with the aim of decreasing risk of preterm birth. © 2014 Kajeepeta et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - It is commonly believed that a good night's sleep is paramount to good health. Nevertheless, in modern society we spend less time sleeping. No less important, the quality of our sleep is interrupted by environmental factors such as noise and light pollution. Here, we focus on the functional outcomes of a major form of sleep disruption, sleep fragmentation. The fragmentation of sleep frequently accompanies various physiological conditions such as sleep apnea, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pregnancy, and aging. We will address the impact of sleep fragmentation on cognitive functions and memory consolidation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intrauterine infection or inflammation in preterm neonates is a known risk for adverse neurological outcomes, including cognitive, motor and behavioral disabilities. Our previous data suggest that there is acute fetal brain inflammation in a mouse model of intrauterine exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We hypothesized that the in utero inflammation induced by LPS produces long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the exposed mice that could be determined by using continuous quantitative video/EEG/electromyogram (EMG) analyses. A single LPS injection at E17 was performed in pregnant CD1 dams. Control dams were injected with same volumes of saline (LPS n= 10, Control n= 8). At postnatal age of P90-100, 24-h synchronous video/EEG/EMG recordings were done using a tethered recording system and implanted subdural electrodes. Behavioral state scoring was performed blind to treatment group, on each 10. s EEG epoch using synchronous video, EMG and EEG trace signatures to generate individual hypnograms. Automated EEG power spectrums were analyzed for delta and theta-beta power ratios during wake vs. sleep cycles. Both control and LPS hypnograms showed an ultradian wake/sleep cycling. Since rodents are nocturnal animals, control mice showed the expected diurnal variation with significantly longer time spent in wake states during the dark cycle phase. In contrast, the LPS-treated mice lost this circadian rhythm. Sleep microstructure also showed significant alteration in the LPS mice specifically during the dark cycle, caused by significantly longer average non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycle durations. No significance was found between treatment groups for the delta power data; however, significant activity-dependent changes in theta-beta power ratios seen in controls were absent in the LPS-exposed mice. In conclusion, exposure to in utero inflammation in CD1 mice resulted in significantly altered sleep architecture as adults that were circadian cycle and activity state dependent. © 2014 IBRO.

AB  - Study Objectives: To determine whether sleep disturbances are found in the valproic acid model of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Design: Comparative study for sleep behavior, sleep architecture, electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67 protein expression in juvenile rats exposed to valproic acid (VPA), sodium salt, or saline in utero. Setting: N/A. Participants: Juvenile (postnatal day 32) male and female Sprague- Dawley rats. Interventions: In utero exposure to either saline or 400 mg/kg VPA administered intraperitoneally to the dams on gestational day 12.5. On postnatal days 22-24, all rats were implanted with transmitters to record EEG and electromyogram (EMG) activity. Measurements and Results: During the light phase, when nocturnal animals are typically quiescent, the VPA-exposed animals spent significantly more time in wake (∼35 min) and significantly less time in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (∼26 min) compared to the saline controls. Furthermore, spectral analysis of the EEG reveled that VPA-exposed animals exhibited increased high-frequency activity during wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced theta power across all vigilance states. Interestingly, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system, which modulates the induction and maintenance of sleep states, was also disrupted, with reduced levels of both GAD 65 and GAD67 in the cortical tissue of VPA-exposed animals compared to saline controls. Conclusions: To date, the current animal models of ASD have been underutilized in the investigation of associated sleep disturbances. The VPA animal model recapitulates aspects of sleep disruptions reported clinically, providing a tool to investigate cellular and molecular dysregulation contributing to sleep disruptions in ASD.

AB  - Context: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move legs that usually occur during inactivity and at night. This neurologic condition is associated with increased risk of nocturnal hypertension as well as cardiovascular events and affects patient’s sleep, which leads to anxiety, depression, and decreases quality of life. Presence of RLS in patients on hemodialysis is associated with higher mortality rate. Most of the times, patients have indescribable symptoms. The aim of this review was to provide physicians with information to be aware and turn their attention to the patient’s symptoms, which are the most important clue to diagnosis of RLS.
Evidence Acquisition: For data extraction, we reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, the Cochrane collaboration, and Up to Date databases with the keywords of restless legs syndrome, sleep disorders, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The most recent review articles, clinical trials, and cross-sectional studies with large sample sizes that had used International RLS Study Group criteria (IRLSSG) and had focused on demographic characteristics and renal function were included. This situation has described in primary and secondary forms. The former usually occurs in younger patients and seems to have genetic tendencies and the latter is due to the iron deficiency state, pregnancy, and ESRD.
Results: Two major theories are developed regarding the pathophysiology of RLS. The first one concerns central nervous system dopamine imbalance and the second one concerns intracellular iron dysregulation. The most common used pharmacologic agents in treatment of RLS are dopamine agonists. Other used therapeutic agents include levodopa, Alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands, opioids, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, clonidine, iron therapy in low levels of serum ferritin, and nonpharmacologic therapies.
Conclusions: The most important factor in diagnosis is physician’s attention and clinical experience with this condition and using IRLSSG. © 2014, Nephrology and Urology Research Center. Published by Kowsar Corp.

AB  - The Preparing for a Lifetime, It's Everyone's Responsibility initiative was developed to improve the health and well- being of Oklahoma's mothers and infants. The development phase included systematic data collection, extensive data analysis, and multi-disciplinary partnership development. In total, seven issues (preconception/interconception health, tobacco use, postpartum depression, breastfeeding, infant safe sleep, preterm birth, and infant injury prevention) were identified as crucial to addressing infant mortality in Oklahoma. Workgroups were created to focus on each issue. Data and media communications workgroups were added to further partner commitment and support for policy and programmatic changes across multiple agencies and programs. Leadership support, partnership, evaluation, and celebrating small successes were important factors that lead to large scale adoption and support for the state-wide initiative to reduce infant mortality.

AB  - Perinatal exposure to infection is highly associated with adverse outcomes. Experimentally, acute, severe exposure to gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with increased fetal heart rate variability (FHRV). It is unknown whether FHRV is affected by subclinical infection with or without acute exacerbations. We therefore tested the hypothesis that FHRV would be associated with hypotension after acute on chronic exposure to LPS. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation were exposed to a continuous low-dose LPS infusion (n = 12, 100 ng/kg over 24 h, followed by 250 ng·kg-1·24 h-1 for a further 96 h) or the same volume of saline (n = 10). Boluses of either 1 μg LPS or saline were given at 48, 72, and 96 h. Low-dose infusion was not associated with hemodynamic or FHRV changes. The first LPS bolus was associated with tachycardia and suppression of nuchal electromyographic activity in all fetuses. Seven of twelve fetuses developed hypotension (a fall in mean arterial blood pressure ≥5 mmHg). FHRV was transiently increased only at the onset of hypotension, in association with increased cytokine induction and electroencephalogram suppression. FHRV then fell before the nadir of hypotension, with transient suppression of short-term FHRV. After the second LPS bolus, the hypotension group showed a biphasic pattern of a transient increase in FHRV followed by more prolonged suppression. These findings suggest that infection-related hypotension in the preterm fetus mediates the transient increase in FHRV and that repeated exposure to LPS leads to progressive loss of FHRV. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: Assessment of quality of life after childbirth is an important health-outcome measurement for new mothers and is of special interest in midwifery. The Mother-Generated Index (MGI) is a validated instrument to assess postnatal quality of life. The tool has not been applied for making a cross-cultural comparison before. This study investigated (a) responses to the MGI in German-speaking women in Germany and Switzerland; and (b) associations between MGI scores on the one hand and maternity and midwifery care on the other.Methods: A two-stage survey was conducted in two rural hospitals 10 km apart, on opposite sides of the German-Swiss border. The questionnaires included the MGI and questions on socio-demographics, physical and mental health and maternity care, and were distributed during the first days after birth and six weeks postpartum. Parametric and non-parametric tests were computed with the statistical programme SPSS.Results: A total of 129 questionnaires were returned an average of three days after birth and 83 in the follow-up after seven weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in the MGI scores between the German and the Swiss women (p = 0.22). Significantly more favourable MGI scores were found associated with more adequate information during pregnancy (p = 0.02), a more satisfactory birth experience (p < 0.01), epidural anaesthesia (p < 0.01), more information (p = 0.01) and better support (p = 0.02) during the time in hospital and less disturbed sleep (p < 0.01). Significantly lower MGI scores were associated with the presence of a private doctor during birth (p = 0.01) and with exclusive breastfeeding during the first postnatal days (p = 0.04).Conclusion: The MGI scores of these German-speaking women were higher than those in other studies reported previously. Thus the tool may be able to detect differences in postnatal quality of life among women with substantially divergent cultural backgrounds. Shortcomings in maternity and midwifery care were detected, as for example the inadequate provision of information during pregnancy, a lack of individualised postpartum care during the hospital stay and insufficient support for exclusively breastfeeding mothers. The MGI is an appropriate instrument for maternity care outcome measurement in cross-cultural comparison research. © 2014 Grylka-Baeschlin et al.

AB  - Background: The increased prevalence of malocclusions represents a secular trend attributed to the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The analysis of factors related to the causes of these changes is essential for planning public health policies aimed at preventing and clinically intercepting malocclusion. This study investigated the sucking habits, nocturnal mouth breathing, as well as the relation of these factors with malocclusion. Methods: This is a longitudinal study in which 80 mother-child pairs were monitored from the beginning of pregnancy to the 30th month after childbirth. Home visits for interviews with the mothers were made on the 12th, 18th and 30th months of age. Finger sucking, pacifier sucking, bottle feeding, breastfeeding and nocturnal mouth breathing, were the variables studies. On the 30th month, clinical examinations were performed for overjet, overbite and posterior crossbite. A previously calibrated single examiner (Kappa coefficient = 0.92) was responsible for all examinations. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests, at a significance level of 5%. Results: Bottle feeding was the most prevalent habit at 12, 18 and 30 months (87.5%; 90% and 96.25%, respectively). Breastfeeding was 40%, 25% and 12.50% at 12, 18 and 30 months, respectively. Nearly 70% of the children in this study had some sort of malocclusion. Pacifier sucking habit at 12, 18 and 30 months of age was associated with overjet and open bite; and at 30 months, an association with overbite was also observed. Finger sucking habit and breastfeeding at 12, 18 and 30 months were also associated with overjet and open bite. The posterior crossbite was associated with bottle feeding at 12 and 30 months, and nocturnal mouth breathers at 12 and 18 months. Conclusions: Sucking habits, low rates of breastfeeding, and nocturnal mouth breathing were risk factors for malocclusion. © 2014 Moimaz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Pregnancy is anecdotally equated with sleep disturbance, most commonly resulting in sleep deprivation, with the possible exception of the first trimester when hypersomnia may be present. The relationship between sleep and pregnancy is likely bidirectional. The dynamic hormonal and physiological changes of pregnancy affect a large variety of sleep parameters, ranging from homeostatic sleep drive to sleep latency, maintenance, duration, fragmentation, and perceived quality to sleep stages. Conversely, sleep disturbance, in any form, including decreased total sleep duration versus increased number of awakenings with or without respiratory disturbance, may affect pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertensive disease, labor type and duration, prematurity, and gestational weight. We will review the various aspects of sleep disturbance during pregnancy and the existing evidence that sleep deprivation and disturbance affect pregnancy outcomes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Accumulating evidence from both human and preclinical studies indicates maternal substance use during pregnancy can affect fetal development, birth weight and infant outcomes. Thus, the prenatal period can be regarded as an important and potentially sensitive period of development. In this manuscript, an updated overview of studies on prenatal cannabis exposure in humans is presented, including recent studies conducted within the Generation R study. Findings on fetal growth, birth outcomes, early neonatal behavior and infant behavior and cognitive development are discussed in detail. Preclinical evidence and potential mechanisms are described as well, and recommendations for future studies are provided. It is concluded that evidence seems to suggest that fetal development is affected by prenatal maternal cannabis use, while findings on effects on infant behavior or cognition are inconsistent. Beyond infancy, subtle differences may be found in specific cognitive or behavioral outcomes, although replication studies in which pregnant women and their fetuses are exposed to current and probably higher levels of δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and novel designs are needed to come to firm conclusions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) leads to considerable physical and psychological morbidity. The highest prevalence reported was found in Caucasian Americans (range 23% -67%) and the lowest in Singaporean females (4.8%). The study assessed the prevalence, perceptions, predisposing factors and health seeking behaviour of women with SUI in an Asian setting which may have different sociocultural implications.Methods: 400 consecutive women >20 years of age attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka, for non-urinary conditions were studied over a 3 week period using an interviewer administered questionnaire. SUI was diagnosed on clinical history alone when leakage of urine occurred either with coughing, sneezing, walking or lifting heavy objects. The severity was graded using the Finnish Gynaecological Society's Urinary Incontinence Severity Score (UISS). Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. Odds ratios were calculated using univariate and multivariate analysis.Results: Ninety three (23.33%) had SUI and only 12 (12.9%) had sought treatment. The prevalence among women >50 years of age was 34.71% (n = 121) compared to 18.28% (n = 279) in those ≤50 years. 25 (26.88%) had mild SUI, 66 (70.97%) moderate and 2 (2.15%) severe as per UISS. SUI was perceived as an illness by 210 (52.5%). SUI was significantly associated with pregnancy, parity, vaginal delivery, complicated labour, diabetes mellitus, chronic cough, constipation and faecal incontinence (p < 0.05).Among those affected main reasons for not seeking medical advice included; being embarrassed (n = 27, 33.33%), not knowing that it is remediable (n = 23, 28.40%), perceiving SUI to be a normal consequence of childbirth (n = 19, 23.46%) and having to attend to needs of the family (n = 12, 14.81%). None who had been pregnant (n = 313) had received advice on postnatal pelvic floor exercises. SUI interfered with social activities (71;76.34%), sexual function (21; 22.58%) and resulted in despair (67; 72.09%). It was associated with clinically diagnosed candidiasis (50; 53.76%) and soreness in the perineal region (49; 52.69%).Conclusions: SUI is a common and neglected gynaecological problem with poor healthcare seeking behaviour. Community based education may help to minimize the occurrence and improve the quality of life of those affected. © 2014 Perera et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Previous attempts have been made to address sleep disorders in women; however, significant knowledge gaps in research and a lack of awareness among the research community continue to exist. There is a great need for scientists and clinicians to consider sex and gender differences in their sleep research to account for the unique biology of women. To understand the role of sex differences in sleep and the state of women's sleep health research, the Society for Women's Health Research convened an interdisciplinary expert panel of well-established sleep researchers and clinicians for a roundtable meeting. Focused discussions on basic and clinical research along with a focus on specific challenges facing women with sleep-related problems and effective therapies led to the identification of knowledge gaps and the development of research-related recommendations. Additionally, sex differences in sleep disorders were noted and discussed in the context of underlying hormonal differences. Differences in sleep behavior and sleep disorders may not only be driven by biological factors but also by gender differences in the way women and men report symptoms. Progress has been made in identifying sex and gender differences in many areas of sleep, but major research gaps in the areas of epidemiology, sleep regulation, sleep quality, diagnosis, and treatment need to be addressed. Identifying the underlying nature of sex and gender differences in sleep research has potential to accelerate improved care for both men and women facilitating better diagnosis, treatment, and ultimately prevention of sleep disorders and related comorbid conditions. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background: Aortic intima-media thickness measured by transabdominal ultrasound (aIMT) is an intermediate phenotype of cardiovascular risk. We aimed to (1) investigate the reproducibility of aIMT in a population-derived cohort of infants; (2) establish the distribution of aIMT in early infancy; (3) compare measurement by edge-detection software to that by manual sonographic calipers; and (4) assess the effect of individual and environmental variables on image quality. Methods. Participants were term infants recruited to a population-derived birth cohort study. Transabdominal ultrasound was performed at six weeks of age by one of two trained operators. Thirty participants had ultrasounds performed by both operators on the same day. Data were collected on environmental (infant sleeping, presence of a sibling, use of sucrose, timing during study visit) and individual (post-conception age, weight, gender) variables. Two readers assessed image quality and measured aIMT by edge-detection software and a subset by manual sonographic calipers. Measurements were repeated by the same reader and between readers to obtain intra-observer and inter-observer reliability. Results: Aortic IMT was measured successfully using edge-detection in 814 infants, and 290 of these infants also had aIMT measured using manual sonographic calipers. The intra-reader intra-class correlation (ICC) (n = 20) was 0.90 (95% CI 0.76, 0.96), mean difference 1.5 μm (95% LOA -39, 59). The between reader ICC using edge-detection (n = 20) was 0.92 (95% CI 0.82, 0.97) mean difference 2 μm (95% LOA -45.0, 49.0) and with manual caliper measurement (n = 290) the ICC was 0.84 (95% CI 0.80, 0.87) mean difference 5 μm (95% LOA -51.8, 61.8). Edge-detection measurements were greater than those from manual sonographic calipers (mean aIMT 618 μm (50) versus mean aIMT 563 μm (49) respectively; p < 0.001, mean difference 44 μm, 95% LOA -54, 142). With the exception of infant crying (p = 0.001), no associations were observed between individual and environmental variables and image quality. Conclusion: In a population-derived cohort of term infants, aIMT measurement has a high level of intra and inter-reader reproducibility. Measurement of aIMT using edge-detection software gives higher inter-reader ICC than manual sonographic calipers. Image quality is not substantially affected by individual and environmental factors. © 2014 McCloskey et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Pregnant women, both before and after childbirth, frequently experience memory deficits and disrupted sleep. In the present study we assessed the relationship between false memory generation and fragmented sleep during pregnancy and motherhood. We tested 178 pregnant women and 58 female non-pregnant childless controls, during pregnancy (15-35th week of gestation) and again after childbirth (8-13th month). False memories were defined as memories of gist words that were semantically related to studied word lists but were not presented during learning of these lists in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy in the home environment for seven consecutive nights. Compared to the controls, the group of pregnant women produced more false memories and displayed more fragmented sleep both during pregnancy and after childbirth. However, false memory generation was not correlated to measures of sleep fragmentation. These results show that pregnant women suffer from sleep fragmentation and a higher susceptibility to false memories, but leave open the question as to whether both phenomena are related. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The United Kingdom has one of the highest rates of stillbirth in Europe, resulting in approximately 4,000 stillbirths every year. Potentially modifiable risk factors for late stillbirths are maternal age, obesity and smoking, but the population attributable risk associated with these risk factors is small.Recently the Auckland Stillbirth Study reported that maternal sleep position was associated with late stillbirth. Women who did not sleep on their left side on the night before the death of the baby had double the risk compared with sleeping on other positions. The population attributable risk was 37%. This novel observation needs to be replicated or refuted.Methods/Design: Case control study of late singleton stillbirths without congenital abnormality. Controls are women with an ongoing singleton pregnancy, who are randomly selected from participating maternity units booking list of pregnant women, they are allocated a gestation for interview based on the distribution of gestations of stillbirths from the previous 4 years for the unit. The number of controls selected is proportional to the number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital over the previous 4 years.Data collection: Interviewer administered questionnaire and data extracted from medical records. Sample size: 415 cases and 830 controls. This takes into account a 30% non-participation rate, and will detect an OR of 1.5 with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% for variables with a prevalence of 57%, such as non-left sleeping position.Statistical analysis: Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and unconditional logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders.Discussion: The hypotheses to be tested here are important, biologically plausible and amenable to a public health intervention. Although this case-control study cannot prove causation, there is a striking parallel with research relating to sudden infant death syndrome, where case-control studies identified prone sleeping position as a major modifiable risk factor. Subsequently mothers were advised to sleep babies prone (" Back to Sleep" campaign), which resulted in a dramatic drop in SIDS. This study will provide robust evidence to help determine whether such a public health intervention should be considered.Trial registration number: NCT02025530. © 2014 Platts et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Early life programming has important consequences for future health and wellbeing. A key new aspect is the impact of perinatal light on the circadian system. Postnatal light environment will program circadian behavior, together with cell morphology and clock gene function within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the principal circadian clock in mammals. Nevertheless, it is still not clear whether the observed changes reflect a processing of an altered photic input from the retina, rather than an imprinting of the intrinsic molecular clock mechanisms. Here, we addressed the issue by systematically probing the mouse circadian system at various levels. Firstly, we used electroretinography, pupillometry and histology protocols to show that gross retinal function and morphology in the adult are largely independent of postnatal light experiences that modulate circadian photosensitivity. Secondly, we used circadian activity protocols to show that only the animal's behavioral responses to chronic light exposure, but not to constant darkness or the acute responses to a light stimulus depend on postnatal light experience. Thirdly, we used real-time PER2::LUC rhythm recording to show long-term changes in clock gene expression in the SCN, but also heart, lung and spleen. The data showed that perinatal light mainly targets the long-term adaptive responses of the circadian clock to environmental light, rather than the retina or intrinsic clock mechanisms. Finally, we found long-term effects on circadian peripheral clocks, suggesting far-reaching consequences for the animal's overall physiology. © 2014 Brooks et al.

AB  - Background: Access to insecticide-treated bed nets has increased substantially in recent years, but ownership and use remain well below 100% in many malaria endemic areas. Understanding decision-making around net allocation in households with too few nets is essential to ensuring protection of the most vulnerable. This study explores household net allocation preferences and practices across four districts in Uganda. Methods. Data collection consisted of eight focus group discussions, twelve in-depth interviews, and a structured questionnaire to inventory 107 sleeping spaces in 28 households. Results: In focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, participants almost unanimously stated that pregnant women, infants, and young children should be prioritized when allocating nets. However, sleeping space surveys reveal that heads of household sometimes receive priority over children less than five years of age when households have too few nets to cover all members. Conclusions: When asked directly, most net owners highlight the importance of allocating nets to the most biologically vulnerable household members. This is consistent with malaria behaviour change and health education messages. In actual allocation, however, factors other than biological vulnerability may influence who does and does not receive a net. © 2014 Lam et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this review was to summarize evidence for the effectiveness of music therapy (MT) and to assess the quality of systematic reviews (SRs) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Study design: An SR of SRs based on RCTs. Methods: Studies were eligible if they were RCTs. Studies included were those with at least one treatment group in which MT was applied. We searched the following databases from 1995 to October 1, 2012: MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, Global Health Library, and Ichushi-Web. We also searched all Cochrane Database and Campbell Systematic Reviews up to October 1, 2012. Based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, we identified a disease targeted for each article. Results: Twenty-one studies met all inclusion criteria. This study included 16 Cochrane reviews. As a whole, the quality of the articles was very good. Eight studies were about "Mental and behavioural disorders (F00-99)"; there were two studies on "Diseases of the nervous system (G00-99)" and "Diseases of the respiratory system (J00-99)"; and there was one study each for "Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-90)", "Diseases of the circulatory system (I00-99)", and "Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O60)". MT treatment improved the following: global and social functioning in schizophrenia and/or serious mental disorders, gait and related activities in Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. Conclusion: This comprehensive summary of SRs demonstrated that MT treatment improved the following: global and social functioning in schizophrenia and/or serious mental disorders, gait and related activities in Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. MT may have the potential for improving other diseases, but there is not enough evidence at present. Most importantly, no specific adverse effect or harmful phenomenon occurred in any of the studies, and MT was well tolerated by almost all patients. © 2014 Kamioka et al.

AB  - The Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) measures the rates at which Americans are victims of crimes, including rape and sexual assault, but there is concern that rape and sexual assault are undercounted on this survey. BJS asked the National Research Council to investigate this issue and recommend best practices for measuring rape and sexual assault on their household surveys. Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault concludes that it is likely that the NCVS is undercounting rape and sexual assault. The most accurate counts of rape and sexual assault cannot be achieved without measuring them separately from other victimizations, the report says. It recommends that BJS develop a separate survey for measuring rape and sexual assault. The new survey should more precisely define ambiguous words such as "rape," give more privacy to respondents, and take other steps that would improve the accuracy of responses. Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault takes a fresh look at the problem of measuring incidents of rape and sexual assault from the criminal justice perspective. This report examines issues such as the legal definitions in use by the states for these crimes, best methods for representing the definitions in survey instruments so that their meaning is clear to respondents, and best methods for obtaining as complete reporting as possible of these crimes in surveys, including methods whereby respondents may report anonymously. Rape and sexual assault are among the most injurious crimes a person can inflict on another. The effects are devastating, extending beyond the initial victimization to consequences such as unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, sleep and eating disorders, and other emotional and physical problems. Understanding the frequency and context under which rape and sexual assault are committed is vital in directing resources for law enforcement and support for victims. These data can influence public health and mental health policies and help identify interventions that will reduce the risk of future attacks. Sadly, accurate information about the extent of sexual assault and rape is difficult to obtain because most of these crimes go unreported to police. Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault focuses on methodology and vehicles used to measure rape and sexual assaults, reviews potential sources of error within the NCVS survey, and assesses the training and monitoring of interviewers in an effort to improve reporting of these crimes. © 2014 by the National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Introduction. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia Type 2 (PCH2) is a rare autosomal recessive condition, defined on MRI by a small cerebellum and ventral pons. Clinical features are severe developmental delay, microcephaly and dyskinesia.Ninety percent carry a p.A307S mutation in the TSEN54-gene. Our aim was to describe the natural course including neurological and developmental features and other aspects of care in a homogeneous group of PCH2 patients all carrying the p.A307S mutation. Patients and methods. Patients were recruited via the German patients' organizations. Inclusion criteria were imaging findings of PCH2 and a p.A307S mutation. Data were collected using medical reports and patient questionnaires discussed in a standardized telephone interview. Results: Thirty-three patients were included. When considering survival until age 11 years, 53% of children had died Weight, length and head circumference, mostly in the normal range at birth, became abnormal, especially head circumference (-5.58 SD at age 5 yrs). Neurologic symptoms: Choreathetosis was present in 88% (62% with pyramidal signs), 12% had pure spasticity. Epileptic seizures were manifest in 82%, status epilepticus in 39%. Non-epileptic dystonic attacks occurred in 33%. General symptoms: feeding difficulties were recorded in 100%, sleep disorder in 96%, apneas in 67% and recurrent infections in 52%; gastroesophageal reflux disease was diagnosed in 73%, 67% got percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and 36% a Nissen-fundoplication. Neurodevelopmental data: All children made progress, but on a low level: such as fixing and following with the eyes was seen in 76%, attempting to grasp objects (76%), moderate head control (73%), social smile (70%), rolling from prone to supine (58%), and sitting without support (9%). Ten percent lost achieved abilities on follow-up. The presence of prenatal symptoms did not correlate with outcome. Conclusion: Phenotype of this genetically homogeneous group of PCH2 children was severe with reduced survival, but compatible with some developmental progress. Our data support the hypothesis of an early onset degeneration which thereafter stabilizes. © 2014 Sánchez-Albisua et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Study Objectives: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. Design: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. Setting: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009. Patients or Participants: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5-10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4-11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group.

AB  - Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is a serious public health issue which threatens maternal and foetal health outcomes. The aim of the study was to explore prevalence of domestic violence among pregnant women in southern Sweden (Scania) and to explore associations with background factors, as symptoms of depression and sense of coherence.Methods: This study has a cross-sectional design and is the first part of a longitudinal, cohort study. Inclusion criteria were women ≥ 18 years, registered at antenatal care when pregnant and who understand and write Swedish or English. Questionnaires were collected prospectively at seventeen antenatal care receptions situated in the two cities and six smaller municipalities in Scania. Statistical analyses were done using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, bivariate logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Study sample included 1939 women. History of violence was reported by 39.5% (n =761) women. Significant differences were obtained between the groups with or without history of violence regarding being single/living apart, unemployment, financial distress, smoking/snuffing, unintended pregnancy as well as history of miscarriage/legalised abortion (p < 0.001). Experience of domestic violence during pregnancy regardless of type or level of abuse was 1.0% (n = 18); history of physical abuse by actual intimate partner was 2.2% (n = 42). History of violence was the strongest risk factor associated with domestic violence during pregnancy, where all women (n = 18) exposed reported history of violence (p < 0.001). Several symptoms of depression (adjusted for low socio-economic status, miscarriage/abortion, single/living apart, lack of sleep, unemployment, age and parity) were associated with a 7.0 fold risk of domestic violence during pregnancy (OR 7.0; 95% CI: 1.9-26.3).Conclusions: The reported prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy in southwest Sweden is low. However, a considerable proportion of women reported history of living in a violent relationship. Both history of violence and the presence of several depressive symptoms detected in early pregnancy may indicate that the woman also is exposed to domestic violence during pregnancy. Increased attention to this vulnerable group of women is needed to improve maternal and child health. © 2014 Finnbogadóttir et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - While the use of creatine in human pregnancy is yet to be fully evaluated, its long-term use in healthy adults appears to be safe, and its well documented neuroprotective properties have recently been extended by demonstrations that creatine improves cognitive function in normal and elderly people, and motor skills in sleep-deprived subjects. Creatine has many actions likely to benefit the fetus and newborn, because pregnancy is a state of heightened metabolic activity, and the placenta is a key source of free radicals of oxygen and nitrogen. The multiple benefits of supplementary creatine arise from the fact that the creatine-phosphocreatine [PCr] system has physiologically important roles that include maintenance of intracellular ATP and acid-base balance, post-ischaemic recovery of protein synthesis, cerebral vasodilation, antioxidant actions, and stabilisation of lipid membranes. In the brain, creatine not only reduces lipid peroxidation and improves cerebral perfusion, its interaction with the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor is likely to counteract the effects of glutamate excitotoxicity - actions that may protect the preterm and term fetal brain from the effects of birth hypoxia. In this review we discuss the development of creatine synthesis during fetal life, the transfer of creatine from mother to fetus, and propose that creatine supplementation during pregnancy may have benefits for the fetus and neonate whenever oxidative stress or feto-placental hypoxia arise, as in cases of fetal growth restriction, premature birth, or when parturition is delayed or complicated by oxygen deprivation of the newborn. © 2014 Dickinson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Introduction Poor sleep quality in pregnancy is frequent. A treatment with sedatives is problematic due to possible adverse effects for mother and embryo/foetus. In the present study, we investigated the sedative effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum, a phytotherapeutic medication used in anthroposophic medicine. In previous clinical studies on its tocolytic effect, B. pinnatum showed a good risk/benefit ratio for mother and child. A recent analysis of the prescribing pattern for B. pinnatum in a network of anthroposophic physicians revealed sleep disorders as one of the most frequent diagnoses for which these preparations are prescribed. Materials and methods In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women suffering from sleep problems were treated with B. pinnatum (350 mg tablets, 50% leaf press juice, Weleda AG, Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration). Sleep quality, daily sleepiness and fatigue were assessed with the aid of standardised questionnaires, at the beginning of the treatment and after 2 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. Results The number of wake-ups, as well as the subjective quality of sleep was significantly improved at the end of the treatment with B. pinnatum. The Epworth Sleeping Scale decreased, indicating a decrease of the tiredness during the day. There was, however, no evidence for prolongation of the sleep duration, reduction in the time to fall asleep, as well as change in the Fatigue Severity Scale after B. pinnatum. No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion B. pinnatum is a suitable treatment of sleep problems in pregnancy. The data of this study encourage further clinical investigations on the use of B. pinnatum in sleep disorders. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Background: Insomnia and depression are strongly interrelated. This study aimed to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17 and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from 2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Results: After delivery, sleep duration was reduced by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to 75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression, primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression had residual insomnia. Limitations: Depression and insomnia were not verified by clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in the study. Conclusions: Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous depression. © 2014 Dorheim et al.

AB  - Background: The triple risk model for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been useful in understanding its pathogenesis. Risk factors for late stillbirth are well established, especially relating to maternal and fetal wellbeing. Discussion: We propose a similar triple risk model for unexplained late stillbirth. The model proposed by us results from the interplay of three groups of factors: (1) maternal factors (such as maternal age, obesity, smoking), (2) fetal and placental factors (such as intrauterine growth retardation, placental insufficiency), and (3) a stressor (such as venocaval compression from maternal supine sleep position, sleep disordered breathing). We argue that the risk factors within each group in themselves may be insufficient to cause the death, but when they interrelate may produce a lethal combination.Summary: Unexplained late stillbirth occurs when a fetus who is somehow vulnerable dies as a result of encountering a stressor and/or maternal condition in a combination which is lethal for them. © 2014 Warland and Mitchell; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - According to the heat dissipation limit theory, maximum metabolic turnover is limited by the capacity of the body to dissipate excess heat. Small mammals, including common voles (Microtus arvalis), face a heat dissipation limitation during lactation. Pup growth and milk production are reduced under higher ambient temperatures. Heat dissipation problems might in part be alleviated by modifying behavior, such as reducing nest attendance and being active at energetically optimal times of day. According to the circadian thermo-energetics hypothesis, animals can make use of daily ambient temperature fluctuations to alter their energetic expenditure. In this study we test whether heat challenged (housing at 30. °C compared to 21. °C) lactating common voles allocate their time differently among behaviors and whether their ultradian and circadian behavioral rhythmicity are altered.Behavior was scored every 13. min from automated picture recordings, while general locomotor activity was measured by passive infrared detectors to assess ultradian and circadian organization. The effects of ambient temperature on the ultradian organization of behavior were assessed by determining the ultradian period length and the distribution of activity within the ultradian bout. Changes in circadian organization were assessed by the distribution of activity over the light and dark phase. As a complementary measure nest temperature recordings were used to quantify nest attendance distribution between day and night.Lactating dams at 30. °C reduced the fraction of time spent on the nest while increasing the fraction of time resting without pups away from the nest. The ultradian period of locomotor activity was longer in voles housed at 30. °C during pregnancy and lactation, but not after weaning when the pups were removed. No differences in the distribution of activity within the ultradian bout could be detected. The circadian organization was also modulated by ambient temperature. Lactating voles housed at 30. °C became more day active and a loss of day-night differences in nest temperature suggests a shift of nest attendance towards the night.Reducing the time attending the nest can reduce the risk of hyperthermia, and may be the behavioral component resulting in lower milk production and hence reproductive output. Becoming more day active allows feeding and nursing of the pups during the rest phase to occur during the night at which lower ambient temperatures are expected in the field. In natural situations this strategy will increase heat dissipation and lactation capacity. Whether there are similar benefits associated with a longer ultradian period is currently unknown, but these are likely to result from decreased energy turnover at 30. °C. In conclusion, our study shows that lactating common voles facing heat dissipation problems re-organize their behavior in a way that can maximize heat dissipation capabilities and thereby optimize lactation capacity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non-conventional agents. Objectives: 1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 30 September 2012), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials allocating participants with major depression to paroxetine versus any other antidepressants (ADs), both conventional (such as TCAs, SSRIs) and newer or non-conventional (such as hypericum). For trials which had a cross-over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double-entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures. Main results: A total of 115 randomised controlled trials (26,134 participants) were included. In 54 studies paroxetine was compared with older ADs, in 21 studies with another SSRI, and in 40 studies with a newer or non-conventional antidepressant other than SSRIs. For the primary outcome (patients who responded to treatment), paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine at increasing patients who responded early to treatment (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.87, number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTb) = 16, 95% CI 10 to 50, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 1375 participants, moderate quality of evidence), and less effective than mirtazapine (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.02, NNTb = 8, 95% CI 5 to 14, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 726 participants, moderate quality of evidence). Paroxetine was less effective than citalopram in improving response to treatment (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28, NNTb = 9, 95% CI 5 to 102, at six to 12 weeks, 1 RCT, 406 participants, moderate quality of evidence). We found no clear evidence that paroxetine was more or less effective compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at acute (six to 12 weeks), early (one to four weeks), or longer term follow-up (four to six months). Paroxetine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, but was less well tolerated than agomelatine and hypericum. Included studies were generally at unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Some possibly clinically meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings. In terms of response, there was a moderate quality of evidence that citalopram was better than paroxetine in the acute phase (six to 12 weeks), although only one study contributed data. In terms of early response to treatment (one to four weeks) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine. However there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point. Even if some differences were identified, the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Finally, most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias, and were sponsored by the drug industry. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. © 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - H-K-ATPase type 2 (HKA2), also known as the "nongastric" or "colonic" H-K-ATPase, is broadly expressed, and its presence in the kidney has puzzled experts in the field of renal ion transport systems for many years. One of the most important and robust characteristics of this transporter is that it is strongly stimulated after dietary K+ restriction. This result prompted many investigators to propose that it should play a role in allowing the kidney to efficiently retain K+ under K+ depletion. However, the apparent absence of a clear renal phenotype in HKA2-null mice has led to the idea that this transporter is an epiphenomenon. This review summarizes past and recent findings regarding the functional, structural and physiological characteristics of H-KATPase type 2. The findings discussed in this review suggest that, as in the famous story, the ugly duckling of the X-K-ATPase family is actually a swan. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder that has numerous medical consequences including cardiovascular morbidity. The clinical presentation in women is frequently vague, leading to its under-recognition in this population. Sleep is known to influence several female hormonal cycles including estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); consequently, sleep disruption may have adverse effects on female health including pregnancy. Miscarriage, defined as the loss of a pregnancy in the first trimester, occurs in one in four pregnancies; in up to half of cases, the cause may be unknown. Risk factors for miscarriage include increased age, increased weight, and a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, all of which are also risk factors for SDB. Since SDB is frequently accompanied by sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia, we speculate that these factors may contribute to miscarriage risk. If this is the case, then treatment of SDB may be a possible intervention for subsequent pregnancies. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26-34. weeks gestation). Methods: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized controlled trial design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to achieve mutual calm and promote communication of affect between infants and their mothers throughout the NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants during sleep at ~35 and ~40. weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 frequency bands between 1 and 48. Hz in each of 125 electrodes. Results: Near to term age, compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48. Hz (20% to 36% with p-values <0.0004). Effects were significant in both quiet and active sleep, regardless of gender, singleton-twin status, gestational age (26-30 or 30-35. weeks) or birth weight (<1500 or >1500. g). Conclusion: FNI leads to increased frontal brain activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of better neurobehavioral outcomes. Significance: FNI may be a practicable means of improving outcomes in preterm infants. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - Epidemiological and experimental evidence correlates adverse intrauterine conditions with the onset of disease later in life. For a fetus to achieve a successful transition to extrauterine life, a myriad of temporally integrated humoral/biophysical signals must be accurately provided by the mother. We and others have shown the existence of daily rhythms in the fetus, with peripheral clocks being entrained by maternal cues, such as transplacental melatonin signaling. Among developing tissues, the fetal hippocampus is a key structure for learning and memory processing that may be anticipated as a sensitive target of gestational chronodisruption. Here, we used pregnant rats exposed to constant light treated with or without melatonin as a model of gestational chronodisruption, to investigate effects on the putative fetal hippocampus clock, as well as on adult offspring's rhythms, endocrine and spatial memory outcomes. The hippocampus of fetuses gestated under light:dark photoperiod (12:12 LD) displayed daily oscillatory expression of the clock genes Bmal1 and Per2, clock-controlled genes Mtnr1b, Slc2a4, Nr3c1 and NMDA receptor subunits 1B-3A-3B. In contrast, in the hippocampus of fetuses gestated under constant light (LL), these oscillations were suppressed. In the adult LL offspring (reared in LD during postpartum), we observed complete lack of day/night differences in plasma melatonin and decreased day/night differences in plasma corticosterone. In the adult LL offspring, overall hippocampal day/night difference of gene expression was decreased, which was accompanied by a significant deficit of spatial memory. Notably, maternal melatonin replacement to dams subjected to gestational chronodisruption prevented the effects observed in both, LL fetuses and adult LL offspring. Collectively, the present data point to adverse effects of gestational chronodisruption on long-term cognitive function; raising challenging questions about the consequences of shift work during pregnancy. The present study also supports that developmental plasticity in response to photoperiodic cues may be modulated by maternal melatonin. © 2014 Vilches et al.

AB  - Objectives: Emerging evidence suggests that maternal obesity (MO) predisposes offspring to obesity and the recently described non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) but involved mechanisms remain unclear. Using a pathophysiologically relevant murine model, we here investigated a role for the biological clock - molecular core circadian genes (CCG) in the generation of NAFPD. Design: Female C57BL6 mice were fed an obesogenic diet (OD) or standard chow (SC) for 6 weeks, prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation and lactation: resulting offspring were subsequently weaned onto either OD (Ob-Ob and Con-Ob) or standard chow (Ob-Con and Con-Con) for 6 months. Biochemical, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic markers associated with NAFPD were then evaluated and CCG mRNA expression in the pancreas determined. Results: Offspring of obese dams weaned on to OD (Ob-Ob) had significantly increased (p≤0.05): bodyweight, pancreatic triglycerides, macrovesicular pancreatic fatty-infiltration, and pancreatic mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, α-SMA, TGF-β and increased collagen compared to offspring of control dams weaned on to control chow (Con-Con). Analyses of CCG expression demonstrated a phase shift in CLOCK (24.818, p<0.01), REV-ERB-α ( 21.4,p<0.05) and Per2 (3.27,p<0.05) in association with decreased amplitude in BMAL-1 (-0.914,p<0.05) and PER2 (1.18,p<0.005) in Ob-Ob compared to Con-Con. 2-way ANOVA revealed significant interaction between MO and post-weaning OD in expression of CLOCK (p<0.005), PER1 (p<0.005) and PER2 (p<0.05) whilst MO alone influenced the observed rhythmic variance in expression of all 5 measured CCG. Conclusions: Fetal and neonatal exposure to a maternal obesogenic environment interacts with a post-natal hyper-calorific environment to induce offspring NAFPD through mechanisms involving perturbations in CCG expression. © 2014 Carter et al.

AB  - Women with epilepsy (WWE) face challenges throughout their reproductive life that place them and their unborn offspring at risk of adverse events. It is important to choose an antiepileptic drug (AED) that can control seizures, does not interfere with contraception, and is favorable for childhood outcomes. Pregnant women need folic acid, prenatal vitamins, frequent medication management, and careful obstetrical monitoring. Postpartum WWE should be monitored for postpartum depression and counseled about seizures from sleep deprivation. With the proper counseling and attentive care, WWE can maintain seizure control and deliver healthy babies. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The paper examines the case of a pregnant woman in a twin pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia and sleep disordered breathing. The patient was admitted to hospital with high blood pressure, proteinuria and increasing oedema. Laboratory tests revealed proteinuria and reduced total protein concentration in serum. The patient was diagnosed with mild pre-eclampsia. Due to the observed severe daytime sleepiness of the patient, loud snoring and pauses in breathing during sleep, polysomnography was performed. The test revealed a number of episodes of obstructive apnea and hypopnea. The AHI (apnea-hypopnea index) value was 82.1. A number of episodes of desaturation were observed. The lowest saturation had a value of 82%. When the patient was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea, treatment with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) was introduced. The use of CPAP allowed a reduction of the AHI to 1.2, and the blood pressure value normalised. The patient used CPAP between the 33rd and 35th weeks of gestation. At the 35th week of gestation, caesarean section was performed due to life-threatening symptoms of the first foetus in the CTG-recording. Two male infants were delivered in good condition. During the postpartum period, the patient discontinued the use of CPAP. Following this, an increase in AHI to 45.3 and an increase in blood pressure to a maximum of 180/100mmHg were observed. The patient was discharged from hospital in good general condition on the 7th day postpartum with recommendation for further diagnostic and therapy. The conclusion that may be drawn from the case is that sleep disorders adversely affect the health of the mother and the foetus. Also, the mood and quality of life of the pregnant woman deteriorate. It has been proven that there are many relationships between sleep and health. Sleep disorders and disorders of breathing during sleep contribute to the development of various diseases or they degrade the overall phenomena. A disease, on the other hand, additionally negatively affects the quality of sleep. Therefore, it is essential to treat not only the primary disease, but also the accompanying sleep disorders. © 2014 PTChP.

AB  - Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women. However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family well-being.Methods/Design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are <28 weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and family-based outcomes.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01901796. © 2014 Kingston et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - background: Research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have previously-unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs. Likewise, numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health. The relationship of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in this review. methods: Databases were searched for the related published English literature up to 15 May 2013. The search terms used in various combinations included melatonin, circadian rhythms, biological clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ovary, pregnancy, uterus, placenta, fetus, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, ischemia-reperfusion, chronodisruption, antioxidants, oxidative stress and free radicals. The results of the studies uncovered are summarized herein. results: Both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction, especially during pregnancy. Melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities. Melatonin is produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative/nitrosative stress. The placenta, in particular, is often a site of excessive free radical generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall, which leads to either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, processes that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction. This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy. Melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in experiments using non-human mammals. Likewise, the maintenance of a regular maternal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important since her circadian clock, either directly or indirectly via the melatonin rhythm, programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus. Experimental studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms, referred to as chronodisruption, and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for the maturing fetal oscillators, which may lead to psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn. To optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy, shift work and bright light exposure at night should be avoided, especially during the last trimester of pregnancy. Finally, melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the fetus. Since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period, the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the strength of uterine contractions. conclusions: Anumber of conclusions naturally evolve fromthe data summarized in this review: (i) melatonin, of both pineal and placental origin, has essential functions in fetal maturation and placenta/uterine homeostasis; (ii) circadian clock genes, which are components of all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs, have important roles in reproductive and organismal (fetal and maternal) physiology; (iii) due to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin, coupled with its virtual absence of toxicity, this indoleamine mayhave utility in the treatment of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placental and fetal ischemia/reperfusion, etc. (iv) the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Until recently, neuroscience has given sleep research and discovery of better treatments of sleep disturbances little attention, despite the fact that disturbed sleep has overwhelming impact on human health. Sleep is a complex phenomenon in which specific psychological, electrophysiological, neurochemical, endocrinological, immunological and genetic factors are involved. The brain as both the generator and main object of sleep is obviously of particular interest, which makes a neuroscience-driven view the most promising approach to evaluate clinical implications and applications of sleep research. Polysomnography as the gold standard of sleep research, complemented by brain imaging, neuroendocrine testing, genomics and other laboratory measures can help to create composite biomarkers that allow maximizing the effects of individualized therapies while minimizing adverse effects. Here we review the current state of the neuroscience of sleep, sleep disorders and sleep therapeutics and will give some leads to promote the discovery and development of sleep medicines that are better than those we have today. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is characterized by normal levels of peripheral thyroid hormone, paired with a TSH level that is either lower than (subclinical hyperthyroidism) or higher than (subclinical hypothyroidism) the normal laboratory reference range. Slight shifts in peripheral hormone levels result in significant serum TSH changes. The exact upper limit of normal TSH and the management of subclinical hypothyroidism are still controversial. For those with TSH between high upper limit of normal and 10 mIU/L, the authors suggest selective use of thyroxine therapy. The authors agree with the general consensus in favor of therapy for those with serum TSH levels above 10 mIU/L. This recommendation is compatible with guidelines of American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. For subclinical hyperthyroidism persistent serum TSH <0.1 mIU/L should be treated particularly if the etiology is nodular toxic goiter. For serum TSH between 0.1 mIU/L and lower limit of normal, serum TSH co-morbidities such as cardiac risk factors and osteoporosis may favor therapy. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Background Our goal is to study the triggers of spontaneous preterm delivery using a case-crossover design. Methods In a pilot study, we enrolled 50 women with spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) and 50 with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 2011 and 2012. To assess non-transient risk factors, we also enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time was defined as the onset of PTL/PPROM (for cases) or interview (for controls). Detailed data were collected through structured interviews regarding factors of interest during the 72 h that preceded the index time. Within case subjects, we compared the frequency of transient factors from 0 to 24 h before index time with that from 48 to 72 h before index time, and estimated matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Previously hypothesised chronic risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful events, were more common among cases than among controls. Within cases, skipped meals [OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2, 15.2], disturbed sleep [OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5, 13.3], sexual activity [OR 6.0, 95% CI 0.7, 69.8], and intake of spicy foods [OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.6, 30.8] were associated with an increased risk for PTL/PPROM within the subsequent 24 h. For physical exertion and other potential risk factors evaluated, the OR was close to the null. Conclusion Skipping meals and disturbed sleep may be associated with imminent PTL/PPROM; sexual activity and spicy food may trigger PTL/PPROM in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies will be able to evaluate the impact of modifiable risk factors and acute predictors of PTL/PPROM, and might help guide obstetrical management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Whether they are African or Asian, the children of immigrant families live in situations in which they may be exposed to serious trauma. Immigrant families themselves often live in extreme conditions. Although research has described these conditions, intervention is still inadequate. These families need not only medical or psychological treatment but also basic needs for survival such as food, shelter, a place to sleep, a place to bury their dead. However, the psychological care of immigrant children and their families has much to teach us. We set out here to share what we have learned about immigrant families with infants. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Between May 2010 and October 2012, approximately 12.5 million long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were distributed through a national universal mass distribution campaign in Ghana. The campaign included pre-registration of persons and sleeping places, door-to-door distribution of LLINs with 'hang-up' activities by volunteers and post-distribution 'keep-up' behaviour change communication activities. Hang-up activities were included to encourage high and sustained use. Methods. The cost and cost-effectiveness of the LLIN Campaign were evaluated using a before-after design in three regions: Brong Ahafo, Central and Western. The incremental cost effectiveness of the 'hang-up' component was estimated using reported variation in the implementation of hang-up activities and LLIN use. Economic costs were estimated from a societal perspective assuming LLINs would be replaced after three years, and included the time of unpaid volunteers and household contributions given to volunteers. Results: Across the three regions, 3.6 million campaign LLINs were distributed, and 45.5% of households reported the LLINs received were hung-up by a volunteer. The financial cost of the campaign was USD 6.51 per LLIN delivered. The average annual economic cost was USD 2.90 per LLIN delivered and USD 6,619 per additional child death averted by the campaign. The cost-effectiveness of the campaign was sensitive to the price, lifespan and protective efficacy of LLINs.Hang-up activities constituted 7% of the annual economic cost, though the additional financial cost was modest given the use of volunteers. LLIN use was greater in households in which one or more campaign LLINs were hung by a volunteer (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.27; p = 0.02). The additional economic cost of the hang-up activities was USD 0.23 per LLIN delivered, and achieved a net saving per LLIN used and per death averted. Conclusion: In this campaign, hang-up activities were estimated to be net saving if hang-up increased LLIN use by 10% or more. This suggests hang-up activities can make a LLIN campaign more cost-effective. © 2014 Smith Paintain et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of US women aged 20 to 39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m or greater. Across the life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI, addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve care.

AB  - Background: Serving on volunteer groups undertaking medical mission trips is a common activity for health care professionals and students. Although volunteers hope such work will assist underserved populations, medical mission groups have been criticized for not providing sustainable health services that focus on underlying health problems. As members of a volunteer medical mission group, we performed a bed net indicator study in rural Mali. We undertook this project to demonstrate that volunteers are capable of undertaking small-scale research, the results of which offer locally relevant results useful for disease prevention programs. The results of such projects are potentially sustainable beyond the duration of a mission trip.Methods: Volunteers with Medicine for Mali interviewed 108 households in Nana Kenieba, Mali during a routine two-week medical mission trip. Interviewees were asked structured questions about family demographics, use of insecticide treated bed nets the previous evening, as well as about benefits of net use and knowledge of malaria. Survey results were analyzed using logistic regression.Results: We found that 43.7% of households had any family member sleep under a bed net the previous evening. Eighty seven percent of households owned at least one ITN and the average household owned 1.95 nets. The regression model showed that paying for a net was significantly correlated with its use, while low perceived mosquito density, obtaining the net from the public sector and more than four years of education in the male head of the household were negatively correlated with net use. These results differ from national Malian data and peer-reviewed studies of bed net use.Conclusions: We completed a bed net study that provided results that were specific to our service area. Since these results were dissimilar to peer-reviewed literature and Malian national level data on bed net use, the results will be useful to develop locally specific teaching materials on malaria prevention. This preventive focus is potentially more sustainable than clinical services for malaria treatment. Although we were not able to demonstrate that our work is sustainable, our study shows that volunteer groups are capable of undertaking research that is relevant to their service area. © 2014 Rovers et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Women with bipolar disorder have a high risk for symptom exacerbation during pregnancy and the risk is elevated further when mood stabilizers are discontinued. This report describes a 31-year-old bipolar woman who discontinued medication before pregnancy but had to resume her pharmacotherapy due to manic episodes that recurred during the second trimester. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, was administered from week 25 of gestation and then replaced with quetiapine in week 35 of gestation. Even though a consensus on clinical interventions for pregnant patients with symptom relapse has not been reached, clinicians should still discuss pregnancy and therapeutic management with every female bipolar patient of childbearing age. This discussion is important because treatment can be managed most effectively in these individuals if pregnancy is planned. Ultimately, clinical decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, weighing the risks to the mother and fetus between the disorder itself and the teratogenicity of pharmacotherapy. © 2014 Choi et al.

AB  - Colonic morphology and function change significantly during ontogenesis. In mammals, many colonic physiological functions are temporally controlled by the circadian clock in the colon, which is entrained by the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The aim of this present study was to ascertain when and how the circadian clock in the colon develops during the perinatal period and whether maternal cues and/or the developing pup SCN may influence the ontogenesis of the colonic clock. Daily profiles of clock genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, Reverb α, Bmal1, and Clock expression in the colon underwent significant modifications since embryonic day 20 (E20) through postnatal days (P) 2, 10, 20, and 30 via changes in the mutual phasing among the individual clock gene expression rhythms, their relative phasing to the light-dark regime, and their amplitudes. An adult-like state was achieved around P20. The foster study revealed that during the prenatal period, the maternal circadian phase may partially modulate development of the colonic clock. Postnatally, the absence and/or presence of rhythmic maternal care affected the phasing of the clock gene expression profiles in pups at P10 and P20. A reversal in the colonic clock phase between P10 and P20 occurred in the absence of rhythmic signals from the pup SCN. The data demonstrate ontogenetic maturation of the colonic clock and stress the importance of prenatal and postnatal maternal rhythmic signals for its development. These data may contribute to the understanding of colonic function-related diseases in newborn children. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To examine the link between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and sleep-disordered breathing using complete polysomnography and questionnaires in a case-control study of pregnant women. METHODS:: Pregnant women (body mass index [BMI] less than 35, no prior diabetes or hypertension) were eligible as cases (n=26) if diagnosed with GDM by routine 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Women in the control group without GDM (n=26) were matched for gestational age at polysomnography, BMI, and age. Polysomnography were conducted at home at 24-32 weeks of gestation. Sleepiness score (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), risk for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), and restless legs syndrome were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS:: Primary outcome apnea-hypopnea index (4.2±3.9 events per hour in women in the case group compared with 3.8±2.3 events per hour in women in the control group) as well as other objective and subjective sleep measures, including oxygen desaturation index, snoring, and flow limitation, were not significantly different between groups. Sleepiness was greater in women in the case group than in women in the control group (9.8±3.6 compared with 7.2±3.6, P=.05). Additionally, 23% of women in the case group compared with 0% of women in the control group (P<.01) reported an Edinburgh Scale score of at least 10 (suggesting significant depression) and 46% of women with GDM reported restless legs syndrome compared to 19% of women in the control group (P=.07). CONCLUSION:: There was no association between GDM and sleep-disordered breathing in pregnant women with prepregnancy BMIs under 35 and no medical comorbidities.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation in critically ill neonates. Methods: Newborn infants (≥35 weeks gestation) who required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to 12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated. Results: Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 ± 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho5 0.54, p= 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p> 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho= -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores. Conclusions: Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleep-including analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentation-showed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.

AB  - Alteration in the HPA axis is a robust biomarker of anxiety and depression in adults, but questions remain about this association in pregnancy. We examined the longitudinal links between diurnal cortisol and mood symptoms from self-report questionnaire and diagnostic interview in an ethnically diverse, psychosocially at-risk sample of 101 women at mid-pregnancy and early third trimester. There were modest but significant associations between depression and elevated cortisol, indexed by a decreased morning level and diminished diurnal decline; the effects were strongest for diagnostic data from clinical interview. These effects were independent of socio-demographic factors and sleep disturbance. Associations with anxiety and trauma were generally non-significant. These findings extend prior work by showing that significant mood symptoms in pregnancy are associated with altered diurnal cortisol in pregnancy, which may have implications for maternal and child health. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective We sought to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in deliveries occurring overnight with those in daylight hours. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Large national tertiary referral center. Population All singleton laboring nulliparous parturients delivering infants >500 g over a 2-year period, 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009. Methods Details of intrapartum characteristics and neonatal outcomes of deliveries occurring between midnight and 08.00 h were compared with deliveries occurring outside of these hours. Main outcome measures Maternal and neonatal morbidity. Results During the study period there were 8450 nulliparous deliveries. 2668 (31.6%) delivered between midnight and 08.00 h, and 5782 (68.4%) outside of these hours. There was a significant difference between the time periods in the number of babies born with a cord pH <7.1: 10.8% (44/406) of babies were born between midnight and 08.00 h, and 6.3% (63/1007) of babies were born outside these hours (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in terms of Apgar score <7 at 5 min (p = 0.17). There was a trend toward a larger number of anal sphincter injuries occurring between midnight and 08.00 h (3% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.05). Conclusion Our findings suggest that infants are more likely to be born with a pH <7.1 and there was a trend toward an increased rate of anal sphincter injury during time periods when staffing levels are low and clinician fatigue may play a role in decision-making and patient management. This may play a role in service provision planning and staff recruitment. © 2013 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - This paper reviews recent work investigating the influence of sleep disturbances on maternal hyperglycemia, particularly gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The incidence and prevalence of hyperglycemia are increasing worldwide, which is cause for concern because GDM and even mild hyperglycemia are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A better understanding of sleep-related risk factors for maternal hyperglycemia is an important health matter. Evidence demonstrates associations between sleep disturbances, especially sleep-disordered breathing, and hyperglycemia, but causal effects and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions have not been fully elucidated. Subjective sleep assessments show associations between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There are, however, few studies using objective measures to support these findings. Large prospective studies are required to examine causal relationships between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There is also a need for smaller mechanistic studies to understand the pathophysiology. Furthermore, interventional studies are required to address whether improvement of sleep parameters can prevent/decrease the risk of developing maternal hyperglycemia. Taken together, the data suggests that sleep disturbances during pregnancy are important to identify and manage in order to minimize maternal hyperglycemia and GDM, and improve maternal and fetal well-being. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: In contrast to postpartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder, little is known about the risk of recurrence in men with bipolar disorder who have just become fathers. Case report: We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder who had a manic episode immediately after becoming a father. His spouse had a normal pregnancy, and delivery started during daytime and lasted until the early morning hours. The patient subsequently developed a manic episode, which had a major impact on the family. Conclusions: There is a well-known relationship between sleep loss and the occurrence of a manic episode. The study of psychopathology in the postpartum period in relation to sleep disturbance refers mainly to women. Disturbance of sleep patterns in the perinatal and postpartum period may also negatively impact the course of bipolar disorder in the father. In cases of pregnancy of a male bipolar disorder patient's spouse, preventive strategies for the postpartum period should be planned in advance. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Following the "back to sleep" recommendations, a striking rise in deformational plagiocephaly (DP) occurred. However, additional maternal, pregnancy and infant conditions may play a role. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for DP at birth. Additionally, given the association between assisted reproductive technologies (ART) use and unfavorable pregnancy events, we explored the association between ART and DP. Patients and Methods: A total of 413 neonates >33 weeks born at L. Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) from May 2011 through to January 2012 were enrolled. Data regarding parental, conceivement, pregnancy and delivery characteristics were recorded. Infants' skull measurements, including the oblique cranial length ratio (OCLR) were taken within 72h after birth. Plagiocephaly was defined for OCLR>105.9. Results: The prevalence of DP was 20.3%. It was associated with twinning (OR 5.0; 95%CI 2.22-11.1), pregnancy complications (OR 2.86; 95%CI 1.49-5.26), prematurity (OR 2.13; 95%CI 0.98-4.54), ART use (OR 2.00; 95%CI 0.90-4.35) and male gender (OR 1.79; 95%CI 0.94-2.50). Adjusting for multiple pregnancies however, the association between ART and DP disappeared. Conclusion: Results show that offspring of pregnancies conceived through ART do not have increased risk of DP. However, our numbers are small thus larger studies are needed for definitive conclusions. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective. Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are common in primary care and may cause severe pain and sleep disturbance. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of magnesium in treating NLC and the side-effect profile of magnesium compared to placebo. Methods. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registries until August 2012. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing magnesium therapy for NLC in adults with any other comparator were eligible. Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies. To compensate for the heterogeneity in outcome measures, simulations were used to summarize the data. Results. Seven RCTs were included in the review (n = 361), all comparing magnesium to placebo. Three of these trials included only pregnant women. The difference in the median number of leg cramps per week between the placebo and the intervention groups was 0.345 (quantile 2.5%: -0.133, quantile 97.5%: 0.875). This difference was 0.807 (quantile 2.5%: 0.015, quantile 97.5%: 1.207) in the three studies involving only pregnant women and 0.362 (quantile 2.5%: -0.386, quantile 97.5%: 1.148) in the others. Overall gastrointestinal side effects were slightly more common with magnesium therapy than with placebo. The strength of this evidence was weak, mainly due to small study sizes and short follow-up. Conclusions. Magnesium therapy does not appear to be effective in the treatment of NLC in the general population, but may have a small effect in pregnant women. Further research using better designed RCTs is necessary. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine the rate of, and risk factors for, a change in diagnosis from major depressive disorder to bipolar disorder, and from bipolar II disorder to bipolar I disorder in pregnancy and postpartum. Methods: Patients with a prior history of major depressive disorder or bipolar II disorder were recruited between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation and followed through to one year postpartum. Diagnostic interviews were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV at study intake and repeated using the Mini-International Psychiatric Interview at one, three, six, and 12 months after childbirth. Fisher's exact test was used to assess the association between various risk factors and diagnostic switch. Results: A total of 146 participants completed the intake interview and at least one follow-up interview postpartum. Of these, 92 were diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 54 with bipolar II disorder at intake. Six women (6.52%) experienced a diagnostic change from major depressive disorder to bipolar II disorder during the first six months after childbirth. There were no cases of switching to bipolar I disorder, but in one participant the diagnosis changed from bipolar II disorder to bipolar I disorder during the three months after childbirth. Bipolar switch was associated with a family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: The postpartum period appears to be a time of high risk for a new onset of hypomania in women with major depressive disorder. Our rate of diagnostic switching to bipolar II disorder (6.52%) is at least 11- to 18-fold higher than the rates of switching in similar studies conducted in both men and women. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - We report a case of clonidine poisoning in a breastfed newborn. At 2 days of life, this boy presented a consciousness deficit with drowsiness, hypotonia, and suspected generalized seizures. There were no cardiorespiratory problems outside of progressive central apneas beginning the 5th day. Further initial investigations were normal (extensive biological exams, cranial ultrasonography and transfontanellar Doppler, electroencephalography, and brain MRI study), excluding the main causes of neonatal hypotonia (encephalitis, infection, metabolic disorder). However, new medical questioning revealed maternal daily intake of 0.15. mg clonidine for hypertension during and after pregnancy. Since it was impossible to quantify clonidine quantification in newborn serum and breast milk, a weaning test was performed the 9th day. Twenty-four hours after cessation of breastfeeding, complete regression of symptoms was obtained. Poisoning by clonidine after fetal and neonatal exposure through breast milk is rare but severe enough to simulate a neurological disease. Diagnosis is based on the search for drug use and the cessation of breastfeeding if doubt persists. Recovery of normal examination results is then rapid and complete. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objective To assess the effect of the time interval from indication of hypoxia to delivery on neonatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies monitored with cardiotocography (CTG) and ST-waveform analysis. Design Prospective observational study. Setting University hospital, Norway, 2004-08. Population Singleton high-risk births with a gestational age above 35+6 weeks, monitored with CTG and ST-waveform analysis. Methods Logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival plots. Main outcome measure Neonatal morbidity in relation to the rapidity of intervention. Results Of 6010 deliveries monitored with ST-waveform analysis, 1131 (19%) had an indication to intervene for fetal distress according to clinical guidelines. Those fetuses were at increased risk of an adverse neonatal outcome, and if delivered later than 20 min after the indication of hypoxia their risk increased further; i.e. transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2-2.2) to an odds ratio of 3.3 (95% confidence interval 2.5-4.3). The indication-to-delivery interval was longer for neonates with a 5-min Apgar score of &lt;7, transfer to NICU and neonatal encephalopathy than for those without adverse outcome. Conclusion In deliveries monitored with CTG and ST-waveform analysis, the risk of an adverse neonatal outcome was dependent on the time between indication of hypoxia and delivery. Nonadherence to the specific clinical guidelines increased the risk of neonatal morbidity. © 2013 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - While the harmful effects of alcohol during pregnancy are well-established, the consequences of alcohol intake during lactation have been far less examined. We reviewed available data on the prevalence of alcohol intake during lactation, the influence of alcohol on breastfeeding, the pharmacokinetics of alcohol in lactating women and nursing infants and the effects of alcohol intake on nursing infants. A systematic search was performed in PubMed from origin to May 2013, and 41 publications were included in the review. Approximately half of all lactating women in Western countries consume alcohol while breastfeeding. Alcohol intake inhibits the milk ejection reflex, causing a temporary decrease in milk yield. The alcohol concentrations in breast milk closely resemble those in maternal blood. The amount of alcohol presented to nursing infants through breast milk is approximately 5-6% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose, and even in a theoretical case of binge drinking, the children would not be subjected to clinically relevant amounts of alcohol. Newborns metabolize alcohol at approximately half the rate of adults. Minute behavioural changes in infants exposed to alcohol-containing milk have been reported, but the literature is contradictory. Any long-term consequences for the children of alcohol-abusing mothers are yet unknown, but occasional drinking while breastfeeding has not been convincingly shown to adversely affect nursing infants. In conclusion, special recommendations aimed at lactating women are not warranted. Instead, lactating women should simply follow standard recommendations on alcohol consumption. © 2013 Nordic Pharmacological Society.

AB  - Since the earliest descriptions of the condition, controversy has prevailed as to the existence of as well as appropriate management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Often diagnosed in childhood, symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can continue into adolescence and adulthood, requiring lifelong therapy. Effective therapeutic interventions include stimulant medications with all their respective potential side effects, including the cardiovascular system. However, although initial studies raised concerns for an increase in serious adverse cardiovascular effects among children receiving these drugs, more recent and extensive reports have failed to substantiate those findings among young patients. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Changes in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) have been associated with specific phenotypes, most specifically those of fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile X primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Evidence of increased risk for additional medical, psychiatric, and cognitive features and conditions is now known to exist for individuals with a premutation, although some features have been more thoroughly studied than others. This review highlights the literature on medical, reproductive, cognitive, and psychiatric features, primarily in females, that have been suggested to be associated with changes in the FMR1 gene. Based on this review, each feature is evaluated with regard to the strength of evidence of association with the premutation. Areas of need for additional focused research and possible intervention strategies are suggested. © 2014 Wheeler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with a high risk of abnormal neurodevelopment. Underlying neuroanatomical substrates are partially documented. We hypothesized that at 12 months preterm infants would evidence specific white-matter microstructure alterations and gray-matter differences induced by severe IUGR. Twenty preterm infants with IUGR (26-34 weeks of gestation) were compared with 20 term-born infants and 20 appropriate for gestational age preterm infants of similar gestational age. Preterm groups showed no evidence of brain abnormalities. At 12 months, infants were scanned sleeping naturally. Gray-matter volumes were studied with voxel-based morphometry. White-matter microstructure was examined using tract-based spatial statistics. The relationship between diffusivity indices in white matter, gray matter volumes, and perinatal data was also investigated. Gray-matter decrements attributable to IUGR comprised amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus and insula bilaterally, left occipital and parietal lobes, and right perirolandic area. Gray-matter volumes positively correlated with birth weight exclusively. Preterm infants had reduced FA in the corpus callosum, and increased FA in the anterior corona radiata. Additionally, IUGR infants had increased FA in the forceps minor, internal and external capsules, uncinate and fronto-occipital white matter tracts. Increased axial diffusivity was observed in several white matter tracts. Fractional anisotropy positively correlated with birth weight and gestational age at birth. These data suggest that IUGR differentially affects gray and white matter development preferentially affecting gray matter. At 12 months IUGR is associated with a specific set of structural gray-matter decrements. White matter follows an unusual developmental pattern, and is apparently affected by IUGR and prematurity combined. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety are important mood changes in childbearing women. However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety courses. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N = 139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Group-based modeling identified three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%), and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%), and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly related to anxiety trajectories (p<0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1∼6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4∼7.3) in the third trimester. Conclusions: Distinctive trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to continuous assessment of psychological well-being among women who undergo an elective CS. © 2014 Kuo et al.

AB  - Particular reproductive stages such as lactation impose demands on the female. To cope with these demands, her physiology goes through numerous adaptations, for example, attenuation of immune and stress responses. Hormonal fluctuation during lactation exerts a strong influence, inducing neuroplasticity in the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic regions, and diminishing the stress and inflammatory responses. Thus, hormones confer decreased vulnerability to the female brain. This mini-review focuses on the adaptations of the immune and stress response during maternity, and on the neuroprotective actions of progesterone and prolactin and their effects on inflammation. The importance of pregnancy and lactation as experimental models to study immune responses and disease is also highlighted. © 2014 Monasterio, Vergara and Morales.

AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) imaging studies have revealed the functional development of the human brain in early infancy. By measuring spontaneous fluctuations in cerebral blood oxygenation with NIRS, we can examine the developmental status of the functional connectivity of networks in the cortex. However, it has not been clarified whether premature delivery and/or chromosomal abnormalities affect the development of the functional connectivity of the cortex. In the current study, we investigated the spontaneous brain activity of sleeping infants who were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit at term age. We classified them into the 3 following infant groups: (i) term-or-late-preterm, (ii) early-preterm, and (iii) Down's syndrome (DS). We used multichannel NIRS to measure the spontaneous changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) at 10 measurement channels, which covered the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions. In order to reveal the functional connectivity of the cortical networks, we calculated the temporal correlations of the time-course signals among all of the pairs of measurement channels. The functional connectivity was classified into the 4 following types: (i) short-range, (ii) contralateral-transverse, (iii) ipsilateral-longitudinal, and (iv) control. In order to examine whether the local properties of hemodynamics reflected any pathological conditions, we calculated the phase differences between the oxy- and deoxy-Hb time-course signals in the 3 groups. The statistical analyses of the functional connectivity data showed main effects of group and the types of connectivity. For the group effect, the mean functional connectivity of the infants in the term-or-late-preterm group did not differ from that in the early-preterm group, and the mean functional connectivity of the infants in the DS group was lower than that in the other 2 groups. For the effect of types of connectivity, short-range connectivity was highest compared to any of the other types of connectivity, and the second highest connectivity was the contralateral-transverse one. The phase differences between the oxy- and deoxy-Hb changes showed that there were significant differences between the DS group and the other 2 groups. Our findings suggested that the development of the functional connectivity of cortical networks did not differ between term-or-late-preterm infants and early-preterm infants around term-equivalent ages, while DS infants had alterations in their functional connectivity development and local hemodynamics at term age. The highest short-range connectivity and the second highest contralateral-transverse connectivity suggested that the precursors for the basic cortical networks of functional connectivity were present at term age. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The effects of rapid eye movement sleep restriction (REMSR) in rats during late pregnancy were studied on the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) made by the pups. USVs are distress calls inaudible to human ears. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was restricted in one group of pregnant rats for 22 hours, starting from gestational day 14 to 20, using standard single platform method. The USVs of male pups were recorded after a brief isolation from their mother for two minutes on alternate post-natal days, from day one till weaning. The USVs were recorded using microphones and were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using SASPro software. Control pups produced maximum vocalization on post-natal days 9 to 11. In comparison, the pups born to REMSR mothers showed not only a reduction in vocalization but also a delay in peak call making days. The experimental group showed variations in the types and characteristics of call types, and alteration in temporal profile. The blunting of distress call making response in these pups indicates that maternal sleep plays a role in regulating the neural development involved in vocalizations and possibly in shaping the emotional behaviour in neonates. It is suggested that the reduced ultrasonic vocalizations can be utilized as a reliable early marker for affective state in rat pups. Such impaired vocalization responses could provide an important lead in understanding mother-child bonding for an optimal cognitive development during post-partum life. This is the first report showing a potential link between maternal REM sleep deprivation and the vocalization in neonates and infants. © 2014 Gulia et al.

AB  - Background: The incidence of snoring and sleepiness is known to increase during pregnancy, and this might impact maternal health and obstetric outcome. However, the association between snoring and sleepiness during pregnancy is not fully understood. This study was aimed at investigating the development of snoring during pregnancy and prospectively assessing if there is an association between snoring and sleepiness or adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, mode of delivery, and fetal complications. Methods: Consecutively recruited pregnant women (n = 500) received a questionnaire concerning snoring and sleep at the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who had rated their frequency of snoring at both occasions (n = 340) were divided into subgroups according to the development of snoring they reported and included in the subsequent analyses. Additional medical data were collected from the medical records. Results: The frequency of snoring was 7.9% in the 1st trimester and increased to 21.2% in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who snored already in early pregnancy had significantly higher baseline BMI (p = 0.001) than the women who never snored, but snoring was not associated with the magnitude of weight gain during pregnancy. Snoring women were more likely to experience edema in late pregnancy than the non-snorers. Women who started to snore during pregnancy had higher Epworth Sleepiness Scores than the non snorers in both early and late pregnancy. No significant association between obstetric outcome and snoring was found. Conclusion: Snoring does increase during pregnancy, and this increase is associated with sleepiness, higher BMI at the start of pregnancy and higher prevalence of edema, but not with weight gain. © 2014 Sarberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Early-pregnancy short sleep duration is predictive of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia; mechanisms for these associations are unknown. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived peptide involved in regulating food intake and energy expenditure, may play a role in these observed associations. Given inconsistent reports linking short sleep duration with leptin, and absence of studies among pregnant women, we examined the association of maternal sleep duration with plasma leptin in early pregnancy. Methods. This cross-sectional study included 830 pregnant women. Plasma leptin was measured in samples collected around 13 weeks gestation. Sleep duration was categorized as: ≤5, 6, 7-8 (reference), and ≥9 hours. Differences in leptin concentrations across categories were estimated using linear regression. Analyses were completed for lean and overweight/obese women. Results: Overall, women with long sleep duration had elevated plasma leptin (p-value = 0.04). However, leptin concentrations were not statistically significantly elevated in women with a short sleep duration. There was no association of leptin with sleep duration among lean women. Among overweight/obese women, a U-shaped relation between leptin and sleep duration was observed: Mean leptin was elevated (β = 21.96 ng/ml, P < 0.001) among women reporting ≤5 hour of sleep compared with reference group; and women reporting ≥9 hours of sleep also had elevated leptin (β = 4.29 ng/ml, P = 0.09). Conclusions: Short sleep duration, and to a lesser extent long sleep duration, were associated with elevated leptin among overweight/obese women. These data add some evidence to help understand mechanistic relationships of sleep duration with pregnancy complications. © 2014 Qiu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Almost all forms of life have predictable daily or circadian rhythms in molecular, endocrine, and behavioral functions. In mammals, a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei coordinates the timing of these rhythms. Daily light exposure that affects the retina of the eye directly influences this area, which is required to align endogenous processes to the appropriate time of day. The present "Views and Reviews" articles discuss the influence of circadian rhythms, especially nightly secretion of melatonin, on reproductive function and parturition. In addition, an examination is made of problems that arise from recurrent circadian rhythm disruption associated with changes in light exposure patterns common to modern day society. Finally, a possible solution to prevent disruptions in circadian phase markers by filtering out short wavelengths from nocturnal light is reviewed. © 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Insufficient sleep is common in the general population, and can result from environmental and psychosocial factors, medical and psychiatric disorders, and sleep disorders, such as insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep apnoea and restless legs. Women are particularly at risk for sleep disorders, and complaints of sleep disturbance are more prevalent among women than men across the life span. During the perinatal period, many common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or restless legs may be exacerbated, or in the case of insomnia or narcolepsy, treatment options may change. In addition, the role of circadian rhythms in fertility and perinatal health is just beginning to be appreciated. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the unique aspects of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders during the perinatal period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To summarize the role of melatonin and circadian rhythms in determining optimal female reproductive physiology, especially at the peripheral level. Design Databases were searched for the related English-language literature published up to March 1, 2014. Only papers in peer-reviewed journals are cited. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) Not applicable. Intervention(s) Melatonin treatment, alterations of the normal light:dark cycle and light exposure at night. Main Outcome Measure(s) Melatonin levels in the blood and in the ovarian follicular fluid and melatonin synthesis, oxidative damage and circadian rhythm disturbances in peripheral reproductive organs. Result(s) The central circadian regulatory system is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The output of this master clock is synchronized to 24 hours by the prevailing light-dark cycle. The SCN regulates rhythms in peripheral cells via the autonomic nervous system and it sends a neural message to the pineal gland where it controls the cyclic production of melatonin; after its release, the melatonin rhythm strengthens peripheral oscillators. Melatonin is also produced in the peripheral reproductive organs, including granulosa cells, the cumulus oophorus, and the oocyte. These cells, along with the blood, may contribute melatonin to the follicular fluid, which has melatonin levels higher than those in the blood. Melatonin is a powerful free radical scavenger and protects the oocyte from oxidative stress, especially at the time of ovulation. The cyclic levels of melatonin in the blood pass through the placenta and aid in the organization of the fetal SCN. In the absence of this synchronizing effect, the offspring may exhibit neurobehavioral deficits. Also, melatonin protects the developing fetus from oxidative stress. Melatonin produced in the placenta likewise may preserve the optimal function of this organ. Conclusion(s) Both stable circadian rhythms and cyclic melatonin availability are critical for optimal ovarian physiology and placental function. Because light exposure after darkness onset at night disrupts the master circadian clock and suppresses elevated nocturnal melatonin levels, light at night should be avoided. © 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Circadian clocks regulate homeostasis and mediate responses to stressors. Lactation is one of the most energetically demanding periods of an adult female's life. Peripartum changes occur in almost every organ so the dam can support neonatal growth through milk production while homeostasis is maintained. How circadian clocks are involved in adaptation to lactation is currently unknown. The abundance and temporal pattern of core clock genes' expression were measured in suprachiasmatic nucleus, liver, and mammary from late pregnant and early lactation mice. Tissue-specific changes in molecular clocks occurred between physiological states. Amplitude and robustness of rhythms increased in suprachiasmatic nucleus and liver. Mammary rhythms of core molecular clock genes were suppressed. Attenuated rhythms appeared to be a physiological adaptation of mammary to lactation, because manipulation of timing of suckling resulting in significant differences in plasma prolactin and corticosterone had no effect on amplitude. Analysis of core clock proteins revealed that the stoichiometric relationship between positive (CLOCK) and negative (PER2) components remained 1:1 in liver but was increased to 4:1 in mammary during physiological transition. Induction of differentiation of mammary epithelial cell line HC11 with dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin resulted in similar stoichiometric changes among positive and negative clock regulators, and prolactin induced phase shifts in HC11 Arntl expression rhythm. Data support that distinct mechanisms drive periparturient changes in mammary clock. Stoichiometric change in clock regulators occurs with gland differentiation. Suppression of mammary clock gene expression rhythms represents a physiological adaptation to suckling cues. Adaptations in mammary clock are likely needed in part to support suckling demands of neonates. © 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

AB  - Internal temporal organisation properly synchronised to the environment is crucial for health maintenance. This organisation is provided at the cellular level by the molecular clock, a macromolecular transcription-based oscillator formed by the clock and the clock-controlled genes that is present in both central and peripheral tissues. In mammals, melanopsin in light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells plays a considerable role in the synchronisation of the circadian timing system to the daily light/dark cycle. Melatonin, a hormone synthesised in the pineal gland exclusively at night and an output of the central clock, has a fundamental role in regulating/timing several physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion and energy metabolism. As such, metabolism is severely impaired after a reduction in melatonin production. Furthermore, light pollution during the night and shift work schedules can abrogate melatonin synthesis and impair homeostasis. Chronodisruption during pregnancy has deleterious effects on the health of progeny, including metabolic, cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction. Developmental programming by steroids or steroid-mimetic compounds also produces internal circadian disorganisation that may be a significant factor in the aetiology of fertility disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Thus, both early and late in life, pernicious alterations of the endogenous temporal order by environmental factors can disrupt the homeostatic function of the circadian timing system, leading to pathophysiology and/or disease. © 2014 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.

AB  - The impact of pregnancy and lactation on ultradian rhythms (URs) and circadian rhythms (CRs) of locomotor activity was assessed in circadian rhythmic and arrhythmic Siberian hamsters maintained in a long-day photoperiod (16. h light/day). Progressive decrements in CR robustness and amplitude over the course of gestation were accompanied by enhanced URs. Dark-phase UR period and amplitude increased during early gestation and complexity and robustness increased during late gestation. The persistence of pregnancy-associated enhancements of URs in circadian arrhythmic (ARR) hamsters suggests that reproductive modulation of the UR waveform is not dependent on coherent circadian organization. The increased incidence of dark-phase URs appeared more rapidly in ARR dams than entrained (ENTR) dams. Throughout gestation, the percentage of dams with dark-phase URs was significantly greater in the ARR group. Gestational increases in UR complexity and robustness emerged earlier and were greater in ARR than ENTR dams. The attenuation of CRs during lactation is correlated with increased expression of URs. Relaxation of circadian control of the dam's behavior may increase fitness by permitting more efficient interactions with circadian arrhythmic pups. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Data regarding circadian rhythm in the onset of spontaneous preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and placental abruption (PA) cases are conflicting. We modeled the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases and examined if the circadian profiles varied based on the gestational age at delivery. Methods: We used parametric and nonparametric methods, including trigonometric regression in the framework of generalized linear models, to test the presence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases among 395 women who delivered a singleton between 2009 and 2010 in Lima, Peru. Results: We found a diurnal circadian pattern, with a morning peak at 07:32 AM (95% confidence interval, 05:46 AM-09:18 AM) among moderate preterm PROM cases (P value < .001), and some evidence of a diurnal circadian periodicity among PA cases in term infants (P value=067). However, we did not find evidence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of extremely or very preterm PROM (P value=259) and preterm PA (P value=224). Conclusions: The circadian rhythms of the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases varied based on gestational weeks at delivery. Although circadian rhythms were presented among moderate preterm PROM and term PA cases, there was no evidence of circadian rhythms among preterm PA and very or extremely preterm PROM cases, underlying other mechanisms associated with the time of onset. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective To review and update the research on melatonin receptor expression in the human myometrium, in particular as it pertains to uterine contractility at labor. Design Summary of previous studies with the addition of new data on the transcriptional regulation of melatonin receptor expression in human myometrial cells. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) Late-term pregnant volunteers. Intervention(s) Biopsy collection for in vitro analyses provided the original data. More recently, uterine contractions in late-term pregnant volunteers were assessed before, during, and after acute white-light exposure. Main Outcome Measure(s) Melatonin receptor signaling in myometrial cells and uterine contractions in late-term pregnant volunteers. Result(s) Melatonin acts through the MTNR1B melatonin receptor that is expressed in the myometrium at late term to synergistically enhance oxytocin-dependent signaling and contractions. Acute inhibition of endogenous melatonin levels with light reversibly suppresses uterine contractions. Conclusion(s) These results point to a significant role for circulating melatonin in the timing and degree of uterine contractions in late-term pregnancy. Understanding the regulation of melatonin receptors remains a future objective. © 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Objective To examine the effects of high-fat (HF) diet-induced maternal obesity on follicular population and gene expression in adult offspring ovaries. Design Experimental mouse study. Setting Laboratory. Animal(s) Mice on HF diet. Intervention(s) Female C57BL/6J mice were fed an HF or standard chow (C) diet 6 weeks before conception, through pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were fed the C or HF diet from weaning, creating the HF/HF, HF/C, C/HF, C/C offspring groups. Main Outcome Measure(s) Follicular counts and gene expression in adult offspring ovaries. Result(s) Prenatal exposure to maternal HF nutrition resulted in the reduction of primordial, antral, and Graafian follicle numbers in offspring ovaries (both HF/C and HF/HF). Expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis (FoXO3a), follicular growth and development (Gdf9), and circadian rhythms generation (Clock and Bmal1) were elevated in the ovaries of HF/C and HF/HF offspring, while expression of the circadian clock genes Cry1 and Per1 were lower in HF/HF ovaries. Conclusion(s) Maternal obesity during pregnancy has long-term deleterious consequences on follicular growth and development in the adult offspring ovaries, which may impact their reproductive potential. © 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

AB  - In mammals, the 24-hour clock mechanism, or circadian oscillator, is critical for the function and coordination of a broad range of biological processes, from hormone secretion to locomotor activity. This biological timing system is vital for successful reproduction. Animals are more likely to gain mating opportunities if they coordinate their sexual behavior with that of their potential partners. Females benefit from synchronizing the timing of pregnancy to seasons with favorable food and weather conditions, and it is advantageous for an animal to give birth at a time of day when it is most likely to be in a safe place such as a burrow rather than out foraging. A mounting body of evidence indicates that disruptions in normally synchronized, or entrained, biological rhythms are associated with a broad range of pathologies including reproductive dysfunction in females. © 2015 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and may be influenced by a multitude of factors. Pregnancy physiology may predispose to sleep disruption but may also result in worsening of some underlying sleep disorders, and the de novo development of others. Apart from sleep disordered breathing, the impact of sleep disorders on pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes is poorly understood. In this article, we review the literature and discuss available data pertaining to the most common sleep disorders in perinatal women. These include restless legs syndrome, insomnia, circadian pattern disturbances, narcolepsy, and sleep-disordered breathing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The characterization of blood metabolite concentrations over the circadian period and across physiological stages is important for understanding the biological basis of feed efficiency, and may culminate in indirect methods for assessing feed efficiency. Hematological analyses for albumin, urea, creatine kinase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, carbon dioxide, and acetate were carried out in growing and gestating heifers. These measures were carried out in a sample of 36 Bos taurus crossed beef heifers held under the same husbandry conditions. Hourly blood samples were collected over a 24-h period on three separate sampling occasions, corresponding approximately to the yearling (and open), early-gestation and late-gestation stages. This design was used to determine variation throughout the day, effects due to physiological status and any associations with feed efficiency, as measured by residual feed intake. Blood analyte levels varied with time of day, with the most variation occurring between 0800 and 1600 h. There were also considerable differences in analyte levels across the three physiological stages; for example, creatine kinase was higher (P<0.05) in open heifers, followed by early- and late-gestation heifers. Feed efficiency was also associated with analyte abundance. In more feed-efficient open heifers, there were higher activities of creatine kinase (P<0.05) and aspartate aminotransferase (P<0.05), and lower concentrations of carbon dioxide (P<0.05). Furthermore, in late gestation, more efficient heifers had lower urea concentrations (P<0.05) and lower creatine kinase levels (P<0.05). Over the whole experimental period, carbon dioxide concentrations were numerically lower in more feed efficient heifers (P=0.079). Differences were also observed across physiological stages. For instance, open heifers had increased levels (P<0.05) of creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, carbon dioxide than early and late pregnancy heifers. In essence, this study revealed relevant information about the metabolic profile in the context of feed efficiency and physiological stages. Further optimization of our approach, along with the evaluation of complementary analytes, will aid in the development of robust, indirect assessments of feed efficiency. © The Animal Consortium 2014.

AB  - Sleep disturbances, including sleep insufficiency and sleep fragmentation, have been linked to abnormal glucose metabolism and increased diabetes risk. Well-controlled laboratory studies have provided insights regarding the underlying mechanisms. Several large prospective studies suggest that these sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. Whether glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea remains controversial. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy and their relationship to gestational diabetes and hyperglycemia have received considerable attention owing to potential adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, evidence from animal models has identified disruption of the circadian system as a putative risk factor for adverse metabolic outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current state of knowledge linking sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and glucose metabolism. Experimental, prospective, and interventional studies are discussed. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The mechanism of synchronizing uterine contractions is not fully understood. We present a case of twin pregnancy in a uterus didelphys and objectively analyze the synchrony of bilateral uterine contractions. A 32-year-old woman, with a history of vaginal septal resection during her previous vaginal delivery, became pregnant with twins in a uterus didelphys in which each uterine horn had one fetus. At 37 weeks and 6 days, the first baby was delivered vaginally. The second baby was delivered by cesarean section due to recurrent late decelerations. Operative findings confirmed the didelphys uterus. We retrospectively reviewed the timing of contractions of both uteruses. The timing was determined by visual analysis as synchronous if both uteruses contracted within 5 s. Otherwise, contractions were considered solitary. Both uterine horns contracted independently in 90% of the incidence throughout labor and delivery. From this rare case of an 'experiment by nature', we speculated that the myometrium must be histologically connected in order to synchronize uterine contractions. © 2013 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - Background: Pregnant women with complications including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These pathologies are aggravated by sympathetic nervous system activation and may be related to stress. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of and changes in sleep quality and stress in pregnant women with PIH and GDM during the second and third trimesters. Methods: We enrolled 56 women in their second or third trimesters who were diagnosed with PIH or GDM. Participants completed questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SlgA) concentrations were measured as a biological indicator of stress. Results: PSS scores and subjective stress parameters were significantly higher than those reported from previous studies of healthy pregnant women (15.2 points and 15.1 points for the second and third trimesters, respectively).Mean one-day values for SIgA were 168.3 and 205.7. μg/mL for the second and third trimesters, respectively. During the second and third trimesters, SIgA scores were higher than those reported for healthy pregnant women in previous studies. The PSQI component scores sleep disturbance (C5) and sleep duration (C3) in follow up case were significantly higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester. Discussion: This investigation suggests that pregnant women with PIH and GDM experience higher stress levels than do non-pregnant women and healthy pregnant women. Further, our results indicate that sleep quality worsens during the third trimester compared with the second trimester. © 2014 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - With the aim of comparing the circadian characteristics of blood pressure (BP) in normotensive pregnant women and preeclampsia, a total of 35 pregnant women with gestational age more than 20 weeks (age: 18-40 years) were recruited from the patients admitted in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Queen Mary's Hospital, King George's Medical University, Lucknow. In these patients, systolic (S) BP was 140 mmHg or above and diastolic (D) BP was 90 mmHg or above on 2 consecutive occasions, with measurements taken 6 hours apart. Thirty five agematched pregnant women were diagnosed as 'normotensive', when their casual BP was always below 140/90 mmHg on at least 3 different occasions were included as Controls. We analyzed BP records obtained by ABPM (TM-2430 monitors from the A&D Company, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days, observing all the required precautions and after getting their informed consent and proper counseling. Compared with normotensive pregnancies, a statistically significant elevation of the circadian rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR, a rhythmadjusted average value) of BP was observed in preeclampsia (p<0.001 for both SBP and DBP). © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Background: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during 24 hours shows a blood pressure variability. The prevalence of chronic hyperten sion in pregnant women is 1-5%, so it is important to know the changes in blood pressure and cardiovascular risk and prevent complications to the mother and fetus.
Objetive: To know the circadian rhythm of the blood pressure in the chronic hypertensive pregnant patients, through the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
Material and methods: A cross-sectional and descriptive study included chronic hypertensive pregnant patients, with > 20 weeks of gestation. Assessment of factors related to gynaecologic characteristics, according to the inclusion criteria underwent a washout period of two weeks and they were monitored with a Spacelabs 90207 monitor blood pressure. Quantitative variables by Student t test, one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation were analysed.
Results: 16 chronic hypertensive pregnant patients were included, whose ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the systolic blood pressure in 24 hours averaged 117.12 ± 5.85 mmHg; 24 hours diastolic blood pressure 71.31 ± 5.89 mmHg; daytime systolic blood pressure 120.18 ± 5.75 mmHg, nocturnal systolic blood pressure 110.31 ± 8.41 mmHg; daytime diastolic blood pressure 75.43 ± 7.32 mmHg, nocturnal diastolic blood pressure 64.25 ± 8.27 mmHg. Significant differences between daytime and night time were found.
Conclusion: 56% of chronic hypertensive pregnant patients had no nocturnal reduction in systolic blood pressure and 43.75% had no nocturnal changes on diastolic blood pressure. The fact that 50% of patients were non-dippers force us to use long-action antihypertensive therapy and obtain control of the blood pressure for 24 hours. © 2014, Asociacion Mexicana de Ginecologia y Obstetricia.

AB  - Objective To identify modifiable risk factors for miscarriage and to estimate the preventable proportion of miscarriages that could be attributed to these. Design Nationwide observational follow-up study. Setting Denmark. Population Ninety-one thousand four hundred and twenty seven pregnancies included in the Danish National Birth Cohort between 1996 and 2002. Methods Information on potentially modifiable risk factors before and during pregnancy was collected by means of computer-assisted telephone interviews and linkage with Danish registers, ensuring almost complete follow-up of pregnancy outcome. Modifiable risk factors for miscarriage were identified by multiple Cox regression analysis, which provided the background for our estimations of population attributable fractions. In all, 88 373 pregnancies had full information on all covariates and were included in this analysis. Main outcome measures Miscarriage before 22 completed weeks of gestation. Results The potentially modifiable pre-pregnant risk factors associated with increased miscarriage risk were: age of 30 years or more at conception, underweight, and obesity. During pregnancy the modifiable risk factors were: alcohol consumption, lifting of >20 kg daily, and night work. We estimated that 25.2% of the miscarriages might be prevented by reduction of all these risk factors to low risk levels. Modification of risk factors acting before and during pregnancy could lead to prevention of 14.7 and 12.5%, respectively, of the miscarriages. Maternal age at conception and alcohol consumption were the most important risk factors. Conclusions Miscarriage risk is increased by multiple potentially modifiable risk factors and a considerable proportion of miscarriages may be preventable. © 2014 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

AB  - The first urine in the morning (total 15 samples) and whole day urine (total 4 days, 17 samples) were collected from a young healthy woman during the pregnancy and lactation period, to examine the possible interactions of urine components (methanol extracts) with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). The interaction was evaluated by measuring the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine123, a P-gp substrate, in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, or calcein, an MRP substrate, in Caco-2 cells in the absence and presence of urine components. Four first urine samples out of 12 collected before childbirth and one sample out of three collected after childbirth suppressed P-gp function significantly. The effect of pregnancy and lactation on P-gp inhibitory potencies of urine components was not observed. The whole day urine samples showed a clear circadian rhythm, in which three first urine samples in the morning out of four showed greater P-gp inhibitory potencies than other daytime samples. Interaction of urine components with MRPs was not detected. In conclusion, the concentration of endogenous P-gp inhibitor(s) was higher in the first urine in the morning, showing a clear circadian rhythm. Normal pregnancy and lactation appeared not to significantly affect the P-gp inhibitory potencies of urine components.

AB  - In recent years, the negative impact of oxidative stress on fertility has become widely recognised. Several studies have demonstrated its negative effect on the number and quality of retrieved oocytes and embryos following in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Melatonin, a pineal hormone that regulates circadian rhythms, has also been shown to exhibit unique oxygen scavenging abilities. Some studies have suggested a role for melatonin in gamete biology. Clinical studies also suggest that melatonin supplementation in IVF may lead to better pregnancy rates. Here we present a critical review and summary of the current literature and provide suggestions for future well designed clinical trials. © 2014 Fernando and Rombauts.

AB  - Over the past two decades, it has become clear just how much of our physiology is under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the cell-intrinsic molecular clock that ticks with a periodicity of approximately 24 h. The SCN prepares our digestive system for meals, our adrenal axis for the stress of waking up in the morning, and the genes expressed in our muscles when we prepare to exercise. Long before molecular studies of genes such as Clock, Bmal1, and the Per homologs were possible, it was obvious that female reproductive function was under strict circadian control at every level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and in the establishment and successful maintenance of pregnancy. This review highlights our current understanding of the role that the SCN plays in regulating female reproductive physiology, with a special emphasis on the advances made possible through the use of circadian mutant mice. © 2014 Miller and Takahashi.

AB  - Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is secreted during the dark hours at night by the pineal gland. After entering the circulation, melatonin acts as an endocrine factor and a chemical messenger of light and darkness. It regulates a variety of important central and peripheral actions related to circadian rhythms and reproduction. It also affects the brain, immune, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, bone and endocrine functions and acts as an oncostatic and anti-aging molecule. Many of melatonin's actions are mediated through interactions with specific membrane-bound receptors expressed not only in the central nervous system, but also in peripheral tissues. Melatonin also acts through non-receptor-mediated mechanisms, for example serving as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. At both physiological and pharmacological concentrations, melatonin attenuates and counteracts oxidative stress and regulates cellular metabolism. Growing scientific evidence of reproductive physiology supports the role of melatonin in human reproduction. This review was conducted to investigate the effects of melatonin on female reproduction and to summarize our findings in this field. © 2013 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - Circadian variation in biological rhythms has been identified as affecting both labour pain and the pharmacological properties of analgesics. In the context of pain, there is also a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of adult attachment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether labour pain, analgesic consumption and pharmacological effect are significantly affected by the time of day and to analyse whether this circadian variation is influenced by women's attachment style. This prospective observational study included a sample of 81 pregnant women receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Attachment was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale-Revised. The perceived intensity of labour pain in the early stage of labour (3cm of cervical dilatation and before the administration of PCEA) was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain was also indirectly assessed by measuring the consumption of anaesthetics. The latency period and the duration of effect were recorded for a chronopharmacology characterisation. Pain, as assessed with the VAS, was significantly higher in the night-time group than in the daytime group. An insecure attachment style was significantly associated with greater labour pain at 3cm of cervical dilatation (p<0.001) and before the beginning of analgesia (p<0.001) as well as with higher analgesic consumption and lower pharmacological efficacy (p<0.05). The time of day was significantly associated with the pharmacological effect: the latency period was longer at night, and the duration of the pharmacological effect was longer during the daytime. The interaction between time of day and attachment style was not significant for any of the study variables. Our results provide evidence of the importance of circadian variation in studying labour pain and the pharmacological effect of labour analgesia involving epidural blockage with a PCEA regimen. Moreover, although there was no evidence that attachment style influenced the circadian variation, these data emphasise that insecure attachment patterns are a risk factor for greater labour pain and analgesic consumption, which should be considered in pain management approaches. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the effects of night work on the major stages of women's reproductive health, specifically the menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Current understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause. Methods: A systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies written in English using the key words "shift-work" and "female/women." Findings of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual cycles, and menopause. Results: Twenty articles were identified, (13 articles concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work exposure. Discussion: Evidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover, available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work. © 2013 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - The timing and pattern of mammalian behavioral activities are regulated by an evolutionary optimized interplay of the genetically based biological (circadian) clock located in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei and direct responses to environmental factors that superimpose and thus mask the clock-mediated effects, the most important of which is the photically induced phase-setting (synchronization) of the circadian rhythmicity to the 24-hour solar day. In wild and captive animals living under the natural conditions prevailing in their habitat, to date, only a few attempts have been made to analyze the role of these two regulatory mechanisms in the species' adaptation to the time structure prevailing in their habitat. We studied the impact of housing conditions and season on the daily timing and pattern of activity in Mexican spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). To this end, we carried out long-term activity recordings with Actiwatch® AW4 accelerometer/data-logger devices in 11 adult Ateles living under identical natural lighting and climatic conditions in either a large wire netting cage or a 0.25ha forest enclosure in the primatological field station of Veracruz State University near Catemaco, Mexico. In a gravid female in the forest enclosure, we obtained first-hand information on the effect of late pregnancy and parturition on the monkey's activity rhythm. The Ateles behaved strictly diurnal and undertook about 90% of daily total activity during this activity time. Due to a higher second activity peak in late afternoon, the bimodal activity pattern was more pronounced in monkeys living in the forest enclosure. Although the spider monkeys kept there had an earlier activity onset and morning activity peak than their conspecifics in the cage, no consistent differences were found in the parameters characterizing the phase-setting of the circadian system to the environmental 24-h periodicity, either by comparison or correlation with the external time markers of sunrise (SR) and sunset (SS). The most obvious effect of late pregnancy, parturition and lactation was a distinct reduction of the activity level during the week of parturition and the next. Seasonal variations in the form of significant differences between the long-day summer half year and the short-day winter half year were established in the phase-Angle differences of the morning activity peak to SR, in the evening activity peak and activity offset to SS, as well as in the activity time and the peak-to-peak interval, but not in the phase position of activity onset to SR or in the height of the morning and evening activity peak. These findings in combination with a high variability of the phase angle differences indicate that in A. geoffroyi, a relatively weak circadian component and strong masking direct effects of environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the daily activity rhythm. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Although progesterone is most commonly regarded in terms of its role in the female estrous cycle, reproductive behavior, and pregnancy, progesterone is also a precursor to corticosterone (CORT) and is released from the adrenal glands of both sexes in response to stress. However, the relationship between plasma CORT and progesterone during times of stress has not been well established. To better characterize dynamic changes in progesterone release as a result of stressor exposure, plasma progesterone levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay under multiple conditions, including after stress exposure (footshock, restraint, and forced swim), manipulations of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (injection of metyrapone or dexamethasone, or adrenalectomy), and in response to CRH and ACTH injections. When plasma levels of ACTH, CORT, and progesterone were analyzed across studies, CORT and progesterone were found to be highly correlated and rarely dissociated. Additionally, it appears that in male rats, the adrenal glands are the principle source of circulating progesterone in response to stress. Interestingly, a detailed time course indicated lack of a circadian rhythm of progesterone secretion, despite a robust rhythm of circulating CORT. The current studies provide critical new information on the coincident release of progesterone and CORT in response to stress and their somewhat paradoxical dissociation across the circadian rhythm. These findings provide an important foundation for future studies that will examine the role of stress-induced progesterone in behavioral, neuroimmune, and neuroendocrine responses to stress.

AB  - We investigated main and interactive effects of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and gestational weight gain on circadian cortisol from the second to third trimester. A diverse sample of 215 pregnant women was enrolled. Maternal height and most recent pre-pregnancy weight were collected at study initiation (22% obese). Weight and circadian salivary cortisol samples were measured during second (24 ± 4) and third (35 ± 1 weeks) trimesters. During the third trimester, women who were obese prior to conception showed elevated evening cortisol versus normal weight women. This pattern was moderated by weight gain in excess of Institute of Medicine guidelines, such that women who were obese prior to conception and gained greater than 7.94 kg by the 35 ± 1 week visit displayed greatest elevations in evening cortisol. Given links between excessive prenatal glucocorticoid exposure and both poor maternal and offspring health outcomes, elevated maternal cortisol may be one mechanism underlying links between maternal obesity and adverse perinatal outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This review aims to discuss how endogenous and exogenous testosterone exposures in men and estrogens/progesterone exposures in women interact with sleep regulation. In young men, testosterone secretion peaks during sleep and is linked to sleep architecture. Animal and human studies support the notion that sleep loss suppresses testosterone secretion. Testosterone levels decline slowly throughout the aging process, but relatively few studies investigate its impact on age-related sleep modifications. Results suggest that poorer sleep quality is associated with lower testosterone concentrations and that sleep loss may have a more prominent effect on testosterone levels in older individuals. In women, sex steroid levels are characterized by a marked monthly cycle and reproductive milestones such as pregnancy and menopause. Animal models indicate that estrogens and progesterone influence sleep. Most studies do not show any clear effects of the menstrual cycle on sleep, but sample sizes are too low, and research designs often inhibit definitive conclusions. The effects of hormonal contraceptives on sleep are currently unknown. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased sleep disturbances, but their relation to the hormonal milieu still needs to be determined. Finally, studies suggest that menopausal transition and the hormonal changes associated with it are linked to lower subjective sleep quality, but results concerning objective sleep measures are less conclusive. More research is necessary to unravel the effects of vasomotor symptoms on sleep. Hormone therapy seems to induce positive effects on sleep, but key concerns are still unresolved, including the long-term effects and efficacy of different hormonal regimens. © 2014.

Methods and results: We prospectively studied a cohort of 60 women during the third trimester of pregnancy; of them, 28 suffered pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia and 32 had uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. Subsequently, 42 of these were re-examined 3 months after delivery. In women with a hypertensive disorder, the nocturnal fall in blood pressure (dipping) was significantly smaller than in the normotensive group (systolic, P = 0·031; diastolic, P<0·001), but after pregnancy, this difference disappeared (systolic, P = 0·941; diastolic, P = 0·907). Ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) assessed after pregnancy correlated inversely with fasting glucose level during pregnancy (r = -0·580, P = 0·018), both systolic (r = -0·651, P = 0·012) and diastolic (r = -0·687, P = 0·007) nocturnal dipping and total cholesterol concentration after pregnancy (r = -0·526, P = 0·036). Conclusions: A hypertensive disorder during pregnancy was associated with a flattened circadian blood pressure response, which was restored after delivery. Higher arterial stiffness predicted the signs of postpartum metabolic syndrome and correlated also with non-dipping, especially postpartum. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: While research has shown that maternal mood (depression and/or anxiety) can have effects on the fetus, little is known about whether maternal positive and negative affect influences the fetus. Method: We examined fetal vascular and heart rate changes at 36 weeks gestation in 53 euthymic mothers according to their Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) scores. Results: Mothers who reported high levels of negative affect showed reduced uterine artery flow, decreased fetal heart rate (fHR) variability, an altered diurnal pattern, and decreased uterine artery cross-sectional area compared to mothers who reported low levels of negative affect. Mothers with low positive affect had a steeper diurnal pattern in fHR accelerations and decreased uterine artery mean velocity flow than mothers with high positive affect. Limitations: Our observational study suffers from a small sample size. Conclusion: Even in the absence of an Axis I Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), variations in maternal affect appear to be associated with variations in fetal and uterine physiology. © 2014 Mediafarm Group.

AB  - Amplitude integrated electroencephalogaphy (aEEG) is becoming an important tool for the assessment of cerebral activity in preterm newborns. Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological lesion/death. Preterm newbornswith a birth weight ≤1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and bandwidth (BW). Key outcomeswere severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV III/IHP, a lowvoltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological lesion/death. Absent SWCs during the first 72 h were also related to death. Conclusion: Early aEEG patterns can be predictive of neurological outcome in the preterm newborn. Low-voltage tracing and absence of SWCs are associated with severe neurological lesions/death. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

AB  - Depression during pregnancy and in the post partum period is a significant health issue in modern society. The estimated prevalence of depression in pregnancy ranges from 13-20%. The major dilemma for gynecologists is to treat or not to treat depression during gestation and lactation. Consequences of untreated depression can be so serious that the benefit of antidepressant therapy may overweigh the possible risk for injury of fetal/neonatal development. Currently, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used for treatment of maternal depression. The review article brings up-to-date knowledge on effects of maternal adversity (depression) and/or antidepressants on the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis of the offspring in relation to postnatal behavior and reactivity to stressful stimuli. Treated as well as untreated maternal depression presents a risk for the developing fetus and neonate. The authors stress the need to evaluate the relative safety of SNRIs/SNRIs by means of relevant experimental models to assess if these drugs can be assigned to treat pregnant and lactating depressive women. © 2014 Neuroendocrinology Letters.

AB  - Information on the associations between objectively measured sleep and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in early adolescence is scarce. We examined associations between average sleep duration and quality (sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset) over 8 days with actigraphs and (1) diurnal cortisol patterns and (2) cortisol reactivity to a low-dose (3. μg/kg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in a birth cohort born in 1998 (N = 265 participants, mean age 12.3 years, SD = 0.5). We also explored (3) if sleep duration and quality were affected the nights after the DST exposure. Cortisol was measured during 2 days, and participants were exposed to dexamethasone in the evening of first day. In boys, short sleep duration was associated with higher cortisol upon awakening and lower cortisol awakening response (CAR; P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Long sleep duration in boys associated with higher CAR (P < 0.02). Lower sleep quality in boys associated with lower CAR, but fell slightly short of significance (P < 0.06). In girls, no significant associations were detected. Sleep quantity and quality were not associated with responses to the DST. There were no effects of DST on sleep (P > 0.15 in between-subject analyses). The average sleep patterns showed associations with diurnal cortisol patterns during early adolescence, but only in boys. Sleep was not associated with cortisol reactivity to DST and the exogenous corticosteroid exposure did not affect sleep significantly. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aims: Fetal behavioral states can be distinguished by biomagnetic recordings. We performed a longitudinal and a cross-sectional study to address the question whether the distribution of fetal behavioral states changes during the daytime. Methods: For the longitudinal study, 32 magnetocardiographic recordings were performed on a singleton pregnancy on a weekly basis. On each examination day, two recordings were performed at different times between 25 and 40 weeks of gestation. For the cross-sectional study, fetal magnetocardiograms (fMCG) were recorded in a group of 32 singleton pregnancies matched for gestational age and daytime to the longitudinal study. The recordings were separated into two gestational age groups (less and more than 32 weeks). Fetal behavioral states were extracted from actocardiograms generated from MCG. Results: No significant differences in fetal behavioral state distribution were found between morning and afternoon recordings in either the longitudinal or the cross-sectional study. Conclusion: This is the first magnetographic approach to show that daytime does not influence the distribution of fetal behavioral states in standardized recordings of 30 min length. This result implies that fetal magnetography recordings at normal daytimes can be combined without a bias and future recordings can be conducted independently of daytime as long as the varying behavioral states are generally taken into account during analysis.

AB  - Of the problems that complicate child-bearing, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), or severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is likely one of the most painful with unrelenting retching and vomiting that can lead to measurable injuries such as Mallory-Weiss Syndrome and esophageal rupture, and/or subtle maternal cognitive impairments related to starvation and dehydration. Recognized hallmarks of HG include dehydration, ketonuria, weight loss over 5%, and electrolyte abnormalities not attributable to other causes.Historically providers regarded the hyperemetic as a difficult to treat patient with potentially underlying psychological problems. Sick patients who experience pain and suffering present challenges to care, not excepting NVP. Ill patients can be demanding and agitated. Agitation can be one of the early signs of delirium or altered mental status (AMS). AMS can include previously diagnosed psychiatric conditions as well as new onset of Wernicke's encephalopathy, deliria, insomnia, hallucinations and autoscopy, resulting from various etiologies including and not limited to medications, pain including pain from hunger, vomiting and retching, constipation, dehydration, altered electrolytes, hypoglycemia, malnutrition and sleep deprivation.AMS may have a subtle waxing and waning trajectory, making the condition difficult to diagnosis in early stages. What have not been well elucidated in AMS are subjective images and/or experiences. Whether all AMS experiences are similar is unknown. We believe there may be a transient alteration of cognitive status or "altered sensorium gestosis" (ASG), attributed to the direct insults of hyperemesis gravidarum which will be discussed herein. How prevalent ASG might be is unknown and needs further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Non-dipping circadian blood pressure (BP) is a common finding in preeclampsia, accompanied by adverse outcomes. Melatonin plays pivotal role in biological circadian rhythms. This study investigated the relationship between melatonin secretion and circadian BP rhythm in preeclampsia. Cases were women with preeclampsia treated between January 2006 and June 2007 in the University Hospital of Larissa. Volunteers with normal pregnancy, matched for chronological and gestational age, served as controls. Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP monitoring was applied. Serum melatonin and urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were determined in day and night time samples by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Measurements were repeated 2 months after delivery. Thirty-one women with preeclampsia and 20 controls were included. Twenty-one of the 31 women with preeclampsia were non-dippers. Compared to normal pregnancy, in preeclampsia there were significantly lower night time melatonin (48.4±24.7 vs. 85.4±26.9pg/mL, p<0.001) levels. Adjustment for circadian BP rhythm status ascribed this finding exclusively to non-dippers (p<0.01). Two months after delivery, in 11 of the 21 non-dippers both circadian BP and melatonin secretion rhythm reappeared. In contrast, in cases with retained non-dipping status (n=10) melatonin secretion rhythm remained impaired: daytime versus night time melatonin (33.5±13.0 vs. 28.0±13.8pg/mL, p=0.386). Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were, overall, similar to serum melatonin. Circadian BP and melatonin secretion rhythm follow parallel course in preeclampsia, both during pregnancy and, at least 2 months after delivery. Our findings may be not sufficient to implicate a putative therapeutic effect of melatonin, however, they clearly emphasize that its involvement in the pathogenesis of a non-dipping BP in preeclampsia needs intensive further investigation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women in all countries. A history of pre-eclampsia, one of the most deadly hypertensive complicationsofpregnancy, increases cardiovascular riskbytwotofour times, whichiscomparablewith the risk inducedbysmoking. Substantial epidemiological data reveal that pregnancy-related hypertensive complications are associated with a predisposition to chronic hypertension, premature heart attacks, strokes, and renal complications. Inthis review, we summarize clinical studies that demonstrate this relationship and also discuss the pathogenesis of these long-term complications of pre-eclampsia. Future studies should focus on strategies to prevent the progression of cardiovascular disease in women exposed to pre-eclampsia, thereby improving long-term cardiovascular health in women. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Background/Objective:To evaluate the relation between docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status and neurodevelopment in the offsprings of gestational diabetic mothers (ODMs).Subjects/Methods:A prospective cohort study was performed. The offspring of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 19 insulin-treated GDM) were recruited. Maternal and venous cord plasma DHA percentages were analyzed. Skin temperature and activity in children were recorded for 72 h at 3 and 6 months of life. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development II (BSID II) at 6 and 12 months of age.Results:Cord plasma DHA percentage was significantly lower in the ODMs compared with that in the controls (Control 6.43 5.04-7.82 a; GDM+diet 5.65 4.44-6.86 ab; GDM+insulin 5.53 4.45-6.61 b). Both mental (Control 102.71 97.61-107.81 a; GDM+diet 100.39 91.43-109.35 a; GDM+insulin 93.94 88.31-99.57 b) and psychomotor (Control 91.52 81.82-101.22 a; GDM+diet 81.67 73.95-89.39 b; GDM+insulin 81.89 71.96-91.85 b) scores evaluated by the BSID II were significantly lower at 6 months in ODMs, even after adjusting for confounding factors such as breastfeeding, maternal educational level and gender. Cord plasma DHA percentage correlated with the psychomotor score from BSID II (r=0.27; P=0.049) and with the intra-daily variability in activity (r=-0.24; P=0.043) at 6 months. Maternal DHA was correlated with several sleep rhythm maturation parameters at 6 months.Conclusions:Lower DHA levels in cord plasma of ODMs could affect their neurodevelopment. Maternal DHA status was also associated with higher values in the sleep rhythm maturation parameters of children. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Lead (Pb) exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse maternal, infant, or childhood health outcomes by interfering with hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal-Axis function. We examined relationships between maternal blood or bone Pb concentrations and features of diurnal cortisol profiles in 936 pregnant women from Mexico City. Methods: From 2007-11 we recruited women from hospitals/clinics affiliated with the Mexican Social Security System. Pb was measured in blood (BPb) during the second trimester and in mothers' tibia and patella 1-month postpartum. We characterized maternal HPA-Axis function using 10 timed salivary cortisol measurements collected over 2-days (mean: 19.7, range: 14-35 weeks gestation). We used linear mixed models to examine the relationship between Pb biomarkers and cortisol area under the curve (AUC), awakening response (CAR), and diurnal slope. Results: After adjustment for confounders, women in the highest quintile of BPb concentrations had a reduced CAR (Ratio: -13%; Confidence Interval [CI]: -24, 1, p-value for trend < 0.05) compared to women in the lowest quintile. Tibia/patella Pb concentrations were not associated with CAR, but diurnal cortisol slopes were suggestively flatter among women in the highest patella Pb quantile compared to women in the lowest quantile (Ratio: 14%; CI: -2, 33). BPb and bone Pb concentrations were not associated with cortisol AUC. Conclusions: Concurrent blood Pb levels were associated with cortisol awakening response in these pregnant women and this might explain adverse health outcomes associated with Pb. Further research is needed to confirm these results and determine if other environmental chemicals disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal-Axis function during pregnancy. © 2014 Braun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Iodine is an essential trace mineral, required for the production of thyroid hormone. Iodine deficiency may result in goiter, hypothyroidism, miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, infant and neonatal mortality, and impaired growth. Adequate thyroid hormone is critically important for normal growth and neurodevelopment in fetal life, infancy and childhood. The population iodine status is most commonly assessed using median urinary iodine concentration values, but goiter prevalence (determined by palpation or by ultrasound), serum thyroglobulin levels, and neonatal thyroid-stimulating hormone values can also be used. Universal salt iodization programs have been the mainstay of public health efforts to eliminate iodine deficiency worldwide. However, in some regions targeted fortification of foods such as bread has been used to combat iodine deficiency. Iodine supplementation may be required in areas where dietary fortification is not feasible or where it is not sufficient for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women. Although international public health efforts over the past several decades have been highly effective, nearly one third of children worldwide remain at risk for iodine deficiency, and iodine deficiency is considered the leading preventable cause of preventable intellectual deficits. © 2014 S.

AB  - The emergence of the interdisciplinary field of salivary bioscience has created opportunity for neonatal researchers to measure multiple components of biological systems non-invasively in oral fluids. The implications are profound and potentially high impact. From a single oral fluid specimen, information can be obtained about a vast array of biological systems (e.g., endocrine, immune, autonomic nervous system) and the genetic polymorphisms related to individual differences in their function. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the art for investigators interested in integrating these unique measurement tools into the current and next generation of research on gonadal steroid exposure during the prenatal and neonatal developmental periods. © 2014 Voegtline and Granger.

AB  - Endocrine-immune system interactions are the basis for predominance of autoimmune diseases in women with differences between the fertile and the postmenopausal periods. B cell-driven diseases reach the maximum incidence rate in the reproductive years, at least in women under the effects of serum estrogens and their metabolites (endocrine synthesis). On the other hand, the prevalent peripheral synthesis of estrogens, especially in advanced ages (intracrine synthesis), through the action of aromatases, modulate the immune/inflammatory response in peripheral tissues similarly in both female and male patients (final common pathway). Interestingly, tissue injury that occurs during chronic immune/inflammatory reaction induces tissue repair and homeostatic responses including cell proliferation, growth factor production and angiogenesis that might facilitate cancer progression. The successful treatment of chronic immune/inflammatory diseases obtained by using medications initially developed for use in oncology, such as antiproliferative drugs, B-cell depleting monoclonal antibodies support the inflammation-cancer link. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Previous studies have found that mothers of very preterm infants often report symptoms of posttraumatic stress, which has been related to cortisol dysregulation. However, the exact nature of this association is not clear and can be different regarding the predominance of some specific symptoms of posttraumatic stress, as suggested by a recent model. The objective of the present study is to assess the association between diurnal salivary cortisol and posttraumatic stress symptoms in mothers of very preterm infants. Seventy-four mothers of very preterm infants were included in the study. Mothers' cortisol regulation and posttraumatic stress symptoms were evaluated 12 months after child theoretical term (40 weeks of gestation). Results showed an association between higher re-experiencing symptoms and flatter cortisol slopes. These results may help to understand differences found in studies assessing the relation between severity of posttraumatic stress and cortisol levels, by supporting the symptoms' theory.

AB  - Objective: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap frequency on maternal glycemic control. Methods: Sixty-three urban, low-income, pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values ≥130. mg/dL. Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9 ± 0.9. h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r= -0.28, P = .03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.1-0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia. Conclusions: Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep findings. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective To test the hypothesis that the diurnal cortisol secretion rhythm of children who as neonates had been hospitalized differs from that of children without a history of neonatal hospital admission and that this rhythm differs between these hospitalized children treated with either continuous morphine infusion or placebo. Study design A follow-up cohort study was performed with 5-year-old children who as neonates participated in a randomized controlled trial of continuous morphine infusion (born 24-42 weeks' gestation), and a control group of healthy term born (≥37 weeks' gestation) children. Five saliva samples over a school day were assayed for cortisol concentrations. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was analyzed with random regression analysis for repeated measurements. Results Compared with the healthy controls, the trial participants had greater cortisol levels (P =.002) after adjustment for sex and socioeconomic status. The administration of morphine did not affect the cortisol concentrations (P =.66) after adjustment for sex, socioeconomic status, and gestational age at birth. Conclusions The finding that former trial participants had greater cortisol levels at 5 years of age supports the concept of long-lasting programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Morphine infusion in the neonatal period did not alter cortisol secretion at 5 years of age. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sodium channels play an important role in action potentials. Moreover, some evidences recently suggested that sodium channels were responsible for murine sinoatrial node pacemaking. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of sodium channels in pacemaking in embryonic cardiomyocytes in early development stage (EDS). Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was employed to record sodium current of murine early embryonic cardiomyocytes. Current clamp technique was used to record the effect of 0.1, 1 and 10 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) on embryonic cardiomyocytes pacemaking. Electrophysiology properties of sodium channels in embryonic cardiomyocytes corresponded to Na<inf>v</inf>1.5, and the IC<inf>50</inf> of TTX was 5.24 μM. TTX at 0.1 μM concentration had no effects on the pacemaking. TTX at 1 μM concentration, however, dramatically slowed the spontaneous beating rate from 73.975 ± 10.478 to 50.268 ± 10.476 cycle/min (P < 0.05), and the maximum upstroke velocity (dV/dt<inf>max</inf>) of phase 4 from 0.074 ± 0.006 to 0.046 ± 0.007 V/s (P < 0.01). Furthermore, 1 μM TTX reduced the dV/dt<inf>max</inf> of phase 0 from 16.405 ± 0.056 to 12.801 ± 0.084 V/s (P < 0.01), and increased the period of phase 4 from 710.342 ± 110.983 to 1320.618 ± 250.483 ms (P < 0.05). TTX at 1 μM also had some effects on the peak of phase 0 decreasing it from 40.621 ± 3.012 to 37.407 ± 2.749 mV (P < 0.05). But TTX at 1 μM had no effects on the period of phase 0. In some cells (9/13), TTX at 10 μM caused complete cessation of spontaneous action potentials. Our results suggested that the main expression subtype of sodium channels was Na<inf>v</inf>1.5 of early embryonic cardiomyocytes. And TTX-resistant sodium channels contributed to the initiation of action potentials of early embryonic cardiomyocytes, while TTX-sensitive sodium channels were not involved in initiation of action potentials. © 2014 by The Chinese Physiological Society and Airiti Press Inc.

AB  - We recently reported that gestational chronodisruption induces fetal growth restriction and marked effects on fetal adrenal physiology. Here, whole-transcriptome profiling was used to test whether gestational chronodisruption modifies gene expression in the fetal heart, potentially altering cardiac development. At day 10 of gestation (E10), pregnant rats were randomized in two groups: constant light (LL) and control 12. h light/12. h dark photoperiod (LD). RNA isolated from E18 heart was subjected to microarray analysis (Affymetrix platform for 28,000 genes). Integrated transcriptional changes were assessed by gene ontology and pathway analysis. Significant differential expression was found for 383 transcripts in LL relative to LD fetal heart (280 up-regulated and 103 down-regulated); with 42 of them displaying a 1.5-fold or greater change in gene expression. Deregulated markers of cardiovascular disease accounted for alteration of diverse gene networks in LL fetal heart, including local steroidogenesis and vascular calcification, as well as cardiac hypertrophy, stenosis and necrosis/cell death. DNA integrity was also overrepresented, including a 2.1-fold increase of Hmga1 mRNA, which encodes for a profuse architectural transcription factor. microRNA analysis revealed up-regulation of miRNAs 218-1 and 501 and concurrent down-regulation of their validated target genes. In addition, persistent down-regulation of Kcnip2 mRNA and hypertrophy of the left ventricle were found in the heart from 90. days-old offspring from LL mothers. The dysregulation of a relevant fraction of the fetal cardiac transcriptome, together with the diversity and complexity of the gene networks altered by gestational chronodisruption, suggest enduring molecular changes which may shape the hypertrophy observed in the left ventricle of adult LL offspring. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The large-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BKCa) is an important regulator of membrane excitability in a wide variety of cells and tissues. In myometrial smooth muscle, activation of BKCa plays essential roles in buffering contractility to maintain uterine quiescence during pregnancy and in the transition to a more contractile state at the onset of labor. Multiple mechanisms of modulation have been described to alter BKCa channel activity, expression, and cellular localization. In the myometrium, BKCa is regulated by alternative splicing, protein targeting to the plasma membrane, compartmentation in membrane microdomains, and posttranslational modifications. In addition, interaction with auxiliary proteins (i.e., β1- and β2- subunits), association with G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, such as those activated by adrenergic and oxytocin receptors, and hormonal regulation provide further mechanisms of variable modulation of BKCa channel function in myometrial smooth muscle. Here, we provide an overview of these mechanisms of BKCa channel modulation and provide a context for them in relation to myometrial function. © 2014 Lorca, Prabagaran and England.

AB  - Sika deer (Cervus nippon) is an endangered species, which has been listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the Appendices of the CITES. In addition, Sika deer is also classified as a Category I key species under the Wild Animal Protection Law in China. Reproductive behaviors of Sichuan sika deer (C. n. sichuanicus), including rutting and copulating, fawning season, circadian rhythms of estrous roar and mounting behavior, etc., were observed and recorded from April to December 2006 and from March to November 2007 in Tiebu Natural Reserve, Zoige County, Sichuan Province, China. The results indicated that Sichuan sika deer was seasonal estrus animal. The behaviors of estrus and copulation were observed from early September to the middle of December, with a higher frequency ((86.99 ± 3.24) %) occurring between October and November. The earliest rutting and mating behaviors occurred at 8 September and the latest in 16 December, covering a period of 90 —100 d (± 6 d, n = 90). There was a low positive correlation between the mating date of female deer and their mating experience (Kendall’s tau-b and Spearman’s rho, 0.3< r <0.5, P <0.05), and the mating date for the adult females were slightly earlier than that for the first breeding ones. The behaviors of estrous roar and mounting in males have noticeable circadian rhythms, in which each have two peak periods (05:00—08:00, 18:00 — 21:00) and several low rhythm at night. U-test showed that the roar frequency and mounting rate were significantly different between daytime and night (P < 0. 01). The roar behaviors in males were high positive related to their mating behaviors (Kendall’s tau-b and Spearman’s rho, 0.8<r<1.0, P<0.05), and there were statistically significant differences in the frequency of circadian roar among dominant males, subordinate males and single males (P<0.01). Hinds fawning took place from the end of April to the end of July, and most frequently ((91.51± 4.96) %) between May and June (P<0.01). The earliest calving happened on 29 April and the latest on 28 July, covering a period of 80 —90 days d (± 5 d, n = 130). There was a low positive correlation between the fawning date of females and their parturition experience (Kendall’s tau-b and Spearman’s rho, 0.3<r<0.5, P<0.05), and the fawning date in adult females was slightly earlier than the first breeding females. Its litter sizes ranged from one to two fawns once, and single and twinning rate were 98.86% (± 6.96%, n = 129) and 1.01% (± 0.07%, n = 1), respectively. Among all behaviors, feeding behavior has a largest proportion, followed by the resting and moving behaviors during pregnancy and lactation. The proportion of feeding behavior during lactation lower than it would be during pregnancy, which is related to the different situation of food resources in the two periods. Food resources were relatively scarce in winter (pregnancy period), and rich in summer (suckling period). © 2014, Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this review is to evaluate different methodology in blood pressure measurements and prediction of preeclampsia in diabetes. Blood pressure evaluation estimates a risk by either pregnancy per se or vasculopathy of the pregnant woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Use of monitors is increasing but relative few monitors are validated for use in pregnancy. The output is evaluated by different methodology, like diurnal variation and analyzing the systolic and diastolic pressure relationship; the latter technique leads to the ambulatory arterial stiffness index. Using the absolute values of blood pressure has the advantage that fewer assumptions are necessary of how blood pressure behaves due to modes of evaluation and biological rhythm. Monitors should be chosen carefully with consideration as the clinical setting, timing, and population influences the outcome. The monitors should be validated for the specific condition they are applied to. Inherent characteristics of diurnal measurements to be considered are reproducibility, consistency, precision, and trend over scale of measurement. Research suggests that consistency and precision depend on the monitor. During pregnancy, the reproducibility and specificity depend on the timing and whether measurements are performed repeatedly. Diabetes mellitus itself seems not to play a major role during pregnancy in the performance of blood pressure measurement. Over- and underestimation of blood pressure are typical for 24-h monitors in highas well as low risk pregnancies. Preeclampsia is associated with urinary albumin excretion rate, reduced night/day ratio, and elevated diurnal blood pressure from first trimester and onwards. However, due to blunting of the diurnal variation, the night/day rhythm provides no better prediction of preeclampsia. Diurnal BP measurement is a precise estimate of blood pressure in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Obviously, well-known risk factors like hypertension, urinary albumin excretion rate, glycemia, and parity must still be considered. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To explore if blood pressure (BP) readings over 24h is a useful addition to uterine artery Doppler to screen for hypertensive disorders. Methods: In a prospective observational study, we invited nulliparous women with abnormal and normal uterine artery Doppler but normal BP at the time of their routine anomaly scan. BP was measured by the woman using automated apparatus at five specified time intervals over 24h at 22-24 weeks. Pregnancy outcome was retrieved from delivery suite records, discharge summaries, and letters to general practitioners if necessary. Logistic regression was used to explore the contribution of uterine artery Doppler and BP measurements towards the development of pre-eclampsia. Results: Data were available from 52 women with abnormal and 48 women with normal uterine artery Doppler. Thirteen women developed hypertension in pregnancy. Significant difference was found in the BP of women who did or did not develop hypertensive disorders. BP recordings showed the diurnal variation. Both uterine artery Doppler mean PI and BP showed significant correlation with future development of hypertension. Conclusions: Women can self-measure BP at home. BP readings show diurnal variation. There are significant differences in BP of women who do and do not develop hypertension later in the pregnancy. Use of home BP monitoring over 24h of the day in mid-pregnancy is unlikely to add to the use of uterine artery Doppler and a one-off BP reading for future development of hypertension in pregnancy. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Aim: to evaluate the qualitative characteristics of a sleep in pregnant women in the 3rd term of the physiological pregnancy by a questionnaire survey. Materials and methods: we have demonstrated questionnaire survey data of 400 pregnant women (mean age 27,5±8,2 years) in the 3rd term of pregnancy. Questioning conducted using the scale PSQI (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment Questionnaire), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (sleepiness questionnaire Epfort's) and screening questionnaire to identify obstructive sleep apnea. Results: we have determined that 78% of pregnant women to complain about sleep disorders, namely obstructive sleep disordered breathing, insomnia, «restless legs» syndrome, and combinations thereof. The frequency of sleep disorders increases as pregnancy progresses. Obstructive sleep disordered breathing increases with 10,12% in the 1st term to 31,7% in the 3rd term, insomnia - from 14,3% in the 1st term to 37,6% in the 3rd term. In pregnancy increases of sleep latency (from 14,3 to 44,9 minutes), and reduced the duration of a sleep (from 8,7 to 7,8 hours). Conclusions: high frequency of sleep disorders in pregnancy requires early pathogenetic prevention of pathological conditions, both in the mother and in the fetus.

AB  - Objectives: Fetal exposure to elevated maternal cortisol can permanently modify hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, and thereby have long-term health impacts. Maternal cortisol steadily increases throughout normal pregnancy, but is abnormally high in preterm deliveries (<37 weeks). Prematurity remains a widespread public health problem, yet little is known about its potential long-term effects on adult HPA function. Here we test the hypothesis that diurnal cortisol profiles measured in young adulthood will vary based upon an individual's preterm status. Methods: Diurnal salivary cortisol profiles, a marker of HPA-axis function, were measured in 1,403 young adults (ages 21-23 years) participating in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, located in Metropolitan Cebu City, Philippines. Results: Males who had been born preterm exhibited lower morning cortisol and non-significantly elevated evening cortisol, resulting in a more adverse, flatter rate of decline across the day. In contrast, there were no significant differences by preterm status in cortisol measured at any time of day in females. Conclusions: These findings point to potential long-term effects of having been born preterm on adult HPA-axis function, and add to evidence from this and other populations for sex differences in the biological and health impacts of prenatal stress exposure.

AB  - The advent of AI has markedly improved the production potential of dairy cows in all systems of production and transformed the dairy industry in many countries. Unfortunately, for many years breeding objectives focused solely on milk production. This resulted in a major decline in genetic merit for fertility traits. In recent years, the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for this decline have started to be unravelled. It is apparent that poor genetic merit for fertility traits is associated with multiple defects across a range of organs and tissues that are antagonistic to achieving satisfactory fertility performance. The principal defects include excessive mobilisation of body condition score, unfavourable metabolic status, delayed resumption of cyclicity, increased incidence of endometritis, dysfunctional oestrus expression and inadequate luteal phase progesterone concentrations. On a positive note, it is possible to identify sires that combine good milk production traits with good fertility traits. Sire genetic merit for daughter fertility traits is improving rapidly in the dairy breeds, including the Holstein. With advances in animal breeding, especially genomic technologies, to identify superior sires, genetic merit for fertility traits can be improved much more quickly than they initially declined. © IETS 2014.

AB  - Visual system development depends on neural activity, driven by intrinsic and light-sensitive mechanisms. Here, we examined the effects on retinal function due to exposure to summer- and winter-like circadian light cycles during development and adulthood. Retinal light responses, visual behaviors, dopamine content, retinal morphology, and gene expression were assessed in mice reared in seasonal photoperiods consisting of light/dark cycles of 8:16, 16:8, and 12:12 h, respectively. Mice exposed to short, winter-like, light cycles showed enduring deficits in photopic retinal light responses and visual contrast sensitivity, but only transient changes were observed for scotopic measures. Dopamine levels were significantly lower in short photoperiod mice, and dopaminergic agonist treatment rescued the photopic light response deficits. Tyrosine hydroxylase and Early Growth Response factor-1 mRNA expression were reduced in short photoperiod retinas. Therefore, seasonal light cycles experienced during retinal development and maturation have lasting influence on retinal and visual function, likely through developmental programming of retinal dopamine. © 2014 the authors.

AB  - Background/Aims: Cortisol plays an important role during pregnancy. It controls maternal glucose metabolism and fetal development. Cortisol metabolism is partially controlled by the 11b-HSD2. This enzyme is expressed in the kidney and human placenta. The activity of the enzyme is partially controlled by functional polymorphisms: the HSD11B2[CA]n microsatellite polymorphism. The impact of this functional gene polymorphism on cortisol metabolism and potential effects on the newborn's is unknown so far. Methods: In the current prospective birth cohort study in southern Asia, we analyzed the association of the HSD11B2[CA]n microsatellite polymorphisms in 187 mothers and their newborn's on maternal and newborn's serum cortisol concentrations. Results: Using multivariable regression analyses considering known confounding (gestational age, newborn's gender, the labor uterine contraction states and the timing during the day of blood taking), we showed that the fetal HSD11B2[CA]n microsatellite polymorphisms in the first intron was related to maternal cortisol concentration (R2=0.26, B=96.27, p=0.007), whereas as the newborn's cortisol concentrations were independent of fetal and maternal HSD11B2[CA]n microsatellite polymorphism. Conclusions: Our study showed for the first time that the fetal HSD11B2[CA]n microsatellite polymorphism of the HSD11B2 gene in healthy uncomplicated human pregnancy is associated with maternal cortisol concentration. This indicates that fetal genes controlling cortisol metabolism may affect maternal cortisol concentration and hence physiology in healthy pregnant women. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: In 2003, following a workshop at the National Institutes of Health, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) developed updated diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED). These criteria were integral to major advances in research, notably in epidemiology, biology, and treatment of RLS/WED. However, extensive review of accumulating literature based on the 2003 NIH/IRLSSG criteria led to efforts to improve the diagnostic criteria further. Methods: The clinical standards workshop, sponsored by the WED Foundation and IRLSSG in 2008, started a four-year process for updating the diagnostic criteria. That process included a rigorous review of research advances and input from clinical experts across multiple disciplines. After broad consensus was attained, the criteria were formally approved by the IRLSSG executive committee and membership. Results: Major changes are: (i) addition of a fifth essential criterion, differential diagnosis, to improve specificity by requiring that RLS/WED symptoms not be confused with similar symptoms from other conditions; (ii) addition of a specifier to delineate clinically significant RLS/WED; (iii) addition of course specifiers to classify RLS/WED as chronic-persistent or intermittent; and (iv) merging of the pediatric with the adult diagnostic criteria. Also discussed are supportive features and clinical aspects that are important in the diagnostic evaluation. Conclusions: The IRLSSG consensus criteria for RLS/WED represent an international, interdisciplinary, and collaborative effort intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Nonadherence with scheduled saliva sampling, as encountered in ambulatory settings, can bias the estimation of salivary cortisol concentrations. This study is the first to estimate if such nonadherence is also associated with biased salivary testosterone concentration estimates. Methods: Using a standard ambulatory saliva-sampling protocol, we instructed pregnant women to collect saliva samples on two consecutive days at awakening, 1100. h, 1500. h, 2000. h, and 2200. h. We estimated testosterone concentrations in the saliva samples and participants' actual sampling times with an electronic medication event-monitoring system. We classified a saliva sample as adherent if it was sampled within a specific time window relative to its scheduled sampling time. We used a mixed-model analysis to distinguish between trait (number of adherent saliva samples per participant) and state (adherence status of a specific sample) adherence. Results: We included 60 pregnant women in this study. Seventy-five percent (448 of 600) of the scheduled samples indicated adherence with the sampling schedule. Participants' trait adherence was associated with their diurnal profiles of salivary testosterone estimates; that is, adherent participants had higher salivary testosterone estimates compared with nonadherent participants, F(1,58)=5.41, p=0.023, Cohen's d=0.67. The state adherence of a sample was associated with the salivary testosterone estimate of the related sample, F(1,469)=4.48, p=0.035, Cohen's d=0.20, with delayed sampling associated with lower salivary testosterone estimates. Conclusions: The results suggest that common ambulatory nonadherence with scheduled saliva sampling is associated with biased salivary testosterone estimates. They will inform further studies estimating salivary testosterone with ambulatory saliva-sampling designs and highlight the relevance of strategies to improve or confirm adherence, beyond routinely used instructions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the stability throughout the day of the protein to creatinine ratio (PCR) in spot urine, to demonstrate whether the PCR is a valid alternative for 24-hour protein investigation in pregnant women. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral university centre. Population: Women suspected of having pre-eclampsia, admitted to the Erasmus Medical Centre. Methods: Twenty-four-hour urine collections and simultaneously three single voided 5-ml aliquots were obtained at 8 a.m., 12 a.m. (noon) and 5 p.m. A PCR was measured in each specimen and compared with the 24-hour protein excretion. Main outcome measures: The 24-hour proteinuria and PCR measured in spontaneous voids. Results: The PCRs correlated strongly with each other and with the 24-hour protein excretion but did show variation throughout the day (mean coefficient of variation 36%; 95% confidence interval 31-40%). The coefficient of variation was unrelated to the degree of 24-hour proteinuria. Receiver operating characteristics curves to discriminate between values below and greater than or equal to the threshold of 0.3 g protein per 24-hour had an area under the curve of respectively 0.94 (8 a.m.), 0.96 (noon) and 0.97 (5 p.m.). Sensitivities at 8 a.m., noon and 5 p.m. were respectively 89%, 96% and 94%; specificities were 75%, 78% and 78% with the proposed PCR cut-off of 30 mg/mmol (0.26 g/g) (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines).There is no evidence of a difference between the three measurement times regarding the sensitivities and specificities. Conclusion: The PCR determined in spot urine varies throughout the day but is a valid alternative for 24-hour urine collections in pregnant women. It is especially useful to rapidly identify clinically relevant proteinuria. © 2014 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women. Design: Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants: One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10-20 weeks gestation. Methods: Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. Results: On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality (M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (β =-.18, p < 0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (β = -.18, p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment. Conclusions: Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider. © 2014 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

AB  - Gestational exposures to estrogenic compounds, both endogenous hormones and exogenous endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), have long-term effects on reproductive physiology and behavior. We tested the hypothesis that prenatal treatment of rats with low doses of Aroclor 1221 (A1221), a weakly estrogenic polychlorinated biphenyl mix previously used in industry, or estradiol benzoate (EB), alters development of the hypothalamus in a sexually dimorphic manner and subsequently perturbs reproductive function. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected on embryonic days 16 and 18 with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), A1221 (1 mg/kg), or EB (50 μg/kg). Developmental milestones were monitored, and on postnatal days 15, 30, 45, and 90, 1 male and 1 female per litter were euthanized. Because of their key roles in the mediation of steroid actions on reproductive function, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) were punched for a low-density quantitative PCR array of 48 neuroendocrine genes and analysis of DNA methylation of a subset of genes. Gestational exposure to A1221 or EB delayed the timing of puberty in males and disrupted estrous cyclicity in females. In the AVPV, 28 genes were affected by treatment in a developmental stage-specific manner, mostly in females, which exhibited a masculinized expression profile. This included 2 clock genes, Per2 and Arntl, implicating circadian circuits as being vulnerable to endocrine disruption. DNA methylation analysis of 2 genes, Per2 and Ar, showed no effect of EDCs and suggested alternative mechanisms for the altered mRNA levels. In the ARC, 12 genes were affected by treatment, mostly in males, again with dynamic developmental changes. Bionetwork analysis of relationships among genes, hormones, and physiological markers showed sexually dimorphic effects of estrogenic EDC exposures, with the female AVPV and the male ARC being most vulnerable, and provided novel relationships among hypothalamic genes and postnatal reproductive maturation. © 2014 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Aim The aim of the study was to compare neurodevelopmental outcomes of extremely preterm infants admitted during (OH) and after (AH) office hours. Methods A retrospective review of the New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory Neonatal Intensive Care Units' (NICUs) Data Collection of all infants <29 weeks gestation admitted to New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory NICUs between January 1998 and December 2004 was conducted. The primary outcome was moderate/severe functional disability (FD) at 2-3 years follow-up defined as developmental delay (Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales general quotient or Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II mental developmental index >2 standard deviations below the mean), cerebral palsy (unable to walk without aids), deafness (requiring bilateral hearing aids) or blindness (visual acuity <6/60 in the better eye). Results Mortality and age at follow-up were comparable between the AH and OH groups. Developmental outcome was evaluated in 972 (74.9%) infants admitted during AH and 501 (74.6%) admitted during OH. FD was not significantly different between the AH and OH groups (17.1% vs. 14.8%, adjusted odds ratio 1.131, 95% confidence interval 1.131 (0.839-1.523), P = 0.420). There were no significant differences between AH and OH infants with cerebral palsy (9.6% vs. 7.6%), developmental delay (5.4% vs. 5.0%) or any other component of FD. Conclusion There is little circadian variation in mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in an NICU network with the current model of after hours staffing and support, and sharing of NICU workload within a network. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance has become an important health problem for pregnant women. In fact, pregnancy-associated sleep disorder has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity. We aimed to study the relationship between sleep disturbance and preterm birth during pregnancy in a sample of Iranian women. Methods: In this analytical cohort study, 231 pregnant women in their 28th-32nd gestational week were recruited, using the multistage sampling method, from four healthcare centres in Ardabil, Iran, during 2010. The women were followed-up until 37-week gestation. One hundred and twelve women did not have sleep disturbances while 119 women had sleep disturbances. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and a demographic data questionnaire were used for data collection. Data were analysed using SPSS software. Descriptive statistics, t, Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney tests were used as appropriate. Results: The prevalence of preterm labour was 11.8%in women with sleep disorder compared with 11.6% in women without sleep disorder (p = 0.9). Sleep duration less than eight hours, daytime dysfunction and impaired quality of life as a component of ISI showed a significant relationship with preterm birth (p = 0.02, p = 0.044, and p = 0.047, respectively). Conclusion: Although daily dysfunction and lower quality of life because of sleep problems, and total sleep duration were variables associated with preterm birth, we found no significant relationship between sleep disorder and preterm birth.

AB  - Objective: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies. Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3. ±. 6.9. weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0-82.9%). Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position. Practice implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim: to evaluate the qualitative characteristics of a sleep in pregnant women in the 3rd term of the physiological pregnancy by a questionnaire survey. Materials and methods: we have demonstrated questionnaire survey data of 400 pregnant women (mean age 27,5±8,2 years) in the 3rd term of pregnancy. Questioning conducted using the scale PSQI (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment Questionnaire), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (sleepiness questionnaire Epfort's) and screening questionnaire to identify obstructive sleep apnea. Results: we have determined that 78% of pregnant women to complain about sleep disorders, namely obstructive sleep disordered breathing, insomnia, «restless legs» syndrome, and combinations thereof. The frequency of sleep disorders increases as pregnancy progresses. Obstructive sleep disordered breathing increases with 10,12% in the 1st term to 31,7% in the 3rd term, insomnia - from 14,3% in the 1st term to 37,6% in the 3rd term. In pregnancy increases of sleep latency (from 14,3 to 44,9 minutes), and reduced the duration of a sleep (from 8,7 to 7,8 hours). Conclusions: high frequency of sleep disorders in pregnancy requires early pathogenetic prevention of pathological conditions, both in the mother and in the fetus.

AB  - The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of drugs are dependent on numerous factors that influence their disposition. A dose that is efficacious and safe for one individual may result in sub-therapeutic or toxic blood concentrations in other individuals. A major source of this variability in drug response is drug metabolism, where differences in pre-systemic and systemic biotransformation efficiency result in variable degrees of systemic exposure (e.g., AUC, C <inf>max</inf>, and/or C <inf>min</inf>) following administration of a fixed dose. Interindividual differences in drug biotransformation have been studied extensively. It is well recognized that both intrinsic (such as genetics, age, sex, and disease states) and extrinsic (such as diet, chemical exposures from the environment, and even sunlight) factors play a significant role. For the family of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the most critical of the drug metabolizing enzymes, genetic variation can result in the complete absence or enhanced expression of a functional enzyme. In addition, up- and down-regulation of gene expression, in response to an altered cellular environment, can achieve the same range of metabolic function (phenotype), but often in a less reliably predictable and time-dependent manner. Understanding the mechanistic basis for drug disposition and response variability is essential if we are to move beyond the era of empirical, trial-and-error dose selection and into an age of personalized medicine that brings with it true improvements in health outcomes in the therapeutic treatment of disease. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2014.

AB  - Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a disease characterized by a deficient production or action of glucocorticoids, with or without deficiency in mineralcorticoids and/or adrenal androgens. It can result from disease intrinsic to the adrenal cortex (primary AI), from pituitary diseases that hamper the release of corticotropin (secondary AI) or from hypothalamic disorders that impair the secretion of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (tertiary AI).It is a disease with a low prevalence but its impact on the affected individual is very high as it can be life-threathening if not treated or lead to health problems if inadequately treated. However, currently there are no specific guidelines for the management of this disease. Therefore, at the proposal of the Spanish Society of Endocrinology and Nutrition (SEEN) board, a task-force under the Neuroendocrinology Knowledge Area of the SEEN was established, with the mandate of updating the diagnosis and treatment of AI. In fulfilment of this mandate the task-force has elaborated the present guide that, based on a comprehensive review of literature, is intended to provide an answer to questions related to the management of this disease. It is, therefore, an essentially practical document, mainly aimed at guiding the health professionals involved in the care of IA patients. © 2014 Sociedad Española de Endocrinología y Nutrición.

AB  - The endogenous timing system within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus drives the cyclic expression of the clock molecules across the 24 h day-night cycle controlling downstream molecular pathways and physiological processes. The developing fetal clock system is sensitive to the environment and physiology of the pregnant mother and as such disruption of this system could lead to altered physiology in the offspring. Characterizing the gene profiles of the endogenous molecular clock system by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is dependent on normalization by appropriate housekeeping genes (HKGs). However, many HKGs commonly used as internal controls, although stably expressed under control conditions, can vary significantly in their expression under certain experimental conditions. Here we analyzed the expression of 10 classic HKG across the 24 h light-dark cycle in the SCN of mouse offspring exposed to normal chow or a high fat diet during early development and in postnatal life. We found that the HKGs glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta actin and adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit to be the most stably expressed genes in the SCN regardless of diet or time within the 24 h light-dark cycle, and are therefore suitable to be used as internal controls. However SCN samples collected during the light and dark periods did show differences in expression and as such the timing of collection should be considered when carrying out gene expression studies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Capturing components of the weather that drive environment-animal interactions is a perennial problem in ecology. Identifying biologically significant elements of weather conditions in sensible statistics suitable for analysis of life history variation and population dynamics is central. Meteorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind modulate rates of heat loss in animals, but analysis of their effects on endothermic species is complicated by the fact that their influence on energy balance is not invariably linear, even across the thermoneutral range. Rather, the thermal load imposed by a given set of weather conditions is a function of organisms' metabolic requirement, which, crucially, may vary spontaneously both seasonally and across different life phases. We propose that the endogenous component of variation in metabolic demand introduces a temporal dimension and that, as a consequence, the specific effect of meteorological variables on energy balance and attendant life history parameters is a function of the timing of weather events with respect to the organism's metabolic rhythm(s). To test this, we examined how a spontaneous increase in metabolic demand influenced the effect of weather on early development in a large mammal. Specifically, we examined interaction between the exponential rise in the energy requirements of pregnancy and depth of snow, which restricts dams' access to forage, on the body mass of reindeer calves (Rangifer tarandus) at weaning. As expected, we detected a significant temporal component: the specific negative effect of snow on weaning mass was not constant, but increased across pregnancy. The life history response was therefore better predicted by interaction between the magnitude and the timing of weather events than by their magnitude alone. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the influence of an endogenous metabolic dynamic on the impact of weather on a life history trait in a free-living mammal. Evaluating weather variables with respect to endogenous variation in metabolic demand adds biological realism and is likely to improve understanding of the influence of environmental variation on life history traits in many ecological contexts. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and insomnia frequently characterize sleep in pregnancy during all three trimesters. We aimed: (i) to review the clinical evidence of the association between conditions of sleep loss during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) to discuss the potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may be involved. A systematic search of cross-sectional, longitudinal studies using Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO, and MeSH headings and key words for conditions of sleep loss such as 'insomnia', 'poor sleep quality', 'short sleep duration', and 'pregnancy outcome' was made for papers published between January 1, 1960 and July 2013. Twenty studies met inclusion criteria for sleep loss and pregnancy outcome: seven studies on prenatal depression, three on gestational diabetes, three on hypertension, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, six on length of labor/type of delivery, eight on preterm birth, and three on birth grow/birth weight. Two main results emerged: (i) conditions of chronic sleep loss are related to adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) chronic sleep loss yields a stress-related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and abnormal immune/inflammatory, reaction, which, in turn, influences pregnancy outcome negatively. Chronic sleep loss frequently characterizes sleep throughout the course of pregnancy and may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Common pathophysiological mechanisms emerged as being related to stress system activation. We propose that in accordance to the allostatic load hypothesis, chronic sleep loss during pregnancy may also be regarded as both a result of stress and a physiological stressor per se, leading to stress 'overload'. It may account for adverse pregnancy outcomes and somatic and mental disorders in pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many structures of the mammalian CNS generate propagating waves of electrical activity early in development. These waves are essential to CNS development, mediating a variety of developmental processes, such as axonal outgrowth and pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and the maturation of ion channel and receptor properties. In the mouse cerebral cortex, waves of activity occur between embryonic day 18 and postnatal day 8 and originate in pacemaker circuits in the septal nucleus and the piriform cortex. Here we show that genetic knock-out of the major synthetic enzyme for GABA, GAD67, selectively eliminates the picrotoxin-sensitive fraction of these waves. The waves that remain in the GAD67 knock-out have a much higher probability of propagating into the dorsal neocortex, as do the picrotoxin-resistant fraction of waves in controls. Field potential recordings at the point of wave initiation reveal different electrical signatures for GABAergic and glutamatergic waves. These data indicate that: (1) there are separate GABAergic and glutamatergic pacemaker circuits within the piriform cortex, each of which can initiate waves of activity; (2) the glutamatergic pacemaker initiates waves that preferentially propagate into the neocortex; and (3) the initial appearance of the glutamatergic pacemaker does not require preceding GABAergic waves. In the absence of GAD67, the electrical activity underlying glutamatergic waves shows greatly increased tendency to burst, indicating that GABAergic inputs inhibit the glutamatergic pacemaker, even at stages when GABAergic pacemaker circuitry can itself initiate waves. © 2014 the authors.

AB  - Objective: To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: 122 pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation. Methods: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals. Results: Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related issues as well as with negative expectations about the future. Conclusions: Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed. © 2014 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

AB  - Objective: The majority of women develop sleep impairments during pregnancy, but alterations in dream experiences remain poorly understood. This study aimed to assess prospectively and comparatively the recall of dreaming and of disturbed dreaming in late pregnancy. Methods: Fifty-seven nulliparous, third-trimester pregnant women (mean age. ±. SD, 28.7. ±. 4.06. years) and 59 non-pregnant controls (mean age. ±. SD, 26.8. ±. 4.21. years) completed demographics and psychological questionnaires. A 14-day prospective home log assessed sleep and dream characteristics and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire measured retrospective dream and disturbed dream recall. Results: Even though pregnant and non-pregnant women showed similar prospective dream recall (P= 0.47), pregnant women reported prospectively more bad dreams (P= 0.004). More pregnant women (21%) than non-pregnant women (7%) reported a nightmare incidence exceeding moderately severe pathology (>1/week) (P= 0.03). Pregnant women also reported overall lower sleep quality (P= 0.007) and more night awakenings (P= 0.003). Higher prospective recall of bad dreams (r= -0.40, P= 0.002) and nightmares (r= -0.32, P= 0.001) both correlated with lower sleep quality in pregnant women. Conclusions: Late pregnancy is a period of markedly increased dysphoric dream imagery that may be a major contributor to impaired sleep at this time. Further polysomnographic assessments of pregnant women are needed to clarify relationships between sleep and disturbed dream production in this population. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Perinatal distress has largely been conceptualised as the experience of depression and/or anxiety. Recent research has shown that the affective state of stress is also present during the perinatal period and thus may add to a broader understanding of perinatal distress. Aim: The aims of the present study were to investigate the changes in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms across pregnancy, and to explore the prospective relationships between these symptoms. Methods: Two-hundred and fourteen pregnant women were recruited when they were less than 16 weeks gestation. Women completed depression, anxiety and stress measures on a monthly basis, from 16 weeks gestation through to 36 weeks gestation. The covariate measures of sleep quality and social support were assessed bi-monthly at 16, 24 and 32 weeks gestation. Findings: Levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were all shown to change over time, with women experiencing fewer symptoms during the middle of their pregnancy. Higher symptoms early in pregnancy predicted higher symptom levels throughout the rest of pregnancy. Higher depression scores early in pregnancy were also shown to predict higher anxiety and higher stress scores in late pregnancy. Increased stress scores during mid pregnancy also predicted higher anxiety scores in late pregnancy. Conclusion: Current findings indicate that symptom levels of depression, anxiety and stress vary over the course of pregnancy. Increased depression in early pregnancy seemed to be particularly pertinent as it not only predicted later depression symptoms, but also increased anxiety and stress in late pregnancy. Collectively, these results further highlight the importance of emotional health screening early in pregnancy. © 2014 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and its associated factors among pregnant women in Japan. Of the 940 randomly selected survey locations identified by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 344 obstetric institutions participated in the survey. The study was conducted on women with confirmed pregnancies who had had a second or subsequent consultation at one of these institutions. The survey items included age, highest educational achievement, trimester of pregnancy, number of pregnancies, employment status, smoking, alcohol consumption, restless sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, sleep duration, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and restless leg syndrome. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to assess the level of excessive daytime sleepiness. We calculated the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and then examined its associated factors using χ2 test and multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness among pregnant women was 6.2%. The results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly higher among younger women and those in an earlier trimester of pregnancy. The odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was also significantly higher for women in their first pregnancy, full-time workers, and current alcohol consumers. Women indicating the presence of sleep-related issues, including restless sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome, reported significantly higher levels of excessive daytime sleepiness. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Objective The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a high-risk cohort. Study Design This was a planned analysis of a prospective cohort designed to estimate the prevalence and trends of SDB in high-risk pregnant women. We recruited women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index of 5 or greater and further grouped into severity categories: mild SDB (5-14.9), moderate SDB (15-29.9), and severe SDB (≤30). Pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, infant weight) were abstracted by physicians blinded to the SDB results. Results Of the 188 women with a valid early pregnancy sleep study, 182 had complete delivery records. There was no relationship demonstrated between SDB exposure in early or late pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age (&lt;5%), or large-for-gestational-age (&gt;95%) neonates. Conversely, SDB severity in early pregnancy was associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes (no SDB, 25%; mild SDB, 43%; moderate/severe SDB, 63%; P =.03). The adjusted odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes for moderate/severe SDB was 3.6 (0.6, 21.8). Conclusion This study suggests a dose-dependent relationship between SDB in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, no relationships between SDB during pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth, and extremes of birthweight were demonstrated.

AB  - To determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in a population of Nigerian women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. A prospective cross-sectional design. Participants' were interviewed at the antenatal clinic with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep during and before pregnancy and to appraise disturbance in their sleep according to the trimester. Two hundred and three pregnant women participated in the survey and were evaluated at one of three points in pregnancy: 1st trimester (n=57), 2nd trimester (n=71) and 3rd trimester (n=75). Overall, the prevalence of sleep disorder in the population surveyed was 35.5% (72/203), more women experienced sleep disturbances in the first (42.1%) and third (40%) trimester of pregnancy compared to the second (25.3%). In terms of types of sleep disorders; 96(47.3%) reported insomnia, 32(15.8%) sleep breathing disorders, 86(42.4%) excessive daytime sleepiness, 172(84.7%) mild sleepiness and 64(31.5%) significant specific awakenings. The most common reason for specific awakening was frequent urination (78.6%). These sleep disorders were more common in the third trimester of pregnancy but only insomnia and specific awakenings showed statistical significance, p=0.007 and 0.031 respectively. Logistic regression model showed that nulliparity, increased BMI and previous adverse obstetric events had significant independent associations with sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are common in pregnancy, notably in the first and third trimesters.

AB  - Background: Retinopathy of prematurity is a serious potentially blinding disease of pre-term infants. There is extensive vascular remodeling and tissue stress, but data concerning alterations in retinal neurons and glia, and long-term functional sequelae are still incomplete. Methods: ROP was induced using the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model. Postnatal day 7 (P7) 129SVE mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75∈±∈0.5 % oxygen) for 5 days, and then returned to normoxia to induce OIR. Exposed animals were euthanized at 5 (P17-OIR) and 14 days (P26-OIR) after return to normal air, together with corresponding age-matched control mice (P17-C and P26-C respectively) raised only in room air. Their retinas were examined by immunohistochemistry using a battery of antibodies against key glial and neuronal proteins. A further group of OIR mice and controls were examined at 10 weeks of age for their ability to re-entrain to changing 12 h light/12 h dark cycles, assayed by wheel-running actimetry. In this protocol, animals were subjected to three successive conditions of 300 lux, 15 lux and 1 lux ambient light intensity coupled with 6 hours of jetlag. Animals were euthanized at 4 months of age and used in immunoblotting for rhodopsin. Results: Compared to P17-C, immunohistochemical staining of P17-OIR sections showed up-regulation of stress-related and glutamate-regulatory proteins in astrocytes and Müller glial cells. In contrast, glial phenotypic expression in P26-OIR retinas largely resembled that in P26-C. There was no loss in total retinal ganglion cells (RGC) at either P17-OIR or P26-OIR compared to corresponding controls, whereas intrinsically photosensitive RGC showed significant decreases, with 375∈±∈13/field in P26-OIR compared to 443∈±∈ 30/field in P26-C (p∈<∈0.05). Wheel actimetry performed on control and OIR-treated mice at 4 months demonstrated that animals raised in hyperoxic conditions had impaired photoentrainment at low illuminance of 1 lux, as well as significantly reduced levels of rhodopsin compared to age-matched controls. Conclusions: OIR leads to transient up-regulation of retinal glial proteins involved in metabolism, and partial degeneration of intrinsically photosensitive RGC and rod photoreceptors. OIR affects circadian photo-entrainment at low illuminance values, possibly by affecting the rod pathway and/or intrinsically photosensitive RGC input to the circadian clock. This study hence shows that retinopathy of prematurity affects light-regulated circadian behavior in an animal model, and may induce similar problems in humans. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objectives To determine the incidence of admission in labor after morphine sleep (therapeutic rest), patient characteristics associated with labor, and adverse outcomes associated with treatment. Methods We reviewed medical records of women treated with morphine sleep from December 2005 to December 2009. Variables evaluated included medications used for treatment, cervical examination, maternal demographic characteristics and obstetric history, fetal heart rate patterns, and maternal/neonatal outcomes. These characteristics were compared between those admitted in labor after morphine sleep versus those discharged. Results Fifty-eight women received morphine sleep: 36 (62%) were admitted in labor, 17 (29%) were discharged, and 5 (9%) were admitted secondary to category II fetal heart rate tracings. All fetuses had category I fetal heart rate tracings prior to treatment. Median dose of morphine sulfate was 20 mg. Those with effacement > 50% (p < 0.01) and carrying term gestations (p < 0.01) were more likely to be admitted in labor after treatment. There were no adverse maternal outcomes. There were no significant differences in neonatal outcomes. Conclusion Sixty-two percent of women were admitted in labor after morphine sleep. Admission effacement > 50% and term gestational age were associated with admission in labor. There were no significant differences in maternal or neonatal morbidity in those admitted versus discharged home after treatment with morphine sleep.©2014 by Thieme Medical.

AB  - Purpose of review: The evidence of a putative causal effect of sleep apnea-induced intermittent hypoxia on the pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is mounting. The present review presents the evidence of current literature and questions whether an early diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Recent findings: Although pathophysiological pathways remain to be more clearly defined, recent studies shed light on the association of sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. For the first time, a recent prospective study revealed that obstructive sleep apnea increases over the course of pregnancy and that it is common during the third trimester. In this study, age and BMI have been identified as independent predictors of gestational obstructive sleep apnea. Summary: An association between sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment during pregnancy on hypertension and preeclampsia. Further studies are required to ascertain whether continuous positive airway pressure can be a useful adjunct treatment for pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: This study examined prospectively whether maternal orientation (Facilitator/Regulator) in pregnancy predicted maternal orientation and mothering practices at six months postpartum. Background: A woman's preferred approach to infant care, present prior to the birth, has been proposed to explain individual differences in mothering behaviour. Method: At 30 weeks gestation, 192 women completed two questionnaire measures assessing maternal orientation. At six months postpartum, maternal orientation and maternal caretaking behaviours were assessed by interview and questionnaire. Results: Bivariate analyses indicated small but significant correlations among measures of antenatal and postnatal maternal orientation. In addition, as predicted, lower Regulator scores in pregnancy were associated with greater likelihood of breastfeeding exclusively, less scheduling of infant feeds and sleeps, and less likelihood of leaving baby to cry to sleep. Associations were found between mother-infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation. Conclusions: Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories. © 2014 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep complaints are commonly reported during pregnancy. Sleep disturbances are typically exacerbated in the first and third trimester because of pregnancy-related anatomic changes and hormonal adaptations. Aim: The aim of this research is to assess the frequency of low sleep quality, daytime sleepiness among pregnant women taking into account different etiological factors. Material and methods. 147 pregnant women from the Perinatology Department of Medical Univeristy of Łódź were interviewed to assess their sleep alterations. Taking medicines and concomitant disorders which can affect low sleep quality were eliminated. 140 women in reproductive age represent the control group. The survey was comprised of demographic part and two tests: PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), ESS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) assessing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness respectively. Statistical analysis was performed by means of Statistica. Results: The survey confirmed sleep disorders amid 90,5% of pregnant women. Comparative analysis between pregnant patients and control group revealed a statistically significant difference in frequency of poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness (p<0,05). Simultaneously the impact of sleep disorders on ESS score was not confirmed (p>0,05). However there is a statistical connection between stress level, trimester of pregnancy and PSQI score. The most often causes of sleep disorders were an inconvenient position during sleep, necessity of going to the toilet at night and intensified stress. Sleep disorders increase in I and III trimester of pregnancy and have a complex etiological background. Conclusions: Received data suggests a tenuous relation between low sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Incorrect scores of test which estimates the sleep quality were much more often observed among pregnant women than in control group (90,5%; 45,7% respectively). © GinPolMedProject.

AB  - Introduction: Physiologic and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase risk of occurrence and severity of sleep breathing disorders in pregnant women. This study was performed with the aim to determine the frequency of sleep breathing disorders and some related factors in pregnant women referred to delivery ward of Alborz social security hospital of Karaj.
Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed on 200 pregnant women referred to the delivery ward of Alborz social security hospital of Karaj in 2009. Background information and Stop Bang questionnaire (for sleep breathing disorders screening) were evaluated through interviews, and information related to neonatal weight and Apgar score were evaluatedfrom medical records, and anthropometric indices of pregnant women were measured with balance scale and tap meter. The data was analyzed by SPSS software (version 18) and Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests. P< 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: 91 cases (54.5%) of pregnant women had habitual snoring, 114 (57%) daily sleepiness and fatigue, 43 (21.5%) sleep apnea, 14 (7%) hypertension, 6 (3%) body mass index > 35 kg/m², and 20 (10%) neck circumference > 40 cm. 29 cases (14.5%) were at high risk for sleep breathing disorders. Statistical significant relationship was found between sleep breathing disorders in pregnant women and increased neck circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased BMI and higher Apgar score and increased birth weight (P<0.001).
Conclusions: Pregnant women are at risk for sleep breathing disorders and sleep breathing disorders are more common in pregnant women with central and general obesity, and higher blood pressure. © 2014, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All Rights reserved.

AB  - Objective The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a high-risk cohort. Study Design This was a planned analysis of a prospective cohort designed to estimate the prevalence and trends of SDB in high-risk pregnant women. We recruited women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index of 5 or greater and further grouped into severity categories: mild SDB (5-14.9), moderate SDB (15-29.9), and severe SDB (≤30). Pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, infant weight) were abstracted by physicians blinded to the SDB results. Results Of the 188 women with a valid early pregnancy sleep study, 182 had complete delivery records. There was no relationship demonstrated between SDB exposure in early or late pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age (&lt;5%), or large-for-gestational-age (&gt;95%) neonates. Conversely, SDB severity in early pregnancy was associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes (no SDB, 25%; mild SDB, 43%; moderate/severe SDB, 63%; P =.03). The adjusted odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes for moderate/severe SDB was 3.6 (0.6, 21.8). Conclusion This study suggests a dose-dependent relationship between SDB in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, no relationships between SDB during pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth, and extremes of birthweight were demonstrated.

AB  - Objective: Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes and less mental well-being. In pregnant women with a mental disorder, who frequently suffer from sleep problems, it is unknown whether predominantly objective or subjective sleep quality is more affected. To clarify this, we compared objective and subjective parameters of sleep quality between patients and healthy controls during pregnancy. Methods: This observational study was embedded in an ongoing study among pregnant women with a mental disorder at the department of Psychiatry of Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We compared 21 pregnant women with a confirmed mental disorder with 33 healthy controls (gestational age, 23-29 weeks). To measure objective parameters of sleep quality, all participants continuously wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days and nights. Subjective sleep quality was retrospectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and on a daily basis with the Subjective Sleep Quality-scale (SSQ). Differences in parameters of sleep between patients and controls were tested using a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for parity, gestational age, educational level, and employment status.Results: Objective parameters of sleep quality and subjective sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Daily sleep reports showed that, relative to controls, patients had a significantly worse average SSQ-score (5.2 vs. 7.6, adjusted β = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.03-0.53, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our exploratory study suggests that perceived sleep quality reported on a daily basis by pregnant women with a mental disorder is worse than the sleep quality as measured by wrist actigraphy.

AB  - Summary: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been used in pregnancy for just over 20 years now and is generally well tolerated. Normal values have been established for different gestations; these are slightly higher than conventional blood pressure (BP) in normal pregnancy, presumably reflecting greater activity during the 24 h of ABPM recordings. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a better predictor than conventional BP for the development of pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, but it is not sensitive or specific enough to be recommended for these purposes in routine practice. Studies of ABPM have shown that sleep hypertension is common in women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia, but detecting this in routine clinical practice does not aid usual decision making in the pregnancy, including timing of delivery. Studies using ABPM have found that pregnant women who are working outside the home have higher BP than non-working women, but these data should not be interpreted to mean that not working during pregnancy will prevent gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. The best role for ABPM is to determine whether women with office hypertension in early pregnancy have true (usually essential) hypertension or white-coat hypertension. The latter can be managed without antihypertensives and pregnancy outcomes appear good, although possibly with a slightly increased incidence of pre-eclampsia. Women who have had pre-eclampsia are at greater life-time risk for cardiovascular diseases; several years postpartum these women have slightly higher ABPM-measured BP than women who had normal pregnancies and a greater propensity to metabolic syndrome. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression (X2 13.39; p&lt;0.001). Berlin-assessed risk of SDB was also associated with probable depression (X2 9.20 p&lt;0.01), though this was attenuated following multivariate analysis. There was a significant relationship between total PSQI score and the tendency for participants to attribute 'sleep-related causes' to their low mood (X 2 20.78; p&lt;0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI). © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Summary: Hypocretin/orexin peptides are known for their role in the control of the wake-sleep cycle and narcolepsy-cataplexy pathophysiology. Recent studies suggested that hypocretin peptides also have a role in pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a retrospective analysis on pregnancy complications in two different mouse models of hypocretin deficiency. We recorded 85 pregnancies of mice lacking either hypocretin peptides (knockout) or hypocretin-releasing neurons (transgenic) and their wild-type controls. Pregnancy was associated with unexplained dam death before delivery in 3/15 pregnancies in knockout mice, and in 3/23 pregnancies in transgenic mice. No casualties occurred in wild-type pregnant dams (P < 0.007 versus hypocretin-deficient mice as a whole). Hypocretin deficiency did not impact either on litter size or the number of weaned pups per litter. These data provide preliminary evidence of a critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy. © 2013 European Sleep Research Society.

AB  - The pathophysiology of diabetes as a disease is characterised by an inability to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. In type 1 diabetes, this is due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cells and subsequent lack of insulin production, and in type 2 diabetes it is due to a combination of both insulin resistance and an inability of the β-cells to compensate adequately with increased insulin release. Animal models, in particular genetically modified mice, are increasingly being used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and as such the ability to study glucose homeostasis in vivo has become an essential tool. Several techniques exist for measuring different aspects of glucose tolerance and each of these methods has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Thus the appropriate methodology may vary from study to study depending on the desired end-points, the animal model, and other practical considerations. This review outlines the most commonly used techniques for assessing glucose tolerance in rodents and details the factors that should be taken into account in their use. Representative scenarios illustrating some of the practical considerations of designing in vivo experiments for the measurement of glucose homeostasis are also discussed. © 2014 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - Study Objective: To describe sleep duration and quality in the fi rst month postpartum and compare the sleep of women who exclusively breastfed at night to those who used formula. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study in a predominantly low-income and ethnically diverse sample of 120 fi rst-time mothers. Both objective and subjective measures of sleep were obtained using actigraphy, diary, and self-report data. Measures were collected in the last month of pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Infant feeding diaries were used to group mothers by nighttime breastfeeding behavior. Results: Mothers who used at least some formula at night (n = 54) and those who breastfed exclusively (n = 66) had similar sleep patterns in late pregnancy. However, there was a significant group difference in nocturnal sleep at one month postpartum as measured by actigraphy. Total nighttime sleep was 386 ± 66 minutes for the exclusive breastfeeding group and 356 ± 67 minutes for the formula group. The groups did not differ with respect to daytime sleep, wake after sleep onset (sleep fragmentation), or subjective sleep disturbance at one month postpartum. Conclusion: Women who breastfed exclusively averaged 30 minutes more nocturnal sleep than women who used formula at night, but measures of sleep fragmentation did not differ. New mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively since breastfeeding may promote sleep during postpartum recovery. Further research is needed to better understand how infant feeding method affects maternal sleep duration and fragmentation.

AB  - Introduction: sleep- related breathing disorders --sleep apnea stands out-- are characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cardio respiratory and cognitive secondary to repeated obstruction of the upper airway disorders. Pregnant women suffer from them with significant frequency. Objective: analyze the impact of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) in maternal and perinatal morbidity through the evidence found in literature. Methods: aliterature review was conducted for updating on methods for diagnosis, pathogenesis, sleep-related obstetric complications, and some recommended behaviors as well. Conclusions: the association between sleep-related breathing disorders and increased maternal and perinatal risk is evident; drawing attention to the suffering patients has potential benefits in the detection of associated complications and it allows adopting a timely and efficient behavior during the prenatal control. © 2014, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

AB  - Background: Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors. Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N= 161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10-12. weeks), T2 (14-16. weeks) and T3 (18-20. weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs. Results: BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL. ≥. 20. min had greater BMI than women without persistent SOL. ≥. 20. min prior to covariate adjustment at T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for persistent WASO. ≥. 30. min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates. Conclusions: Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background and aim: Pregnancy physiology may predispose women to the development of airflow limitations during sleep. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether pregnant women suspected of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are more likely to have airflow limitations compared to non-pregnant controls. Methods: We recruited pregnant women referred for polysomnography for a diagnosis of SDB. Non-pregnant female controls matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) were identified from a database. We examined airflow tracings for changes in amplitude and shape. We classified airflow limitation by (a) amplitude criteria defined as decreased airflow of ≥10. s without desaturation or arousal (FL 10), or decreased airflow of any duration combined with either 1-2% desaturation or arousal, (FL 1-2%); and (b) shape criteria defined as the presence of flattening or oscillations of the inspiratory flow curve. Results: We identified 25 case-control pairs. Mean BMI was 44.0. ±. 6.9 in cases and 44.1. ±. 7.3 in controls. Using shape criteria, pregnant women had significantly more flow-limited breaths throughout total sleep time (32.4. ±. 35.8 vs. 9.4. ±. 17.9, p<. 0.0001) and in each stage of sleep (p<. 0.0001) than non-pregnant controls. In a subgroup analysis, pregnant women without a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) who had an AHI <5 had similar findings (p<. 0.0001). There was no difference in airflow limitation by amplitude criteria between pregnant women and controls (p= 0.22). Conclusions: Pregnant women suspected of OSA have more frequent shape-defined airflow limitations than non-pregnant controls, even when they do not meet polysomnographic OSA criteria. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rationale Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are common among pregnant women, and several studies link SDB symptoms with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. However, few prospective studies objectively measuring SDB during pregnancy have been performed. Objectives We performed a prospective cohort study examining risk factors for third trimester SDB in pregnant women. Measurements and methods 105 pregnant women from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania obstetrics practices completed first and third trimester overnight polysomnography studies. We examined whether the number of SDB events per hour of sleep increased during pregnancy. We performed unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate the effects of usual and pregnancy-specific characteristics on development of third trimester obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In secondary analyses, we examined the relationship between objectively measured SDB, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and other adverse maternal-fetal outcomes. Main results Mean Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index increased from 2.07 (SD 3.01) events/h at baseline (first trimester) to 3.74 (SD 5.97) in the third trimester (p=0.009). 10.5% of women had OSA in the first trimester. By the third trimester, 26.7% of women had OSA. In multivariable analyses, first trimester body mass index (BMI) and maternal age were significantly associated with third trimester OSA. Conclusions Third trimester OSA is common. Risk factors for third trimester OSA among women without baseline SDB include higher baseline BMI and maternal age.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy-associated sleep disorder is a new category on the latest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. It is a significant problem for pregnant women. Purpose: The present follow-up study assesses the association between sleep quality during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and obstetricYneonatal outcomes. Methods: Aprospective follow-up study designwas used. Follow-up examination of the obstetric birth records in the immediate postpartum period were carried out on 128 second-trimester and 120 third-trimesterwomenand their newborns in two hospitals in Taiwan. Poor sleep qualitywas identified using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were collected from October 2007 to June 2008. Results: The prevalence of poor sleepers (Pittsburgh SleepQuality Index score >5)was 58%for second-trimester participants and 66% for third-trimester participants; participants who were unemployed reported a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality than those who were employed. Subsequent review of the participant's obstetric birth records revealed that third-trimester poor sleepers were more likely to have had a vacuum-assisted delivery. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: This study identified poor sleep quality during the third trimester as a novel risk factor for vacuum-assisted delivery.We suggest that prenatal healthcare providers focus greater attention to the sleep disturbance condition of pregnant women and provide proactive sleep counseling to facilitate pregnant women's adjustment to the new psychosocial and physiological demands of motherhood. © 2014 Taiwan Nurses Association.

AB  - Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common condition among pregnant women, particularly during late gestation. Gestational perturbations promote the emergence of adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring, most likely through epigenetic modifications. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) expression inversely correlates with obesity and insulin resistance. The effects of SF during late gestation on metabolic function and AdipoQ expression in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of offspring mice are unknown. Male offspring mice were assessed at 24 weeks after dams were exposed to SF or control sleep during late gestation. Increased food intake, body weight, VWAT mass, and insulin resistance, with reductions in AdipoQ expression in VWAT, emerged in SF offspring. Increased DNMT3a and -b and global DNA methylation and reduced histone acetyltransferase activity and TET1, -2, and -3 expression were detected in VWAT of SF offspring. Reductions in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and H3K4m3 and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K9m2 in the promoter and enhancer regions of AdipoQ emerged in adipocytes from VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression. SF during late gestation induces epigenetic modifications in AdipoQ in male offspring mouse VWAT adipocytes along with a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype. Thus, altered gestational environments elicited by SF impose the emergence of adverse, long-lasting metabolic consequences in the next generation. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Study Objective: To assess the validity of using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) Unicorder for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women. Methods: Sixteen pregnant women, mean age (SD) = 29.8 (5.4) years, average gestational age (SD) = 28.6 (6.3) weeks, mean body mass index (SD) = 44.7 (6.9) kg/m2 with signs and symptoms of OSA wore the ARES Unicorder during one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG was scored according to AASM 2007 criteria, and PSG AHI and RDI were compared to the ARES 1%, 3%, and 4% AHIs calculated with the ARES propriety software. Results: Median PSG AHI and PSG RDI were 3.1 and 10.3 events/h of sleep, respectively. Six women had a PSG AHI ≥ 5 events/h of sleep and 11 had a PSG RDI ≥ 5 events/h of sleep. PSG AHI and RDI were strongly correlated with the ARES AHI measures. When compared with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, the ARES 3% algorithm provided the best balance between sensitivity (1.0 for PSG AHI, 0.91 for PSG RDI) and specificity (0.5 for PSG AHI, 0.8 for PSG RDI) for detecting sleep disordered breathing in our sample. Conclusions: The ARES Unicorder demonstrated reasonable consistency with PSG for diagnosing OSA in this small, heterogeneous sample of obese pregnant women.

AB  - Objective: To assess the frequency of obstructive sleep apnoea among women with and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Obstetric clinics at an academic medical centre. Population: Pregnant women with hypertensive disorders (chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia) and women who were normotensive. Methods: Women completed a questionnaire about habitual snoring and underwent overnight ambulatory polysomnography. Main outcome measures: The presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnoea. Results: Obstructive sleep apnoea was found among 21 of 51 women with hypertensive disorders (41%), but in only three of 16 women who were normotensive (19%, chi-square test, P = 0.005). [Author correction added on 16 June 2014, after first online publication: Results mentioned in the abstract were amended.] Non-snoring women with hypertensive disorders typically had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, but >25% of snoring women with hypertensive disorders had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Among women with hypertensive disorders, the mean apnoea/hypopnoea index was substantially higher in snorers than in non-snorers (19.9 ± 34.1 versus 3.4 ± 3.1, P = 0.013), and the oxyhaemoglobin saturation nadir was significantly lower (86.4 ± 6.6 versus 90.2 ± 3.5, P = 0.021). Among women with hypertensive disorders, after stratification by obesity, the pooled relative risk for obstructive sleep apnoea in snoring women with hypertension compared with non-snoring women with hypertension was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.8). Conclusions: Pregnant women with hypertension are at high risk for unrecognised obstructive sleep apnoea. Although longitudinal and intervention studies are urgently needed, given the known relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension in the general population, it would seem pertinent that hypertensive pregnant women who snore should be tested for obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition believed to cause or promote hypertension. © 2014 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

AB  - Introduction: Gestational hypertension is seen in 10% of pregnant women and is associated with fetal and maternal complications such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, asphyxia, fetal death, pre-and postpartum hemorrhage and maternal mortality. Sleep apnea is one of the factors that may be associated with Gestational hypertension. The present study has been implemented to investigate the relationship between sleep apnea and gestational hypertension. Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 15 hypertensive diabetic and 45 normotensive diabetic pregnant women referred to diabetes center in Saqqez, Iran in 2013. Berlin questionnaire and blood pressure chart were used to collect data. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 18), independent t-test, chi-square and Fisher exact tests. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: 9 cases (20%) of the normotensive diabetic pregnant mothers and 8 cases (53.3%) of hypertensive diabetic pregnant women and had sleep apnea, and the risk of hypertension in mothers with sleep apnea was 4.5 times higher than mothers without sleep apnea. Conclusion: There is a relationship between sleep apnea and hypertension among women with gestational diabetes.

AB  - We report a patient with pregnancy related obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA]; apnea hypopnea index [AHI] 18/h) early after delivery, with improvement of AHI by 87% following 45-degree elevation in body position compared with the non-elevated position. Improvement associated with this position may be explained, at least in part, by an increased upper airway diameter (as measured during wakefulness). Sleep apnea in this patient resolved at 9 months postpartum. This observation suggests that 45-degree elevated body position may be an effective treatment of pregnancy related OSA during the postpartum period.

AB  - Extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40) is thought to complicate approximately 5% of deliveries in the United States. Extreme obesity puts a pregnant woman at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure; respiratory disease, including obstructive sleep apnea and asthma; as well as pregnancy-specific diseases including pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. Extreme obesity also puts a parturient at a significantly increased risk of requiring cesarean delivery. For the anesthesiologist, the physiologic changes of obesity combined with the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy can make for a complex and challenging case. This review will focus on the anesthetic approach to the extremely obese parturient undergoing scheduled operative delivery. With proper planning and a detailed understanding of the patient[U+05F3]s comorbidities, a safe and effective anesthetic can be achieved. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) has been shown to be associated with negative clinical sequelae such as systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It has been reported in the literature that approximately 53-56 % of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have positional OSA, known as POSA. Potential treatment for SDB in pregnancy: These findings have led to a resurgence of positional therapy as an effective treatment for select patients with SDB. Pregnant patients can also be diagnosed with SDB, the negative consequences of which not only pertain to the patient but to the unborn fetus as well. Despite this, however, SDB is under-diagnosed in pregnant patients and research looking at SDB in pregnant patients and potential therapies are scarce. Conclusions: This article reviews the literature regarding the physiologic respiratory changes that occur during pregnancy, SDB in pregnancy, supine hypotensive syndrome (SHS), complications and current treatments for these events and potential roles for positional therapy in pregnant women whose problems may be specifically position dependent. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a frequently occurring sleep disorder with an adverse effect on the patient's quality of life. Moreover, OSA is associated with numerous comorbidities, such as hypertension. CPAP generates a positive pressure, preventing the airways from narrowing or closing. The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the OSA symptoms and its associated complications are counteracted by this treatment. It is already known that the treatment of patients with OSA by means of CPAP exerts positive effects on the blood pressure. During pregnancy, sleep disorders such as OSA can develop or even worsen. This often results in increased snoring, which is related to a higher risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Studies have shown that hypertension during pregnancy is associated with an adverse fetal and maternal outcome. CPAP is a safe treatment for sleep disorders in pregnant women. Moreover, CPAP is able to normalize the blood pressure during the entire pregnancy. The research on the effects of CPAP during pregnancy is limited, but the obtained results so far are promising.

AB  - Objective: To identify quantitative MEG indices of spontaneous brain activity for fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies and examine the effect of fetal state on these indices. Methods: Spontaneous MEG brain activity was examined in 22 low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from 30 to 37. weeks. As major quantitative characteristics of spontaneous activity, burst duration (BD) and interburst interval (IBI) were studied in correlation with GA and fetal state. Results: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (-0.21 s/week, P=. 0.0031). This trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep state. With respect to BD, no significant trends were detected with GA and state. Conclusion: IBI can be quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter. The decrease in IBI over gestation was similar to the trend reported in the preterm neonatal EEG studies. Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such MEG maturational indices. Significance: With further investigation, indices extracted from spontaneous fetal brain activity may serve as an early warning for fetal neurological distress. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - This study examined the association between measures of objective sleep (OS) and subjective sleep (SS) to postpartum mood in healthy women from the third trimester of pregnancy to 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Twenty-nine pregnant women completed self-report measures of mood and SS, and wore actigraphs for 7 continuous days during the third trimester (Time 1), within 15 days (Time 2), and 10 to 12 weeks postpartum (Time 3). The subjective perception of marked daytime dysfunction was associated with low mood during Time 1 and Time 3. Poor nighttime SS was related to low mood only at Time 2, whereas poor nighttime OS influenced stress during the same assessment time. These data indicate a stronger association between postpartum mood and the subjective perception of sleep than with OS quality and duration in healthy, non-depressed women, and highlight the awareness of poor daytime functioning as a significant contributor to new mothers' emotional wellbeing.

AB  - Objective: Although many studies have shown the evolution of sleep parameters across the lifespan, not many have included a representative sample of the general population. The objective of this study was to describe age-related changes in sleep structure, sleep respiratory parameters and periodic limb movements of the adult population of São Paulo. Methods: We selected a representative sample of the city of São Paulo, Brazil that included both genders and an age range of 20-80. years. Pregnant and lactating women, people with physical or mental impairments that prevent self-care and people who work every night were not included. This sample included 1024 individuals who were submitted to polysomnography and structured interviews. We subdivided our sample into five-year age groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare age groups. Pearson product-moment was used to evaluate correlation between age and sleep parameters. Results: Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep showed a significant age-related decrease (P<. 0.05). WASO (night-time spent awake after sleep onset), arousal index, sleep latency, REM sleep latency, and the percentage of stages 1 and 2 showed a significant increase (P<. 0.05). Furthermore, apnea-hypopnea index increased and oxygen saturation decreased with age. The reduction in the percentage of REM sleep significantly correlated with age in women, whereas the reduction in the percentage of slow wave sleep correlated with age in men. The periodic limb movement (PLM) index increased with age in men and women. Conclusions: Sleep structure and duration underwent significant alterations throughout the aging process in the general population. There was an important correlation between age, sleep respiratory parameters and PLM index. In addition, men and women showed similar trends but with different effect sizes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Migraine in pregnancy can cause considerable concern to both patient and doctor, particularly if migraine starts for the first time during pregnancy or if the woman has her first attack with aura. There is often confusion regarding which medicines are safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, leaving many women unable to control their attacks effectively. This paper reviews the diagnosis as well as the management of migraine, which is similar to the non-pregnant state, with a few exceptions. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Objective Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are increased in pregnancy compared to the nongravid state. Maternal SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this is still under investigation. We performed a systematic literature review, and where feasible, a metaanalysis, to evaluate whether women with SDB in pregnancy have a higher risk of specific adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women without SDB. Study Design Original studies published until June 2012 evaluating the association between gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight infants, and maternal SDB, defined either by symptoms or the reference standard polysomnography, were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data were extracted on study design and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect estimates from each study were pooled using a random-effects model. Results Of the 4386 studies identified, 31 met the defined criteria. Twenty-one studies, all observational in design, reported dichotomous outcomes; 9 of these adjusted for potential confounders. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-3.09; 5 studies), and gestational diabetes (pooled aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; 5 studies). Conclusion Based on published observational studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. However, large-scale, prospective cohort, and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the relationship between maternal SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2014 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Neuroactive steroid concentrations are remarkably high in the foetal brain during late gestation. These concentrations are maintained by placental progesterone synthesis and the interaction of enzymes in the placenta and foetal brain. 5α-Pregnane-3α-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) is a key neuroactive steroid during foetal life, although other 3α-hydroxy- pregnanes may make an additional contribution to neuroactive steroid action. Allopregnanolone modulates GABAergic inhibition to maintain a suppressive action on the foetal brain during late gestation. This action suppresses foetal behaviour and maintains the appropriate balance of foetal sleep-like behaviours, which in turn are important to normal neurodevelopment. Neuroactive steroid-induced suppression of excitability has a key role in protecting the foetal brain from acute hypoxia/ischaemia insults. Hypoxia-induced brain injury is markedly increased if neuroactive steroid levels are suppressed and there is increased seizure activity. There is also a rapid increase in allopregnanolone synthesis and hence levels in response to acute stress that acts as an endogenous protective mechanism. Allopregnanolone has a trophic role in regulating development, maintaining normal levels of apoptosis and increasing myelination during late gestation in the brain. In contrast, chronic foetal stressors, including intrauterine growth restriction, do not increase neuroactive steroid levels in the brain and exposure to repeated synthetic corticosteroids reduce neuroactive steroid levels. The reduced availability of neuroactive steroids may contribute to the adverse effects of chronic stressors on the foetal and newborn brain. Preterm birth also deprives the foetus of neuroactive steroid mediated protection and may increase vulnerability to brain injury and suboptimal development. These finding suggest replacement therapies should be explored. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Pregnancy and steroids © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To objectify indications for treatment with pantogam in premature infants with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury of the CNS. Material and methods: We studied 71 children, with GA (gestation age) 24-36 weeks (32,9±2,9 weeks), with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury of the CNS, I-II grades, and hyperexitability syndrome. The main group (33 patients) received pantogam in dose 50 mg/kg/day at the adjusted age (AA) 36-40 weeks from the conception. The comparison group included 38 patients. EEG day sleep monitoring was performed before and at the end of treatment. Results: Shortening of sleep cycle was observed in 78,8% children of the main group and in 78,9% of the comparison group. Duration of transitional sleep over 1 min was 78,79% and 81,58%. At AA 44-46 weeks, the frequency of sleep disorders decreased to 45,45% (p=0,012) and 52,63% (p=0,05). Duration of transitional sleep over 1 min was 45,45% and 65,79%. Duration of the latent period of the 2nd stage of slow wave sleep was 6,4±2,57 and 12,5±7,18 min (p=0,0004). Conclusion: The treatment reduced sleep disorders, changed the duration of transitional sleep stage and latent period of the 2nd stage of slow wave sleep.

AB  - Conclusions: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.
Background: Low maternal choline intake and blood concentration may be risk factors for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD); however, the data are inconsistent. This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved by folic acid.
Objective: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionally could reduce NTD rates.
Design: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first prenatal visit.
Results: Mean (±SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the AP (2.8 ± 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of phosphatidylethanolamine-Nmethyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P = 0.02). © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - The treatment of opiate-dependent women during pregnancy is a common problem. Maintenance treatment with methadone is the best-established treatment, although a few case reports demonstrate the possible advantages of buprenorphine and slow release morphine in limiting the intensity of the postnatal, neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Here we report on the course of pregnancy and the postnatal withdrawal symptom of the son of a 25-year-old, first childbearing woman in her 38th week of pregnancy under diamorphine-assisted treatment (HAT=heroin-assisted treatment). Until the beginning of her pregnancy Mrs. X was maintained on diamorphine for about a year; apart from diamorphine, the only medicinal treatment was low dosages of quetiapine ad libitum, which were prescribed to treat nightmares and sleep-onset disorder. The pregnancy under diamorphine maintenance caused no major problems, and childbirth by Caesarean section took place in the 38+2 week of her pregnancy, although Mrs. X’s son’s neonatal withdrawal syndrome turned out to be more severe, and to show an earlier onset compared with methadone or buprenorphine treatments. © 2014, Pacini Editore S.p.A.

AB  - Power spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability has been proposed to provide a non-invasive estimate of autonomic balance. However, there are few systematic data before birth. We therefore examined developmental changes in the frequency power spectrum at very low (0-0.04 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequencies (0.15-0.4 Hz), as well as the ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF), in chronically catheterized, healthy fetal sheep at 0.6 (n= 8), 0.7 (n= 7) and 0.8 gestational age (ga; n= 11). In a second study, 0.8 ga fetuses received either atropine (4.8 mg bolus, then 4.8 mg h-1 for 30 min, n= 6) or 6-hydroxydopamine (20 mg ml-1 at 2.5 ml h-1 for 3 h; n= 9). Data were analysed by sleep state, defined by low-voltage-high-frequency (LV) or high-voltage-low-frequency (HV) EEG. Total spectral power increased with gestational age (P &lt; 0.05), while LF/HF decreased from 0.6 to 0.7 ga. At 0.8 ga, heart rate and LF/HF were significantly higher during HV than LV sleep (P &lt; 0.05). Consistent with this, although total spectral power was not significantly greater during HV sleep, there was a significant interaction between sleep state and frequency band (P= 0.02). Both atropine (P= 0.05) and 6-hydroxydopamine (P &lt; 0.05) were associated with an overall reduction in spectral power but no significant effect on the LF/HF ratio. This study does not support substantial, consistent differences between the frequencies of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in late-gestation fetal sheep. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - To analyze which Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Postpartum Depression Screening Scores (PDSS) total and dimensional scores, as well as symptomatic answers proportions significantly differ between women in the perinatal period (pregnant/postpartum) without major depression, with major depression and women outside the perinatal period. Methods 572 pregnant women in the third trimester completed Beck Depression Inventory-II and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale and were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. 417 of these were also assessed (with the same instruments) at three months postpartum. Ninety non-pregnant women or that did not have a child in the last year (mean age=29.42±7.159 years) also filled in the questionnaires. Results Non-depressed pregnant women showed lower scores than depressed pregnant women and higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the BDI-II total score and in its Somatic-Anxiety dimension. Non-depressed postpartum women showed significantly higher scores than women outside the perinatal period only at Sleep/Eating Disturbances. Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without depression presented higher scores only in the somatic items. Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes. Limitations Women outside the perinatal period were not diagnosed for the presence of a depressive disorder, but their BDI-II mean score was similar to the figures reported worldwide regarding women in childbearing age. Conclusion In the perinatal period, most particularly at pregnancy, women experience significant somatic changes even if not clinically depressed. Cognitive-affective symptoms are more useful when assessing the presence of perinatal depression. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common condition in postreproductive females. Key risk factors for later-life CVD include gestational hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia (PE). Although several risk factors of hypertension in pregnancy are well recognized, a novel risk factor that has emerged recently is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a condition characterized by repeated closure of the upper airway during sleep with disrupted ventilation and sleep fragmentation. In the nonpregnant population, SDB is now known to play a causal role in future CVD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to propose the hypothesis that occult SDB during pregnancy may play a role in long-term CVD in women who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This study is a review and synthesis of empirical evidence that links SDB to GHTN/PE and GHTN/PE to future CVD. RESULTS: An increasing body of evidence supports the relationship between SDB and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy via mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with long-term risk for CVD via similar mechanisms. However, no studies have addressed the potential role of SDB in long-term outcomes of women with GHTN/PE during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Given the suggested mechanisms that explain these associations, it is plausible that SDB during pregnancy may increase long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. RELEVANCE: Pregnancy may offer a window of opportunity for identification and treatment of SDB, which could provide substantial health benefit for many years to come. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to evaluate the current evidence regarding the frequency of SDB in pregnancy, its risk factors, subsequent outcomes, and treatment. © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective To investigate the risk factors for early miscarriage among Chinese women. Design Hospital-based matched case-control study. Setting Academic medical center and maternal health hospital. Patient(s) 620 women with early miscarriage (less than 13 weeks of gestation) and 1,240 normal pregnant women. Intervention(s) Face-to-face questionnaire. Main Outcome Measure(s) Multivariable conditional odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to measure risk factors. Result(s) After adjustment for confounding factors, the following were independently associated with increased risk: history of miscarriage, repeated induced abortion, working night shifts, and frequent staying up late. Vitamin supplementation and regular physical activity reduced the risk of miscarriage. We did not find paternal age, alcohol consumption, or smoking status to be linked with early miscarriage. Conclusion(s) Our findings suggest that a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and planned pregnancy may be advantageous for women in pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy. Induced abortion, working night shifts, and frequent staying up late were associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. Further work in larger populations is warranted.

AB  - Aims: This study examined whether the association between sleep duration, as well as sleep continuity, and cognitive function differs between normally developing preterm children compared to full-term children during middle childhood. Methods: A total of 58 early preterm (<32 weeks' gestation) and 55 full-term children, aged 6-10 years and enrolled in elementary school, were assessed on sleep duration, sleep continuity and cognitive function. We used in-home polysomnographic recordings of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and nocturnal awakenings. Cognitive tests included intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, verbal memory, and visuospatial memory. Results: Preterm children showed poorer performance in intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, and visuospatial memory (d = 0.38-0.79, p < 0.05) and more objectively assessed nocturnal awakenings (d = 0.40, p = 0.03) than full-term children. Associations of sleep efficiency and cognitive functions (intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, visuospatial memory) were positive and stronger for preterm children (β = 0.17-0.31, p < 0.05), while they were nonsignificant for full-term children. Conclusion: Results confirm lower cognitive test scores and more nocturnal awakenings in normally developing early preterm children compared to full-term children. Furthermore, poor sleep efficiency may aggravate cognitive deficits, particularly in children who are more vulnerable due to premature birth. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Sleeping disorders are a common problem in pregnant women, as up to 78% have reported that their sleep was significantly more disturbed during pregnancy than in a non-pregnant condition. These sleeping disorders are related to anatomical, physiological, hormonal and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. This manuscript presents an overview of the current research on sleeping disorders in pregnancy. First, a definition of sleeping disorders is presented and the most common symptoms are described. Next, the different causes are discussed as well as the risk factors and the consequences for mother and child. Both objective and subjective criteria are used to establish a diagnosis. Until now, a polysomnography remains the golden diagnostic standard. The first step in the treatment of sleeping disorders is a lifestyle improvement. If this does not yield enough progress, medical treatments like a dental device or a surgical procedure such as a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty can be considered. Most promising is the "continuous positive airway pressure" (CPAP) as therapy.

AB  - Aim To explore the role of maternal personality (hardiness), sleep-related cognitions and bedtime involvement in child sleep behaviour during the second post-natal year in a sample of spontaneous and assisted conception first-time mothers. Method Mothers (n = 134 (spontaneous (n = 81); assisted (n = 53) conception)) reported on a resilience measure (hardiness) during pregnancy and child sleep at 7 and 19 months post-partum. At 19 months post-partum, mothers also reported on their cognitions and involvement around their child's bedtime, and half the sample used Actigraph monitors (Acitiwatch-16, Mini Mitter Co. Inc, Bend, OR, USA) to validate maternal report of child sleep. Results No significant differences were found between spontaneous and assisted conception mothers on any of the study variables; therefore, assisted and spontaneous samples were combined. Structural equation modelling confirmed that lower pre-birth maternal hardiness was associated with more problematic sleep-related cognitions (β = 0.23, P < 0.01) and involvement at bedtime (β = 0.29, P < 0.01) and poorer child sleep outcomes (β = -0.33, P < 0.001) during toddlerhood, even after considering concurrent maternal mood and child temperament. Conclusions Pre-birth maternal hardiness rather than mode of conception contributes to parenting cognitions and behaviour around child sleep and, ultimately, toddlers' sleep outcomes. Findings suggest that targeting negative maternal perceptions of control and efficacy through clinical interventions could benefit toddlers' sleep. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To explore sleep quality in infertile women and examine the factors that contribute to sleep disturbances during intrauterine insemination treatment. Background: Sleep disturbance is an important factor of human health and well-being. Sleep disturbances tend to occur among infertile women during intrauterine insemination treatment. Although many studies have focused on the high percentage of somatic symptoms and psychological distress in infertile women associated with their treatment, few studies have investigated factors linked to their sleep disturbances. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The study was conducted during the period of September 2010-January 2011 in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Infertile women (n = 117) who received assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination treatment completed a questionnaire. Demographic data, somatic symptoms, psychological distress and perceived sleep quality were collected. Results: More than one-third (35%) of the infertile women reported having sleep disturbances. Their nausea symptoms and psychological distress were risk factors that contributed to sleep disturbance. Conclusions: The variables of nausea and psychological distress significantly explained 30% of the sleep disturbances in the infertile women. The evaluation of nausea symptoms and/or psychological distress among infertile women is an important area of future research; such research should aim to identify the best compromise between infertility treatment and sleep quality. Relevance to clinical practice: Clinical obstetrics and gynaecology nurses should develop strategies to help infertile women reduce their nausea symptoms and psychological distress during intrauterine insemination treatment to promote healthy sleep. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Sleep disorders are frequent comorbidities in neurologic patients. This review focuses on clinical aspects and prognosis of 3 neurologic sleep disorders: narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED), and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Narcolepsy causes pervasive, enduring excessive daytime sleepiness, adversely affecting patients' daily functioning. RLS/WED is characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs before sleep, often evolving toward augmentation and resulting in daylong bothersome symptoms. RBD causes potentially injurious dream enactment behaviors that often signify future evolution of overt synucleinopathy neurodegen-eration in as many as 81% of patients. Timely recognition, referral for polysomnography, and longitudinal follow-up of narcolepsy, RLS/WED, and RBD patients are imperatives for neurologists in providing quality comprehensive patient care. © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - An appropriate pro-health behavior is a prerequisite of a normal course of pregnancy. An adequate diet, a sufficient amount of sleep and exercise as well as avoiding any stimulants (alcohol, nicotine, drugs etc.) constitute the basic pro-health conditions. However, statistical data reveal a very widespread use of stimulants among pregnant women, who cannot or frequently even do not attempt to overcome their addiction or harmful habits acquired before pregnancy, and are not aware of the consequences of their behavior. As surveys indicate, the improper behaviors in pregnancy are due to individual neglect on the patient's side as well as to insufficient health education and promotion. © GinPolMedProject.

AB  - Background: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women's fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum. Results: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha. ≥ .97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient. >. .87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88-94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity. Conclusions: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective. Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with adverse maternal and child outcomes and contributes to obesity in women. Our aim was to identify early pregnancy factors associated with excessive GWG, in a contemporary nulliparous cohort. Methods. Participants in the SCOPE study were classified into GWG categories ("not excessive" versus "excessive") based on pregravid body mass index (BMI) using 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Maternal characteristics and pregnancy risk factors at 14-16 weeks were compared between categories and multivariable analysis controlled for confounding factors. Results. Of 1950 women, 17% gained weight within the recommended range, 74% had excessive and 9% inadequate GWG. Women with excessive GWG were more likely to be overweight (adjOR 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.8)) or obese (adjOR 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5)) before pregnancy compared to women with a normal BMI. Other factors independently associated with excessive GWG included recruitment in Ireland, younger maternal age, increasing maternal birthweight, cessation of smoking by 14-16 weeks, increased nightly sleep duration, high seafood diet, recent immigrant, limiting behaviour, and decreasing exercise by 14-16 weeks. Fertility treatment was protective. Conclusions. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors for excessive GWG provides opportunities for intervention studies to improve pregnancy outcome and prevent maternal obesity. © 2014 Antonia Restall et al.

AB  - Objective: This prospective observational study explored the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and sleep studies. Study Design: Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen-positive subjects were referred for polysomnography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to estimate the relative risks of associations. Result: One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models (adjusted relative risk=1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.37). Conclusion: In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggests that the BQ but not the ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others. However, causative association of BQ with OSA cannot be assumed.

AB  - Inconsistent information exists in the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and perinatal outcomes. This study was intended to investigate whether OSA in pregnant women has a potential to elevate the incidence of the maternal and neonatal outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of all available cohort studies. Five cohort studies including 977 participants were eligible for inclusion. The association between OSA and the risk of perinatal outcomes was expressed as relative risks (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Our results revealed that OSA group was associated with more frequent preeclampsia (RR 1.96; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.86), preterm birth (RR 1.90; 95%CI 1.24 to 2.91), cesarean delivery (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.29) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 2.65; 95% CI 1.86 to 3.76). On analyzing data for the prevalence of gestational diabetes and small gestational age (SGA) < 10th percentile (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.62 to 3.19, and RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.33 to1.24, respectively), there were no significant differences in both group. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that OSA in pregnant women significantly increases the incidence of maternal and neonatal outcomes, which is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, preterm birth, cesarean delivery and NICU admission.

AB  - Key points: The majority of women with epilepsy (WWE) have either no change in seizure frequency or decrease in seizure frequency. The risk of seizure during delivery remains small but significant (~3.5%) Neonates of WWE takingantiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are likely to be at an increased risk of being small for gestational age (SGA). However, there is no substantially increased risk of perinatal death in neonates born to WWERoutine antenatal fetal tests should be performed to rule out congenital malformations, such as the maternal serum biochemical screen, fetal anatomy ultrasound, and possibly fetal echocardiographyDelivery should take place in an obstetric unit where resources for, and expertise in, maternal and fetal resuscitation are readily availableWWE do not have a substantially increased risk of cesarean delivery. Cesarean section should be reserved for the usual obstetrical indications, or in the setting of recurrent uncontrolled generalized seizures in late pregnancy or labour Effect of pregnancy on maternal epilepsy The majority of patients with epilepsy maintain seizure control during pregnancy with the risk of increase in seizure frequency generally thought to be small. Potential reasons for seizure exacerbation may include poor compliance because of maternal concerns regarding teratogenicity, decreased drug levels related to nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, physiological increase in metabolism during pregnancy, decreased free drug levels, lack of adjusting drug levels, sleep deprivation towards term and during labour, and lack of absorption of AEDs from the GI tract during labour. Several studies in the past have attempted to examine the change in seizure frequency, though no studies compared the change in seizure frequency in pregnant WWE to non-pregnant WWE [2–5]. Three studies in particular used each patient’s pre-pregnancy seizure frequency as the control. Bardy et al. [2] prospectively evaluated 154 pregnancies in Finland over a 4-year period, and found that seizure frequency was unchanged in 54% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46–0.62), decreased in 14% (95% CI, 0.10–0.21), and increased in 32% (95% CI, 0.25–0.40) compared to pre-pregnancy seizure frequency. In a second study, 78 pregnancies in Norway were prospectively evaluated, and seizure frequency was unchanged in 72% (95% CI, 0.61–0.81) decreased in 14% (95% CI, 0.08–0.24), and increased in 14% (95% CI, 0.08–0.24) compared to pre-pregnancy baseline [3]. © Cambridge University Press 2014.

AB  - Purpose: Previous investigations have suggested a strong association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. However, the results of the following replication studies were not always concordant. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the more reliable estimate.
Methods: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Springer Link, and EMBASE to identify all eligible studies published before August 2013. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random effects model.
Results: A total of 24 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Findings demonstrated that moderate-to-severe SDB during pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI, 1.29 to 2.46), pregnancy-related hypertension (OR = 2.38; 95 % CI, 1.63 to 3.47), preeclampsia (OR = 2.19; 95 % CI, 1.71 to 2.80), preterm delivery (OR = 1.98; 95 % CI, 1.59 to 2.48), low birth weight (OR = 1.75; 95 % CI, 1.33 to 2.32), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (OR = 2.43; 95 % CI, 1.61 to 3.68), intrauterine growth restriction (OR = 1.44; 95 % CI, 1.22 to 1.71), and Apgar score of <7 at 1 min (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI, 1.10 to 2.91) based on all studies but not gestational age and birth weight.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis revealed that moderate-to-severe SDB during pregnancy may be associated with most of adverse perinatal outcomes. Further well-designed studies are warranted to confirm our findings. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objective:We sought to ascertain the validity of two screening scales for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy and to establish the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy.Study Design:In this prospective observational study, two screening scales were administered. Screen positive subjects were referred for diagnostic polysomnography (PSG); if admitted for antepartum care, screen positive subjects underwent a modified study with a type 3 device (T3D).Result:A total of 1509 subjects underwent OSA screening; 58 completed diagnostic testing. Neither measure was a reliable diagnostic tool for OSA as determined by T3D or PSG (detection rates of 10.3% and 18.0%, respectively). Among screen positive subjects undergoing PSG or T3D testing, 15.5% ultimately met 'gold standard' OSA diagnostic criteria for an estimated point prevalence of 4.9%.Conclusion:In this prospective trial, screening positive on the Berlin questionnaire or Epworth sleepiness scale was poorly predictive of OSA among gravidae and was associated with a high false referral rate. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pregnant women have a 2-3 fold higher probability of developing restless legs syndrome (RLS – sleep-related movement disorders) than general population. This study aims to evaluate the behavior and locomotion of rats during pregnancy in order to verify if part of these animals exhibit some RLS-like features. METHODS: We used 14 female 80-day-old Wistar rats that weighed between 200 and 250 g. The rats were distributed into control (CTRL) and pregnant (PN) groups. After a baseline evaluation of their behavior and locomotor activity in an open-field environment, the PN group was inducted into pregnancy, and their behavior and locomotor activity were evaluated on days 3, 10 and 19 of pregnancy and in the post-lactation period in parallel with the CTRL group. The serum iron and transferrin levels in the CTRL and PN groups were analyzed in blood collected after euthanasia by decapitation. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the total ambulation, grooming events, fecal boli or urine pools between the CTRL and PN groups. However, the PN group exhibited fewer rearing events, increased grooming time and reduced immobilization time than the CTRL group (ANOVA, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pregnant rats show behavioral and locomotor alterations similar to those observed in animal models of RLS, demonstrating to be a possible animal model of this sleep disorder. © 2014, Revista Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetricia.

AB  - This review summarizes studies on eating disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period that have been conducted as part of the broader Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Prior to the 2000s, empirical literature on eating disorders in pregnancy was sparse and consisted mostly of studies in small clinical samples. MoBa has contributed to a new era of research by making population-based and largesample research possible. To date, MoBa has led to 19 eating disorder studies on diverse questions including the prevalence, course, and risk correlates of eating disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum. The associations between eating disorder exposure and pregnancy, birth and obstetric outcomes, and maternal and offspring health and well-being, have also been areas of focus. The findings indicate that eating disorders in pregnancy are relatively common and appear to confer health risks to mother and her child related to sleep, birth outcomes, maternal nutrition, and child feeding and eating. © 2014, Norwegian Epidemiological Society.

AB  - Objective. Chemokines exert different inflammatory responses which can potentially be related to certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The aim of the study was to determine the concentration of selected chemokines in plasma and amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down syndrome. Method. Out of 171 amniocentesis, we had 7 patients with confirmed fetal Down syndrome (15th-18th weeks of gestation). For the purpose of our control, we chose 14 women without confirmed chromosomal aberration. To assess the concentration of chemokines in the blood plasma and amniotic fluid, we used a protein macroarray, which allows the simultaneous determination of 40 chemokines per sample. Results. We showed significant decrease in the concentration of 4 chemokines, HCC-4, IL-28A, IL-31, and MCP-2, and increase in the concentration of CXCL7 (NAP-2) in plasma of women with fetal Down syndrome. Furthermore, we showed decrease in concentration of 3 chemokines, ITAC, MCP-3, MIF, and increase in concentration of 4 chemokines, IP-10, MPIF-1, CXCL7, and 6Ckine, in amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down syndrome. Conclusion. On the basis of our findings, our hypothesis is that the chemokines may play role in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome. Defining their potential as biochemical markers of Down syndrome requires further investigation on larger group of patients. © 2014 Piotr Laudanski et al.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigated whether psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are prevalent amongst women in pregnancy and/or in the early postnatal phase, and whether the predictors identified in the literature for non-puerperal psychosis apply in a general sample of perinatal women. Method: 101 women in their third trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaire measures of mood, subjective well-being, sleep, expectations about labour, and PLEs. 66 of these participants also completed questionnaires shortly after giving birth. The main outcome measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R). Results: During pregnancy, 80% of the samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and 52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted. Conclusions: The results of this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Overwhelming evidence reveals the close link between unwarranted weight gain among childbearing women and childhood adiposity. Yet current barriers limit the capacity of perinatal health care providers (PHCPs) to offer healthy lifestyle counselling. In response, today's Internet savvy women are turning to online resources to access health information, with the potential of revolutionising health services by enabling PHCPs to guide women to appropriate online resources. This paper presents the findings of a project designed to develop an online resource to promote healthy lifestyles during the perinatal period. The methodology involved focus groups and interviews with perinatal women and PHCPs to determine what online information was needed, in what form, and how best it should be presented. The outcome was the development of the Healthy You, Healthy Baby website and smartphone app. This clinically-endorsed, interactive online resource provides perinatal women with a personalised tool to track their weight, diet, physical activity, emotional wellbeing, and sleep patterns based on the developmental stage of their child with links to quality-assured information. One year since the launch of the online resource, data indicates it provides a low-cost intervention delivered across most geographic and socioeconomic strata without additional demands on health service staff. © 2014 Lydia Hearn et al.

AB  - Numerous medical disorders can lead to CSA or sleep hypoventilation (Fig. 4). Disorders that affect respiratory control centers or chemoreceptor function can lead to inadequate drive to breathe during sleep when wakefulness neurocompensatory mechanisms are absent. A diminished ability to translate central respiratory drive into adequate ventilation can also be caused by pathologic conditions arising from impairment lower down the neuraxis, including respiratory muscle weakness. Some medical disorders may have dysfunction on multiple levels (see Fig. 4). A bidirectional relationship likely exists for many of these conditions, such that the primary medical disorder causes or worsens the CSA and its adverse effects while the primary medical condition and its associated symptoms are worsened by the CSA. There is a need to explore these relationships and improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating the link between certain medical conditions and CSA, and the potential to intervene to improve health outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sexual hormones deeply influence the physiology of human sleep and alertness across the different phases of the female reproductive cycle. Estrogen has a REM-wake promoting effect which proves important for the female cognitive and mood profile, whereas progesterone mediates sedation by increasing NREM sleep and muscle relaxation. It also impacts blood gasses response during sleep and nocturnal ventilation. Women of increasing age are more likely than men to suffer from insomnia and depressive disorders. Daytime fatigue and excessive sleepiness occur more frequently in women with specific sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless leg syndrome/Willis-Ekbom Disease (RLS/WED), to which women appear more prone during both pregnancy and menopause. The impact of OSA and RLS/WED on quality of life and health via induced hypertension and cardiovascular and metabolic risk increases the negative effects of poor sleep on general wellbeing. The load of organic and psychiatric co-morbid disorders associated with altered sleep is greater in women than in men, with a detrimental effect also on gender-specific therapeutic response which is less satisfactory and efficient in women compared to their male counterparts. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Italia.

AB  - Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse model.
Design: Case-control comparison in a murine model.
Setting: University research laboratory.
Participants: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice.
Interventions: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5% O2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses.
Measurements and Results: After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P < 0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 ± 6.4% in normoxia to 12.8 ± 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 ± 0.10 and 2.45 ± 0.73, respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 ± 0.16 and 5.80 ± 1.24, respectively).
Conclusions: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

AB  - The notion that 'older' mothers experience elevated risks during pregnancy and childbirth has proliferated since the mid-twentieth century. In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother's health, and her newborn's health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Objective: to describe the aspects of infant sleep perceived as problematic by first-time Taiwanese mothers and to discover how mothers cope in response to infant sleep concerns. Design: a qualitative approach was used for data collection. Setting: in-depth interviews were conducted and audio-taped at mothers' homes. Participants: 12 first-time mothers within three months post partum. Measurement and findings: content analysis was performed to identify patterns, similarities, and differences in the individual and collective interview data. The major themes describing maternal coping experiences were 'self-help' and 'seek-help.' Self-help coping efforts included reception and acceptance of suggestions as well as changing behaviour to allow mothers to feel capable of adapting to infant sleep patterns or problems. Seek-help was a later stage of coping for mothers when they actively utilised formal and informal sources of help to identify and manage infant sleep problems. The majority of mothers sought informal help sources from family members, friends, or online information. Mothers who suspected their infant of suffering from sleep problems either delayed seeking medical advice or did not actively consult a health care provider. Conclusions and implications for practice: nurses and health care providers who work in antenatal, postnatal, and paediatric clinics should actively educate and provide information about infant sleep patterns and sleep management options to first-time mothers and discuss maternal coping strategies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Antenatal education programs including prenatal exercises are designed by midwives in many hospitals in Nigeria. It is believed that exercises help to improve health and enhance safe delivery of pregnant mothers but researches in Nigeria are yet to challenge the efficacy of this approach. Aim: To examine the usefulness of prenatal exercise as perceived by pregnant mothers attending antenatal clinic of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) Teaching Hospital LTH Osogbo Osun State. \Methods: A descriptive survey research design was used for this study. The population for this study comprises of pregnant mothers attending antenatal clinics both in LAUTECH Teaching Hospital Osogbo and the Community LAUTECH Annex Located at Atelewo Health Centre Osogbo in Osun State. Convenient sampling technique was used to select 500 participants in both antenatal clinics. Data was collected for six weeks in the two antenatal clinics. Questionnaires in Likerts Scale format was used to examine the perception of the perception of the participants on this study. The statistics used for analysis of data were percentages and chi-square at 5% level of significance. Results: Study revealed that there were significant relationships between perceptions of pregnant mothers on various usefulness of prenatal exercise. The variables used as usefulness or benefits of exercise are faster labour, preparation for labour endurance, reduction in weight gain, relieve of fatigue, swelling and back pain, increased blood circulation and prevention of gestational diabetes, decreased use of labour medication, reduced preterm labour and promotion of sleep Conclusion: It was concluded and recommended that aerobic dance should be done in late gestation to test the effect of maternal exercise on foetal activity. Low impart aerobic such as walking which is being performed by the participants in this study should be recommended by the health care giver to all pregnant mothers to strengthen the pelvic joint.

AB  - The perinatal period is associated with an increased risk of severe mental disorders. We summarise the evidence regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment of severe mental illness in relation to childbirth, focusing on bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia. We discuss women with ongoing chronic conditions and those with the onset of new episodes of post-partum psychosis. Despite the importance of perinatal episodes, with suicide a leading cause of maternal death, few studies are available to guide the management of women with severe mental disorders in pregnancy and the post-partum period. However, general principles of management are discussed, including the need for an individual risk-benefit analysis for each woman. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although sleep complaints are very common among pregnant women, the potential adverse effects of sleep disturbance on the offspring are not well studied. Growing evidence suggests that maternal stress can induce an inflammatory environment on the fetal development. But people are not sure about the consequences of prenatal stress such as the inflammatory responses induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD). In the present study, we investigated the effects of MSD on long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences in offspring and its underlying inflammatory response pathway. The pregnant Wistar rats received prolonged sleep deprivation (72h) on gestational day (GD) 4, 9, and 18, respectively. The post-natal day (PND) 21 offspring showed impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze task and anhedonia in sucrose preference experiment. Quantification of BrdU+ and DCX+ cells revealed a significant decrease in hippocampus neurogenesis in prepuberty offspring, especially for the late MSD (GD 18) group. Real-time RT-PCR showed that after MSD, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα) increased in the hippocampus of offspring on PND 1, 7, 14 and 21, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 reduced at the same time. Immunofluorescence found that the cells of activated microglia were higher in the brains of MSD offspring. Taken together, these results suggested that the MSD-induced inflammatory response is an important factor for neurogenesis impairment and neurobehavioral outcomes in prepuberty offspring. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: There are few studies investigating the relationship between respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and asthma in the offspring, and none among mothers with asthma. Infants of mothers with asthma are more likely to wheeze and have a higher risk of developing asthma than infants of non-asthmatic mothers. Methods: A prospective cohort study of viral infection in pregnancy was conducted between 2007 and 2009, and a subgroup of infants of mothers with asthma was followed up at 6 and 12 months of age. During common colds, nasal and throat swabs were collected from mothers and respiratory viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction. Respiratory health of infants was assessed by parent-completed questionnaire. Results: Twelve-month-old infants whose mothers had confirmed viral infections in pregnancy (n = 26) reported more frequent wheeze (40% had 4-12 wheeze attacks compared with 0%), sleep disturbed by wheeze (1 night per week or more in 60% vs. 11%), beta agonist treatment for wheeze (27% vs. 0%), prolonged colds (2 wk or longer 31% vs. 0%), more eczema (40% vs. 6.3%), and parent-perceived asthma (32% vs. 0%), compared with infants whose mothers had common colds without laboratory-confirmed viral infection (n = 16). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a relationship between maternal respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and wheezing illness in infants of mothers with asthma. Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in pregnancy, and infants of asthmatic mothers are at increased risk of asthma themselves. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns in very low birth weight premature newborns when reaching term-to-term neonates, thereby comparing extra uterine to intra uterine development. Methods: EEG recordings were obtained between 2 and 14. days of life in 47 preterm (<37. weeks) very low birth weight (≤1500. g) newborns and repeated when reaching term age (38-42. weeks) in a subsample (n= 22). EEG recordings were also obtained in term newborns. Clinical evaluation was performed at birth and at 6 and 12. months. Results: Relative to the first EEG, preterm newborns showed a reduction in delta brushes and interburst intervals and increased interhemispheric synchrony, suggesting an improvement in EEG maturation. Further organization in sleep patterns, like a reduction in total sleep time and phase shifts, were also observed. However, when reaching term, preterm newborns still had less mature EEG patterns, phase shifts and transitional sleep than matched controls. Background abnormalities and dysmaturity in preterm newborns during the first EEG predicted adverse neurological outcome later on. Conclusions: EEG patterns in preterm very low birth weight newborns might be influenced by extra uterine development. Specific EEG abnormalities are related to increased risk of neurological disorders. Significance: Extra uterine development of very low birth weight delays the acquisition of maturational EEG patterns. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - Our goal was to revise the literature about external nasal dilators (ENDs) as to their definition, history, and current uses. We reviewed journals in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases. The current uses hereby presented and discussed are physical exercise, nasal congestion and sleep, snoring, pregnancy, cancer, and healthy individuals. Numerous studies have shown that ENDs increase the cross-sectional area of the nasal valve, reducing nasal resistance and transnasal inspiratory pressure and stabilizing the lateral nasal vestibule, avoiding its collapse during final inspiration. These effects also facilitate breathing and are beneficial to patients with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, END use is simple, noninvasive, painless, affordable, and bears minimum risk to the user. Most studies have limited sample size and are mainly focused on physical exercise. In conclusion, ENDs seem useful, so further studies involving potential effects on the performance of physical tests and improvements in sleep quality are necessary, especially in children and teenagers. © 2014 Dinardi et al.

AB  - The use of antidepressant medications during pregnancy has stimulated much professional and public debate. As a consequence, considerable data on the reproductive safety of antidepressants has been generated that exceeds the available information for most, if not all, other classes of medications that may be used in the perinatal period. Despite progress to date, definitive conclusions are limited by the methodological issues inherent to clinical research involving illness versus treatment effects in pregnancy. A notable shortcoming is the limited discussion of statistically significant (a mathematical determination) versus clinically significant (incorporation of incidence and effect sizes into practical relevance). Research emphasises completing an individualised 'risk-benefit' assessment, which is a laudable goal but falls short in providing succinct practical guidelines that includes the key educational points for patients. In this chapter, we focus on areas in which the preponderance of data are consistent, and there is concordance with the preclinical literature to generate a practical approach for antidepressant use in pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare neurocristopathy with disordered respiratory control, is characterized by alveolar hypoventilation and diffuse autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation. Mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) are causative, leading to physiologic ANS dysregulation and pathologic abnormalities. Presentation is typically during the newborn period with alveolar hypoventilation during sleep, or in more severely affected individuals, during sleep and wakefulness. Breathing complications occur despite the lungs and airways being normal. Disordered respiratory control demonstrated by absent or severely attenuated ventilatory, behavioral, and arousal responses to both endogenous and exogenous hypoxemia and hypercarbia results in severe physiologic compromise. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The potential teratogenic effects of psychotropic medication use during pregnancy have been scrutinized ever since thalidomide contributed to phocomelia in the 1950's. Up to 35% of the half a million women becoming pregnant each day take psychotropic medication(s). Teratogens alter normal intrauterine fetal growth, anatomic structures, functioning and postnatal development. In this educational review article, we examine whether different classes of psychotropic medications have the potential to be teratogens or have other nonteratogenic effects. Specifically, we examined antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs), anticonvulsants (valproate, carbamazepime, lamotrigine), antipsychotics, Benadryl and Lithium. We also provided case reports with ultrasound images as well as a review quiz.

AB  - Objective: to examine the effectiveness of using back massage to improve sleep quality in postpartum women. Design and setting: randomised controlled trial, conducted at a postpartum centre in Northern Taiwan. Participants: sixty postpartum women reporting poor quality of sleep were recruited from February 2012 to May2012. Interventions: participants were assigned randomly to either an intervention or a control group. Participants in both groups received the same care except for back massage therapy. The intervention group received a single 20-minutes back massage session at the same time each evening for 5consecutive days. Sessions were administered by a certified massage therapist. Measures and finding: the outcome measure was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which was administered pre- and post-test. Using a generalised estimation equation to control several confounding variables, the changes in mean PSQI were significantly lower in the intervention group (B=-3.97, standard error=0.43, p<0.001) than in the controlgroup. Conclusions: an intervention involving back massage in the postnatal period significantly improved the quality ofsleep. Implications for practice: midwives should evaluate maternal sleep quality and design early intervention programs to improve the quality of sleep, to increase maternal health. Midwives interested in complementary therapies should be encouraged to obtain training in back massage and to apply it in postpartumcare. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The spontaneous brain activity exhibits long-range spatial correlations detected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in newborns when (1) long neuronal pathways are still developing, and (2) the electrical brain activity consists of developmentally unique, intermittent events believed to guide activity-dependent brain wiring. We studied this spontaneous electrical brain activity using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) of premature and fullterm babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration during last months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes were found to follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain activity exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the developmentally essential high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial correlations. There were no clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but clear frontal and parieto-occipital modules at term age. A significant fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the development of the graph measure clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality was found in the fMRI recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early EEG activity and fMRI signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The results are compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits intermittent long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Objective: The authors reviewed the published literature on the acute and long-term neurobehavioral effects on infants and children of either in utero exposure to maternal depression or in utero exposure to antidepressants. Data Sources: The PubMed electronic database was searched to locate 292 English-language studies from the first available year to October 2013 using the keywords pregnancy, antidepressants, depression, perinatal, and neurobehavioral. Study Selection: The authors reviewed only prospective studies that assessed the impact of maternal depression during pregnancy or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on (1) clearly defined short-term behavioral outcomes in infants (perinatal outcome) or (2) longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children (neurodevelopmental outcome). Data Extraction: Studies were included if they were prospective and assessed the impact of maternal depression or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on clearly measurable, objective short-term and longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children. Results: Untreated depression during pregnancy is associated with short-term neonatal effects, including increased distress after delivery, less than optimal orientation and motor activity, and disrupted sleep. Longer-term effects on neurobehavioral outcome have also been reported, including disruptive social behavior, depression, and changes in the period of sensitivity for language discrimination. Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse short-term perinatal symptomatology, including effects on autonomic and motor activity, habituation, and sleep. Longer-term studies of neurobehavioral outcomes of in utero antidepressant exposure suggest potential effects on gross motor function and language development but not cognition. Conclusions: In utero exposure to either maternal depression or antidepressants carries risks to the developing fetus. Treatment decisions regarding whether and how to treat depression during pregnancy must be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the impact of these decisions on both mother and infant. © Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To study the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) in a certain rural area in Upper Egypt, identifying the factors that might be involved in its genesis. Study design: The current study is a cross-sectional community-based study. Methods: The study was conducted in El-Burgaia village, 5km north to El-Minia city over a period of three months. Systematic random sampling was used to interview 200 female subjects, who gave birth within the last 14 months preceding interview. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was applied to these females to identify the presence of PPD. Results: The sample size analysed was 200 females, 99 (49.5%) of them had PPD (29.5% had minor PPD and 20% had major PPD). The age of the study subjects ranged between 19 and 45 years old (mean age 29±5.2 years). PPD occurred more significantly among wives of less educated husbands (P=0.03). PPD was more common among those previously diagnosed of having depression or prescribed antidepressants (P=0.02), in addition to those females experiencing financial problems after delivery (P=0.0001). PPD was even more common among females having complications after delivery (P=0.01). Using logistic regression analysis, total household income, child sleeping hours, complications after delivery and support of husband after delivery were found to be statistically associated with PPD. Conclusions: PPD is relatively common among rural females of El-Minia Governorate. Certain factors in these females, in the mere gestation and delivery after which they become depressed, and in the environment in which they live in, may all come to play a part in the emergence of their psychiatric illness. © 2014 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to measure the brain activity of preterm infants treated with caffeine citrate and doxapram for preterm apnoea, using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), to identify any adverse effects on cerebral function. Methods We analysed the aEEG tracings of 13 preterm infants <30 weeks of gestation before, during and after doxapram treatment, with regard to background activity (percentages of continuous and discontinuous patterns), occurrence of sleep-wake cycling and appearance of electrographic seizure activity. They were also compared with 61 controls without doxapram treatment. Results During doxapram treatment, aEEG tracings showed an increase in continuous background activity (19 ± 30% before treatment, 38 ± 35% during treatment) and a decrease in discontinuous patterns. In addition, they showed more frequent electrographic seizure activity (0% before treatment, 15 ± 37% during treatment) and less frequent sleep-wake cycling (92 ± 27% before treatment, 85 ± 37% during treatment) could be observed. These results were confirmed when compared to the control group. Conclusion Doxapram treatment influences aEEG in preterm infants, showing higher percentages of continuous activity as well as more electrographic seizure activity and less sleep-wake cycling. It should, therefore, be used with caution in very preterm infants. ©2014 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to identify and explain the essences and structures of maternal conflicts in Vietnamese married immigrant women in Korea. Methods: A phenomenological methodology was used for the study. Eleven Vietnamese married immigrant women participated in the study. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using Colaizzi's method. Results: Four categories, 10 clusters and 26 themes emerged from the data for the experience in maternal conflicts of Vietnamese married immigrant women. The four categories were ‘An unprepared young motherhood in another culture’, ‘Feeling left out of the mother’s place along the bands of Nap tai tradition’, ‘My image is like not-being able to stand alone/be independent’ and ‘Finding hope in motherhood despite of conflicts and stigmas’. Conclusion: Vietnamese married immigrant women experienced not only the negative aspects but also sublimation of maternal conflicts. Based on the results, health professionals need to develop effective nursing interventions toward a positive maternal identity and approach with interculturalism for the Vietnamese married immigrant women in Korea. © 2014 Korean Society of Nursing Science.

AB  - The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued recommendations in 2005 and 2011 to reduce sleep-related infant death, which advise against all bedsharing for sleep. These recommendations overemphasize the risks of bedsharing, and this overemphasis has serious unintended consequences. It may result in increased deaths on sofas as tired parents try to avoid feeding their infants in bed. Current evidence shows that other risks are far more potent, such as smoking, shared sleep on sofas, sleeping next to impaired caregivers, and formula feeding. The emphasis on separate sleep is diverting resources away from addressing these critical risk factors. Recommendations to avoid bedsharing may also interfere with breastfeeding. We examine both the evidence behind the AAP recommendations and the evidence omitted from those recommendations. We conclude that the only evidence-based universal advice to date is that sofas are hazardous places for adults to sleep with infants; that exposure to smoke, both prenatal and postnatal, increases the risk of death; and that sleeping next to an impaired caregiver increases the risk of death. No sleep environment is completely safe. Public health efforts must address the reality that tired parents must feed their infants at night somewhere and that sofas are highly risky places for parents to fall asleep with their infants, especially if parents are smokers or under the influence of alcohol or drugs. All messaging must be crafted and reevaluated to avoid unintended negative consequences, including impact on breastfeeding rates, or falling asleep in more dangerous situations than parental beds. We must realign our resources to focus on the greater risk factors, and that may include greater investment in smoking cessation and doing away with aggressive formula marketing. This includes eliminating conflicts of interest between formula marketing companies and organizations dedicated to the health of children. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To assess how change in sleep duration is related to subsequent obesity. Methods: In this 10-year follow-up, 4903 non-pregnant participants answered a questionnaire on sleeping habits, obesity, and lifestyle factors (questions identical to baseline questionnaire). Habitual normal sleepers were defined as sleeping 6-9 h/night at both baseline and follow-up, whereas women sleeping &lt;6 h/night or ≥9 h/night at both occasions were defined as habitual short sleepers and habitual long sleepers, respectively. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations between changes in sleep duration, general obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2), weight gain (≥10 kg) and also, central obesity (waist circumference ≥88 cm), and increase in waist circumference (≥10 cm) at follow-up. Results: Among younger women (aged &lt;40 years) both habitual short sleepers and habitual long sleepers had a higher prevalence of general (short: 31.3%, P &lt; 0.0001; long: 38.1%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (short: 60.5%, P = 0.01; long: 82.4%, P = 0.01) compared with habitual normal sleepers (general obesity: 8.9%; central obesity: 35.9%) at follow-up. Younger women who were short sleepers at baseline but normal sleepers at the follow-up had a higher prevalence of both general (19.3%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (45.4%, P = 0.07) compared with habitual normal sleepers at follow-up. In adjusted analyses, both habitual short [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 6.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.71-17.0] and long (aOR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.09-19.8) sleep durations were risk factors for general obesity in younger women. In younger women habitual long sleep duration was a risk factor also for central obesity (aOR, 6.05; 95% CI, 1.19-30.7) whereas habitual short sleep duration was not (aOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.87-4.81). Similar results were seen also for weight gain and increased waist circumference as dependent variables. In addition, decreased sleep duration from normal to short duration was a risk factor for both weight gain (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14-3.02) and increased waist circumference (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.20-2.81). There were no associations between changes in sleep duration and any of the measures of obesity at the follow-up in women aged &gt;40 years at baseline. Conclusion: In younger women, both habitual short and long sleep duration was a risk factor for obesity, whereas no such relationship was seen in older women. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80 percent of pregnant women. This condition is usually self-limiting, but the symptoms can be distressing and interfere with work, social activities and sleep. Symptoms can often be managed by diet and lifestyle changes, but these interventions may not be successful for everyone. In April 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved doxylamine succinate 10 mg/pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg (Diclegis®) as the first medication to specifically treat NVP in more than 30 years. This article reviews the indications, dosage and nursing interventions associated with using doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine to treat NVP. © 2014 AWHONN.

AB  - Women who develop gestational diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy are at substantially increased risk for type 2 diabetes and comorbidities after pregnancy. Little is known about the role of genetic factors and their interactions with environmental factors in determining the transition from gestational diabetes mellitus to overt type 2 diabetes mellitus. These critical data gaps served as the impetus for this Diabetes & Women's Health study with the overall goal of investigating genetic factors and their interactions with risk factors amenable to clinical or public health interventions in relation to the transition of gestational diabetes mellitus to type 2 diabetes mellitus. To achieve the goal efficiently, we are applying a hybrid design enrolling and collecting data longitudinally from approximately 4000 women with a medical history of gestational diabetes mellitus in two existing prospective cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study II and the Danish National Birth Cohort. Women who had a medical history of gestational diabetes mellitus in one or more of their pregnancies are eligible for the present study. After enrollment, we follow study participants for an additional 2 years to collect updated information on major clinical and environmental factors that may predict type 2 diabetes mellitus risk as well as with biospecimens to measure genetic and biochemical markers implicated in glucose metabolism. Newly collected data will be appended to the relevant existing data for the creation of a new database inclusive of genetic, epigenetic and environmental data. Findings from the study are critical for the development of targeted and more effective strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications in this high-risk population. © 2014 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - Background: Prenatal maternal stress is associated with adverse birth outcomes. Relaxation techniques might be effective in reducing stress during that period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of applied relaxation in reducing anxiety and stress in pregnant women in their second trimester, as well as raising their sense of control. Also we expected to see a difference in some lifestyle factors associated with stress. A randomized control trial with a prospective pretest-posttest experimental design was used. Methods: Sixty primigravida women in their second trimester were assigned randomly to receive a 6-week stress management programme (N= 31) (relaxation breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, RB-PMR, twice a day) or not (N= 29). Self-reported validated measures were used to evaluate perceived stress, health locus of control and anxiety at baseline and at the end of the 6-weeks follow-up. Results: The results of the study demonstrated significant benefits from the use of the techniques in the psychological state of the pregnant women. The systematic implementation of the proposed relaxation techniques contributed in the reduction of perceived stress (mean change -3.23, 95% CI: -4.29 to -0.29) and increased the sense of control (mean change 1.99, 95% CI: 0.02-3.7). Conclusion: The findings suggest beneficial effects of relaxation on reducing perceived stress as well as increment of sense of control in pregnant women. The results of this study support the claim that training in the proposed relaxation techniques may constitute an ideal, non-pharmaceutical, intervention that can promote well-being, at least during pregnancy. Longer studies will be necessary in the future, in order to examine the long-term effects of relaxation techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - MASA syndrome (OMIM 303350) is a rare X-linked recessive neurologic disorder, also called CRASH syndrome, spastic paraplegia 1 and Gareis-Mason syndrome. The acronym MASA describes four major signs: Mental retardation, Aphasia, Shuffl ing gait and Adducted thumbs. A more suitable name for this syndrome is L1 syndrome because the disorder has been associated with mutations in the neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) gene. The syndrome has severe symptoms in males, while females are carriers because only one X chromosome is aff ected. The aim of this report is to show similarities and diff erences in clinical manifestations between twins with the L1CAM gene mutation and to emphasize the importance of genetic counseling. Our patients were dizygotic twins born prematurely at 35 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy was complicated with early bleeding and gestational diabetes. Immediately after birth, hypertonia of lower extremities was observed in both twins. Sixteen-year clinical follow up showed spastic paraparetic form with shuffl ing gait, clumsiness, delayed speech development, lower intellectual functioning at the level of mild to moderate mental retardation, primary nocturnal enuresis, behavioral and sleep disorder (more pronounced in the second twin). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, complete lack of the anterior commissure, and internal hydrocephalus. Electroencephalograms showed nonspecifi c slower dysrhythmic changes. Kidney ultrasound showed mild dilatation in the channel system of both kidneys in both twins. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. Molecular genetic testing identifi ed homozygous intron 26 L1CAM gene IVS26-12G→A mutation in both twins. The mother is carrier of the same heterozygous mutations. In conclusion, our patients, fraternal twins, show similar clinical changes typical of the MASA syndrome. After identifying the specifi c genetic mutations, this family has become eligible for genetic counseling and informative for prenatal diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction: Menopause is a period of life that a permanent cessation of menstruation occurs due to loss of ovarian follicular activity. This study was done to determine the level of physical activity and its relationship with the severity of menopausal symptoms. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on 600 menopause women in 2013. Cases were selected randomly through cluster sampling method. Data were gathered based on a self-made questionnaire on demographic characteristics(Age, education, occupation, socioeconomic status, marital status, and number of pregnancies), international physical activity questionnaire and menopausal symptoms. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 21andKolmogorov-Smirnovand Spearman correlation coefficient tests. P value less than 0.01 was considered significant and p value less than 0.05 was also synchronous. Results: Most women complained of menopausal symptoms in moderate, severe and very severe scales were sleep disorders (39%), myalgia (42.5%) and flushing (23.2%). Daily work, transportation and leisure showed inverse association with hot flashes, heart problems, sleep disorders, depression, decreased libido, incontinence, vaginal dryness and muscle pain and working at home was also showed significant inverse association with heart problems and muscle pain (p<0.05). Conclusion: Exercise is very important to stabilize the natural circulation and other physiological activities in postmenopausal women. © 2014 - Journal Management System.

AB  - Behavioral contributions to the pathogenesis of prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) include lifestyle behaviors including dietary intake, exercise, sedentariness, sleep, and stress. The purpose of this paper is to review evidence for the metabolic pathways by which the behavior is linked to T2D. Evidence for interventions, which change each of the lifestyle behaviors, is discussed. The article will close with a brief discussion on how new technologies may provide opportunities to better understand relationships between moment-to-moment fluctuations in behaviors and diabetes pathogenesis, as well as provide opportunities to personalize and adapt interventions to achieve successful behavior change and maintenance of that change. Especially promising are new technologies, which assist in tracking lifestyle behaviors along with clinical and metabolic outcomes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Adequate bowel preparation is important for successful colonoscopic examination. Several effective colonic cleansing agents are available and routinely prescribed, but each carries its own limitations and benefits from particular dosing regimens. The most frequently prescribed colonic cleansing agent, the polyethylene glycol (PEG) cathartic solution, suffers from low patient compliance in general, due to its unpalatable taste and smell coupled with the large ingested volumes required. However, PEG is preferred over other cathartics for use in individuals of advanced age, sufferers of chronic kidney disease, heart failure and inflammatory bowel disease, and women who are pregnant or lactating. The laxative agents sodium phosphate (NaP) and sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate have been applied and have improved patient compliance and tolerance. NaP, however, should be avoided in individuals with impaired renal function or plasma clearance, such as those with chronic kidney disease, who are taking drugs that affect renal function, or who suffer from heart failure. Other special conditions that may affect an individual's tolerance of the cathartic agent or ability to complete the administration routine include stroke, severe constipation, hematochezia, suspicious lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and mental disorders such as dementia. All ingestible bowel preparation solutions can be instilled into the stomach and duodenum through nasogastric tube or esophagogastroduodenoscope with the aid of a water irrigation pump for patients with difficulties swallowing or ingesting the large volumes of fluid required. In addition, dietary regimens based on clear liquids and low-residue foods for 1-4 d prior to the colonoscopy may be supplemental bowel preparation strategies. Achieving an effective and safe cleansing of the bowel is important for successful colonoscopy in all patients, so full knowledge of the individual's condition and capabilities is necessary to select the most appropriate colonic cleansing agent and delivery regimen. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

AB  - Objective To assess whether gynecologists have impaired laparoscopic skills and/or reduced cognitive function after long on-call hours. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Norway.
Population 28 gynecologists working long shifts in a single department.
Methods Pre-training of laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality simulator. Simulator- and cognitive testing on two different occasions; one in the morning after a normal nights' sleep at home and one in the morning directly after 17.5 h on call. The virtual reality simulator test consisted of three repetitive salpingectomies in an ectopic pregnancy module. The cognitive test consisted of a standardized cognitive test battery (Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery).
Main outcome measures Simulated laparoscopic performance was assessed by time to perform the procedure, total length of instrument movement (tip trajectory) and blood loss. Cognitive function was assessed by reaction time, errors and total score.
Results No significant impairment in laparoscopic skills was found after 17.5 h on call. Cognitive testing revealed a statistically significant increase in reaction time post-call. Construct validity for the metrics "time to perform procedure" and "tip trajectory" in the ectopic pregnancy module was established in a validation study prior to our main study.
Conclusions We were not able to detect impaired laparoscopic skills among gynecologists tested by a virtual reality procedural module after 17.5 h on call. We found a small increase in reaction time but no other signs of reduced cognitive function. The study adds information on surgical performance of sleep-deprived gynecologists. © 2014 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology. © 2014 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the transition to parenthood and mental health in first-time parents in detail and explore any differences in this transition in the context of parental gender and postpartum mental health. Semistructured clinical interviews (Birmingham Interview for Maternal Mental Health) were carried out with 46 women and 40 men, 5 months after birth. Parents were assessed on pre- and postpartum anxiety, depression, and postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a range of adjustment and relationship variables. One fourth of the men and women reported anxiety in pregnancy, reducing to 21% of women and 8% of men after birth. Pregnancy and postpartum depression rates were roughly equal, with 11% of women and 8% of men reporting depression. Postpartum PTSD was experienced by 5% of parents. Postpartum mental health problems were significantly associated with postpartum sleep deprivation (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5), complications in labor (OR = 5.1), lack of postpartum partner support (OR = 8.0), feelings of parental unworthiness (OR = 8.3), and anger toward the infant (OR = 4.4). Few gender differences were found for these variables. This study thus highlights the importance of focusing interventions on strengthening the couple's relationship and avoiding postnatal sleep deprivation, and to address parents' feelings of parental unworthiness and feelings of anger toward their baby. © 2014 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

Binary outcomes were high 'internalizing' (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/ hyperactive) problems (high was >90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were 'none'; 'early onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at school age); and 'late onset' (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old. Results Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15; internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62, 1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association. Conclusions Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

AB  - Objective: This study investigates whether maternal socio-demographic and clinical characteristics influence the site of placental implantation so that placental localization and associated abnormalities can be predicted.
Methods: This study reviews 500 healthy women with singleton pregnancy that were consecutively admitted to the study center and eventually delivered healthy newborns.
Results: The most frequently observed sites of placentation were anterior uterine wall (53.2%), posterior uterine wall (28.8%), lateral uterine walls (10.0%) and uterine fundus (8.0%), respectively. The women with fundal placentation had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.044 and p = 0.040, respectively). Supine sleeping position was more frequent in women with anterior placenta and (OR: 11.568, 95% CI: 2.720-49.193) and prone sleeping position was more frequent in women with posterior placenta (OR: 15.449, 95% CI: 2.151-52.978) (p = 0.001). The women who favored to sleep in right lateral position were more likely to have lateral placentation, while the women who used to sleep in left lateral position were more likely to have fundal placentation (p = 0.001).
Conclusions: Sleeping position in early pregnancy may influence placental implantation site. The probable mechanism may refer to the alterations in uterine perfusion which is induced by the change in systemic blood pressure and dominant sleeping position. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Objective. To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects. A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11-16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. Main outcome measures. Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine. Results. Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity. Conclusions. Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the changes of perceived health status, physical symptoms, and sleep satisfaction of postpartum women over time. A longitudinal design was used. Participants were 137 healthy postpartum women who had not been diagnosed with any medical diseases. Data were collected by a self-report questionnaire at three periods, the second day, 4-6 weeks, and 12-14 weeks postpartum. Women's perceived health status was lower at 4-6 weeks than on the second day after childbirth, physical symptoms were more frequent at 4-6 weeks than on the second day after childbirth, and sleep satisfaction was lower at 4-6 weeks than at 12-14 weeks postpartum. Tiredness or fatigue was the most frequent symptom experienced by postpartum women at all three periods. These results indicate that the period from 4 to 6 weeks postpartum is the most difficult time for mothers. Therefore, there is a need to develop nursing interventions to alleviate fatigue and other symptoms, and to help and support women during the period 4-6 weeks postpartum, a critical period for interventions. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to dyslipidemia, which is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Although this link is thought to reflect response to heightened stress, behavioral health risks, including smoking, alcohol dependence, and poor sleep quality, may mediate the relationship between PTSD and dyslipidemia. Methods: To test this hypothesis, serum lipid levels were collected from 220 young adults (18-39 years old), 103 of whom were diagnosed with PTSD. Results: PTSD and associated depressive symptoms were negatively related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), p=.04, and positively related to triglyceride (TG) levels, p=.04. Both associations were mediated by cigarette consumption and poor sleep quality, the latter of which accounted for 83% and 93% of the effect of PTSD and depression on HDL-C and TG, respectively. Conclusions: These results complement recent findings highlighting the prominence of health behaviors in linking PTSD with cardiovascular risk. © 2014.

AB  - Backgrounda Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size. Methodsa We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32. 6â€‰±â€‰1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8â€‰±â€‰9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size. Resultsa A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (pâ€‰&lt;â€ ‰0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r 2â€‰=â€‰0.16, pâ€‰=â€‰0.11). Conclusiona The present study supports the hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size.

AB  - Fetal movements (FM) related heart rate accelerations (AC) are an important maturation criterion. Since Doppler-based time resolution is not sufficient for accompanying heart rate variability analysis, the work is aimed at a comprehensive FM-AC analysis using magnetocardiographic recordings from fetuses during sleep. We identify FM and AC by independent component analysis and automatic recognition algorithms. We investigate associations between FM and AC of different magnitude by means of event coincidence and time series cross-correlation over the maturation period of 21-40 weeks of gestation (WGA). FM related AC appear with increasing AC magnitude and WGA. Vice versa, AC related FM appear independent of WGA, but more frequently with increasing AC amplitude. The FM-AC correlation exists already at 21 WGA and further increases with WGA while the variability of its time delay decreases. Hence, FM and AC are clearly associated over the whole investigated maturation period. The increase of FM related AC runs parallel to the increasing AC magnitude. The MCG methodology was confirmed and results from previous Doppler-based analyses reproduced. Hence, MCG recordings allow the collective analysis of heart rate variability based maturation indices and FM related AC. This synergism may improve the diagnosis of fetal developmental disorders. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - Study Objectives: The study was performed to evaluate the hypothesis that the extremely obese manifest sleep disordered breathing with a preponderance of hypopneas and relative paucity of obstructive apneas. Methods: Retrospective review of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) matched for age and gender, comparing two groups, Group A: body mass index (BMI) &lt; 35, Group B: BMI ≥ 45. Exclusion criteria: age &lt; 18 years, pregnancy, ≥ 5 central apneas/hour, BMI ≥ 35 &lt; 45. Primary Outcome Measure: Hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index (HI), oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), and presence of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Statistical methods: t-test for independent samples; Mann-Whitney, linear regression with natural log transformation, and Kruskal-Wallis χ2. Descriptive statistics were expressed as interquartile range, median and mean ± standard deviation, p &lt; 0.05 considered significant. Results: Group A (n = 45): age = 50.6 ± 11.5 years, BMI = 28.9 ± 4 kg/m2; Group B (n = 45): age = 47.4 ± 12.7 years, BMI = 54.5 ± 8 kg/m2. HAR was significantly higher in Group B (38.8 ± 50.7) than Group A (10.6 ± 16.5), p = 0.0006, as was HI (28.7 ± 28.6 in B vs 12.6 ± 8.4 in A, p = 0.0005) and AHI (35.5 ± 33.8 vs 22 ± 23, p = 0.03), but not apnea index. HAR was significantly higher in Group B regardless of race, gender, or presence of OHS. The BMI was the only significant predictor of HAR (adjusted r2 = 0.138; p = 0.002) in a linear regression model with natural log transformation of the HAR performed for age, gender, race, BMI, and PetCO2. Conclusion: Extremely obese patients manifest OSAHS with a preponderance of hypopneas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleeping on sofas increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and other sleep-related deaths. We sought to describe factors associated with infant deaths on sofas. METHODS: We analyzed data for infant deaths on sofas from 24 states in 2004 to 2012 in the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths Case Reporting System database. Demographic and environmental data for deaths on sofas were compared with data for sleep-related infant deaths in other locations, using bivariate and multivariable, multinomial logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1024 deaths on sofas made up 12.9% of sleep-related infant deaths. They were more likely than deaths in other locations to be classified as accidental suffocation or strangulation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.3) or ill-defined cause of death (aOR 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5). Infants who died on sofas were less likely to be Hispanic (aOR 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) compared with non-Hispanic white infants or to have objects in the environment (aOR 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5-0.7) and more likely to be sharing the surface with another person (aOR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9-3.0), to be found on the side (aOR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.4), to be found in a new sleep location (aOR 6.5; 95% CI, 5.2-8.2), and to have had prenatal smoke exposure (aOR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6). Data on recent parental alcohol and drug consumption were not available. CONCLUSIONS: The sofa is an extremely hazardous sleep surface for infants. Deaths on sofas are associated with surface sharing, being found on the side, changing sleep location, and experiencing prenatal tobacco exposure, which are all risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome and sleep-related deaths.

AB  - Introduction: Maternal health in pregnancy is one of the most crucial ways to maintain maternal and fetal health. Pioneer physicians of Iranian traditional medicine have focused their efforts on maintaining the individual and community health and have recommended simple health-promoting and functional instructions during pregnancy that in this study ،these guidelines have been summarized and compared and contrasted with new articles and researches.
Methods: In this review and library study, the main resource textbooks of traditional medicine and new studies have been evaluated and the findings of scientists of modern medicine were briefly compared with those of traditional medicine, and new researches on nutrition, sexual intercourse, bathing and mental and emotional status and lifestyle during pregnancy were reviewed in Google Scholar, Pubmed, Magiran, SID, Irandoc, and Iranmedex databases.
Results: In perspective of Iranian traditional medicine, to maintain healthy life and prevention from the incidence of diseases, observing some principles is necessary which are titled as six principles of maintaining health that precise and practical recommendations are suggested about health of climate, food, balanced physical activity, sleeping and wakefulness, custody and disposal of waste materials from the body, and specially mental health.
Conclusion: Regarding the meticulous attention of Iranian Tradition Medicine scholars to maternal healthcare during pregnancy, perhaps now we can use the findings of physicians about pregnancy health issues and ideas and research findings related to this period and lay the foundation of researches on the statement and experiences of great scholars and practitioners such as Avicenna and Razi. © 2014, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Infant-caregiver attachment disorganization has been linked to many long-term negative psychosocial outcomes. While various prevention programs appear to be effective in preventing disorganized attachment, methods currently used to identify those at risk are unfortunately either overly general or impractical. The current investigation tested whether women's prenatal biases in identifying infant expressions of emotion-tendencies previously shown to relate to some of the maternal variables associated with infant attachment, including maternal traumatization, trauma symptoms, and maternal sensitivity-could predict infant attachment classification at 18 months postpartum. Logistic regression analyses revealed that together with women's adult history of high betrayal traumatization, response concordance with a normative reference sample in labeling infant expressions as negatively valenced, and the number of infant facial expressions that participants classified as "sad" and "angry" predicted subsequent infant attachment security versus disorganization. Implications for screening and prevention are discussed. © 2014 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - Aim To compare blood pressure reactions (BPR) of infants to mild stress for evidence of adverse cardiovascular effects of passive exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and early infancy. Methods An observational field study conducted in Crete. We compared 4- to 6-month olds of lifelong nonsmokers minimally (controls, n = 9) or frequently exposed to tobacco smoke (passive smokers; n = 10) with those born to habitual smokers (n = 6). Smoke exposure was verified biochemically (urine cotinine each trimester and at study). We recorded beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) during brief repositioning manoeuvres performed during a daytime nap and analysed BPR (% change in BP during head-up tilt) for associations with maternal and infant cotinine. Results We observed a 20-fold difference between BPR of infants of controls versus passive smokers - exceptional given number of infants (α error/confidence level <10% i.e. power >90%). The BPR declined linearly as the infant's (but not mother's) cotinine level rose (p = 0.04), indicating abnormal BPR was caused mainly by postnatal smoke exposure. Infants of active smokers differed from those of passive smokers. Conclusion Cardiovascular effects of passive smoking by a newborn infant manifest early on and are exceptionally strong. They can be largely avoided by keeping the home smoke rigorously free. ©2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of nocturia according to the International Continence Society (ICS) definition in Turkish women and to determine the associated risk factors and the correlation of other voiding symptoms with nocturia. Materials and Methods: A prospective epidemiological study was carried out by use of self-reported questionnaires in 4,250 reproductive-aged women from January 2013 to May 2013. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form and a questionnaire developed by the researchers according to the ICS were administered to define nocturia and other lower urinary tract symptoms. Other physical, reproductive, and health characteristics were also recorded concurrently. Results: Overall, 1,636 women were included in the final analyses. The women had an average age of 34.4±5.26 years. The overall prevalence of nocturia was 34.7% (567 of 1,636 women). Women with nocturia were older (p<0.001), had a higher body mass index (p=0.026), and had more children (p<0.001). Nocturia occurred more frequently in women with a history of nocturnal enuresis (p<0.001). Three or more pregnancies, 3 or more deliveries, and age >40 years were significant risk factors for nocturia. We also found that other lower urinary tract symptoms correlated significantly (p<0.001) with nocturia. Conclusions: Although the prevalence of nocturia is higher with increasing age, younger adults are also affected. Nocturia may cause sleep disorders, mood disturbances, reduced quality of life, and distractibility. Thus, even if one void nightly causes a patient to experience bother, nocturia should be queried about and should be treated if necessary according to the cause of the disease. © The Korean Urological Association, 2014.

AB  - Background: Though migraine and tension type headache are both commonly diagnosed in childhood, little is known about their determinants when diagnosed prior to puberty onset. Our aim was to determine psychosocial- and health-related risk factors of migraine and tension-type headache in 11 year old children.
Methods: 871 New Zealand European children were enrolled in a longitudinal study at birth and data were collected at birth, 1, 3.5, 7, and 11 years of age. Primary headache was determined at age 11 years based on the International Headache Society. Perinatal factors assessed were small for gestational age status, sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal perceived stress, and maternal school leaving age. Childhood factors assessed were sleep duration, percent body fat, television watching, parent and self-reported total problem behaviour, being bullied, and depression.
Results: Prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was 10.5% and 18.6%, respectively. Both migraine and TTH were significantly associated with self-reported problem behaviour in univariable logistic regression analyses. Additionally, migraine was associated with reduced sleep duration, and both sleep and behaviour problems remained significant after multivariable analyses. TTH was also significantly associated with antenatal maternal smoking, higher body fat, and being bullied. For TTH, problem behaviour measured at ages 3.5 and 11 years both remained significant after multivariable analysis. Being born small for gestational age was not associated with either headache group.
Conclusions: Although they share some commonality, migraine and tension-type headache are separate entities in childhood with different developmental characteristics. The association between primary headache and problem behaviour requires further investigation. © 2014, Waldie et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Design Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between post-partum psychological distress and PWR at 9 months, after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual influences, and maternal behaviours. Method Pregnant women (N = 126) completed a series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9 months post-partum.
Results Hierarchical regression indicated that gestational weight gain, shorter duration (6 months or less) of breastfeeding, and post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months are associated with higher PWR at 9 months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence. Conclusion Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Post-partum weight retention (PWR) is a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. Causes of PWR are complex and multifactorial. There is increasing evidence that psychological factors play a key role in predicting high PWR. What does this study add? Post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months is associated with PWR at 9 months post-birth. Post-partum depression, stress and anxiety have less influence on PWR at 9 months. Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should target body dissatisfaction.
Objectives Post-partum weight retention (PWR) has been identified as a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining PWR. © 2013 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Question: An increasing number of my patients are asking about the safety of consuming non-alcoholic beer and other alcohol-free versions of alcoholic beverages during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as they believe that these drinks might be a "safer" alternative to regular alcoholic beverages. What are Motherisk's recommendations regarding these products? Answer: Such drinks might contain higher ethanol levels than what is indicated on their labels. As there is no known safe level of alcohol intake in pregnancy, abstinence from non-alcoholic beverages would eliminate any risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Although it is likely that moderate intake of non-alcoholic beverages would pose no harm to breastfed infants, briefly delaying breastfeeding after consumption of such drinks would ensure that the infant is not exposed to alcohol.

AB  - The fetus, which develops within a fluid-filled amniotic sac, relies on the placenta for respiratory gas exchange rather than the lungs. While not involved in fetal oxygenation, fetal breathing movements (FBM) nevertheless have an important role in lung growth and in development of respiratory muscles and neural regulation. FBM are regulated differently in many respects than postnatal respiration, which results from the unique intrauterine environment. Prominent distinctions of FBM include its episodic nature and apnea-sensitivity to hypoxia. The latter characteristic is the basis for using FBM in the assessment of fetuses at risk for hypoxic injury. At birth, the transition to continuous postnatal respiration involves a fall in temperature, gaseous distention of the lungs, activation of the Hering-Breuer reflexes, and functional connectivity of afferent O<inf>2</inf> chemoreceptor activity with respiratory motoneurons and arousal centers. Importantly, exposure to drugs or adverse conditions in utero not only can change patterns of FBM but also can lead to epigenetic dysregulation in postnatal respiration. Such changes, can blunt respiratory and arousal defenses against hypoxic challenges in sleep. Thus, fetal hypoxia and/or drug exposure may in later life dispose sleeping infants, children, and adults to hypertension, diabetes mellitus, brain injury, and sudden death. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Introduction: A growing body of literature has emerged describing the risks of extended-duty shifts and sleep deprivation. Worldwide, midwifery organizations have not adopted standards for practitioner or student duty shifts. This project reviews the literature related to extended-duty shifts in an effort to develop evidence-based recommendations for student nurse-midwives/student midwives (SNMs/SMs). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through electronic databases, major journals, and reference lists published in English since January 2001. Primary research studies evaluating sleep deprivation and shift duration were included. Studies that did not include the target population (shift workers) and those that formed conclusions related to extended-duty shifts greater than 30 hours were excluded. In addition, an extensive worldwide review of duty-hour recommendations from more than 300 health care organizations was conducted. Results: A total of 40 studies met the inclusion criteria. Extended-duty shifts (those greater than 12 hours) increased the risk for cognitive and physical functional errors, safety concerns, and decreased quality of life from sleep deprivation. Cognitive function errors included attention lapses, visual tracking errors, decreased mentation and immediate recall, and decreased learning capacity. Physical errors included decreased motor skills and slowed reaction times in clinical simulations. These deficits led to an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, needle sticks, and performance equivalent to unsafe blood alcohol concentrations. An overall decrease in quality of life and job satisfaction was linked to extended-duty shifts. Seven organizations for medical residents or advanced practice nurses have developed policy statements on duty shifts, with extended-duty shift limitations between 12 and 24 hours. Discussion: The risks associated with extended-duty shifts may inhibit the development of SNMs/SMs into competent practitioners and place patients at risk. It is recommended that midwifery education programs adopt evidence-based limitations for the duty shifts of SNMs/SMs. © 2014 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus ambient sound. Design: Repeated-measures randomized controlled trial. Setting: Special care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center. Participants: Clinically stable preterm infants (22) born at > 28 weeks gestation and enrolled at > 32 weeks gestation and their mothers. Methods: Infants were exposed to lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall. Results: There was no discernible infant response to music and therefore no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over time. However during the mothers' presence (first 12 minutes), the infants exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p = .024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was not significant. Conclusion: Infants may have been unable to detect the music against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants' physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and departure of the mothers. © 2014 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

AB  - While the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) typically occurs during the childbearing years, many women living with MS are of perimenopausal age. There is frequent overlap between menopausal and MS-related symptoms and co-morbidities (e.g. sexual dysfunction, mood disorders and bladder function). Furthermore, some MS symptoms may be exacerbated by perimenopausal changes such as hot flashes or sleep disturbance. The MS neurologist may frequently be the first to become aware of these symptoms and to play a role in monitoring and managing them. In this review, we describe immunological and neurologic changes at menopause as they may impact MS. We then review common symptoms, including fatigue, depression, sexual function, pain and insomnia, and provide both behavioral and pharmacological suggestions for their management. Next, we discuss the need for osteoporosis and cancer screening in perimenopausal women with MS. Finally, we highlight important research gaps, including what effect, if any, the menopausal transition may play on MS disease course as well as the potential modulatory role of hormone replacement therapies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background: Continuity of midwife-led care is recommended in maternity care because of its various positive outcomes. In Japan, midwife-led care is receiving broad attention as well. In order to popularise midwifery care within the entire system of perinatal care in Japan, there is a need to show evidence that continuity of midwife care for women will bring about positive outcomes. Aim: The objectives of this study were to compare the health outcomes of women and infants who received midwife-led care with obstetrician-led care in Japan. Methods: This was an observational study using non-random purposive sampling with a survey questionnaire. Settings where midwife-led care and obstetrician-led care were chosen by purposive samples. Participants were low-risk women who received antenatal care and delivered a term-singleton-infant at the participating settings during the research period. Measurements were: Women-centred care pregnancy questionnaire, Stein's maternity blues questionnaire, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Findings: Midwife-led care was perceived by women to be beneficial and had no adverse outcomes compared to obstetrician-led care. Main findings are: (1) Perception of Women-centred care was higher; (2) Less premature rupture of membranes, and the Apgar scores of the infants were similar; (3) Exclusively breast-feeding during hospitalisation and at one-month postpartum; (4) Stein's maternity blues scale scores was lower in women who received midwife-led care than those who received obstetrician-led care. Conclusions: Continuity of midwife-led care was perceived by women to be beneficial and had no adverse outcomes. Therefore, midwife-led care in low-risk pregnancy could be applicable and recommended. © 2014 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate which prepartum determinants contribute to the development of postpartum (PP) fatigue among working women in the Netherlands. Methods: A prospective cohort study in 15 Dutch companies was conducted to measure different potential predictors using self-administrated questionnaires at baseline and at 30. weeks of pregnancy. Fatigue was measured at 12 (N. = 523) and 52. weeks (N. = 436) PP using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS). A CIS score. &gt;. 76 was defined as fatigue. Results: The prevalence of fatigue at 12 and 52weeks PP was 24.5% and 18.1%, respectively. Fourteen predictive factors were found for fatigue (R2=0.37) at 12weeks PP. Ten predictive factors were found for fatigue at 52weeks PP (R2=0.36). In general, less favourable work relationships and characteristics, poorer mental health, more passive coping styles, more sleeping problems, more fatigue during pregnancy, and beliefs about child care arrangements were related to PP fatigue. At 30weeks of pregnancy, only more fatigue (OR=3.69, p&lt;0.001; OR=2.68, p=0.02) and poorer mental health (OR=0.50, p=0.02; OR=0.90, p=0.78) predicted fatigue both at 12 and 52weeks PP. Conclusions: A large number of predictive factors for PP fatigue were found. These findings indicate that different aspects can contribute to being fatigued after pregnancy. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of possible interventions by employers and/or occupational physicians. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The occurrence of common pregnancy-related medical disorders identifies women at high risk of developing future vascular disease. Systematic reviews of cohort studies demonstrate that gestational diabetes confers a 7-fold risk increase for type 2 diabetes, and preeclampsia confers a 1.8-fold risk increase for type 2 diabetes and 3.4-fold risk increase for hypertension. Gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) increase the risk of premature vascular disease, but the 2-fold risk increase associated with preeclampsia is only partially explained by the development of traditional vascular risk factors. Despite the compelling evidence for gestational diabetes and HDP as vascular risk indicators, there are no published Canadian vascular prevention guidelines that recognize these postpartum women. In contrast, the 2011 American Heart Association guidelines on cardiovascular disease in women include gestational diabetes and HDP in their vascular risk assessment. Studies indicate that the importance surveillance of vascular risk factors in these women after pregnancy is underappreciated by the women themselves and their physicians. Although a prudent diet and physically active lifestyle were demonstrated to reduce diabetes risk in women with a gestational diabetes history in the American Diabetes Prevention Program trial, adoption of these health behaviours is low; qualitative studies confirm a need for tailored strategies that address barriers and provide social support. Further research is also needed on approaches to reduce vascular risk in women with a history of gestational diabetes and HDP. Otherwise, an early window of opportunity for chronic disease prevention in young, high-risk women will be missed. © 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

AB  - This paper examines the existence of social interactions in malaria preventive behaviors in Sub-Saharan Africa, that is, whether an individual's social environment has an influence on the individual's preventive behaviors. We focus on the two population groups which are the most vulnerable to malaria (children under 5 years and pregnant women) and on two preventive behaviors (sleeping under a bednet and taking intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). We define the social environment of the individual as people living in the same region. To detect social interactions, we calculate the size of the social multiplier by comparing the effects of an exogenous variable at individual and regional levels. Our data come from 92 surveys for 29 Sub-Saharan countries between 1999 and 2012, and they cover approximately 660,000 children and 95,000 women. Our results indicate that there are social interactions in malaria preventive behaviors in the form of social multipliers effects of women's education and household wealth. The long-run effects of these characteristics on preventive behaviors at the regional level are larger than those apparent at the individual level. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of infant mortality from the ages of one month and one year, in developed countries. The incidence has dramatically decreased in countries where the "none prone sleeping" position was adopted. Nevertheless, in the last few years this decrease has stabilized. Considering that in more than 95% of the cases of SIDS two or more risk factor are involved, we must reconsider the preventive measures. In the present paper, we will review the recommendations and preventive measures based on the most important modifiable risk factors: supine position during sleeping, firm sleep surface, room sharing without bed sharing, avoid soft objects in the bed, avoid overheating, pacifier use, breastfeeding, avoid smoking and other substances during pregnancy, prenatal care, as well as the lack of evidence regarding monitoring in the household.

AB  - This study aimed to explore a broad range of psychological reactions to trauma in a sample of bereaved parents in order to assess whether the traumatic framework is adequate for describing the entire range of emotional reactions to infant death. A sample of bereaved parents (N = 455) who lost their child through perinatal or postnatal loss were compared to a control group of parents (N = 110) who gave birth to a healthy child. Multivariate regression analysis clearly demonstrated that bereaved parents scored significantly higher on the Depression, Anxiety, Dissociation, Sleep Disturbances, Somatization, Interpersonal Sensitivity, and Aggression subscales of the Trauma Symptom Checklist. Consistent with previous studies, the results showed that for up to 5 years postloss bereaved parents expressed elevated levels of trauma-specific and psychological outcomes, in particular interpersonal sensitivity and aggression. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are one of the most frequently occurring mental disorders. They are the result of abnormal neurotransmitter function within the central nervous system. Treatment options for anxiety disorders include lifestyle modifications, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. While several drug classes may be employed for the treatment of anxiety disorders, antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are considered first-line therapies. Pharmacists should be aware of adverse drug reactions and drug interactions for the various medications used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. © 2000 - 2014 Jobson Medical Information LLC unless otherwise noted.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum. Background: The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence. Methods: A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament. Results: Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy. © 2014, © 2014 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.

AB  - Background & Objectives: Since the human diet is a combination of different foods and that this combination will affect the body differently from when these foods are received separately, the evaluation of dietary patterns is of great importance. The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between dietary patterns during pregnancy and postpartum depression.
Methods: This population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted on 771 women who attended the Ardabil's health care network. This study was carried out in a period of 4 months. In this study, systematic random sampling was used. Dietary data was collected using the Willett-format Dish-based 106 items Semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (DS-FFQ) which was designed and validated specifically for Iranian adults. Dietary patterns were identified through exploratory factor analysis based on 34 predefined food groups. In the present study, individuals who obtained a rating of 13 or higher were considered to be suffering from postpartum depression. Logistic regression was used to estimate OR and 95% CI for postpartum depression in each quartile of patterns.
Results: In the present study, three dietary patterns were identified: mixed dietary pattern, semi-healthy dietary pattern, and fruits and vegetables dietary pattern. The last one was significantly associated with a reduced risk of postpartum depression.
Conclusion: The findings show that a diet of fruits and vegetables during pregnancy is associated with a reduction in the risk of PPD. Additional studies are recommended to confirm these finding. © 2014 Iranian Epidemiological Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. Nowadays it is thought that the main cause of premature birth is subclinical infection. However, none of the currently used methods provide effective prevention to preterm labor. The aim of the study was to determine the concentration of selected chemokines in sera of patients with premature birth without clinical signs of infection (n = 62), threatened preterm labor (n = 47), and term births (n = 28). Method. To assess the concentration of chemokines in the blood serum, we used a multiplex method, which allows the simultaneous determination of 40 chemokines per sample. The sets consist of the following chemokines: 6Ckine/CCL21, Axl, BTC, CCL28, CTACK/CCL27, CXCL16, ENA-78/CXCL5, Eotaxin-3/CCL26, GCP-2/CXC, GRO (GROα/CXCL1, GROβ/CXCL2 and GROγ/CXCL3), HCC-1/CCL14, HCC-4/CCL16, IL-9, IL-17F, IL18-BPa, IL-28A, IL-29, IL-31, IP-10/CXCL10, I-TAC/CXCL11, LIF, LIGHT/TNFSF14, Lymphotactin/XCL1, MCP-2/CCL8, MCP-3/CCL7, MCP-4/CCL13, MDC/CCL22, MIF, MIP-3α/CCL20, MIP-3-β/CCL19, MPIF-1/CCL23, NAP-2/CXCL7, MSPα, OPN, PARC/CCL18, PF4, SDF-1/CXCL12, TARC/CCL17, TECK/CCL25, and TSLP. Results. We showed possible implication of 4 chemokines, that is, HCC-4, I-TAC, MIP-3α, and TARC in women with symptoms of preterm delivery. Conclusion. On the basis of our findings, it seems that the chemokines may play role in the pathogenesis of preterm labor. Defining their potential as biochemical markers of preterm birth requires further investigation on larger group of patients. © 2014 Piotr Laudanski et al.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Down syndrome affects more than 5 million people globally. During the last 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the research efforts focused on therapeutic interventions to improve learning and memory in Down syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: This review summarizes the different functional abnormalities targeted by researchers in mouse models of Down syndrome. Three main strategies have been used: neural stem cell implantation; environmental enrichment and physical exercise; and pharmacotherapy. Pharmacological targets include the choline pathway, GABA and NMDA receptors, DYRK1A protein, oxidative stress and pathways involved in development and neurogenesis. Many strategies have improved learning and memory as well as electrophysiological and molecular alterations in affected animals. To date, eight molecules have been tested in human adult clinical trials. No studies have yet been performed on infants. However, compelling studies reveal that permanent brain alterations originate during fetal life in Down syndrome. Early prenatal diagnosis offers a 28 weeks window to positively impact brain development and improve postnatal cognitive outcome in affected individuals. Only a few approaches (Epigallocatechine gallate, NAP/SAL, fluoxetine, and apigenin) have been used to treat mice in utero; these showed therapeutic effects that persisted to adulthood. SUMMARY: In this article, we discuss the challenges, recent progress, and lessons learned that pave the way for new therapeutic approaches in Down syndrome. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health - Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The combination of stable isotope labeling of amino acids in mammals (SILAM) and laser capture microdissection (LCM) for selective proteomic analysis of the targeted tissues holds tremendous potential for refined characterization of proteome changes within complex tissues such as the brain. The authors have applied this approach to measure changes in relative protein abundance in ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the rat brain that correlate to pharmacological perturbations. Enriched 13C615N2-lysine was introduced in vivo via diet. These animals were sacrificed during the middle of the 12-hour light period to extract isotopically "heavy" proteins, which were then used as a reference for extracts from dosed, unlabeled rats. Animals were administered an orexin peptide (Ox-B), an orexin receptor antagonist (ORA), or a mixture of both (Ox-B + ORA). All samples were obtained at same phase of the sleep cycle. Labeled-pair identification and differential quantitation provided protein identification and expression ratio data. Five proteins were found to exhibit decreased relative abundance after administration of an ORA, including α-synuclein and rat myelin basic protein. Conversely, six proteins showed increased relative abundance upon antagonist treatment, including 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11β-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have deleterious consequences for the fetus, including changes in central nervous system development leading to permanent neurologic alterations and cognitive and behavioral deficits. Individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, including those with and without fetal alcohol syndrome, are identified under the umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). While studies of humans and animal models confirm that even low to moderate levels of exposure can have detrimental effects, critical doses of such exposure have yet to be specified and the most clinically significant and consistent consequences occur following heavy exposure. These consequences are pervasive, devastating, and can result in long-term dysfunction. This chapter summarizes the neurobehavioral, neurologic, and neuroimaging characteristics of FASD, focusing primarily on clinical research of individuals with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, although studies of lower levels of exposure, particularly prospective, longitudinal studies, will be discussed where relevant. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A patient of 6 months and 15 days had 8 to 15 crying episodes during the night since birth, and was only consoled in the arms of the mother. On starting the correct homeopathic treatment the baby began to sleep for longer periods, until sleeping for up to 12. hours, and since then it only woke up in the house of the maternal grandparents who live in Cerdanya. The mother then gave the child a dilution of the medication (on her own account), and the child did not wake up during the second night. Using the history of the mother's pregnancy and being so aware of this in its infancy, the connection between the crying of the baby with the feelings of the mother will become clear. © 2014.

AB  - Human Psychopharmacology recently published my review into the increase in empirical knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA over the past 25 years (Parrott, 2013a). Deficits have been demonstrated in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, complex visual processing, sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, pain, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status. Neuroimaging studies have shown serotonergic deficits, which are associated with lifetime Ecstasy/MDMA usage, and degree of neurocognitive impairment. Basic psychological skills remain intact. Ecstasy/MDMA use by pregnant mothers leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Hence, the damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA were far more widespread than was realized a few years ago. In their critique of my review, Doblin et al. (2014) argued that my review contained misstatements, omitted contrary findings, and recited dated misconceptions. In this reply, I have answered all the points they raised. I have been able to refute each of their criticisms by citing the relevant empirical data, since many of their points were based on inaccurate summaries of the actual research findings. Doblin and colleagues are proponents of the use of MDMA for drug-assisted psychotherapy, and their strongest criticisms were focused on my concerns about this proposal. However, again all the issues I raised were based on sound empirical evidence or theoretical understanding. Indeed I would recommend potentially far safer co-drugs such as D-cycloserine or oxytocin. In summary, MDMA can induce a wide range of neuropsychobiological changes, many of which are damaging to humans. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rationale: Better phenotypic descriptions are needed for chronic lung disease among surviving premature infants. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of respiratory inductance plethysmography in characterizing respiratory system mechanics in preterm infants at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Methods: Respiratory inductance plethysmography was used to obtain the phase angle, φ, to describe rib cage and abdominal dyssynchrony in 65 infants born between 23 and 28 weeks gestation, all of whom were studied at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Up to 60 breaths were evaluated for each subject. Sources of intrasubject variability in φ arising from our methods were explored using mechanical models and by evaluating interobserver agreement. Measurements and Main Results: The mean φ from infants ranged from 5.8-162.9°, with intrasubject coefficients of variation ranging from 11-123%. On the basis of the mechanical model studies, respiratory inductance plethysmography recording and analysis software added <2.3% to the intrasubject variability in φ. Potential inconsistencies in breaths selected could have contributed 8.1%, on average, to the total variability. The recording sessions captured 22.8 ± 9.1 minutes of quiet sleep, and enough breaths were counted to adequately characterize the range of φ in the session. Conclusion: φ is quite variable during even short recording sessions among preterm infants sleeping quietly. The intrasubject variability described herein arises from the instability of the rib cage and abdominal phase relationship, not from the recording and analytical methods used. Despite the variability, φ measurements allowed the majority (80%) of infants to be reliably categorized as having relatively synchronous or dyssynchronous breathing. Respiratory inductance plethysmography is easy to use and should prove useful in quantifying respiratory mechanics in multicenter studies of preterm infants.

AB  - Pediatric patients often undergo anesthesia for ambulatory procedures. This article discusses several common preoperative dilemmas, including whether to postpone anesthesia when a child has an upper respiratory infection, whether to test young women for pregnancy, which children require overnight admission for apnea monitoring, and the effectiveness of nonpharmacological techniques for reducing anxiety. Medication issues covered include the risks of anesthetic agents in children with undiagnosed weakness, the use of remifentanil for tracheal intubation, and perioperative dosing of rectal acetaminophen. The relative merits of caudal and dorsal penile nerve block for pain after circumcision are also discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Children born early (<37 weeks of gestation) are at high risk of a range of motor impairments due to a variety of biological and environmental risk factors. Cerebral palsy occurs more frequently in those children born preterm, with the risk increasing with decreasing gestational age. Mild and moderate motor impairments, consistent with developmental coordination disorder, occur in almost half of those children born preterm and include difficulties with balance, manual dexterity and ball skills. All forms of motor impairment are associated with comorbidities, which may have a greater effect on quality of life, academic achievement and participation in extracurricular activities than the motor impairment itself. Infants at risk of motor impairment can be identified in early infancy with a combination of clinical assessment tools and perinatal risk factors. However, the reliable diagnosis of motor impairment requires follow-up into early childhood and it is important to ensure that the appropriate intervention is implemented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) is an uncommon disorder of raised intracranial pressure of unknown etiology. The signs and symptoms have been well described but the pathogenesis remains a mystery. Most of the evidence suggests increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow as being pivotal to the disorder. Any comprehensive theory on causation will have to explain the preponderance of obese women of childbearing age with primary PTCS and lack of ventriculomegaly in the disorder. It is possible that female sex hormones, along with endocrinologically active adipose tissue, directly result in the syndrome, in those genetically predisposed. Aldosterone has been proposed also as important in the development of PTCS. Vitamin A, in the form of retinoic acid, may also play a pivotal role, and is influenced by both estrogen and adipose tissue. This article reviews proposed mechanisms of PTCS. © 2014 American Headache Society.

AB  - Key points: Discuss with the patient whether she has had a catamenial seizure pattern; this may be particularly associated with increased seizures at perimenopause Counsel women when appropriate that epilepsy may be associated with early onset perimenopause and menopause Determine whether the patient is perimenopausal and this should prompt consideration for monitoring levels of appropriate antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to maintain robust therapeutic levels Advise perimenopausal women with epilepsy to be especially vigilant with taking AEDs and getting adequate sleep If vasomotor symptoms disrupt sleep, CEE/MPA should not be used, and other regimens should be considered, such as estradiol plus natural progesterone Menopause is a time of transition for women. It occurs when the ovarian follicles are depleted, therefore women who bear children tend to have later menopause, due to the ovulation-sparing months of pregnancy. This transition occurs gradually over several years and is a normal aging process. It marks the end of reproductive years, and usually occurs during the late 40s or early 50s. The mean age at menopause is 50–51 years and is remarkably stable across populations and generations. Menopausal age has been stated to be 50 years by observers for centuries, including Aristotle in the third century BC, Paulus Aeginata in the seventh century AD, and Gilberts Anglicus in the thirteenth century AD [1]. Ovarian follicles secrete estrogen and progesterone to promote ovulation and endometrial proliferation. Hormonally, as menopause approaches (perimenopause), estrogen levels remain unchanged, may rise steadily, or can surge erratically in response to the elevated FSH levels. The cyclic progesterone elevation, which normally occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle gradually, becomes less frequent throughout perimenopause, thus causing increased occurrence of anovulatory cycles [2, 3]. Estrogen and progesterone stabilize at low levels with complete ovarian failure at menopause; when a woman has not had menses for 12 months, she is considered postmenopausal. © Cambridge University Press 2014.

AB  - Objective: This narrative review describes the differential diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, and provides an overview of the evidence for the associations between RLS and potential comorbidities. Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized. Methods: The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. Results and Conclusions: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - The majority of children and adolescents with epilepsy are managed in the community setting by general paediatricians. However, there is a paucity of practical, relevant information and standardised management documents assisting paediatricians. In the era of sub-specialisation, an electronic educational resource developed by specialists in epilepsy and paediatrics enhances the interface between tertiary and secondary/primary care. We aimed to create a website (www.pennsw.com.au) designed to optimise the care of all children and adolescents living with epilepsy and to assess its clinical usefulness. The site provides clinicians and families an aligned resource, including key information on epilepsy syndromes, medication usage and adverse effects, safety (sleep deprivation, water sports), driving, pregnancy, psychosocial impact of epilepsy and coping skills. General paediatricians and carers completed a questionnaire, utilising rating scales and open ended questions, to evaluate design, content and clinical usefulness. Forty-nine general paediatricians with a median 12 years of paediatric practice participated. Thirty-two carers participated. Epilepsy syndrome was focal in 59% of the children and generalised in 41%. The majority of participants (paediatricians: 84-100%, families: 69-100%) rated the website as well designed, practical, informative and clinically useful. General paediatricians considered the "Medication" pages and "Epilepsy Management Documents" as practically useful. Carers recorded the "Family Resources", seizure recording documents, the support information on mental health, and the "Coping with Epilepsy" segment as most informative. General paediatricians and carers highly valued the website, reflected by 120,000 page views in 12 months since its launch. Crown Copyright © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Few epidemiological studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been conducted in Australia, and current management practice and levels of unmet need in this country are not well characterised. Aim: To perform a systematic literature review to identify Australia-specific information on SLE, particularly areas of unmet need. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched (1 January 1990 to 29 November 2013). All articles on prevalence, disease characteristics, management and outcomes of SLE in Australia were included. Results: There is limited published information on SLE in Australia. Of 24 articles included, 18 described results from observational studies, three were narrative reviews, one was a clinical update, and two were medical education articles. In remote regions, SLE was reported to be more prevalent in Aboriginal Australians than non-Aboriginal Australians; information in urban populations is lacking. Asian Australians may be more affected by SLE than non-Asian Australians. Pregnancy outcomes may also be adversely affected. Many Australians with SLE may experience high levels of unmet need, including delayed diagnosis, ongoing symptoms, flares, depression/anxiety, sleeping difficulty and decreased quality of life. Published guidance on the SLE management in Australia is limited and dated. Conclusions: Published information on SLE in Australia is limited, but suggests that ethnicity may affect the prevalence and disease characteristics and that many Australians with SLE have unmet needs. Improvements in diagnosis, treatment and management are needed to alleviate these needs. Up-to-date guidance on the management of SLE would benefit healthcare professionals and patients. © 2014 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

However, to date, GC have not proven their effectiveness in the setting of a randomized clinical trial that complies with currently accepted standards. The rationale for the use of GC in MG is the autoimmune nature of the disease, which is supported by consistent positive results from retrospective studies. Well-defined recommendations for treatment of MG with GC are lacking and further hampered by inter- and intra-individual differences in the disease course and responses to GC treatment. Uncertainties concerning GC treatment in MG encompass the indication for treatment initiation, exact dosage, dose adjustment in specific conditions (e.g., pregnancy, thymectomy), mode of tapering, and surveillance of adverse events (AE). This review illustrates the mode of action of GC in the treatment for MG, presents the currently available data on GC treatment in MG, and attempts to translate the currently available information into clinical recommendations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - BACKGROUND:: Chronic fatigue (CF) is an important late effect after childhood malignancies. Our aim was to assess CF persistence over time, concurrent comorbidities, and associations with clinical symptoms. PROCEDURE:: A total of 102 long-term survivors of childhood lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 53 and 49 reporting CF and no CF, respectively, at time point (TP)1, were evaluated for CF at a second TP after a median interval of 2.7 years. At TP2 a survey, including self-reported and objectively measured variables, assessed depressive symptoms, pain, and physical activity. RESULTS:: A total of 32 of the 53 reported CF cases at both TPs and 40/49 survivors had no CF at both TPs, whereas 30 had changed their fatigue status between first and second assessment (converters). Major somatic comorbidities were equally distributed among the groups. After exclusion of converters and survivors with major comorbidity/pregnancy, 27 persistent CF (PCF) cases and 35 controls were compared. PCF cases reported significantly more depression, sleeping problems, anxiety, pain, and reduced physical function. Further, they were less physically active than controls (steps/d; P=0.009). In a multiple regression analysis, depressive symptoms remained the only significant predictor of PCF. CONCLUSIONS:: Long-term survivors of childhood cancer with PCF are characterized by more depressive symptoms, anxiety, pain, insomnia, and less physical activity.

AB  - Perinatal depression is prevalent, under-diagnosed and can have serious long-term effects on the wellbeing of women, their partners and infants. In the absence of active identification strategies, most women with perinatal depression will neither seek nor receive elp. To enable early detection and timely intervention, universal screening is coming to be seen as best practice in many settings. Although the strength of recommendations and the preferred methods of identification vary in different countries (e.g. the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, brief case-finding questions), appropriate training for health professionals in wider psychosocial assessment is essential to maximise usefulness while minimising potential harms. Clear pathways of systematic follow up of all positive screening results with a diagnostic procedure and access to effective treatment are centrally important both for the clinical effectiveness of screening and for health system costs. It is also necessary to further build on the emerging evidence base for the clinical effectiveness of screening. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is the commonest adult muscular dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) are often discussed jointly, and although they share many clinical and molecular features, differences do exist. Historically, more is known about DM1 than about DM2. The literature in the field of myotonic dystrophy is broad, with advances in our understanding of DM2. This article reviews recent developments in DM2 with respect to diagnosis, systemic features, and molecular mechanisms of the disease. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.

AB  - CASE: Thomas is a 5-year 6-month-old boy whose parents requested an urgent care appointment because he has recently been suspended from kindergarten stating "and his doctor must see him before he can come back." His suspension from kindergarten was due to kicking and biting his classmates, but he has also become increasingly aggressive at home. His teacher reported that he has always had a high activity level and difficulty shifting attention between tasks, as well as noncompliance with rules and directions. He is noted to have learning challenges and is showing difficulties in the concept of numbers and letter sounds.The practice has followed Thomas since his healthy birth. He has a history of delayed language development, and he received early intervention services from 2 years of age. He spoke his first word at 2 years 6 months. He started a half-day preschool program at 3 years of age. He had difficulty acclimating to preschool, interacting with peers, and was described as "hyperactive" by his teachers. His program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom.His parents have always described him as a "difficult child." He gets frustrated easily and can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs or requests are not met. He has difficulty falling asleep, has frequent night awakenings, and often has trouble getting back to sleep. His self-help skills are poor, and he has difficulty with activities such as brushing his teeth and dressing. His parents report that he does not seem to remember rules from day to day. He was evaluated at 5 years of age and diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but his response to stimulants has been limited.Thomas is an only child. His parents are college educated and professionally employed. They deny drug use, domestic violence, and guns in the home. They reported that prior to the pregnancy, they enjoyed "partying" with friends on the weekends, but Thomas's mother reported that she stopped drinking as soon as she realized she was pregnant.All are wondering whether this child might have a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, although he seems to have no clear facial dysmorphology. It is unsure what the next step might be and if there is value added in pursuing this diagnosis. What do you do next?. © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Leg pain and discomfort are common complaints in any primary physician's clinic. Two common causes of pain or discomfort in legs are nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) and restless leg syndrome (RLS). NLC present as painful and sudden contractions mostly in part of the calf. Diagnosis of NLC is mainly clinical and sometimes involves investigations to rule out other mimics. RLS is a condition characterized by the discomfort or urge to move the lower limbs, which occurs at rest or in the evening/night. The similarity of RLS and leg cramps poses the issue of errors in diagnosing and differentiating the two. In this paper we review the pathopysiology of each entity and their diagnosis as well as treatment. The two conditions are then compared to appreciate the differences and similarities. Finally, suggestions are recommended for complete assessment. © Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Background and aim: Symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety are usually described and understood from a nosological perspective. This research sought to gain insight into women's lived experience of postnatal depression and anxiety, the factors that contribute to these symptoms and the context in which they develop. Method: Face to face and telephone interviews were conducted with 28 women from metropolitan and rural areas across Australia, who had experienced postnatal depression and/or anxiety within the last five years. Analysis was conducted from a grounded theory perspective. Findings: Particular symptoms of anxiety and depression develop in the context of the numerous changes inherent to the transition to motherhood and contribute to a common experience of frustration and loss. Symptoms were also associated with feelings of dissatisfaction with the pregnancy and motherhood experience. Conclusions: The findings provide useful insights into women's experiences of mental health symptoms during the perinatal period, how these symptoms present and the factors involved in their development and maintenance. The need to consider women's perspectives to develop resources and health promotions strategies, as well as within the context of relationships with health professionals is highlighted. The study emphasizes the need for greater, more accurate information surrounding perinatal depression and the need to increase the profile and awareness of anxiety disorders. © 2014 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - Methadone-associated overdose deaths have dramatically increased. In order to inform an evidence-based clinical practice guideline to improve safety of methadone prescribing, the American Pain Society commissioned a systematic review on various aspects related to methadone safety. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO databases through July 2012 to identify studies that addressed 1 or more of 17 Key Questions related to methadone safety; an update search was performed in 2014 for new studies related to methadone-related overdose and risks related to cardiac arrhythmias. A total of 168 studies met inclusion criteria for the review. The purpose of this article is to highlight critical research gaps in the literature related to methadone safety. These include lack of evidence on risk factors associated with methadone-overdose deaths and adverse events, limited evidence to evaluate the comparative mortality of methadone versus other opioids, insufficient evidence to fully understand the harms associated with methadone use during pregnancy, and insufficient evidence to determine effects of risk mitigation strategies such as electrocardiogram monitoring, strategies for managing patients with prolonged QTc intervals on screening, urine drug testing, alternative dosing regimens for initiation and titration of therapy, and timing of follow-up. Therefore, most guideline recommendations are based on weak evidence. More research is needed to guide safe methadone prescribing practices and decrease the adverse events associated with methadone. Perspective This article summarizes critical research gaps in the literature related to methadone safety, based on a systematic review commissioned by the American Pain Society. Critical research gaps were identified in a number of areas, highlighting the need for additional research to guide safer prescribing and risk mitigation strategies. © 2014 by the American Pain Society.

AB  - Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosomal anomaly and is characterized by intellectual disability and a typical facies. People with Down syndrome can have abnormalities of multiple organ systems. Cardiac and respiratory system involvement is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality, although every organ system can be affected. Patients may present prenatally with findings on screening sonography. If the diagnosis is not made prenatally, it is apparent at birth because of the characteristic facial features and musculoskeletal findings. Children with Down syndrome present to the radiology department at various ages depending on the severity of the specific finding. The purpose of this paper is to review the most common antenatal and postnatal imaging findings of Down syndrome as they manifest throughout the body. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Hypertension is a highly prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and it can also lead to other diseases which seriously harm the human health. Screening the risks and finding a clinical model for estimating the risk of onset, maintenance, or the prognosis of hypertension are of great importance to the prevention or treatment of the disease, especially if the indicator can be derived from simple health profile. In this study, we investigate a chronic disease questionnaire data set of 6563 rural citizens in East China and find out a clinical signature that can assess the risk of hypertension easily and accurately. The signature achieves an accuracy of about 83% on the external test dataset, with an AUC of 0.91. Our study demonstrates that a combination of simple lifestyle features can sufficiently reflect the risk of hypertension onset. This finding provides potential guidance for disease prevention and control as well as development of home care and home-care technologies. © 2014 Zhuoyuan Zheng et al.

AB  - Premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene have been linked to various types of clinical involvement ranging from mood and anxiety disorders to immunological disorders and executive function deficits. Carrier females typically have a premutation allele and a normal allele (<55 CGG repeats). Although rare, seven cases of females that carry two expanded alleles (compound heterozygous premutation) have been reported. Here, we report on four members of a family including two compound heterozygous premutation sisters with similar CGG allele sizes, affected with different levels of clinical severity. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background. The preoperative assessment involves the process of evaluating the patients clinical condition, which is intended to define the physical status classification, eligibility for anesthesia and the risks associated with it, thus providing elements to select the most appropriate and individualized anesthetic plan. The aim of this recommendation was provide a framework reference for the preoperative evaluation assessment of pediatric patients undergoing elective surgery or diagnostic/therapeutic procedures. Methods. We obtained evidence concerning pediatric preoperative evaluation from a systematic search of the electronic databases MEDLINE and Embase between January 1998 and February 2012. We used the format developed by the Italian Center for Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Health Care's scoring system for assessing the level of evidence and strength of recommendations. Results. We produce a set of consensus guidelines on the preoperative assessment and on the request for preoperative tests. A review of the existing literature supporting these recommendations is provided. In reaching consensus, emphasis was placed on the level of evidence, clinical relevance and the risk/benefit ratio. Conclusion. Preoperative evaluation is mandatory before any diagnostic or therapeutic procedure that requires the use of anesthesia or sedation. The systematic prescription of complementary tests in children should be abandoned, and replaced by a selective and rational prescription, based on the patient history and clinical examination performed during the preoperative evaluation.

AB  - Previously, we reported about the effectiveness of the EMOST (Electro-Magnetic-Own-Signal-Treatment) treatments in reduction of phantom limb pain as well as improvement of the quality of sleep and mood in subjects under clinical circumstances. We also presented the successful application of EMOST for mental stress management of humans under catastrophic conditions. Our some years experience indicated that the efficiency of EMOST is much greater in children than in adult subjects. In addition, in children much less treatment is needed for recovery compared to adult subjects, as well as the duration of the treatment is shorter. It is possible that this particular success is due to the large plasticity of the central and the autonomic nervous system in young patients. Thus, our research pays special attention regarding the EMOST effectiveness in the field of chronic childhood diseases. Here we report about results of routine alternative treatments carried out at Biolabor Biophysics and Laboratory Services Ltd. by EMOST device regarding to the elimination of chronic constipation and persistent diarrhea in the case of two children. We also briefly present two important possible biological mechanisms such as redox processes and the bidirectional communication between skin cells and the nervous system regarding the efficiency of low-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic fields (LFI-EMF) treatments. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Cornelia de Lange syndrome is a rare genetic disease, caused by mutations in three known different genes: NIBPL (crom 5p), SMC1A (crom X) and SMC3 (crom 10q), that account for about 65% of cases. This syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features, psychomotor delay, growth retardation since the prenatal period (second trimester of pregnancy), hands and feet abnormalities, and involvement of other organs/systems. SMC1A and SMC3 mutations are responsible for a mild phenotype of the syndrome. Methods: We report the electroclinical features of epilepsy in a child with a mild Cornelia de Lange syndrome and furthermore we reviewed the descriptions of the epileptic findings available in the literature in patients with such syndrome. Results: A large heterogeneity of the epileptic findings in the literature is reported. Conclusion: The presence of epilepsy could be related to pathophysiological factors independent of those implicated in the characterization of main classical phenotypic features. A more detailed description of the epileptic findings could help clinicians in the diagnosis of this syndrome in those cases lacking of the typical features. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - Background: breast-feeding outcomes are often worse after caesarean section compared to vaginal childbirth. Objectives: this study characterises mothers' breast-feeding intentions and their infant feeding experiences after caesarean childbirth. Methods: data are from 115 mothers on a postnatal unit in Northeast England during February 2006-March 2009. Interviews were conducted an average of 1.5 days (range 1-6 days) after the women underwent unscheduled or scheduled caesarean. Results: thematic analysis of the data suggested was mostly considered the 'right thing to do,' preferable, natural, and 'supposedly healthier,' but tiring and painful. Advantages of supplementation involved more satiated infants, feeding ease, and longer sleep bouts. The need for 'thinking about yourself' was part of caesarean recovery. Infrequent feeding was concerning but also enabled maternal rest. Other breast-feeding obstacles were maternal mobility limitations, positioning difficulties, and frustration at the need for assistance. Participants were confused about nocturnal infant wakings, leading many to determine that they had insufficient milk. Mothers were surprised that sub-clinically poor infant condition was common following caesarean section. Some breast-feeding difficulty stemmed from 'mucus' expulsion that had to occur before the infants could be 'interested' in feeding. Women who cited motivations for breast feeding that included benefit to themselves were more likely to exclusively breast feed on the postnatal unit after their caesareans than those who reported infant-only motivations. Conclusions: for the majority of mothers, breast feeding after a caesarean is affected by interrelated and compounding difficulties. Provision of more relational breast-feeding information may enable families to better anticipate early feeding experiences after caesarean section childbirth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13 patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11 cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

AB  - Purpose of review: As there are various drugs and different treatment strategies to delay ejaculation, a review of the current drug treatments for premature ejaculation is relevant for daily clinical practice. Recent findings: There are four premature ejaculation subtypes: lifelong premature ejaculation, acquired premature ejaculation, variable premature ejaculation and subjective premature ejaculation. These premature ejaculation subtypes vary in the duration of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time, their course in life and frequency of early ejaculations. Drug treatment is mainly required for lifelong and acquired premature ejaculation. On the other hand, counseling, psychoeducation and local anesthetics are particularly indicated for variable premature ejaculation and subjective premature ejaculation. Apart from the efficacy of various drugs, drugs against premature ejaculation can be taken on-demand or on a daily basis. However, apart from the on-demand use of dapoxetine, all other premature ejaculation treatments are off-label. Summary: Drug treatment is the first choice of treatment for lifelong premature ejaculation and may also be indicated for acquired premature ejaculation. Together with the patient, the clinician can choose which drug and which treatment strategy is most suitable for the patient and his partner. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: No clinical characteristic picture and impact of symptoms on quality of life (QOL) of interstitial cystitis (IC) patients in Taiwan had been reported. This paper is intended to provide preliminary descriptive results of IC research in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 319 patients, based on National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, were enrolled in the study from February 2004 through March 2006. Evaluation data included baseline demographic information, patient and family medical history, dietary effects, pregnancy data, sexual relationships with symptoms, and impact of symptoms on quality of life. The main responsibility of the hospitals discussed was patient care and data collection. Taichung Hospital presents the results. Results: The Interstitial Cystitis Database (ICDB) patients were predominantly female, that is, 86% of the total, with an average enrollment age of 46. The analysis of various symptoms indicates the following distribution: (i) 94% frequency; (ii) 80% pain; (iii) 53% nocturia; (iv) 43% urgency; and (v) 10% associated incontinence. Approximately 83% reported pain over the bladder while in full stage, and 74% reported pain relief after voiding. The predominant characteristic of pain was full sensation (54%) with the predominant position on low abdominal area (52%). Moreover, 80% reported sleeping disturbance due to disease, and 66% reported difficulty in performing daily work. Conclusions: Interstitial cystitis patients in Taiwan have lower economic status but lower impact on QOL than Western patients. However, the sexual-related pain and sleeping disorder were higher than previously thought and deserve our attention. Accordingly, this research provides a foundation for further investigations of baseline associations and longitudinal trends. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Takayasu arteritis (TA) is 1 of the 2 main causes of large vessel vasculitides (LVV), giant cell arteritis being the other. LVV can also develop in various other systemic diseases. In TA, a wide variety of symptoms result from vascular stenoses, occlusions, and dilation. Aneurysms may develop and may occasionally dissect or rupture. Disease activity can sometimes be difficult to assess clinically. Diagnostic modalities also have their shortcomings. Often, acute phase reactants do not accurately detect disease activity. Available vascular imaging modalities may be acceptable in defining vascular anatomy, but are notoriously inaccurate in delineating vascular inflammation. Glucocorticoids remain the cornerstone of therapy in TA, in spite of foreseeable long term side effects. In addition, several steroid-sparing agents are also being used, often based on promising results from small uncontrolled studies. Rarely, endovascular revascularization procedures are necessary. Resection of critical-sized aortic aneurysms and repair of aortic dissections are occasionally warranted as lifesaving procedures. The long term outcome of surgical intervention is often unfavorable and relapses are not uncommon. In addition to TA, other less commonly encountered causes of LVV are also briefly discussed in this review. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Background: Atopic dermatitis is a common allergic disorder. A multifactorial background for atopic dermatitis has been suggested, with genetic as well as environmental factors influencing disease development. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence rate and associated factors for atopic dermatitis in northern Croatia using the methods of the internationally standardised ISAAC protocol. Methods: The study was undertaken among 12-14-year-old schoolchildren. Data were collected using standardised ISAAC written questionnaire Phase One and some selected questions from the ISAAC supplementary questionnaire completed by parents. Results: A total of 2887 children participated in the study. Estimated lifetime (ever) prevalence rate of atopic dermatitis symptoms was 7.55% and estimated 12-month prevalence rate was 5.75%. The factors found to be associated to the symptoms of atopic dermatitis ever were: positive family atopy, female gender, sleeping on feather pillow and contact with pets after age of seven, and to the symptoms in the past 12 months were: positive family atopy, female gender, sleeping on feather pillow, parasite infestation, and contact with pets in the first year of life. Conclusions: The results of our study show that northern Croatia is a region with moderate prevalence rates of atopic dermatitis. Following risk factors were family atopy, female gender and sleeping on feather pillow. Because of controversial results of previous studies conducted on the same topic further investigations should be made. © 2012 SEICAP.

AB  - BACKGROUND:: Frequency of pertussis is highly variable from country to country and it depends on multiple factors including case definitions and type of surveillance systems used. Many countries recently reported an increase of pertussis cases especially in infants and adolescents. METHODS:: From April 2006 to March 2011, 15-year-old patients hospitalized with suspected or proven pertussis were reported to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Patients with ≥14 days of cough plus paroxysms, whooping or post-tussive vomiting fulfilled the clinical case definition of pertussis. For laboratory confirmation, Bordetella pertussis polymerase chain reaction was offered free of charge. RESULTS:: Data were available from 159 of 173 reported cases and 130 (90% of them <12 months old) were eligible including 125 laboratory-confirmed B. pertussis infections. Rates per 100,000 population were 2.6 (<16 years) and 38.8 (<12 months), respectively. Most frequent complications were cyanosis (63%) and sleep disturbance (60%); 35 (27%) patients received intensive care and 1 patient died. Source of infection was known in 79 (61%) patients and was mainly a sibling, parent or both. Most patients were unimmunized (65%) or incompletely immunized (30%). CONCLUSIONS:: The high rate of pertussis hospitalization in young infants established in this surveillance project and the incomplete pertussis immunization status in almost all hospitalized patients require further efforts for improvement. In addition, introduction of pertussis immunizations for all adolescents (in 2013), young adults (in 2012) and pregnant women (in 2013) in Switzerland should increase indirect protection of vulnerable newborns and infants too young to be fully immunized.

AB  - Background False-positive screening results in newborn screening for cystic fibrosis may lead to parental stress, family relationship problems and a changed perception of the child's health. Aim of the study To evaluate whether parental anxiety induced by a false positive screening result disappears after six months and to assess whether a special program to inform parents prior and during the screening procedure prevents or diminishes parental anxiety. Methods Prospective controlled study assessing the long term effects of false-positive test results of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (NBSCF) on parental anxiety and stress by means of questionnaires sent to parents of 106 infants with a false positive newborn screening test and 318 randomly selected infants with a true negative screening test. Additionally we interviewed 25 parents of the false-positive group. Results Parents showed negative feelings after being informed about the positive screening test result. After confirmation that their child was healthy and not suffering from CF, most parents felt reassured. After six months no difference in anxiety levels between both groups of parents was found. Well-informed parents in the false positive group experienced less stress. Conclusions A positive screening test result induces parental anxiety but false positive test results in NBSCF do not seem to cause long-term anxiety. Well-informed parents show lower stress and anxiety levels. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The majority of Xq22 duplications seen in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) include proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1), the gene responsible for PMD, and neighboring genes. Some cases result from larger duplications up to 7 Mb in size. In comparison, the deletions including PLP1 seen in PMD patients are small. In this study, we present the genetic and clinical information for five female patients with deletions involving the Xq22 region, and review the correlation between the genotype and phenotype. Three of the five patients show similar large deletions (>3 Mb) ranging from Xq22.1 to Xq22.3 and all manifest severe intellectual disability, hypotonia and behavioral abnormalities. The most striking similarity among them are the behavioral problems, including poor eye contact and sleep disturbance. We propose that this represents an emerging distinctive microdeletion syndrome encompassing PLP1 in female patients. The possible candidate region responsible for such distinctive features has been narrowed down to the neighboring region for PLP1, including the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 2 (IL1RAPL2) gene and the clustered brain expressed X-linked (BEX) genes. The gene(s) responsible for severe neurological features in the patients in this study would be located in the regions proximate to PLP1; thus, males with the deletions involving the gene(s) would be lethal, and finally, the sizes of the deletions in PMD patients would be smaller than those of the duplications. © 2014 The Japan Society of Human Genetics.

AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is one of the lysosomal storage diseases. It is caused by the deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to accumulation of the specific glycosaminoglycans keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. This accumulation has a direct impact on cartilage and bone development, resulting in systemic skeletal dysplasia. There is no curative therapy for this skeletal dysplasia. This report describes long-term therapeutic efficacy in a 15-year-old boy with a severe form of MPS IVA who received successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from his HLA-identical carrier sister. The level of the GALNS enzyme in the recipient's lymphocytes reached almost half of normal level within two years after BMT. For the successive 9 + years post-BMT, GALNS activity in his lymphocytes maintained the same level as the donor's, and the level of urinary uronic acid was reduced. Lumbar bone mineral density increased around 50% one year later post-BMT and was kept consistent. Radiographs showed that the figures of trochanter major and minor appeared, while the epiphyseal dysplasia in the femoral cap was almost unchanged. Loud snoring and apnea disappeared. Vital capacity increased to around 20% for the first two years and was maintained. Activity of daily life (ADL) was improved in work/study efficacy, respiratory status, sleep, joint pain, and frequency of infection. In conclusion, the long-term study of hematopoetic stem cell transplantation has shown clinical improvements in respiratory function, radiograph findings, ADL, and biochemical findings, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic option for patients with MPS IVA. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the rates of obstetric intervention and associated perinatal mortality and morbidity in the first 28 days among low-risk women giving birth in private and public hospitals in NSW (2000-2008). Design: Linked data population-based retrospective cohort study involving five data sets. Setting: New South Wales, Australia. Participants: 691 738 women giving birth to a singleton baby during the period 2000-2008. Main outcome measures: Rates of neonatal resuscitation, perinatal mortality, neonatal admission following birth and readmission to hospital in the first 28 days of life in public and private obstetric units. Results: Rates of obstetric intervention among low-risk women were higher in private hospitals, with primiparous women 20% less likely to have a normal vaginal birth compared to the public sector. Neonates born in private hospitals were more likely to be less than 40 weeks; more likely to have some form of resuscitation; less likely to have an Apgar <7 at 5 min. Neonates born in private hospitals to low-risk mothers were more likely to have a morbidity attached to the birth admission and to be readmitted to hospital in the first 28 days for birth trauma (5% vs 3.6%); hypoxia (1.7% vs 1.2%); jaundice (4.8% vs 3%); feeding difficulties (4% vs 2.4%) ; sleep/behavioural issues (0.2% vs 0.1%); respiratory conditions (1.2% vs 0.8%) and circumcision (5.6 vs 0.3%) but they were less likely to be admitted for prophylactic antibiotics (0.2% vs 0.6%) and for socioeconomic circumstances (0.1% vs 0.7%). Rates of perinatal mortality were not statistically different between the two groups. Conclusions: For low-risk women, care in a private hospital, which includes higher rates of intervention, appears to be associated with higher rates of morbidity seen in the neonate and no evidence of a reduction in perinatal mortality.

AB  - Each year, a large percentage of people change their physicians and other individual healthcare providers (IHPs). Many of these people have difficulty identifying a replacement they like. To help people find satisfactory IHPs who are likely to be good at managing their health issues and serve their needs well, in a previous paper we proposed a high-level framework for building a personalized search tool for IHPs. There are many issues regarding designing a personalized search tool for IHPs, of which only a small portion are mentioned in our previous paper. This paper surveys various such issues that are not covered in our previous paper. We include some preliminary thoughts on how to address these issues with the hope to stimulate future research work on the new topic of personalized search for IHPs. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background Congenital muscular dystrophy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of myopathies. Congenital muscular dystrophy related to lamin A/C is rare and characterized by early-onset hypotonia with axial muscle weakness typically presenting with a loss in motor acquisitions within the first year of life and a dropped-head phenotype. Methods Here we report the clinical and histological characteristics of four unrelated Brazilian patients with dropped-head syndrome and mutations in the LMNA gene. Results All patients had previously described mutations (p.E358K, p.R249W, and p.N39S) and showed pronounced cervical muscle weakness, elevation of serum creatine kinase, dystrophic pattern on muscle biopsy, and respiratory insufficiency requiring ventilatory support. Three of the patients manifested cardiac arrhythmias, and one demonstrated a neuropathic pattern on nerve conduction study. Conclusion Although lamin A/C-related congenital muscular dystrophy is a clinically distinct and recognizable phenotype, genotype/phenotype correlation, ability to anticipate onset of respiratory and cardiac involvement, and need for nutritional support remain difficult. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Septo-Optic Dysplasia (SOD) is a rare disorder with postulated genetic and environmental etiology. Whilst initially considered as a very rare disease (defined as incidence of approx. 1 in 50,000 births) recent data gave a reported incidence of 1 in 10,000, with equal sex distribution. The diagnosis of SOD is predominantly a clinical one, and made with the presence of two or more features of the classic triad: 1) hypopituitarism, 2) optic nerve hypoplasia, and 3) midline brain defects, typically absence or hypoplasia of the septum pellucidum and/or corpus callosum. Hypopituitarism ranges from isolated to multiple hormone deficits, with diabetes insipidus in a minority. The condition is heterogeneous and may also manifest additional brain defects. Although homozygous mutations in the homeobox gene HESX1 have been identified in SOD, these are uncommon and genetic diagnosis can be made in only <1% of patients with autosomal recessive inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported. SOX2, SOX3 and OTX2 mutations have also been identified in some forms of SOD. The aetiology of SOD is uncertain but viral infections, environmental teratogens and vascular or degenerative damage have been postulated to account for its sporadic occurrence. Other factors (endogenous or exogenous) include parental age, parity, smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, antenatal bleeding, and ethnicity. Cocaine abuse during pregnancy, which is a potent vasoconstrictor has recently been identified as a potential external cause. The phenotype of SOD is highly variable; the clinical picture may include visual impairment, short stature, obesity and sleep-wake inversion. Approximately 75-80% of patients exhibit optic nerve hypoplasia, which may be the first presenting feature. Pituitary insufficiency may evolve over time, and children with possible SOD must be kept under careful endocrine follow-up. Untreated hormonal abnormalities will further jeopardize neurodevelopment of children with SOD and could also lead to life-threatening adrenal crises. The attention should be focussed on early diagnosis and treatment and education of paediatricians how to recognize this complex disorder.

AB  - Background - In the last fifteen years, numerous publications have reported the increase in the incidence of positional occipital plagiocephaly (POP) in babies since the recommendation of the supine position for sleep in the first months of life was introduced to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). On the contrary, there are few studies on the outcome of the cranial asymmetry in later childhood and none have been published on the follow-up of Italian babies presenting with the problem. Objectives - To investigate 1) the outcome in early childhood of the head shape in young babies presenting with POP in the first months of life and 2) eventual correlation of motor and/or language development problems. Methods - The clinical history of the 314 babies enrolled in the study was examined. Questionnaires enquiring into the parents' evaluation of their children's head shape and information on their motor and language milestones were distributed to the 232 couples of parents who agreed to participate in the study. Results - The data from the clinical notes confirmed the characteristics typical of babies who develop POP already described in literature. 199 parents returned the questionnaires; the average age of their children was 4.8 years (range 3.3 to 6.7 years). 87.5% of the parents considered the cosmetic appearance of their children's head shape to be normal, whereas 30.2% reported a residual cranial asymmetry on palpation. 100% referred normal motor development but 34.4% reported some problems in language development. Conclusions - This study confirms the other data available in that POP can be considered mainly a cosmetic problem, which presents in the first months of life and greatly improves spontaneously during early childhood. Further studies need to investigate the relationship between outcome in childhood and treatments undergone in the first year of life. © 2014, Medico e Bambino. All rights reserved.

AB  - This is the third version of the Egyptian Hypertension Society (EHS) Guidelines. The guidelines were developed by a working group of 28 members, including cardiologists, nephrologists and internal medicine specialists, who were divided into 6 writing groups and an implementation group. Members reviewed the recent world literature as well as other national and international guidelines. The working groups had a number of meetings over a period of one and half year, before finalizing the document. The Egyptian guidelines were based upon two principles: 1. Address practical issues, 2. Cost containment. They stressed the need for frequent office visits and careful measurement of blood pressure before making a diagnosis of hypertension. Higher threshold for diagnosis of hypertension (150/95 mmHg) was recommended. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was indicated in a selected group of patients. Laboratory work-up was kept to the minimum particularly when resources and facilities are limited. The need for lifestyle modification (LSM), controlling obesity and limiting salt intake were stressed. Initiation of pharmacologic treatment, duration of blood pressure monitoring and frequency of office visits were based upon the global cardiovascular risk profile, level of blood pressure and response to LSM. In low risk patients, no drug therapy is recommended when blood pressure is less than 160/100 mmHg. Shorter period of blood pressure monitoring and lower blood pressure threshold (140/90 mmHg) is advised in moderate and high risk patients. In absence of compelling indications any of the five standard pharmacologic groups (diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) can be selected as initial therapy preferably a thiazide diuretic. In absence of satisfactory control of blood pressure, it is recommended to ensure patient's adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes and that he is not taking pressor medications. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), white coat hypertension, inadequate diuretic therapy and secondary forms have to be considered as causes for resistant hypertension. Pharmacologic therapy should be modified according to the presence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure and severity of hypertension. The guidelines addressed management of hypertension in special groups such as obese subjects, the elderly, pregnant women, hypertensive emergencies and patients with valvular heart disease. © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Egyptian Society of Cardiology.

AB  - Properties, Metabolism and Forms Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic derivate of thebaine. [1] Buprenorphine has both analgesic and antihyperalgesic systemic effects [2-4] but the exact mechanism of the different modalities remains unknown. [5] It has three known receptor binding mechanisms. First Buprenorphine is an ?-opioid receptor agonist. Secondly Buprenorphine shows partial agonistic activity at the opioid receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1)-receptor that induces a pronociceptive effect, for example useful in the treatment of hyperalgesia. Its antagonistic activity at the third receptor, the ?-opioid receptor, might explain the less sedative and psychomimetic effects compared to morphine or fentanyl. Buprenorphine is metabolised by the liver into norbuprenorphine. The latter is a μ-opioid, δ-opioid and nociception receptor full agonist, as well as a κ-opioid receptor partial agonist. [6, 7] After glucuronidation, both glucuronides are eliminated mainly through excretion into the bile. [8] Anaesthesiological Clinical Use A higher-dose sublingual form (up to 2 mg) is indicated for detoxification and long-term replacement therapy in opioid dependency. [9-14] It is also a good alternative to sustained-release opioids such as morphine and oxycodone. [15, 16]. The transdermal form is indicated for the treatment of severe cancer pain and severe non-cancer pain not responding to non-opioids. [17] But also in orthopaedic surgery e.g., in elderly, it is proven an effective tool for pain control [18-20]. The intravenous formulation is used in continuous postoperative pain treatment. Regional Administration of Buprenorphine Conflicting results have been published on the efficacy and duration of various opioids (including buprenorphine) in prolonging the duration of local anaesthetics. [21, 22]. The regional use of buprenorphine has been described in neuraxial [23] and peripheral blocks as adjuvants. [21, 22]. Local buprenorphine application, e.g., to the stellate ganglion, is also described in chronical pain management. [24] Other Clinical Use Buprenorphine can be sleep-inducing which can be an advantage when pain is accompanied with sleeplessness. [25] Other clinical indications are pregnancy [26], maxillofacial surgery [27], treatment in non-suicidal selfinjury [28], vasectomy surgery [29], and due the euphoria and anxiolytic effects it can be used as an alternative antidepressant in patients with depression due to pain. Adverse Effects and Contraindications The adverse effects are similar to those of other opioids. The most important side effect is nausea and vomiting, in particular when initiated at high doses. Another important side- effect is respiratory depression but due to a relatively long half-life, this depression is characterised by a ceiling effect. [30] The combination with alcohol and/or benzodiazepines however, can lead to fatal respiratory depression. A "precipitated withdrawal" is described when buprenorphine is used in persons with a physically dependency for full-agonist opioids, who are not already in withdrawal.

AB  - Mental health is an important medical issue in perinatal care, and there is increasing evidence that insomnia during pregnancy is associated with postpartum depression (PPD). Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of insomnia treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy on PPD symptoms. Fifty-four pregnant women with insomnia were randomly assigned to trazodone, diphenhydramine, or placebo treatment. Sleep quality was measured by actigraphy at baseline, and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, depression was assessed 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. Trazodone and diphenhydramine improved sleep profile compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Further, depressive symptoms were reduced 2 and 6 weeks after delivery in trazodone and diphenhydramine groups compared to placebo. No differences in depressive symptoms were observed between the trazodone and diphenhydramine groups. These findings indicate that insomnia treatment with trazodone or diphenhydramine during the third trimester of pregnancy may prevent PPD. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - We are reporting the case of a 40 years old 2nd gravida, 1 para. At 26 weeks of the reported pregnancy, fetal movements stopped suddenly and almost completely within 24 hours. At 30w2d she was referred for Doppler scan and fetal biometry. In ultrasonography (US) normal morphology was seen. Biometry corresponded to 28w1d. Outstanding observation was the permanent immobility of the entire fetus in four-dimensional ultrasound (4D-US). We found during two US examinations an abnormal KANET test, the first at 30w2d with a score of 3 points, and the second at 31w4d, with a score of 4 points. Cardio-tocography (CTG) demonstrated complete loss of variability and accelerations. The patient developed severe polyhydramnios at 33 weeks. After lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) because of breech position, the newborn required ventilation, and passed away after 5 days.

AB  - Sleep disturbances in the general population are associated with elevated blood pressure. This may be due to several mechanisms, including sympathetic activation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbance. Elevated blood pressure in pregnancy can have devastating effects on both maternal and fetal health and is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia and poor delivery outcomes. Preliminary evidence suggests that mechanisms linking sleep and blood pressure in the general population may also hold in the pregnant population. However, the effects of disturbed sleep on physiologic mechanisms that may directly influence blood pressure in pregnancy have not been well studied. The role that sleep disturbance plays in gestational blood pressure elevation and its subsequent consequences warrant further investigation. This review evaluates the current literature on sleep disturbance and elevated blood pressure in pregnancy and proposes possible treatment interventions.

AB  - Background: Psychosis following childbirth affects 1-2 mothers per 1000 deliveries. Onset is rapid and functioning is severely affected. Although prognosis in terms of symptom remission is generally good, long-term disability can persist. The study's aim was to develop a theoretical understanding of recovery from psychosis following childbirth.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 women with experience of psychosis following childbirth. Interview transcripts were analysed using grounded theory methodology.Results: A theory of four superordinate themes was developed from the data, including: (i) the process of recovery; (ii) evolving an understanding; (iii) strategies for recovery; and (iv) sociocultural context. The process of recovery and women's understanding of their experience were conceptualised as parallel processes, which informed one another. Women found that a diagnosis facilitated their use of particular strategies.Conclusions: This study highlighted a complex and ongoing process of recovery from psychosis following childbirth. Sensitivity to a woman's position in the process of recovery has the potential to facilitate professionals in assessing readiness for different interventions which will be likely to result in women feeling more understood, accepted and supported. © 2013 McGrath et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance The genus Passiflora incarnata Linnaeus comprises approximately 520 species belonging to the Passifloraceae family. The majority of these species are vines found in Central or South America, with rare occurrence in North America, Southeast Asia and Australia. The genus Passiflora incarnata has long been used in traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety in Europe, and it has been used as a sedative tea in North America. Furthermore, this plant has been used for analgesic, anti-spasmodic, anti-asthmatic, wormicidal and sedative purposes in Brazil; as a sedative and narcotic in Iraq; and for the treatment of disorders such as dysmenorrhoea, epilepsy, insomnia, neurosis and neuralgia in Turkey. In Poland, this plant has been used to treat hysteria and neurasthenia; in America, it has been used to treat diarrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, neuralgia, burns, haemorrhoids and insomnia. Passiflora incarnata L. has also been used to cure subjects affected by opiate dependence in India. This review aims to provide up-to-date information about the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and clinical safety of Passiflora incarnata L. based on the scientific literature. In particular, the methodological accuracy of clinical trials is analysed in accordance with current consolidated guidelines on reporting the clinical efficacy of herbal medicine, offering new insight into opportunities for future research and development. Methods A bibliographic investigation was performed by examining the available data on Passiflora incarnata L. from globally accepted scientific databases and search engines (Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science, SciFinder and Google Scholar). We selected studies, case reports, and reviews addressing the pharmacology and safety of Passiflora incarnata. Results Although numerous Passiflora incarnata L. derivative products have been commercialised as alternative anxiolytic and sedative remedies based on their long tradition of use, their supposed efficacy does not appear to be adequately corroborated by the literature, with clinical studies often featuring inadequate methodologies and descriptions of the products under investigation. This medicinal plant has shown a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities in preclinical experiments, including anxiolytic, sedative, antitussive, antiasthmatic, and antidiabetic activities. The plant has a good safety profile. The clinical trials that we included in this review were designed to evaluate and in some cases confirm promising observations of preclinical pharmacological activity, and the methodological limits of these studies are characterised here. Conclusion In conclusion, clinical studies on the effects of products containing herbal preparations based on Passiflora incarnata reveal crucial weaknesses such as poor details regarding the drug extract ratio, limited patient samples, no description of blinding and randomisation procedures, incorrect definition of placebo, and lack of intention to treat analysis. In conclusion, the results of this review suggest that new clinical trials should be conducted using a more rigorous methodology to assess the traditional putative efficacy of Passiflora incarnata L. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed sleep-related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap duration and 24-hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy-derived nor self-reported sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Melatonin is an endogenously produced indoleamine involved in a variety of important physiological functions, including regulation of the circadian rhythms, reproductive physiology, and body temperature, and it has been determined to possess important antioxidant properties as well. Several studies have suggested that in complicated pregnancies, maternal treatment with antioxidants may improve placental function and thereby fetal development; moreover, melatonin treatment in these cases has been proposed to possess numerous attractive attributes, resulting in a wide range of health benefits and helping to reduce complications in the neonatal period. This review will focus on studies reporting the use of melatonin during pregnancy and its potential benefits of improving quality of life and reducing healthcare costs. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10-20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N=160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks' gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%-38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient (p<0.01). Depressive symptoms were higher among women with diary-defined sleep deficiency across all time points (p=0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - During and following pregnancy, women are at high risk of experiencing depression, for which fluoxetine (FLX; brand names Prozac, Sarafem, Rapiflux) is the most commonly prescribed treatment. An estimated 1.4-2.1% of pregnant women use this medication, which inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and thereby increases serotonergic activity at the synapse. Serotonin acts as a cue guiding numerous neurodevelopmental processes, and changes in the concentration of serotonin can disrupt normal in utero brain development and organization in humans and other animals, thus providing a mechanism by which maternal intake of FLX might alter neural development and ultimately behaviour. Despite this possibility, long-term alterations of behaviour and the brain have not been well studied in individuals exposed to FLX during pregnancy or soon after birth, perhaps because conducting such studies beyond infancy presents significant challenges. To remedy this problem, many researchers have turned to modelling the effects of developmental FLX exposure in non-human animals, primarily rodents. The body of literature on this topic has expanded considerably over the past several years, yet a comprehensive review is lacking. In order to fill this gap, we have summarized the findings of those studies describing the long-term behavioural and neurophysiological effects of FLX exposure in non-human animals in early development. We also discuss methodological considerations and common shortcomings of research in this area. The precise nature of the long-term effects of developmental FLX exposure remains difficult to specify, as these effects appear to be highly variable and dependent on numerous factors. Overall, however, it is clear that early FLX exposure in non-human animals can alter the development of the brain in ways that are relevant to behaviour in adulthood, decreasing exploration and social interaction, and in some cases altering anxiety-and depression-like behaviours. © 2013 S.

AB  - Epidemiological studies initially suggested that maternal undernutrition leading to low birth weight may predispose for long-lasting energy balance disorders. High birth weight due to maternal obesity or diabetes, inappropriate early postnatal nutrition, and rapid catch-up growth, may also sensitize to increased risk of obesity. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease concept, the perinatal perturbation of fetus/neonate nutrient supply might be a crucial determinant of individual programming of body weight set-point. The hypothalamic melanocortin system composed of the melanocortin receptor 4, its agonist α-melanin-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), and its antagonist agouti-related protein (AgRP) is considered as the main central anorexigenic pathway controlling energy homeostasis. Studies in numerous animal models demonstrated that this system is a prime target of developmental programming by maternal nutritional manipulation. In rodents, the perinatal period of life corresponds largely to the period of brain maturation (i. e., melanocortin neuronal differentiation and development of their neural projections). In contrast, these phenomena essentially take place before birth in bigger mammals. Despite these different developmental time windows, altricial and precocial species share several common offspring programming mechanisms. Offspring from malnourished dams present a hypothalamic melanocortin system with a series of alterations: impaired neurogenesis and neuronal functionality, disorganization of feeding pathways, modified glucose sensing, and leptin/insulin resistance. Overall, these alterations may account for the long-lasting dysregulation of energy balance and obesity. Following maternal malnutrition, hormonal and epigenetic mechanisms might be responsible for melanocortin system programming in offspring. © 2013 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

AB  - Objective: Sleep problems are common complaints among pregnant women. This study was designed to compare subjective sleep problems in non-pregnancy condition, healthy and preeclamptic pregnancy as a major complication of pregnancy. We hypothesized that some sleep problems are more prevalent in females with preeclampsia. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 102 women with preeclampsia, 106 healthy pregnant women in the third trimester and 103 healthy non-pregnant women were selected through random sampling. Age and parity were matched in the three groups. We used Global sleep assessment questionnaire (GSAQ) to check the subjective sleep problems, and then we performed statistical analysis using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson Chi-square tests. Results: Our findings revealed significant differences in initial insomnia (p = 0.034), fragmented sleep (p = 0.022), snoring (p<0.001), non-idiopathic insomnia (p = 0.045) and sadness and anxiety (p = 0.001) between the three groups. Some sleep problems were more common in preeclampctic compared to healthy pregnant women including initial insomnia, fragmented sleep, snoring, sleep apnea and non-idiopathic insomnia. Moreover, the subjects with preeclampsia revealed more fragmented sleep, snoring, sadness and anxiety and lack of getting enough sleep due to other activities compared to non-pregnant women. Conclusion: Different kinds of sleep problems can occur in subjects with preeclampsia in comparison with the non-pregnant and healthy pregnant subjects. Sleep problems should be evaluated during pregnancy, particularly in pregnant women with preeclampsia, and suitable treatment should be provided for any specific sleep problem.

AB  - Background: Conventional glucocorticoid (GC) replacement for patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) is inadequate. Patients with AI continue to have increased mortality and morbidity and compromised quality of life despite treatment and monitoring. Objectives: i) To review current management of AI and the unmet medical need based on literature and treatment experience and ii) to offer practical advice for managing AI in specific clinical situations. Methods: The review considers the most urgent questions endocrinologists face in managing AI and presents generalised patient cases with suggested strategies for treatment. Results: Optimisation and individualisation of GC replacement remain a challenge because available therapies do not mimic physiological cortisol patterns. While increased mortality and morbidity appear related to inadequate GC replacement, there are no objective measures to guide dose selection and optimisation. Physicians must rely on experience to recognise the clinical signs, which are not unique to AI, of inadequate treatment. The increased demand for corticosteroids during periods of stress can result in a life-threatening adrenal crisis (AC) in a patient with AI. Education is paramount for patients and their caregivers to anticipate, recognise and provide proper early treatment to prevent or reduce the occurrence of ACs. Conclusions: This review highlights and offers suggestions to address the challenges endocrinologists encounter in treating patients with AI. New preparations are being developed to better mimic normal physiological cortisol levels with convenient, once-daily dosing which may improve treatment outcomes. © 2013 The authors.

AB  - Objective: Pregnancy is associated with many physiologic changes along with changes in breathing during sleep, placing pregnant women at risk for the development of sleep-disordered breathing. The study aims were to assess the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy as well as their impact on the perinatological outcomes. Methods: We studied 101 pregnant women. They were enlisted in a prospective study divided into three parts: Part 1 - questionnaire on past and present sleep disorders including Epworth Sleepiness Scale. In Part 2 all pregnant women underwent nocturnal polysomnography. In part 3-2 weeks after delivery, the patients were surveyed regarding fetal outcome and mode of delivery. Results: Obstructive sleep apnea (AHI > 5) was diagnosed in three patients, which accounted for 3% of all studied women. All of them were in the third trimester of pregnancy. The first patient course of pregnancy was uneventful. The other two patients were enrolled in the group of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. Two patients due to severe obstructive sleep apnea (AHI > 30) were treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The use of CPAP led to normalization of respiratory parameters as well as to lowering blood pressure. Conclusion: Disorders of breathing during sleep contribute to the development of various diseases or they degrade the overall phenomena. Therefore, it is essential to treat not only the primary disease, but also the accompanying sleep disorders.

AB  - Background Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) reduce the levels of ovarian and adrenal androgens. Co-administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may normalise androgen levels during COC use. Objective To investigate the effect of the addition of DHEA to a COC on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of DHEA and its sulphate (DHEA-S), and on levels of total and free testosterone (T). Methods In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study involving 21 female volunteers, the PK and PD of DHEA and DHEA-S were investigated during the use of one cycle of a COC containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) with and without daily co-administration of 50 mg DHEA. Results Treatment during one cycle with a COC containing EE and DRSP reduces the exposure to DHEA and DHEA-S by at least 20%. This loss of adrenal androgens can be fully compensated by daily oral co-administration of 50 mg DHEA. With DHEA co-administration total T levels rise significantly (1.44 nmol/L with DHEA vs. 0.82 nmol/L with placebo; p < 0.001). Free T levels decrease significantly with both DHEA and placebo treatment, but significantly less during co-administration of DHEA (6.34 pmol/L with DHEA vs. 3.96 pmol/L with placebo; p < 0.001). Conclusion By adding DHEA to a COC the loss of adrenal and ovarian androgens can be restored. © 2013 The European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health.

AB  - Background/Aims: Early life experiences are homeostatic determinants for adult organisms. We evaluated the impact of prenatal immune activation during late gestation on the neuroimmune-endocrine function of adult offspring and its interaction with acute stress. Methods: Pregnant Swiss mice received saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 17. Adult male offspring were assigned to the control or restraint stress condition. We analyzed plasmatic corticosterone and catecholamine levels, the monoamine content in the hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex, and the sleep-wake cycle before and after acute restraint stress. Results and Conclusion: Offspring from LPS-treated dams had increased baseline norepinephrine levels and potentiated corticosterone secretion after the acute stressor, and no effect was observed on hypothalamic monoamine content or sleep behavior. The offspring of immune-activated dams exhibited impairments in stress-induced serotonergic and dopaminergic alterations in the striatum and frontal cortex. The data demonstrate a distinction between the plasmatic levels of corticosterone in response to acute stress and the hypothalamic monoamine content and sleep patterns. We provide new evidence regarding the influence of immune activation during late gestation on the neuroendocrine homeostasis of offspring. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The role of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy is not well studied, but an increasing body of literature appears to indicate that there may be adverse maternal and fetal health effects of the disease. OSA is associated with a twofold risk for pre-eclampsia. The small size of the existing investigations still leave unanswered questions about the consequences of OSA as it relates to some other clinically relevant outcomes such as eclampsia, stillbirth, and maternal mortality. A consistent body of literature has emerged demonstrating an increased risk for insulin resistance and diabetes associated with OSA. However, among pregnant women, the association appears to be related to short sleep duration. Well-designed and adequately powered studies are required to further delineate the role of OSA and sleep duration on pregnancy outcome and the mechanisms of those effects.

AB  - Purpose: Survey questions are commonly used to assess sleep duration because of their low cost and convenience. Responses to these questions correlate moderately with objectively measured sleep duration in nonpregnant individuals, but little is known about the validity of self-reported sleep measures in pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which self-reported gestational sleep duration assessed by questionnaire predicted objectively measured gestational sleep duration via actigraphy. Methods: We analyzed data from 80 mothers enrolled in an ancillary study of Project BABIES, a prospective cohort study of urban, pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in midpregnancy and included 7 days of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and survey questions about sleep time adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Mean measured gestational sleep duration derived from actigraphy was 6.87 h [standard deviation (SD) 0.87], and questionnaire-assessed nocturnal sleep time averaged 7.29 h (SD 1.84). While the difference between measures did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 for paired samples t test), over half (62 %) of participants reported a habitual average nightly sleep time that differed more than 1 h from their average actigraphically measured sleep duration (39 % overestimated by more than an hour; 23 % underestimated by more than an hour). There was no correlation between measures (r = 0.007; 95 % confidence interval -0.21, 0.23). Conclusion: Questionnaire-derived reports of usual sleep hours do not reflect objectively measured sleep time in urban, pregnant women. Actigraphy is preferable to accurately assess gestational sleep duration. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Women are at increased risk of developing mood disorders during the postpartum period, and poor postpartum sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of depression. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited from their outpatient obstetricians' offices from July 2009 through March 2010. Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks (p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep, is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression symptoms. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Summary: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is reported commonly during pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but the majority of these data are based upon self-report measures not validated for pregnancy. This study examined the predictive value of screening questionnaires for SDB administered at two time-points in pregnancy, and attempted to develop an 'optimized predictive model' for detecting SDB in pregnancy. A total of 380 women were recruited from an antenatal clinic in the second trimester of pregnancy. All participants completed the Berlin Questionnaire and the Multivariable Apnea Risk Index (MAP Index) at recruitment, with a subset of 43 women repeating the questionnaires at the time of polysomnography at 37 weeks' gestation. Fifteen of 43 (35%) women were confirmed to have a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) &gt; 5 h-1. Prediction of an RDI &gt; 5 h-1 was most accurate during the second trimester for both the Berlin Questionnaire (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.50, positive predictive value 0.50 and negative predictive value 0.93), and the MAP Index [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.768]. A stepwise selection model identified snoring volume, a body mass index (BMI)≥32 kg m-2 and tiredness upon awakening as the strongest independent predictors of SDB during pregnancy; this model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.952. We conclude that existing clinical prediction models for SDB perform inadequately as a screening tool in pregnancy. The development of a highly predictive model from our data shows promise for a quick and easy screening tool to be validated for future use in pregnancy. © 2013 European Sleep Research Society.

AB  - Purpose This qualitative study aimed to explore how Turkish women experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy based on the Roy Adaptation Model. Methods To collect data, in-depth interviews were undertaken with 35 pregnant women who had nausea and vomiting. The sample of the study included pregnant women who were in their first 12 weeks of gestation, did not have medical problems and had nausea, retching and/or vomiting for at least the last 3 days. Data were collected in semi-structured interview form based on the Roy Adaptation Model and with a background data sheet. Data were analyzed using direct content analysis. Results Data were classified into four adaptive modes according to the Roy Adaptation Model. The behaviors in the physiological mode were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, inadequate nutrition, inguinal pain, burning sensation and irritation in the throat, ketosis, and urinary incontinence. The behaviors in the self-concept mode were feeling weak, crying, inadequate self-care, changes in sexual intercourse, and social isolation. The behaviors in the role function mode were being unable to fulfill the responsibilities at home and work. The behaviors in the interdependence mode were dissatisfaction with relationships. Conclusion The study findings help nursing staff detect the stimuli and the behaviors of pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Further research may evaluate the impact of a counseling program prepared under the guidance of a nursing model on nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. © 2013, Korean Society of Nursing Science.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effects of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on the reproductive capability of the offspring. Design Using a sleep loss model or control home-cage group (male and females rats) to evaluate sexual behavior and hormonal profile in males and females F1 offispring. Setting Laboratory. Animals(s) First experiment: Pregnant females were exposed to sleep restriction (SR) protocol and the F1 generation was evaluated. Second experiment: male rats were submitted to SR or paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) protocol and the F1 generation was evaluated. Intervention(s) Male and female rats were subjected to sleep restriction (SR) for 21 days or paradoxal sleep-deprived (PSD) for 96 hours. Main Outcome Measure(s) Sexual behavior and hormonal levels during the adult phase were analyzed in F1 offspring of female and male rats submitted to sleep loss. Result(s) F1 male offspring of SR females had lower motivation for sex and reduced progesterone concentrations. In contrast, F1 female offspring displayed significantly enhanced proceptivity compared with control offspring. F1 female offspring also demonstrated hypersexuality by mounting the males in the absence of any significant hormonal alterations. F1 male offspring of SR or paradoxically sleep-deprived (PSD) males presented a decline in the sexual response, accompanied by a reduction in testosterone concentrations. Proceptivity was significantly increased among F1 female offspring of PSD and SR males compared with control offspring. Conclusion(s) SR in progenitors may alter sexual behavior of the F1 offspring in adulthood. These findings reveal far-reaching consequences of sleep deprivation, and suggest that parental sleep influences the reproductive capability of subsequent generations. © 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and Cesarean deliveries. The purpose of this study was to assess whether excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) increases the risk of these complications further. Methods: Following institutional review board approval and informed consent, English-speaking women in the immediate postpartum period were systematically selected and recruited. Women answered a survey that included questions regarding symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using the multivariable apnea prediction index and excessive daytime sleepiness using ESS. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were collected by review of medical records. Standard statistical analysis with multivariable logistic regression was performed. ESS was evaluated both as a continuous variable and with various cutoffs given that pregnant women are likely more sleepy at baseline than the general population. Results: In patients who underwent planned Cesarean delivery, mean ESS was significantly higher than in those with uncomplicated vaginal delivery, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.08; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.15; p = 0.02). There was no significant association between EDS (defined as ESS of >10) and gestational diabetes or gestational hypertensive disorders in snorers or non snorers. However, a significant association with gestational diabetes was found in patients with an ESS of >16 compared to those with an ESS of ≤16, even after multiple adjustments (aOR, 6.82; 95 % CI, 1.19-39.27), but the number of subjects in an ESS of >16 category was small. Conclusions: There is an increased association between women with higher ESS and planned Cesarean delivery. Severe EDS was associated with gestational diabetes in pregnant women in a small sample size. Future studies in larger samples need to confirm the association of severe EDS and gestational diabetes and elucidate potential mechanisms of the links with adverse outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In a current review we collect and lay down principles of the treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia. It is essential to diagnose and distinguish preeclampsia from other diseases with hypertension and proteinuria as fast as possible. We need to remember about a differentiation of preeclampsia severity and treatment adjustment to that. The maternal laboratory tests values are as important as well as fetal well-being and growth. Timing of delivery is based upon gestational age, maternal and fetal condition, severity of disease. It is suggested to deliver if is?37 weeks of gestation in all women with preeclampsia. In severe preeclampsia there are increased rates of maternal liver and kidney dysfunction, induced labor, caesarean section, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and neonatal difficulties of breathing. We have to give antenatal glucocorticoids 24-34. weeks of gestation. The most effective treatment in breaking eclamptic seizures and their prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia is magnesium sulfate. © GinPolMedProject.

AB  - Background: Insomnia is symptomatic of most psychiatric disorders. Non-habit-forming agents such as trazodone and quetiapine are commonly used off-label to treat patients with insomnia. The safety and efficacy of trazodone and quetiapine as medications for treatment of insomnia have never been directly contrasted. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of trazodone to quetiapine among inpatient psychiatric patients by measuring the traditional sleep parameters of total sleep time, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, length of hospitalization, and patient-reported side effects. Method: Participants were recruited from St Helena Hospital Center for Behavioral Health, Vallejo, California. Patient inclusion criteria were age 18 to 65 years, admitted between September 2011 and February 2012, and a physician order for trazodone or quetiapine for insomnia. Exclusion criteria included primary insomnia, pregnancy, concomitant order of trazodone and quetiapine, receiving trazodone or quetiapine up to 2 weeks prior to the study, and inability to coherently communicate. Subjective patient interviews and objective nursing sleep log reviews composed the data set. Results: On average, mean total sleep time hours were longer among patients receiving trazodone versus those receiving quetiapine according to patients' subjective reports (7.80 vs 6.75, respectively, P < .01) and the nursing sleep logs (9.13 vs 8.68, respectively, P = .04). Patients receiving trazodone experienced fewer mean nighttime awakenings versus those receiving quetiapine (0.52 vs 0.75, respectively, P = .04) according to the nursing sleep log report. Patients receiving trazodone reported more side effects of constipation, nausea, and diarrhea than patients receiving quetiapine. Conclusions: With respect to total sleep time and nighttime awakenings, trazodone was a more effective alternative than quetiapine. However, patients receiving trazodone experienced more gastrointestinal patient-reported side effects. © 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is one of the most frequent neurological sleep disorders. Epidemiological studies have shown consistently that it is more frequent in females than in males with male-to-female ratios mostly in the range of 1:1.5-1:2.0 in adult populations. One of the main candidates involved in this gender gap is pregnancy and specifically the transient form of RLS during pregnancy that affects around 20 % of females. Not only does the risk for RLS increase with increasing numbers of pregnancies, but RLS symptoms during that period are also a significant gender-specific risk factor for the development of chronic, idiopathic RLS later in life. Iron deficiency anemia is a further risk factor that is gender-specific inasmuch as it is more prevalent in females although the probability to develop RLS with iron deficiency anemia does not differ between men and women. While it is unknown whether and how these two gender-specific risk factors, i.e., pregnancy and iron deficiency anemia, interact and to what extent their effects are mediated by an individual genetic predisposition, they can at least explain part of the observed prevalence differences between males and females. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Sleep and headache have both generated curiosity within the human mind for centuries. The relationship between headache and sleep disorders is very complex. While Lieving in 1873 first observed that headaches were linked to sleep, Dexter and Weitzman in 1970 described the relationship between headache and sleep stages. Though our understanding of sleep and headache relationship has improved over the years with expanding knowledge in both fields and assessment tools such as polysomnography, it is still poorly understood. Headache and sleep have an interdependent relationship. Headache may be intrinsically related to sleep (migraine with and without aura, cluster headache, hypnic headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania), may cause sleep disturbance (chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, and medication overuse headache) or a manifestation of a sleep disorder like obstructive sleep apnea. Headache and sleep disorder may be a common manifestation of systemic dysfunction-like anemia and hypoxemia. Headaches may occur during sleep, after sleep, and in relation to different sleep stages. Lack of sleep and excessive sleep are both considered triggers for migraine. Insomnia is more common among chronic headache patients. Experimental data suggest that there is a common anatomic and physiologic substrate. There is overwhelming evidence that cluster headache and hypnic headaches are chronobiological disorders with strong association with sleep and involvement of hypothalamus. Cluster headache showsacircadian and circannual rhythmicity while hypnic headache shows an alarm clock pattern. There is also a preferential occurrence of cluster headache, hypnic headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania during REM sleep. Silencing of anti-nociceptive network of periaqueductal grey (PAG), locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus doing REM sleep may explain the preferential pattern. Sleep related headaches can be classified into (1) headaches with high association with obstructive sleep apnea, which includes cluster headache, hypnic headache, and headache related to obstructive sleep apnea; and (2) headaches with high prevalence of insomnia, medication overuse, and psychiatric comorbidity including chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache. The initial step in the management of sleep related headache is proper diagnosis with exclusion of secondary headaches. Screening for sleep disorders with the use of proper tests including polysomnography and referral to sleep clinic, when appropriate is very helpful. Control of individual episode in less than 2 hours should be the initial goal using measures to abort and prevent a relapse. Cluster headache responds very well to injectable Imitrex and oxygen. Verapamil, steroids and lithium are used for preventive treatment of cluster headache. Intractable cluster headache patients have responded to hypothalamic deep brain stimulation. Hypnic headache patients respond to nightly caffeine, indomethacin, and lithium. Paroxysmal hemicrania responds very well to indomethacin. Early morning headaches associated with obstructive sleep apnea respond to CPAP or BiPAP with complete resolution of headache within a month. Patient education and lifestyle modification play a significant role in overall success of the treatment. Chronic tension-type headache and chronic migraine have high prevalence of insomnia and comorbid psychiatric disorders, which require behavioral insomnia treatment and medication if needed along with psychiatric evaluation. Apart from the abortive treatment tailored to the headache types, - such as triptans and DHE 45 for migraine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication for chronic tension-type headache, preventive treatment with different class of medications including antiepileptics (Topamax and Depakote), calcium channel blockers (verapamil), beta blockers (propranolol), antidepressants (amitriptyline), and Botox may be used depending upon the comorbid conditions. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Fetal heart rate patterns provide valuable information about normal fetal maturation. For heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to be successful in prenatal diagnosis the selection of appropriate HRV indices is required. Those indices were organized according to universal principles of developmental biology. Key characteristics of evolution and self-organization are increasing fluctuation amplitude, increasing complexity and pattern formation. Related HRV indices were used to propose a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS). We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet (n=113, 63 females) and active sleep (n=286, 145 females) by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. fABAS explained 66/63% (training / validation set) of the variance by age in quiet and 51/50% in active sleep. We conclude that functional autonomic brain age can be assessed based on universal developmental indices obtained from fetal heart rate patterns. © 2013 CCAL.

AB  - Objective: To assess the association of various factors with infantile colic. Methods: This case control study was done at Government Sardar Begum Hospital Sialkot in the period from January 2011 to December 2011. Infants visiting the outpatient department for colic were included in the study. For every infant data was collected on structured Proforma for various factors associated with infantile colic. Cases of colic were identified by applying Wessel's criteria, calculations were made using SPSS version 19, P-value, odds ratio and 95% Confidence interval were calculated and significance of various factors were evaluated. Results: Out of the 735 infants who visited the outpatient department for colic, only 125 infants that fulfilled Wessel's criteria were included in the study. Similarly 125 age matched controls were also selected. The factors that were found significantly associated with infantile colic include, stress during pregnancy, being first born, breast feeding, improper feeding/burping techniques, GER, umbilical/inguinal hernia and disturbed sleep pattern. However no statistical significance was found for the following factors, illness in pregnancy, nutritional status, mode of delivery, educational status, maternal pulses intake, socioeconomic status of family, parental age, birth weight & gestational and stool frequency. Conclusion: Reducing the maternal stress during pregnancy, educating the first time mother about handling of infant may be helpful in reducing colic in infants.

AB  - Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem in developing countries. We investigated possible risk factors for cervical cancer in rural areas of Wuhan China using a matched case-control study with 33 women diagnosed with cervical cancer and 132 healthy women selected from the same area as matched controls. A questionnaire, which included questions about general demography conditions, environmental and genetic factors, the first sexual intercourse, first marriage age, age at first pregnancy, pregnancy first child's age, female personal health history, social psychological factors, dietary habits, smoking and alcohol status and other living habits was presented to all participants. At the same time, HPV infection of every participant was examined in laboratory testing. Results showed HPV infection (P<0.000, OR=23.4) and pregnancy first child's age (P<0.000, OR=13.1) to be risk factors for cervical cancer. Menopause (P=0.003, OR=0.073) was a protective factor against cervical cancer. However, there was no indication of associations of environmental (drinking water, insecticide, disinfectant) genetic (cancer family history), or life-style factors (smoking status, alcohol status, physical training, sleep quality), including dietary habits (intake of fruit and vegetable, meat, fried food, bean products and pickled food) or social psychological factors with cervical cancer. The results suggest that the risk of cervical cancer in Chinese rural women may be associated with HPV infection, menopause and the pregnancy first child's age.

AB  - Background: Specific diagnostic criteria for pediatric restless legs syndrome (RLS) were published in 2003 following a workshop at the National Institutes of Health. Due to substantial new research and revision of the adult RLS diagnostic criteria, a task force was chosen by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) to consider updates to the pediatric diagnostic criteria. Methods: A committee of seven pediatric RLS experts developed a set of 15 consensus questions to review, conducted a comprehensive literature search, and extensively discussed potential revisions. The committee recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee and reviewed by the IRLSSG membership. Results: The pediatric RLS diagnostic criteria were simplified and integrated with the newly revised adult RLS criteria. Specific recommendations were developed for pediatric application of the criteria, including consideration of typical words used by children to describe their symptoms. Pediatric aspects of differential diagnosis, comorbidity, and clinical significance were then defined. In addition, the research criteria for probable and possible pediatric RLS were updated and criteria for a related condition, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), were clarified. Conclusions: Revised diagnostic criteria for pediatric RLS have been developed, which are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Neurologists have a new toolbox of options for neu-rorehabilitation of disabling brain disorders such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. An emerging intellectual paradigm for neurologic recovery that includes neural regeneration, repair, and dynamic reorganization of functional neural systems, as well as increasing awareness of behavioral principles that may support best return to function and freedom, brought forward treatments based on experience-dependent learning, neurophysiologic stimulation, and a combination of these concepts. Inthis article, we summarize five rehabilitative approaches to watch: constraint therapy for motor and language recovery, synergy of motor-language rehabilitation, prism adaptation training and other virtual feedback approaches, and noninvasive magnetic and electrical brain stimulation. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of infant mortality between the ages of one month and one year in developed countries. The incidence has dramatically decreased in countries where the "none prone sleeping" position was adapted. Nevertheless, in the last few years this decrease has stabilized. Considering that in more than 95% of the cases of SIDS two or more risk factors are involved, we must reconsider the preventive measures. In the present article, we will review the recommendations and preventive measures based on the most important modifiable risk factors: supine position during sleeping, firm sleep surface, room sharing without bed sharing, avoid soft objects in the bed, avoid overheating, pacifier use, breastfeeding, avoid smoking and other substances during pregnancy, prenatal care, as well as the lack of evidence regarding monitoring in the household.

AB  - This review includes six recent and influential papers that have appeared in the three leading psychiatry journals from the Arab region. The first paper examined the role of personality profile in the motivation to quit smoking and concluded that there is a positive correlation between Novelty seeking (NS), Persistence (P), Cooperativeness (C) and motivation to quit smoking. The second study discussed the prevalence of abuse history in patients with schizophrenia whether physical or sexual, and its impact on their condition and function. The third paper reported that patients with substance abuse problem show more risky sexual behaviors than normal controls. The fourth study high-lighted the similarities regarding complaints about sleep and polysomnographic changes in depression patients and somatoform disorder patients. The fifth paper, investigated the prenatal and perinatal risk factors in autistic disorders. The sixth and final article concluded that poor levels of maternal fetal attachment during the course of pregnancy should be managed in order to optimize fetal and maternal health. Overall, the papers describe a wide spectrum of research initiatives in the Arab world that are likely to have implications for global mental health. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Participants: An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline. Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence. Conclusions:Wesuggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: Androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disordersandrisk factors for endometrial cancer,mooddisorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable riskbenefit ratio overall, and statins require further study. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 4565-4592, 2013) © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Highly active antiretroviral therapy has markedly decreased the morbidity and mortality due to HIV/AIDS. Once antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated, patients generally remain on medications indefinitely. A switch in the antiretroviral regimen is often necessary because of both acute and chronic toxicities, concomitant clinical conditions, and development of virologic failure. The objective of this study was to assess the causes of initial highly active antiretroviral therapeutic regimen changes among patients on ART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted from January 1 to March 1, 2010 in two primary hospitals and one health centre in central Ethiopia. Information cards of HIV/AIDS patients who have had their antiretroviral regimen switched were reviewed. Data from patients below 18 years old and those who did not switch HAART regimen were excluded. Data were then analyzed using SPSS for windows version 16.0. A total of 300 patients' information card was reviewed and the mean age of the patients was 38.6+7 years. Females accounted for 59% (177) of the total patients. The most common first regimen before first switch was D4T/3TC/NVP (63%) and D4T/3TC/EFV (18%). The main reasons for modification were toxicity (65%), co-morbidity (25%), pregnancy (5%) and treatment failure (3%). The main types of toxicities observed were peripheral neuropathy (39%), rash (20%) and anaemia (13.33%). Drug toxicity was the main reason for modification of initial antiretroviral regimen and initial Efavirenz-based regimens are less likely to be changed. The occurrence of drug toxicity should be assessed early among patients commencing HAART and health professionals should be empowered to make appropriate regimen changes.

AB  - Objectives: Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can contribute to a favorable disease course by their own behaviour and environmental adaptations. However, no standardized consensus recommendations on patient behavior and adaptations exist, neither internationally nor nationally. The aim of this study was to establish a core set of recommendations concerning favorable patient behavior to be given to patients with AS by rheumatologists. Methods: An extended literature research in the scientific and patient-oriented literature revealed 70 recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated and ranked by importance at a meeting of the Ankylosing Spondylitis International Federation (ASIF, 26 participants from 13 countries) in November 2011. The remaining 59 recommendations were extensively discussed, supplemented, partially reworded, condensed and those with the highest priority were selected by consensus at a seminar of local branch leaders of the AS patient organization in Germany (Deutsche Vereinigung Morbus Bechterew) in March 2012 (80 participants, 95 % patients with AS). Results: The core set encompasses 1) a general statement on living with AS and 2) recommendations in the areas of sitting position, walking, sleeping, at work, exercising, sports and recreational activities, diet and life style, sexuality and pregnancy, fall prevention, car driving and membership in an AS-specific patient organization. The selected recommendations received agreement by 80-100 % of the patients. Some recommendations (e.g. fall prevention and car driving) are more relevant to patients with advanced and usually longstanding disease, i.e. with advanced ankylosis or osteoporosis. Conclusions: For the first time a core set of recommendations for the behavior of patients with AS was created in collaboration with many persons affected by the disease. Patients with AS should receive these recommendations from their rheumatologists, ideally early in the disease course. The German version of this core set is presented in this article. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The establishment of the National Perinatal Depression Initiative (NPDI, 2008-2013) has brought a focus across Australia for the need to identify women at risk of perinatal mental health disorders, suggesting that routine screening by relevant health professionals may aid earlier detection, better care and improved outcomes. Midwives are frequently the primary point of contact in the perinatal period and thus ideally placed to identify, interpret and manage complex situations, including screening for perinatal mental health disorders. This paper offers strategies that could be implemented into daily midwifery practice in order to achieve the goals consistent with the National Perinatal Depression Initiative. A case study (Jen) and discussion, guided by recommendations from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Competency standards and beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines, are used to demonstrate how midwifery care can be provided. In accordance with her legal obligations, the midwife should act within her scope of practice to undertake a series of psychosocial and medical assessments in order to best determine how midwifery care and support can be of benefit to Jen, her infant and her family. Suggestions described include administration of validated screening questionnaires, clinical interview, physical assessment, discussion with partner, awareness of the mother-infant interactions and questioning around baby's sleep and feeding. Based on evaluation of the information gained from a bio-psycho-social assessment, suggestions are made as to the midwifery care options that could be applied. © 2013 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and distressing sensorimotor disorder of unknown etiology. While the epidemiology of RLS has been examined in several North American and European studies, research on RLS and RLS burden in poor, rural populations, including those residing in Appalachia, remains sparse. In this study, we investigated RLS prevalence in an Appalachian primary care population and examined the association of RLS to demographic factors, lifestyle characteristics, sleep quality, and mood disorders. Methods: Participants of this anonymous survey study were community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 18 years visiting one of 4 West Virginia primary care clinics. Data gathered included detailed information on sleep patterns, demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and health/medical history; the survey also included questions specific to RLS diagnosis and severity. Response rates were excellent, with 68% of eligible adults contacted returning completed surveys (N = 1,424/2,087). Pregnant women (N = 65) and those with missing data on key variables (N = 142) were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 1,217 participants included in the final analytic sample, 19.6% (18.2% with symptoms at least once/month) met the 4 IRLSSG diagnostic criteria in the absence of positional discomfort or leg cramps; 14.5% reported RLS symptoms at least once/week and 10.1% indicated symptoms ≥ 3x/week. Excluding respondents with diabetes, kidney disease, or anemia reduced these rates only slightly. Those with RLS were more likely to be older, female, lower income, unemployed, disabled, non-Hispanic white, and less likely to be college educated than those without RLS. Mood and sleep impairment were significantly elevated in those with RLS; after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle characteristics, health history, and other factors, those with RLS remained significantly more likely to indicate a history of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.6) and anxiety (OR = 1.6, CI 1.1, 2.2), to report sleep impairment both 4 (OR = 2.4, CI 1.6, 3.7) and 7 days/week (OR = 1.8, CI 1.3, 2.4), and a mean sleep duration < 5 h/night (OR = 1.7, CI 1.2, 2.3). These associations increased in both strength and magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (p's for trend ≤ 0.01). Conclusions: Findings of this preliminary anonymous survey study suggest that RLS prevalence is high in this Appalachian primary care population and that RLS is associated with significant burden in terms of both mood and sleep impairment.

AB  - Background: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for their newborns during this time. Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered to an individual or group related to infant general health or care and parent-infant relationships. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013). Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post-birth related to the health or care of an infant or parent-infant relationships. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors (JB, CTB) assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Main results: Of the 27 trials (3949 mothers and 579 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) reported useable data. Educational interventions included: five on infant sleep enhancement, 12 on infant behaviour, three on general post-birth health, three on general infant care, and four on infant safety. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only 13 were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these 13 meta-analyses, only four were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education about sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more night-time minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours at six weeks of age (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. However, it had no significant effect on the mean difference in minutes of crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age. Education related to infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91). Authors' conclusions: The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education related to sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep but appears to have no effect on infant crying time. Education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - Epidemiological studies demonstrated initially that maternal undernutrition results in low birth weight with increased risk for long-lasting energy balance disorders. Maternal obesity and diabetes associated with high birth weight, excessive nutrition in neonates, and rapid catchup growth also increase the risk of adult-onset obesity. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease concept, nutrient supply perturbations in the fetus or neonate result in long-term programming of individual body weight set point. Adipose tissue is a key fuel storage unit involved mainly in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Studies in numerous animal models have demonstrated that the adipose tissue is the focus of developmental programming events in a sex- and depot-specific manner. In rodents, adipose tissue development is particularly active during the perinatal period, especially during the last week of gestation and during early postnatal life. In contrast to rodents, this process essentially takes place before birth in bigger mammals. Despite these different developmental time windows, altricial and precocial species share several mechanisms of adipose tissue programming. Offspring from malnourished dams present adipose tissue with a series of alterations: impaired glucose uptake, insulin and leptin resistance, low-grade inflammation, modified sympathetic activity with reduced noradrenergic innerva-tions, and thermogenesis. These modifications reprogram adipose tissue metabolism by changing fat distribution and composition and by enhancing adipogenesis, predisposing the offspring to fat accumulation. Subtle adipose tissue circadian rhythm changes are also observed. Inappropriate hormone levels, modified tissue sensitivity (especially glucocorticoid system), and epigenetic mechanisms are key factors for adipose tissue programming during the perinatal period. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Epilepsy is the commonest chronic neurological disorder to complicate pregnancy, having an incidence of 0.15% to 10%. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is the principal cause of death, and seizure control is the key to minimizing this risk. The aim of antenatal care is to optimize seizure control. The lowest dose of antiepileptic medication that protects against seizures should be chosen. Non-adherence to treatment may present a greater risk to the developing fetus than antiepileptic drug exposure. Adequate rest and sleep is mandatory for epileptic women. The normal anti epileptic drug regimen should be continued during labor. An elective cesarean section should be considered if there have been frequent tonic clonic or prolonged complex partial seizures towards the end of pregnancy. Breast feeding is not contraindicated. Appropriate contraceptive advice should be given. The importance of pre conceptual care in a subsequent pregnancy should be reiterated.

AB  - Background: A theory is a set of ideas that attempt to explain phenomena and can provide guiding principles on which to base practice. Many theories from biological and social sciences are relevant to women's health and well-being during pregnancy and after birth, yet theory is not commonly explicitly reported in perinatal research. Method: This paper outlines the importance of theory to perinatal research and provides a pragmatic overview of when and how to use theory in research. In particular, we consider (i) deciding when it is appropriate to use theory, (ii) choosing which theory to use and (iii) how to operationalise theory in research. We give examples that illustrate how four different theories have been used in perinatal research to increase understanding and inform the development of interventions. Conclusion: Even when it is not appropriate to use theory in our research, careful consideration of pertinent theories contributes to greater clarity of concepts and understanding of different explanations or perspectives on what we are studying. It also prompts us to consider where our research fits in terms of contribution to knowledge or the development and evaluation of treatments. However, it is important that a critical approach is taken so that theories continue to be developed. In this way we will systematically advance our understanding of general factors or processes that are relevant to perinatal health, as well as those factors that are unique to perinatal health. © 2013 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.

AB  - The study examines whether anxiety or chronic relationship stress alter the way that couple conflict affects cortisol levels for women and men during the transition to parenthood. Saliva samples, assayed for cortisol, were collected before and after couple interaction from 128 heterosexual couples expecting their first child. Confirming prior research, expectant mothers had higher cortisol levels than their spouses, and gestational age was linked to women's cortisol level. Negativity during couple interaction was associated with greater cortisol reactivity for men, but not women. Tests of moderation indicated little relation between negativity and cortisol recovery for individuals with a low level of anxiety or little history of chronic arguing with the partner. However, among individuals with elevated levels of either of these two factors, negativity was linked to less cortisol recovery for men, but more cortisol recovery for women. Consistent results were also found for the relation between low warmth in the couple interaction and both reactivity and recovery for men and women high in anxiety. Future research should examine whether pregnancy is responsible for these different gender patterns, or whether the inhibition of negativity is stressful for women with high levels of risk. © 2012 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Current research suggests that mood varies from season to season in some individuals, in conjunction with light-modulated alterations in chronobiologic indices such as melatonin and cortisol. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations in darkness on mood in depressed antepartum women, and to determine the relationship of seasonal mood variations to contemporaneous blood melatonin and cortisol measures; a secondary aim was to evaluate the influence of seasonal factors on measures of melancholic versus atypical depressive symptoms. We obtained measures of mood and overnight concentrations of plasma melatonin and serum cortisol in 19 depressed patients (DP) and 12 healthy control (HC) antepartum women, during on-going seasonal variations in daylight/darkness, in a cross-sectional design. Analyses of variance showed that in DP, but not HC, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD) scores were significantly higher in women tested during seasonally longer versus shorter nights. This exacerbation of depressive symptoms occurred when the dim light melatonin onset, the melatonin synthesis offset, and the time of maximum cortisol secretion (acrophase) were phase-advanced (temporally shifted earlier), and melatonin quantity was reduced, in DP but not HC. Serum cortisol increased across gestational weeks in both the HC and DP groups, which did not differ significantly in cortisol concentration. Nevertheless, serum cortisol concentration correlated positively with HRSD score in DP but not HC; notably, HC showed neither significant mood changes nor altered melatonin and cortisol timing or quantity in association with seasonal variations. These findings suggest that depression severity during pregnancy may become elevated in association with seasonally related phase advances in melatonin and cortisol timing and reduced melatonin quantity that occur in DP, but not HC. Thus, women who experience antepartum depression may be more susceptible than their nondepressed counterparts to phase alterations in melatonin and cortisol timing during seasonally longer nights. Interventions that phase delay melatonin and/or cortisol timing-for example, increased exposure to bright evening light-might serve as an effective intervention for antepartum depressions whose severity is increased during seasonally longer nights. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The role of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in pregnancy is not well studied, but an increasing body of literature appears to indicate that there may be adverse maternal and foetal health effects of the disease. OSA is associated with a twofold risk of pre-eclampsia. The small size of the existing investigations still leave unanswered questions about the consequences of OSA as it relates to some other clinically relevant outcomes such as eclampsia, stillbirth and maternal mortality. A consistent body of literature has emerged demonstrating an increased risk of insulin resistance and diabetes associated with OSA. However, among pregnant women, the association appears to be related to short sleep duration. Well-designed and adequately powered studies are needed to further delineate the role of OSA and sleep duration on pregnancy outcome and the mechanisms of those effects. © Touch medical media 2013.

AB  - We report on two pregnant women who either had de novo restless legs syndrome (RLS) or had marked enhancement of preexisting RLS symptoms during pregnancy. Both patients had ferritin values <50. μg/L at baseline. The patients had relevant sleep disorders and daytime symptoms caused by RLS. The women were treated in an open paradigm with intravenous iron sucrose. A few weeks after therapy, both patients experienced a significant reduction or even remission of RLS symptoms. Their quality of life and sleep substantially improved and no treatment-related adverse effects were observed. According to our initial experience, intravenous iron sucrose administration appears to be an effective therapy in RLS patients with low ferritin values during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Study Objective: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and small-for-gestational age. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A large tertiary medical center. Patients or Participants: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. Measurements and Results: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-for-gestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that the sensory-motor characteristics of aerodigestive reflexes are dependent on stimulus type and volumes, sleep or awake states, and maturation. Thirteen neonates were studied at 33.6 ± 0.5 wk (time 1) and 37.3 ± 0.5 wk (time 2) postmenstrual age using multimodal provocative esophageal manometry concurrent with video polysomnography. Effects of graded volumes (399 infusions at time 1, 430 infusions at time 2) of midesophageal stimulation with air, water, and apple juice on the sensory thresholds and recruitment frequency of upper esophageal sphincter (UES), esophageal body, and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) reflexes were investigated during sleep and awake states. Sensory thresholds for aerodigestive reflexes between maturational stages were similar. Increased frequency recruitment of UES contractile reflex, LES relaxation reflex, and peristaltic reflexes were noted at time 2 (all, P < 0.05). Graded stimulus-response relationships were evident at time 1 and time 2 during awake and sleep states (P < 0.05). Secondary peristalsis vs. esophago-deglutition response proportions during sleep at time 1 vs. time 2 (P = 0.001) and awake vs. sleep at time 2 (P = 0.02) were distinct. We concluded that sensory-motor effects of esophageal mechanosensitivity, osmosensitivity, and chemosensitivity are advanced in sleep with maturation. Sleep further modulates the frequency recruitment and the type of aerodigestive reflexes. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Objective Depression during pregnancy is today one of the greatest medical risks for expectant mothers and newborns. It is associated with numerous morbid conditions and with postnatal depression. Identifying depression during pregnancy is therefore a major public health concern, but screening for depression is not routinely carried out in somatic settings. We hypothesized that the presence of numerous somatic complaints contributes to the detection of an increased risk of depression during pregnancy. Study design A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1000 consecutive pregnant women approached during OB/GYN visits at a general maternity hospital. They were asked to fill out a questionnaire, which contained the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and a checklist of 18 somatic complaints. Results The median number of somatic complaints was 5 (interquartile range 3-7). The risk of depression during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters was 18.3% (EPDS score > 10.5). Logistic regression revealed that when the somatic complaints total score moved from 3 to 7, the odds of moving from not-at-risk to at-risk for antenatal depression were multiplied by 2.91. Conclusion Our results call for further research exploring somatic complaints and their link to depression during pregnancy. Until more knowledge is available, we suggest considering that women with a high number of somatic complaints during pregnancy are at high risk for depression and should be referred for further diagnostic clinical assessment and care. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The atrioventricular block is a delay or interruption of the electrical impulse from the sinusal node, to level of the auricle-ventricular nodule. This is a congenital disease affecting 1 of every 20,000-25,000 born alive. It is secondary to an abnormal embryonic development of the node AV, and proximal branches of the bundle of His, associated with structural cardiac abnormalities or without structural malformations, for maternal isoimmunization with antibodies that cause immunological irreversible damage in the fetal heart tissue, by inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. Detected by fetal Doppler or echocardiography, between 16 and 30 weeks of gestation for persistent fetal bradycardia, with congestive heart failure or fetal dropsy with mortality of 20%. Factors of worst prognosis are: Coexistence with cardiovascular malformations, heart failure, ventricular frequency below 50 per minute during sleep, bradycardia less than 30 per minute, pacemaker under or changing and long QT. Medical treatment or pacemaker in newborns and breastfed infants is indicated with cardiac insufficiency and ventricular frequency below 50 per minute. In children and asymptomatic teenagers, follow-up with monitoring and echocardiography is recommended. Because our patient did not have them, we decided only to follow him with monthly echocardiogram and Holter every six months, unless there were data of low cardiac output.

AB  - Background: To date few studies have examined how multiple layers of influences shape the emergence of bed-sharing practices in the first 2. years postpartum. In our report, we examined bed-sharing in a large multiethnic sample, exploring the influences of three broad classes of influence on bed-sharing at single time points and across time: (1) sociodemographic and (2) contextual factors such as breastfeeding, maternal mental health and stress, and (3) child temperament and sleep habits. Methods: Frequencies of bed-sharing were assessed at two time points, 2 and 24. months, in a population-based multiethnic (Dutch, Turkish or Moroccan, and Caribbean) sample of 6309 children born in the Netherlands. Results: In Dutch mothers, the majority of mothers did not share their beds with their child, and bed-sharing rates decreased from 2 to 24. months. Other ethnic groups showed higher bed-sharing rates, typified by both increases in bed-sharing (the Turkish and Moroccan group) and persistence of bed-sharing over time (the Caribbean group). There were few family and child characteristics associated with bed-sharing in the non-Dutch ethnic groups. In contrast, bed-sharing in Dutch mothers was associated with child temperament and sleeping problems, maternal depression, and sociodemographic variables like crowding and maternal education. Conclusions: Our results suggest that mothers with a Turkish and Moroccan or Caribbean background were more influenced by cultural values, whereas bed-sharing practices were more reactive in the Dutch group. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objetive To determine whether full-term newborn infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) present immature/ disorganised EEG patterns in the immediate neonatal period, and whether there was any relationship with maternal glycaemic control. Design and setting Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a tertiary hospital neonatal unit. Patients 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born between 2010 and 2013. Interventions All underwent video-EEG recording lasting >90 min at 48-72 h of life. Main outcome measures We analysed the percentage of indeterminate sleep, transient sharp waves per hour and mature-for- gestational age EEG patterns (discontinuity, maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI), asynchrony, asymmetry, ? brushes, encoches frontales and ?/? rolandic activity). The group of IDM was divided into two subgroups according to maternal HbA1c: (1) HbA1c?6% and (2) HbA1c<6%. Results Compared with healthy newborns, IDM presented significantly higher percentage of indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%; p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and ? brushes in the bursts (6% vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3 s vs 0 s; p=0.017); fewer encoches frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced ?/? rolandic activity (3/h vs 9/ h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; p<0.001). IDM with maternal HbA1c?6% showed greater percentage of ? brushes in the burst (14% vs 4%; p=0.007). Conclusions Full-term IDM newborns showed video- EEG features of abnormal development of brain function. Maternal HbA1c levels<6% during pregnancy could minimise the risk of cerebral dysmaturity.

AB  - Debate persists whether coffee is beneficial or problematic for human health. Coffee consumption has been associated with a decrease in risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that healthy, habitual coffee drinkers are more protected from the risk of contracting diabetes than individuals who do not drink coffee. Coffee consumption has been associated with a reduced incidence of impaired glucose tolerance, hyperglycaemia and insulin sensitivity. Data suggest that several coffee components, such as chlorogenic acids, are involved in the health benefits of coffee. Various mechanisms for this protective effect have been proposed, including effects on incretin release, liver glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Epidemiological data support numerous other health benefits for coffee, including reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD), a protective effect against some neurodegenerative conditions, a favourable effect on liver function and a protective effect against certain cancers. These associations are based mainly on observational studies and are currently insufficient to recommend coffee consumption as an interventional strategy for risk reduction in type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. While excessive consumption can have adverse effects on some conditions, particularly in terms of sleep quality, these effects vary among individuals and most people do not have any symptoms from coffee drinking. Moderate coffee consumption is associated with no or little risk of severe diseases and may offer substantial health benefits. Thus, coffee is a safe, low-energy beverage and suitable for most adult people. ©TOUCH MEDICAL MEDIA 2013.

AB  - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman's ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4-15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≥9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m2 ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≥9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Preoperative assessment and premedication represent important preparatory steps to ensuring a smooth and effective induction of anaesthesia. A thorough review of the child's medical history, previous anaesthetics, medications, allergies and family history is essential to design the optimal anaesthetic for the child and his/her surgery. Risks must be addressed with the parents as appropriate based on the local standards. Preoperative anxiolysis may assume several strategies, with premedication with a pharmacologic agent very common and most successful. This review focuses on the preoperative assessment and premedication for children undergoing elective surgery. © 2013 Copyright European Society of Anaesthesiology.

AB  - Child abuse predicts a wide range of long-lasting deleterious outcomes, including disruptions in the biological systems central to emotion arousal and regulation. However, little is known about the specific ways in which child abuse affects adulthood sympathetic reactivity and recovery. This study investigated the association between child abuse experience and adult skin conductance level and habituation in 85 at-risk women as they completed a self-report trauma questionnaire. Childhood emotional abuse was independently associated with blunted skin conductance habituation over the course of survey completion after controlling for other abuse subtypes and current trauma symptoms. These results suggest that women emotionally abused as children experience prolonged emotional arousal and poor physiological regulation of emotion in response to reminders of traumatic experiences. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The widespread impact of cancer worldwide and noncurative treatment methods despite all developments drive patients towards investigating and using nonconventional treatment methods. Herbs, which have an important role in complementary and alternative medicine practices, may cause unfavorable results when used especially with chemotherapeutics in cancer patients due to the substances they contain and due to the properties of some, which still cannot be clarified. Further overshadowing the success of the treatments, patients do not talk about these issues with their doctors and physicians are unable to comprehend these properties of herbs. In this compilation we aimed to clarify the concepts of complementary and alternative medicine, to gather the properties of important and frequently used herbs, and to increase the awareness of physicians on this subject. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

AB  - Thyroid hormones are extremely important for metabolism, development, and growth during the lifetime. The hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis is precisely regulated for these purposes. Much of our knowledge of this hormonal axis is derived from experiments in animals and mutations in man. This review examines the hypothalamo- pituitary-thyroid axis particularly in relation to the regulated 24-hour serumTSHconcentration profiles in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including obesity, primary hypothyroidism, pituitary diseases, psychiatric disorders, and selected neurological diseases. Diurnal TSH rhythms can be analyzed with novel and precise techniques, eg, operator-independent deconvolution and approximate entropy. These approaches provide indirect insight in the regulatory components in pathophysiological conditions. © 2013 The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Using uterine explants from Per1::Luc rats and in situ hybridization, we recently reported that the circadian property of the molecular clock in the uterus and placenta is stably maintained from non-pregnancy, right through to the end stage of pregnancy under regular light-dark (LD) cycles. Despite long-lasting increases in progesterone during gestation and an increase in estrogen before delivery, the uterus keeps a stable Per1::Luc rhythm throughout the pregnancy. The study suggests the importance of stable circadian environments for fetuses to achieve sound physiology and intrauterine development. This idea is also supported by epidemiological and animal studies, in which pregnant females exposed to repeated shifting of the LD cycles have increased rates of reproductive abnormalities and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Leading from this, we introduced artificial circadian environments with controlled lighting conditions to human preterm infants by developing and utilizing a specific light filter which takes advantage of the unique characteristics of infants' developing visual photoreceptors. In spite of growing evidence of the physiological benefits of nighttime exposure to darkness for infant development, many Japanese Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) still prefer to maintain constant light in preparation for any possible emergencies concerning infants in incubators. To protect infants from the negative effects of constant light on their development in the NICU, we have developed a new device similar to a magic mirror, by which preterm infants can be shielded from exposure to their visible wavelengths of light even in the constant light conditions of the NICU while simultaneously allowing medical care staffto visually monitor preterm infants adequately. The device leads to significantly increased infant activity during daytime than during night time and better weight gains. © 2013 Watanabe, Akiyama, Hanita, Li, Nakagawa, Kaneshi, Ohta and Japan RED filter study group.

AB  - Previous research on the association between maternal daily stress and cortisol in pregnancy has yielded inconsistent findings. However, past studies have not considered whether stressful experiences in childhood impact maternal cortisol regulation in pregnancy. In this pilot study, we aimed to examine whether the association between maternal daily stress and cortisol differed according to maternal history of child abuse. Forty-one women provided salivary cortisol samples at wake-up, 30 min after wake-up, and bedtime for 3 days at three times over second and third trimesters of pregnancy. On each day of cortisol collection women reported their daily stress. Women reported child abuse experiences prior to age 18 years by completing 15 items from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale. Twenty-one percent (N 9) of women reported a history of child sexual abuse (CSA), 44% (N 18) reported a history of non-sexual child abuse and 34% (N 14) reported no history of child abuse. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analyses revealed that stress in the day prior was associated with increases in morning cortisol in women with CSA histories compared to women with non-sexual abuse histories or no history of child abuse. Increases in evening cortisol were associated with increases in daily stress in women with CSA histories compared to women with non-sexual abuse histories or no history of child abuse. Results reveal a dynamic association between daily stress and cortisol in pregnancy and suggest that patterns differ according to maternal child abuse history. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Background. Shift-work is suggested to affect fetal development negatively. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm changes may disturb fetal growth or lead to complications during pregnancy. Exposure to constant light is an environmental stressor that can affect the circadian system and has been shown to induce neurochemical and behavioral changes when used during the prenatal and/or postnatal period in experimental animals. However, studies investigating long-term effects of constant light in the offspring are sparse. Methods. An accidental power outage resulted in pregnant females being housed under constant light (LL) conditions for seven days of the offspring perinatal development (embryonic day 20 to postnatal day 4). The long-term effects of constant light on the behavior in the adult offspring were assessed by means of open field, object recognition, and water maze tests. Results. In adulthood, LL-animals displayed an intact recognition memory and no deficits in spatial learning or memory. In the open field test, LL-animals exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior, observed as significantly more thigmotaxis and less ambulation. These results were confirmed in the other behavioral tests as the LL-animals spent less time exploring the objects in the object recognition test, and showed thigmotactic behavior also in the water maze test. Conclusion. The results confirm that early life experience can cause changes in brain development that shape brain function and add to the sparse literature on long-term effects of constant light conditions during perinatal development on specific behaviors in adulthood. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.

AB  - Puberty is the time in which a child's sexual and physical characteristics mature. It is initiated by hormonal changes triggered by the hypothalamus. Unipolar depression becomes more common in girls than boys at the time of puberty, as a result of an increased incidence of depressive episodes in girls at that time. The various signs and symptoms of this condition includes abdominal pain, insomnia or over-sleeping, headache, stomach problems, breathlessness, tremors, and heart palpitations, Eating disorders, severe depression. It is estimated that depression rates increase to 5% to 8% during puberty. The relation between puberty and depression has been published in various journals. Research suggests that an pubertal maturation in girls correlates with a number of detrimental outcomes. This article reviews the relation between Puberty and Depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological disorder which predominantly affects women. Pregnancy is one of the most common conditions leading to secondary RLS. Severe symptoms of RLS may lead to complications of pregnancy and/or labor. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in pregnant women. METHODS: Women in the third trimester of gravidity filled out a simple questionnaire based on the official diagnostic criteria for RLS. Positive responders were interviewed in order to further characterize their symptoms. Afterwards information on changes in frequency and/or intensity of the symptoms after delivery was obtained by a telephone follow-up. All data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 300 questionnaires were completed. All 94 RLS-positives met the four diagnostic criteria (31.33%). There was no difference in age, body mass index, or the number of previous pregnancies between RLS-positives and RLS-negatives, but weight gain during pregnancy was significantly higher in RLS--positives. More than 30% of positives had clinically significant symptoms, and 50% reported sleep disturbances. Almost 75% of the cases of RLS were secondary, i.e., symptoms occurred only during pregnancy (with a peak in the third trimester). More complications of pregnancy or labor occurred in women with RLS, but this was only marginally significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the relatively high prevalence of RLS in pregnant women compared with the general population. Although almost three--fourths of the symptoms were only transient throughout pregnancy, the impact of the severe symptoms and sleep deprivation on the course of pregnancy and delivery was not negligible. Early detection and adequate treatment of severe RLS are necessary to prevent maternal discomfort and possible health risks. The questionnaire method is a simple, reliable diagnostic tool. © 2013 Neuroendocrinology Letters.

AB  - In March 2012, an article in The Straits Times entitled 'Freezing eggs could reverse falling birth rate' suggested that employing the latest oocyte cryopreservation techniques could both foster individual women's reproductive autonomy and impact Singapore's fertility rate, which in recent years has consistently been among the world's lowest. The article cited both local and international fertility specialists' approval of elective oocyte cryopreservation for young women wishing to protect their reproductive potential against ageing and as a potential antidote to the contemporary 'delay and defer' model of family-building. Later in 2012, the Ministry of Health announced a review of oocyte cryopreservation policy taking into account related medical, scientific and ethical issues, while the Singapore College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists endorsed oocyte cryopreservation as an "important, safe and efficient technology". This paper outlines and analyses the arguments and empirical evidence used both to support and oppose offering elective oocyte cryopreservation as a routine fertility service, before concluding that this remains unjustifiable on the basis of insufficient evidence of its clinical efficacy and safety as regards either pregnancy rates or birth outcomes. If it is to be made available at all for these reasons in Singapore, it should be subjected to rigorous clinic-specific evaluation in accordance with accepted clinical and ethical norms.

AB  - We have investigated if biological rhythms, which affect many physiological and pathological events, influence the time of birth. Two hundred and sixty-three cases who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of active labor and who delivered vaginally were enrolled in the study. Information about the age, gravidity, parity, gestational age on admission, and time of onset of labor and birth was registered. A Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was administered for determining the patients' chronotypes and dividing them into a morning- or evening-type group. While 20 (35%) of the morning-types delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h, only 11 (19%) of them delivered between 06:00 and 12:00 h. From the evening types, 6 (33%) delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h and 3 (17%) between 06:00 and 12:00 h. We conclude that there was no statistically significant difference between the chronotypes in terms of delivery time. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Melatonin is a hormone produced in terrestrial vertebrates and humans in the pineal organ, an endocrine gland. It was established that one of the major functions of melatonin is the synchronization of the function of all organs and the regulation of seasonal and diurnal rhythms of their physiological activity. The synchronization function and rhythm regulation are performed in accordance with the circadian rhythm of melatonin expression, depending on the length of day and night. Melatonin is able to influence the growth, development, and physiological activity of different types of cells, affecting the mechanisms of signaling pathways and cascades similarly to growth factors. It was confirmed that the processes of conception, pregnancy, and childbirth directly depend on the rhythm and secretion profile of the epiphyseal hormone melatonin in the body. In this review, we attempt to combine the available published data on the involvement of melatonin in various physiological processes during the preimplantation and postimplantation periods of life of the organism and its positive and negative effects at the stages of puberty. © 2013 Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - Late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) is now considered the best approach to screen patients suspected of having endogenous hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome). As the use of LNSC increases, new preanalytic and analytic issues have arisen. The routine immunoassay for salivary cortisol seems to have better diagnostic performance than liquid chromatograph/tandem mass spectrometry, although measurement of normal salivary cortisone concentrations with the latter technique is very useful in identifying samples contaminated with topical hydrocortisone. LNSC is very useful in screening for Cushing's syndrome in women with increased corticosteroid-binding globulin resulting from estrogen therapy or pregnancy. Two LNSCs from each patient is recommended for routine screening, although one adequate saliva sample seems to perform well. The overnight dexamethasone suppression test remains superior to LNSC in the evaluation of potential subclinical hypercortisolism in patients with adrenal incidentalomas. Periodic assessment of LNSC is extremely useful in monitoring patients for recurrence of Cushing's disease after pituitary surgery. With the large increase in the number LNSCs being ordered around the world, it is likely that more preanalytic and analytic issues will arise, which laboratorians and clinical chemists will need to resolve. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the number of women having their first babies over the age of 35 in most developed societies has steadily increased. Concerns have been raised over this trend amidst warnings of both the increased risk of fertility problems and health risks to mother and child. Despite this, research into the timing of pregnancy in the context of decreasing fertility has been somewhat neglected, with research typically framed in biomedical rather than social terms. However, this area merits closer attention, given the contradictory nature of societal messages that simultaneously encourage women to pursue careers and enhance lifestyle, whilst warning of 'risks' of infertility and problems in 'delaying' motherhood. This article is based on a small-scale qualitative study that uses data drawn from 11 in-depth interviews with 'older mothers' about their transition to motherhood. The data were thematically analysed. We found that the women drew upon risk discourses around decreasing fertility and advancing maternal age, and that these discourses impacted on their decisions about the timing of their pregnancies. Some mothers felt that they started trying to conceive at 'non-ideal' times, owing to the expectations they held about decreasing fertility. We suggest that the impact of contradictory societal messages around the timing of motherhood need to be more clearly considered for their potential effects on the timing of pregnancy and note how this topic brings the personal, and, by implication, the societal, into conflict with the (narrated) biological. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The free hormone hypothesis states that a hormone's physiological effects depend on the free hormone concentration, not the total hormone concentration. Although the in vivo relationship between free hormone and protein-bound hormone is complex, most experts have applied this view to the design of assays used to assess the free hormone concentration in the blood sampled for testing in vitro. The history of the measurement of free thyroxine, probably the most frequently requested free hormone determination, offers a good example of the approaches that have been taken. Methods that require physical separation of the free hormone from the protein-bound hormone must address both the potential disturbance in the equilibrium between the two, as well as the challenge of quantifying small levels of hormone accurately and precisely. The implementation of mass spectrometry in the clinical laboratory has helped to develop proposed reference measurement procedures. These must be utilized to standardize the variety of immunoassay approaches that currently represent options commercially available to the routine clinical laboratory. Practicing endocrinologists should discuss the details of the free hormone assays offered by the clinical laboratory they utilize for patient result reporting, and clinical laboratories should implement the recommendations of published guidelines to ensure that free hormone results using commercially available immunoassays are as accurate and precise as possible. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context: Questionnaire studies linked symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Whether this association is present when OSA is assessed objectively by polysomnography is not known. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between pregnancy, OSA, and GDM. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted observational case-control studies using polysomnography in 15 nonpregnant, nondiabetic women (NP-NGT), 15 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (P-NGT), and 15 pregnant women with GDM (P-GDM). The groups were frequency matched for age and race/ethnicity. Pregnant women were studied during the late second to early third trimester. Main Outcome Measures: Comparisons of OSA diagnosis and sleep parameters between NP-NGT and P-NGT to assess the impact of pregnancy and between P-NGT and P-GDM to explore the association between GDM and OSA were measured. Results: Compared with NP-NGT, P-NGT women had a higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (median 2.0 vs 0.5, P =.03) and more disrupted sleep as reflected by a higher wake time after sleep onset (median 66 vs 21 min, P<.01) and a higher microarousal index (median 16.4 vs 10.6, P=.01). Among the pregnant women, P-GDM had markedly lower total sleep time (median 397 vs 464 min, P =.02) and a higher AHI (median 8.2 vs 2.0, P=.05) than P-NGT women. OSA was more prevalent in P-GDM than in P-NGT women (73% vs 27%, P =.01). After adjustment for prepregnancy body mass index, the diagnosis of GDM was associated with a diagnosis of OSA [odds ratio 6.60 (95% confidence interval 1.15-37.96)]. In pregnancy, after adjusting for prepregnancy body mass index, higher microarousal index significantly associated with higher hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose levels. Higher oxygen desaturation index was associated with higher fasting glucose levels. Conclusion: Pregnancy is associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep is more disturbed in GDM than in P-NGT women. There is a strong association between GDM and OSA. Copyright © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self-administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P < 0.001) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) prior to pregnancy (P < 0.01). Weight gain during pregnancy was higher in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (P < 0.01). More patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy during pregnancy had impaired glucose metabolism and anaemia. Three patients experienced cataplexy during delivery. The rate of caesarean sections was higher in the narcolepsy-cataplexy group compared to the narcolepsy group (P < 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy-cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. © 2013 European Sleep Research Society.

AB  - Accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed is a leading cause of preventable infant death. Bed sharing, teen motherhood, and Hispanic ethnicity have been associated with infant sleep suffocation death. Fifty-five Hispanic teen mothers were surveyed regarding acculturation/demographic characteristics and their infants' sleep behaviors. Most participants had 2 foreign-born parents from Latin America. Participants with 2 US-born parents were less likely to bed share than their less-acculturated peers. Many participants reported not always placing their infant in a supine sleep position. There is a significant need to reach out to Hispanic teen mothers, particularly from newer immigrant families, with culturally and linguistically appropriate multigenerational clinical messaging on the risks of infant bed sharing and nonsupine sleep positioning.

AB  - Objective-Recently, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been reported to be associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Accordingly, as this is emergent area of research that has significant clinical relevance, the objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between SDB with GDM. Research design and methods-We searched several electronic databases for all of the studies published before January 2013 and reviewed references of published articles. Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate the unadjusted and BMI-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a random effects model. Significant values, weighted effect sizes, and 95% CIs were calculated, and tests of homogeneity of variance were performed. Results-Results from nine independent studies with a total of 9,795 pregnant women showed that SDB was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Women with SDB had a more than threefold increased risk of GDM, with a pooled BMI-adjusted OR 3.06 (95% CI 1.89-4.96). Conclusions-These findings demonstrate a significant association between SDB and GDMthat is evident even after considered confounding by obesity. This meta-analysis indicates a need to evaluate the role of early recognition and treatment of SDB early during pregnancy. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - •PTSD symptoms indirectly predicted suicidal ideation via comorbid sleep disturbances, but had no direct effect.•Polyvictimization predicted sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation independently of PTSD or major depression.•No relationships were substantively altered after adjusting for comorbid major depression. We tested if the risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with PTSD symptoms was dependent on comorbid sleep disturbance. Our cross-sectional sample included 2465 participants with complete data from the 21 year follow-up of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a birth cohort study of young Australians. Using structural equation modelling with indirect pathways we found that 12 month PTSD symptoms did not directly predict suicidal ideation at 21 when adjusting for major depression symptoms, polyvictimization and gender. However, PTSD symptoms had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via past-month sleep disturbance. Our results suggest that increased suicidal ideation in those with PTSD may result from the fact that PTSD sufferers often exhibit other comorbid psychiatric conditions which are themselves known to predict suicidal behaviours. Sleep disturbance may be targeted in those who experience PTSD to help prevent suicidal ideation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the impact of moderate noise on the sleep of very early preterm infants (VPI). Methods: Observational study of 26 VPI of 26-31 weeks' gestation, with prospective measurements of sound pressure level and concomitant video records. Sound peaks were identified and classified according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above background noise. Prechtl's arousal states during sound peaks were assessed by two observers blinded to the purpose of the study. Changes in sleep/arousal states following sound peaks were compared with spontaneous changes during randomly selected periods without sound peaks. Results: We identified 598 isolated sound peaks (5 ≤ SNR < 10 decibel slow response A (dBA), n = 518; 10 ≤ SNR < 15 dBA, n = 80) during sleep. Awakenings were observed during 33.8% (95% CI, 24-43.7%) of exposures to sound peaks of 5-10 dBA SNR and 39.7% (95% CI, 26-53.3%) of exposures to sound peaks of SNR 10-15 dBA, but only 11.7% (95% CI, 6.2-17.1%) of control periods. The proportions of awakenings following sound peaks were higher than the proportions of arousals during control periods (p < 0.005). Conclusions: Moderate acoustic changes can disrupt the sleep of VPI, and efficient sound abatement measures are needed. ©2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Aim: To investigate gender-related differences in amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) associated with neurodevelopmental outcome at 3 years. Methods: Preterms born <30 weeks' gestational age between 2000 and 2002 were prospectively included. aEEGs obtained within the first 2 weeks of life were classified according to aEEG composite scores - including background pattern, sleep-wake cycling (SWC) and seizure activity. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 3 years of age. Results: Neurodevelopmental outcome data was available for 148 of 264 eligible infants - 64 showed a normal outcome and 84 an impaired outcome. A logistic regression model revealed a significant independent influence of IVH, analgetic/sedative/anticonvulsant medication, gestational age and gender on aEEG composite scores. Odds ratios for having an abnormal aEEG composite score within the first 2 weeks of life for 'female sex', 'no IVH', 'no medication' and 'gestational age' were calculated. aEEG did not differ between males and females with normal outcomes. In patients with abnormal outcome, however, male preterms showed more burst-suppression patterns and less SWC when compared with female preterms. Conclusion: Being male with an abnormal outcome at 3 years of age is reflected by a less mature early aEEG when compared with the one of females. This association is independent of IVH and medication and was less evident with increasing gestational age. © 2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite being one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, obesity was not recognized as such until very recently. Although linked to ubiquitous diseases like diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and many others, targeted treatments are few. Diet, exercise, and behavior modification are the pillars of weight loss. When they alone do not achieve the required weight reduction, medications may be used for patients with a BMI above 30 or above 27 if obesity-related comorbidities are present. The spectrum of pharmacologic agents aimed at obesity treatment will be reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Two medications, phentermine and orlistat, have been the only agents approved many years ago and now still standing. Others have come and gone, removed from the market by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of harmful side-effects. However, in the last few years, new drugs have started to emerge. Since 2012, two new medications phentermine-topiramate extended-release combination and lorcaserin have been FDA approved, while at least one more, naltrexone SR/bupropion SR combination is expected to be re-evaluated by the FDA in 2014. SUMMARY: Treating obesity is crucial as it will ultimately result in the prevention of many related chronic diseases and will decrease morbidity and mortality. Weight loss medications are a valuable part of the clinicians toolbox in the treatment of obesity and should be used when appropriate. Having a variety of medications would be a great asset to accommodate various patients' needs and pre-existing medical conditions. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Discomfort in farm animals may be induced by inappropriate types or timing of food supplies. Thus, time restriction of meals and lack of roughage have been shown to be one source of emergence of oral stereotypies and abnormal behaviour in horses which have evolved to eat high-fibre diets in small amounts over long periods of time. This feeding pattern is often altered in domestic environment where horses are often fed low fibre meals that can be rapidly consumed. This study aimed at determining the effect of the temporal pattern of feeding on reproductive efficiency of breeding mares, One hundred Arab breeding mares were divided into two groups that differed only in the temporal pattern of roughage availability: only at night for the standard feeding pattern group (SFP mares), night and day for the "continuous feeding" group (CF mares). The total amount of roughage provided was the same as the CF mares received half of the hay during the day while in paddock (haynets). Mares were tested for oestrus detection by teasing with one stallion and were then examined clinically by rectal palpations and ultrasound before being mated naturally or inseminated by fresh or frozen semen. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse data. The treatment affected significantly the reproductive efficiency of the mares with fewer oestrus abnormalities (p = 0.0002) and more fertility (p = 0.024) in CF mares (conception rate = 81% versus 55% in SFP mares). Ensuring semi-continous feeding by providing roughage may be a way of fulfilling the basic physiological needs of the horses' digestive system, reducing stress and associated inhibitors of reproduction. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of an impact of temporal feeding patterns on reproductive success in a Mammal. Temporal patterns of feeding may be a major and underestimated factor in breeding. © 2013 Benhajali et al.

AB  - Background: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Twelve women (age 7 SD=26.9 7 5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase. Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts >30 min. On average 7 SD, new mothers phase delayed 42 7 80 min (range = 163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6. Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication. Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of impaired circadian rhythm on health has been widely studied in shift workers and trans-meridian travelers. A part from its correlation with sleep and mood disorders, biological rhythm impairment is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer. Preeclampsia is a major public health issue, associated with a significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. While the risks factors for this condition such as obesity, diabetes, pre-existing hypertension have been identified, the underlying mechanism of this multi-factorial disease is yet not fully understood. The disruption of the light/dark cycle in pregnancy has been associated with adverse outcomes. Slightly increased risk for "small for gestational age" babies, "low birth weight" babies, and preterm deliveries has been reported in shift working women. Whether altered circadian cycle represents a risk factor for preeclampsia or preeclampsia is itself linked with an abnormal circadian cycle is less clear. There are only few reports available, showing conflicting results. In this review, we will discuss recent observations concerning circadian pattern of blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive pregnancies. We explore the hypothesis that circadian misalignments may represent a risk factor for preeclampsia. Unraveling potential link between circadian clock gene and preeclampsia could offer a novel approach to our understanding of this multi-system disease specific to pregnancy. © 2013 Ditisheim, Dibner, Philippe and Pechére-Bertschi.

AB  - The peripheral circadian oscillator plays an essential role in synchronizing local physiology to operate in a circadian manner via regulation of the expression of clock-controlled genes. The present study aimed to evaluate the circadian rhythms of clock genes and clock-controlled genes expressed in the rat uterus endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) during the stage of implantation by a DNA microarray. Of 12,252 genes showing significantly expression, 7,235 genes displayed significant alterations. As revealed by the biological pathway analysis using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery online annotation software, genes were involved in cell cycle, glutathione metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway, fatty acid metabolism, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, focal adhesion, and PPAR signaling pathway. The clustering of clock genes were mainly divided into four groups: the first group was Rorα, Timeless, Npas2, Bmal1, Id2, and Cry2; the second group Per1, Per2, Per3, Dec1, Tef, and Dbp; the third group Bmal2, Cry1, E4bp4, Rorβ, and Clock; the fourth group Rev-erbα. Eleven implantation-related genes and 24 placenta formation-related genes displayed significant alterations, suggesting that these genes involved in implantation and placenta formation are controlled under circadian clock. Some candidates as clock-controlled genes were evaluated by using RNA interference to Bmal1 mRNA. Down-regulation of Igf1 gene expression was observed by Bmal1 silencing, whereas the expression of Inhβa was significantly increased. During active oscillation of circadian clock, the apoptosis-related genes Fas and Caspase3 remained no significant changes, but they were significantly increased by knockdown of Bmal1 mRNA. These results indicate that clock-controlled genes are up- or down-regulated in rat UESCs during the stage of decidualization. DNA microarray analysis coupled with RNA interference will be helpful to understand the physiological roles of some oscillating genes in blastocyst implantation and placenta formation. © 2013 Tasaki, Zhao, Isayama, Chen, Yamauchi, Shigeyoshi, Hashimoto and Hattori.

AB  - Health impairments, including reproductive issues, are associated with working nights or rotating shifts. For example, shift work has been associated with an increased risk of irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, infertility, miscarriage, low birth weight or pre-term delivery, and reduced incidence of breastfeeding. Based on what is known about circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms in rodents (and much less in humans), the circadian clock is an integral regulatory part of the reproductive system. When this 24-h program is disordered by environmental perturbation (such as shift work) or genetic alterations, the endocrine system can be impaired. The purpose of this review is to explore the hypothesis that misalignment of reproductive hormones with the environmental light-dark cycle and/or sleep-wake rhythms can disrupt menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and parturition. We highlight the role of the circadian clock in regulating human reproductive physiology and shift work-induced pathology within each step of the reproductive axis while exploring potential mechanisms from the animal model literature. In addition to documenting the reproductive hazards of shift work, we also point out important gaps in our knowledge as critical areas for future investigation. For example, future studies should examine whether forced desynchronization disrupts gonadotropin secretion rhythms and whether there are sleep/wake schedules that are better or worse for the adaptation of the reproductive system to shift work. These studies are necessary in order to define not only whether or not shift work-induced circadian misalignment impairs reproductive capacity, but also to identify strategies for the future that can minimize this desynchronization. © 2013 Gamble, Resuehr and Johnson.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a key role in adaptation to environmental stresses. Parvicellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus secrete corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) into pituitary portal system; CRH and AVP stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release through specific G-protein-coupled membrane receptors on pituitary corticotrophs, CRHR1 for CRH and V1b for AVP; the adrenal gland cortex secretes glucocorticoids in response to ACTH. The glucocorticoids activate specific receptors in brain and peripheral tissues thereby triggering the necessary metabolic, immune, neuromodulatory, and behavioral changes to resist stress. While importance of CRH, as a key hypothalamic factor of HPA axis regulation in basal and stress conditions in most species, is generally recognized, role of AVP remains to be clarified. This review focuses on the role of AVP in the regulation of stress responsiveness of the HPA axis with emphasis on the effects of aging on vasopressinergic regulation of HPA axis stress responsiveness. Under most of the known stressors, AVP is necessary for acute ACTH secretion but in a context-specific manner. The current data on the AVP role in regulation of HPA responsiveness to chronic stress in adulthood are rather contradictory. The importance of the vasopressinergic regulation of the HPA stress responsiveness is greatest during fetal development, in neonatal period, and in the lactating adult. Aging associated with increased variability in several parameters of HPA function including basal state, responsiveness to stressors, and special testing. Reports on the possible role of the AVP/V1b receptor system in the increase of HPA axis hyperactivity with aging are contradictory and requires further research. Many contradictory results may be due to age and species differences in the HPA function of rodents and primates. © 2013 Goncharova.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are currently diagnosed in the presence of impairments in social interaction and communication, and a restricted range of activities and interests. However, there is considerable variability in the behaviors of different individuals with an ASD diagnosis. The heterogeneity spans the entire range of IQ and language abilities, as well as other behavioral, communicative, and social functions. While any psychiatric condition is likely to incorporate a degree of heterogeneity, the variability in the nature and severity of behaviors observed in ASD is thought to exceed that of other disorders. The current paper aims to provide a model for future research into ASD subgroups. In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW), and in uteri exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) - are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The findings from this "proof of principle" paper provide support for this "bottom-up" approach as a feasible method for creating homogenous groups. © 2013 Unwin, Maybery, Wray and Whitehouse.

AB  - Fetal brain development involves the development of the neuro-vegetative (autonomic) control that is mediated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Disturbances of the fetal brain development have implications for diseases in later postnatal life. In that context, the fetal functional brain age can be altered. Universal principles of developmental biology applied to patterns of autonomic control may allow a functional age assessment. The work aims at the development of a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS) based on heart rate patterns. We analysed n = 113 recordings in quiet sleep, n = 286 in active sleep, and n = 29 in active awakeness from normals. We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet sleep (n = 113, 63 females) and active sleep (n = 286, 145 females) state by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. According to universal system developmental principles, we included indices that address increasing fluctuation range, increasing complexity, and pattern formation (skewness, power spectral ratio VLF/LF, pNN5). The resulting models constituted fABAS. fABAS explained 66/63% (coefficient of determination R2 of training and validation set) of the variance by age in quiet, while 51/50% in active sleep. By means of a logistic regression model using fluctuation range and fetal age, quiet and active sleep were automatically reclassified (94.3/93.1% correct classifications). We did not find relevant gender differences. We conclude that functional brain age can be assessed based on universal developmental indices obtained from autonomic control patterns. fABAS reflect normal complex functional brain maturation. The presented normative data are supplemented by an explorative study of 19 fetuses compromised by intrauterine growth restriction. We observed a shift in the state distribution towards active awakeness. The lower WGA dependent fABAS values found in active sleep may reflect alterations in the universal developmental indices, namely fluctuation amplitude, complexity, and pattern formation that constitute fABAS. © 2013 Hoyer et al.

AB  - Background: In Benin, around four million Long-Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets were freely distributed to household to prevent malaria in 2011. In contrast to a previous campaign that targeted only children under 5 years and pregnant women, this distribution campaign was conducted in order to achieve universal coverage. This study presents the results of LLIN coverage and utilization after the distribution campaign. Methods. The study was a cross-sectional household survey which utilized a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. The strata represented the twelve departments covered by the national distribution campaign in 2011 and included a total of 4,800 households randomly selected in the country. A questionnaire adapted from the standard Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) Household Questionnaire was used. Data were entered using QPS software and analyzed with R 2.14.1. Results: LLIN ownership was 86.4% (74 - 94). On average, each household received 3 LLINs (2-4). The proportion of households that met the ratio one net for two persons was 77%.The proportions of individuals sleeping under LLINs were high (84.8%). LLIN use among urban residents was 10% lower than in effective users from rural areas (P = 0.00224). Conclusions: The universal distribution campaign conducted in Benin has increased LLIN ownership and use in the community. But additional efforts are need to improve and maintain LLIN coverage. © 2013Tokponnon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Constant light conditions (LL) carry a risk of disrupting the biological clock of developing animals. Our purpose in this study was to investigate what disorders occur in animals receiving an LL stress during the late embryonic and suckling periods as compared with animals housed in dark-light (14 h-10 h) conditions (DL). In addition, we examined ameliorating effects against the disorder by the oral administration of lutein as an antioxidant. LL caused hypertrophy of the spleen and induced a higher expression of serotonin transporter (5HTT) in the corpus striatum and hippocampus in 15-day-old pups. In 9-week-old offspring, LL caused abnormal behavior in the elevated plus-maze test. The expression levels of 5HTT in the brain of the LL group changed to lower than those in DL group. The oral administration of lutein lessened the abnormality in behavior and 5HTT expression in the hippocampus to a certain degree although the expression levels of 5HTT in the corpus striatum were not altered by lutein diet. LL also induced disorders in the maternal brain with lower expression levels of 5HTT and neuregulin 1. These results indicate that LL during the perinatal periods may induce some neuronal abnormalities in both offspring and mothers that may be partially ameliorated by dietary lutein as an antioxidant.

AB  - The muscular layer of the uterus (myometrium) undergoes profound changes in global excitability prior to parturition. Here, a mathematical model of the myocyte network is developed to investigate the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity is essential to the transition from local to global excitation which the myometrium undergoes just prior to birth. Each myometrial smooth muscle cell is represented by an element with FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics. The cells are coupled through resistors that represent gap junctions. Spatial heterogeneity is introduced by means of stochastic variation in coupling strengths, with parameters derived from physiological data. Numerical simulations indicate that even modest increases in the heterogeneity of the system can amplify the ability of locally applied stimuli to elicit global excitation. Moreover, in networks driven by a pacemaker cell, global oscillations of excitation are impeded in fully connected and strongly coupled networks. The ability of a locally stimulated cell or pacemaker cell to excite the network is shown to be strongly dependent on the local spatial correlation structure of the couplings. In summary, spatial heterogeneity is a key factor in enhancing and modulating global excitability. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - Animals exposed to an early adverse event may be more susceptible to a second source of stress later in life, and these stressors may have additive deleterious effects. Sleep deprivation is known to be a stressor, affecting multiple body functions such as the cognition. Modafinil enhances working memory and attention in healthy non-sleep deprived subjects and in animal models of sleep deprivation. The first aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of maternal separation (MS) combined with paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) in adulthood on recognition memory in rats. Second, we aimed to evaluate whether the administration of modafinil would be able to ameliorate memory deficits induced by MS and PSD. Wistar rat pups were initially distributed into MS and handling (H) groups, with their litters standardized in 4 females and 4 males. In adulthood, the male rats were submitted to PSD or control condition, being redistributed afterwards in modafinil- or vehicle-treatment immediately after the training session of object recognition task. PSD did not potentiate the cognitive deficit due to MS. However, modafinil was able to recover memory impairments associated to PSD and also to MS in the neonatal period. This study demonstrates for the first time that modafinil ameliorates cognitive deficits associated to MS and to PSD in adulthood, independent from MS in the neonatal period. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To analyse the circadian rhythm maturation of temperature, activity and sleep during the first year of life in offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) and its relationship with obesity markers. Methods: A prospective analysis of the children of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) controlled with diet and 19 GDM with insulin). Fetal abdominal circumference was evaluated ecographically during gestation. Skin temperature and rest-activity rhythms were monitored for 3 consecutive days in children at 15days and 1, 3 and 6months. Anthropometrical parameters of the children were evaluated during the first year of life. Results: Children from the GDM groups tended to higher fetal abdominal circumference z-score than controls at the beginning of the last trimester (p=0.077) and at delivery (p=0.078). Mean skin temperature or activity was not different among the groups. The I&lt;O sleep index pointed to increasing concordance with parental sleeping at 3 and 6months but no significant GDM-dependent differences. However, some of the parameters that define temperature maturation and also the circadian function index from the temperature-activity variable were significantly lower at 6months in the GDM+insulin group. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score, as a predictor of fetal adiposity, correlated negatively with parameters related to circadian rhythm maturation as the circadian/ultradian rhythm (P1/Pult ratio). Conclusions: Fetal adiposity correlated with a worse circadian rhythm regulation in ODM. In addition, ODM insulin-treated showed a disturbed pattern of the circadian function index of temperature activity at 6months of age. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

Fetal programming due to maternal nutrition is also an important factor especially in developing countries where intrauterine growth retardation followed by excess nutrition postnatally is causing mismatch predisposing individuals to development of metabolic syndrome and its components. Several epidemiological and animal studies have provided evidence for the link between intrauterine growth retardation and adult metabolic diseases. Deficiency of macronutrients, protein and carbohydrates, during pregnancy and gestation results in lower infant birth weight, a surrogate marker of fetal growth and subsequently insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertension and adiposity in adulthood. The role of micronutrients is less extensively studied but however gaining attention with several recent studies focusing on this aspect. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the developmental origin of adult diseases important among them being alteration of hypothalamic pituitary axis, epigenetic regulation of gene expression and oxidative stress. All of these mechanisms may be acting at different time during gestation and contributing to development of metabolic syndrome in adulthood. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Aim Sense of Coherence (SOC) is hypothesized to have direct physiological consequences on endocrine and immunological processes. In this study, we compare parental SOC scores from pregnancy in groups of infants and parents representing different lifestyles (anthroposophic, partly anthroposophic and nonanthroposophic). We also analyse whether these could predict cortisol levels of the parents and their infants at 6-24 months postpartum. Methods Parental SOC-13 was collected during the third trimester of pregnancy from a birth cohort of families with different lifestyles. Salivary samples were collected from the whole family when the child was 6 months (n = 210), 12 (n = 178) and 24 months of age (n = 149), and cortisol levels were analysed with radioimmunoassay technique. Results Sense of Coherence scores did not differ between the three lifestyle groups, and there were no correlations between SOC scores and salivary cortisol concentrations in separate analyses of mothers, fathers and children at any sampling age or at any sampling time during the day (morning, afternoon, bedtime). Conclusion Sense of Coherence scores did not vary in parents with different lifestyles and were not associated with salivary cortisol levels in parents or in children. © 2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

AB  - Background: Experimental animal work shows that prenatal stress has a persisting effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of offspring. The implications of these findings for human health and development are not yet clear. Methods: The data are based on the ALSPAC cohort, a prospective longitudinal study of a community sample that has followed mothers and children from pregnancy. When the children were aged 15 years, diurnal cortisol samples were collected at wake-up, 30. min post-awakening and at afternoon and evening times on up to three consecutive days on n = 889 adolescents. Diurnal cortisol was predicted from prenatal anxiety and depression, obstetric, life-style, socio-demographic, and postnatal covariates. Results: Multilevel model analysis indicated that maternal prenatal anxiety was associated with a modest alteration of diurnal cortisol, indexed by a reduced cortisol awakening response and flatter diurnal slope. The effects were independent of psychosocial and obstetric covariates and measures of maternal postnatal anxiety; effects were similar for prenatal maternal depression. There was no association between adolescent cortisol and paternal prenatal anxiety. Conclusions: There are small but persisting associations between maternal prenatal mood and diurnal cortisol in the child that persist into adolescence and may constitute a programming effect. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We investigated trends in biological fertility in a comprehensive analysis of 5 major European data sets with data on time to pregnancy (TTP) and proportion of contraceptive failures. In particular, we distinguished a period effect from a birth cohort effect (lifelong tendency) in both sexes. Attempts at conception not resulting in birth were excluded. We analyzed data on pregnancies occurring in 9,247 couples between 1953 and 1993 and performed sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of findings. Separate analyses of each time effect showed an increasing fertility trend. Mutually adjusted analyses demonstrated that this rise was visible as a male cohort effect for both TTP and contraceptive failure. On the other hand, the female birth cohort effect showed a slight fall in the first half of the study period for both TTP and contraceptive failure. As a period effect, fertility remained generally stable, the slight trends in TTP and contraceptive failure being in opposite directions, likely indicating an artifact. The rising trend accords with most previous evidence. The increasing trend in male fertility does not contradict the previously reported semen quality deterioration, the effects of which are calculated to be small. The declining female fertility accords with a falling dizygotic twinning rate during the same period. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

AB  - Developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting drugs and environmental toxicants has been shown to alter a variety of physiological processes in mature offspring. Body (core) temperature (Tc) is a tightly regulated homeostatic system but is susceptible to disruptors of the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid (HPT) axis. We hypothesized that thermoregulation would be disrupted in adult offspring exposed perinatally to an HPT disruptor. Propylythiouracil (PTU) was used as a prototypical compound because of its well known antithyroidal properties. PTU was added to the drinking water of pregnant rats in concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 10ppm from gestational day (GD) 6 through postnatal day (PND) 21. Adult male offspring were implanted with radiotransmitters to monitor Tc and motor activity (MA) and were observed undisturbed at an ambient temperature of 22°C for 12 consecutive days. Data were averaged into a single 24hour period to minimize impact of ultradian changes in Tc and MA. All treatment groups showed a distinct circadian temperature rhythm. Rats exposed to 10ppm PTU exhibited a marked deviation in their regulated Tc with a reduction of approximately 0.4°C below that of controls throughout the daytime period and a smaller reduction at night. Rats exposed to 1 or 2ppm also had smaller but significant reductions in Tc. MA was unaffected by PTU. Overall, developmental exposure to moderate doses of an antithyroidal drug led to an apparent permanent reduction in Tc of adult offspring that was independent of changes in MA. © 2013.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of artificially extended daylight applied during pregnancy on reproductive performance in farmed mink. The material consisted of 536 female Black (or "short NAP") mink aged 2 years. To analyse the reproductive performance, we selected females mated twice during the period 13 to 17 March. Energy-saving bulbs of 11 watts each (equivalent to traditional 60-watt bulbs) were placed above the cages of the females. The experiment involved two groups of females: the control group (n = 258) were females kept under natural daylight throughout pregnancy; the females of the treatment group (n = 278) were additionally subjected to extended photoperiod - up to 16 hours of light per day, applied from 20 March to 15 April. Selected reproduction indicators were analysed among the groups. The extended daylight applied during pregnancy of mink positively influenced many of the analysed indices. The duration of diapause and related total length of gestation decreased, the litter size - both at birth and at weaning - significantly increased. Pre-weaning mortality of young and the proportion of nonbreeding females slightly decreased as a result of the treatment, which from the practical point of view might be seen as a beneficial effect; however, these parameters are shaped by other factors than photoperiod. The whelping season was both commenced and completed earlier among females subjected to extra light during pregnancy, which improved the organization of work on the farm. Artificial illumination of pregnant mink in Poland's climate can be applied with great success and introducing this treatment to the mink breeding technology on a permanent basis should be seriously considered.

AB  - Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder. Secondary RLS includes pregnancy and iron deficiency. Prevalence of RLS in pregnancy ranges from 11% to 27%. We aimed to assess the frequency and characteristics of RLS in pregnancy in a Peruvian population and to evaluate the possible pregnancy or delivery complications due to RLS. Methods: We assessed 218 consecutive expectant mothers at the inpatient clinic of the Hospital San Bartolome in Lima, Peru. Assessment was performed by using the standard diagnostic criteria for RLS and by using a clinical and diagnostic interview. Questionnaires for RLS severity, idiopathic RLS (IRLS), and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) according to the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) were used. Blood examination was performed for hemoglobin and hematocrit. For comparison, RLS patients were matched for age and body mass index (BMI) with pregnant women without RLS. Results: Out of 218 patients, 40 (18.4%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for RLS. In RLS patients, prophylactic iron supplementation therapy during pregnancy was less frequently taken (P = .02). Pregnant women with RLS had a higher ESS score than pregnant controls (10.6 +/- 3.1 vs 7.6. +/- 3.6; P< .001). Preeclampsia was more frequent in RLS (7/40 vs 1/39; P= .03). Conclusions: In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant Peruvian women, especially in those without prophylactic iron supplementation. RLS patients described more EDS. Preeclampsia was more common in RLS. Our study is the first study to indicate a possible association between RLS and preeclampsia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects more than 12 million individuals annually. Power and control are central concepts underlying abusive relationships. Physicians may see IPV victims, perpetrators, and their children for annual examinations, as well as for injuries and health conditions associated with abuse. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women of childbearing age (ie, 14 to 46 years) be screened for IPV. Brief, validated screening tools, such as the 4-item Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Scream (HITS), can be used to facilitate screening. Physicians should always assess patients whose medical histories or presenting symptoms or injuries are consistent with abuse. Risk factors for IPV and consequences of abuse include general health conditions (eg, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome), reproductive issues (eg, gynecologic disorders, unintended pregnancies), psychological conditions (eg, depression, sleep disturbances), and risky health behaviors (eg, substance use, poor health care adherence). Tools for identifying perpetrators are under investigation. To prepare the practice to address IPV, physicians should educate themselves and staff and learn about community and national resources. By identifying and responding to IPV, clinicians may be able to reduce IPV and interrupt the intergenerational cycle of violence.

AB  - Nearly all pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) to some degree, yet its effects on quality of life (QOL) have not been studied extensively. The National Voice of Pregnancy survey was undertaken to increase understanding about the symptoms of NVP and their impact on QOL in women in the United States. In all, 621 currently or recently pregnant women completed an online survey about their NVP experiences. Their responses indicated that NVP can occur at any time of day or night and can have negative effects on eating, sleeping, and ability to handle domestic and occupational responsibilities. Relationships with spouse, family, friends, and coworkers can also be adversely affected. The effects of NVP are greater in women with moderate or severe symptoms, but women with mild NVP are also affected. These findings are consistent with previous studies conducted in various countries. Women sometimes fail to discuss NVP with their health care providers, and QOL issues rarely come up if it is discussed. Most women try dietary and other lifestyle modifications first to control their symptoms. Safe and effective medications are also available to help ease the symptoms of NVP and thereby improve QOL.

AB  - Socioeconomic status (SES) impacts on both structural and functional brain development in childhood, but how early its effects can be demonstrated is unknown. In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma frequency range in awake 6-9-month-olds from areas of East London with high socioeconomic deprivation. Between-subject comparisons of infants from low- and high-income families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants from low-income homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing infants according to maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups yielding lower power. Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and birth weight, as well as smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these differences. Our results show that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on brain activity can already be detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to very early risk for language and attention difficulties. This is the first study to reveal region-selective differences in functional brain development associated with early infancy in low-income families. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In March 2011, the Acromegaly Consensus Group met to revise and update the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acromegaly complications. The meeting was sponsored by the Pituitary Society and the European Neuroendocrinology Association and included experts skilled in the management of acromegaly. Complications considered included cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic, sleep apnea, bone diseases, and mortality. Outcomes in selected, related clinical conditions were also considered, and included pregnancy, familial acromegaly and invasive macroadenomas. The need for a new disease staging model was considered, and design of such a tool was proposed. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: Fetal magnetography enables the recording of biomagnetic fetal signals, including fetal heart and fetal brain signals. These signals allow the determination of fetal behavioral states and functional brain signals with auditory evoked responses (AER). In the current study, we investigated how the behavioral state influences the AER and how stimulation affects fetal state. Methods: One hundred and four fetuses in three age groups (28-31 weeks, 32-35 weeks and 36-41 weeks) were recorded with and without auditory stimulation. Both sessions were scored for fetal states. The AER latency was determined for each state separately. Forty-five additional subjects were recorded with two sessions of 10 min without stimulation to investigate a possible time effect on state changes. Results: The state distribution was significantly different between stimulation and no stimulation conditions. The AER latencies were significantly shorter in active sleep (P 0.013) and active wakefulness (P 0.004) compared to quiet sleep. Conclusion: Auditory stimulation has an effect on fetal states. The state information should be taken into account for the analysis of AER latencies.

AB  - Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory animals, and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Advice concerning behaviour and adaptations of living and working environment is considered an unmet need by patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The aim of this study was to develop a core set of recommendations to be given to patients by their rheumatologists. A systematic literature research of scientific and patient-oriented literature revealed 70 raw recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated and ranked at a meeting of the Ankylosing Spondylitis International Federation (ASIF, 26 participants including 19 patients with AS, 5 rheumatologists and 2 physiotherapists from 13 countries) in November 2011. Thereafter, the 59 remaining recommendations were extensively discussed, supplemented, reworded, condensed and voted on during a meeting of local branch leaders of the AS patient organisation in Germany (Deutsche Vereinigung Morbus Bechterew, DVMB) with 80 participants (95 % of whom with AS), 2 rheumatologists and 1 occupational therapist in March 2012. The core set of final recommendations comprises (1) a general statement regarding living with AS which was considered highly important by patients and (2) the following domains: sitting position, walking, sleeping, at work, exercises, sports and recreational activities, diet and lifestyle, sexuality and pregnancy, fall prevention, car driving and advantages of membership in an AS-specific patient organisation. Most recommendations are relevant already in early disease, others concern advanced AS (e.g. fall prevention and car driving). The selected recommendations received high agreements (80-100 %). A first core set of recommendations for the behaviour and environmental adaptations of patients with AS was established under participation of many patients. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objective To describe the dispensing of the hypnotic alimemazine to children aged 0-3 years and investigate the association between dispensing of alimemazine to children and dispensed hypnotics to their parents. Design An observational cohort study linking information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Prescription Database. Hypnotics dispensed to parents in a 1-year period before pregnancy was associated with dispensed alimemazine for children aged 0-3 years. Patients and setting All children born in Norway in 2008 (N=59 325) and their mothers and fathers were included. Main outcome measures Dispensed alimemazine to children during the first 3 years of life. Results Three percent of children received alimemazine. Dispensed hypnotics to mothers increased the risk of the child receiving a prescription for alimemazine, OR of 2.3 (1.7-3.0) for boys and 1.7 (1.2-2.4) for girls. When both parents had been dispensed prescriptions for hypnotics, the risk increased nearly threefold. A dispensed alimemazine prescription was also associated with dispensed prescriptions for antidepressants to both mother and father, mother's smoking, the child's gender and child's prescriptions for antibiotics, respiratory drugs and dermatological steroids. Conclusions Dispensed alimemazine to children under 3 was associated with parents' previous use of hypnotics, indicating that factors other than the child's health influence the use of hypnotic drugs in infancy and toddler years. The frequent usage of alimemazine in children below 3 years and the association with parents' use of hypnotics should concern prescribing doctors.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is being used increasingly in both clinical practice and hypertension research. Although there are many guidelines that emphasize the indications for ABPM, there is no comprehensive guideline dealing with all aspects of the technique. It was agreed at a consensus meeting on ABPM in Milan in 2011 that the 34 attendees should prepare a comprehensive position paper on the scientific evidence for ABPM. This position paper considers the historical background, the advantages and limitations of ABPM, the threshold levels for practice, and the cost-effectiveness of the technique. It examines the need for selecting an appropriate device, the accuracy of devices, the additional information and indices that ABPM devices may provide, and the software requirements. At a practical level, the paper details the requirements for using ABPM in clinical practice, editing considerations, the number of measurements required, and the circumstances, such as obesity and arrhythmias, when particular care needs to be taken when using ABPM. The clinical indications for ABPM, among which white-coat phenomena, masked hypertension, and nocturnal hypertension appear to be prominent, are outlined in detail along with special considerations that apply in certain clinical circumstances, such as childhood, the elderly and pregnancy, and in cardiovascular illness, examples being stroke and chronic renal disease, and the place of home measurement of blood pressure in relation to ABPM is appraised. The role of ABPM in research circumstances, such as pharmacological trials and in the prediction of outcome in epidemiological studies is examined and finally the implementation of ABPM in practice is considered in relation to the issue of reimbursement in different countries, the provision of the technique by primary care practices, hospital clinics and pharmacies, and the growing role of registries of ABPM in many countries. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Introduction: Biochemical diagnosis of acromegaly relies on measurement of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone (GH). An elevated IGF-1 level above the age- and gender-specific normal range and nonsuppression of GH to oral glucose load to a nadir < 0.4 ng/ml in sensitive assays are currently considered diagnostic of acromegaly. Lack of normative data for both IGF-1 and GH across a wide range of populations and ethnicities, interassay and intraassay laboratory variability, pulsatility of GH secretion, and effects of medications and hormones may confound interpretation of these biochemical tests. Areas covered: Clinical situations in which acromegaly should be suspected and/or investigated. Strengths and limitations of current IGF-1/GH assays are discussed. Clinical scenarios with discordant GH suppression test and IGF-1 levels and, briefly, acromegaly in pregnancy, prolactin-cosecreting tumors, familial acromegaly, and nonpituitary acromegaly are also discussed. Expert opinion: Serum IGF-1 is the cornerstone and in most cases the stand-alone test in the diagnosis and follow-up in patients with acromegaly. Diagnosis depends on the accurate and reliable measurement of serum IGF-1. GH suppression testing is currently used in limited clinical setting. Standardization of IGF-1 assay and development of normative data across a wide population base are needed. Newer bioassays for IGF-1 hold promise for future. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - In the past decade, the growing field of telomere science has opened exciting new avenues for understanding the cellular and molecular substrates of stress and stress-related aging processes over the lifespan. Shorter telomere length is associated with advancing chronological age and also increased disease morbidity and mortality. Emerging studies suggest that stress accelerates the erosion of telomeres from very early in life and possibly even influences the initial (newborn) setting of telomere length. In this review, we highlight recent empirical evidence linking stress and mental illnesses at various times across the lifespan with telomere erosion. We first present findings in the developmental programming of telomere biology linking prenatal stress to newborn and adult telomere length. We then present findings linking exposure to childhood trauma and to certain mental disorders with telomere shortening. Last, we review studies that characterize the relationship between related health-risk behaviors with telomere shortening over the lifespan, and how this process may further buffer the negative effects of stress on telomeres. A better understanding of the mechanisms that govern and regulate telomere biology throughout the lifespan may inform our understanding of etiology and the long-term consequences of stress and mental illnesses on aging processes in diverse populations and settings. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The circadian clock has been linked to female reproductive physiology and endocrine in mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have shown increased rates of abnormal reproduction and adverse pregnancy. But little is known how the circadian rhythms affect reproduction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influences of circadian rhythms on estrous cycle in female mice using clock gene Rev-erb-α knock out (Rev-erb-α(-/-)) mice. To test the fertility of Rev-erb-α(-/-) mice, litter sizes were counted after mating with C57BL/6J male mice. HE staining was used to observe the change of follicle development. The number of embryos of Rev-erb-α(+/+) and Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice was compared 1.5 d after mating with C57BL/6J male mice. Then Rev-erb-α(+/+) and Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice were housed to adult, and daily vaginal lavage with 0.9% saline was used to monitor estrous cycle for at least 30 days. Quantity of various cells was counted on specified smears views after staining. We observed estrous cycles of Rev-erb-α(+/+) and Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice using line plots and periodic spectrograms. The results showed that the Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice were infertility, and the number of embryos of Rev-erb-α(-/-) females was less than that of Rev-erb-α(+/+) females. However, the follicle development of Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice was normal. The estrous cycle of Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice was 3.22 days longer than that of Rev-erb-α(+/+) female mice. The results suggest that loss of Rev-erb-α prolongs estrous cycle, which is probably one of the reasons for female mice infertility, and circadian rhythm is important for mammalian estrous cycle.

AB  - Objectives: The behavioral phenotype observed during lactation is peculiar, mainly due to the rise of two specific behaviors: maternal aggressive behavior and maternal care. Current data reported are inconsistent regarding the relationship between these behaviors. Some studies propose a direct association, while others point to an inverse correlation. Additionally, sleep disturbances and other sources of stress may affect the maternal behavior phenotype during lactation. Thus, the present study evaluated the correlation between maternal behavior and maternal aggression, in both control and sleep-restricted female rats. Methods: Eighteen 90-days old female Wistar rats were distributed into two groups: 1) Control (n = 9) - not submitted to any manipulation during pregnancy, and 2) Sleep restriction (n = 9) - submitted to sleep restriction during the entire pregnancy. At the fifth day postpartum both maternal and aggression behavior were assayed by the resident intruder paradigm. Both behaviors were correlated by means of Pearson correlation matrices, independently for control and sleep-restricted groups. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between latency to lateral attack and frequency of maternal behavior and between latency to lateral attack and duration of maternal behavior, but only in the control group. Results: The present data indicate that maternal and aggressive behavior during lactation (represented by shorter latencies to attack) oppose each other, and that maternal care levels are proportional to the time taken until the first attack by the female. Conclusion: Sleep restriction prevented the correlations observed for the control group, probably due to an increase in maternal aggression accompanied by decreased or sustained maternal care.

AB  - Recent research and policy around sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) have emphasised the place of safe sleeping practices within SUDI prevention strategies. Māori SUDI prevention workers have focussed on innovations around the safe sleep environment for some time now, as they have grappled with difficult to change and disproportionately high Māori SUDI rates. The wahakura (a flax bassinet modelled on a traditional Māori infant sleeping item) was developed in 2006 aiming to mitigate some of the risks of bedsharing with vulnerable infants, in particular infants exposed to maternal smoking in pregnancy. Early wahakura projects in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay showed high acceptability, effectiveness as an infant health promotion vehicle but difficulty maintaining a low/no cost supply for vulnerable families. The Hawke's Bay project revealed two pathways forward: the need for robust research to ensure the safety of the wahakura and the exploration of financially viable and more readily available alternatives. Work on both pathways is currently in progress around the country, signalling New Zealand's ongoing contribution to SUDI prevention and its potential contribution to knowledge and practices applicable to indigenous and other marginalised communities worldwide. © NZMA.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) affects from 7% to 19% of childbearing women. Several risk factors for PPD have been identified, yet its cause remains unclear. The pathogenesis of PPD may be related to hormonal fluctuations, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and excessive inflammatory response. Psychometric scales such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) are used to screen for PPD. However, to date there is lack of evidence supporting universal antepartum or postpartum screening. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) are recommended as first-choice treatment. Psychotherapy has been found to be effective as well. PPD is a serious social issue due to its consequences, including an increased risk of suicide and infanticide. PPD is often under-diagnosed and untreated; therefore, efforts are needed to improve perinatal mental health care. This article summarizes the current evidence on the epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, etiology, and treatment of postpartum depression. © Med Sci Tech.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL), also known as lactotropic hormone or Lactotropin, is a phylogenetically ancient proteohormone, which is formed by the lactotropic cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary. It is responsible for the growth of the mammary gland during pregnancy, the milk secretion during lactation and for the regulation of many other endocrine functions but also metabolic effects.In its primary structure human prolactin is composed of 198 amino acids. Its structure is similar to somatotropin. The synthesis of prolactin is controlled by a gene on chromosome 6. Prolactin secretion is regulated by the hypothalamus via neurotransmitters (dopamine) with a circadian rhythm and increased prolactin levels in the second half of the night. In contrast to dopamine which controls the secretion of prolactin as inhibitor, the following hypothalamic factors are stimulating the prolactin release: TRH, VIP, angiotensin II, endogenous opioids, oxytocin. Different forms of circulating prolactin have been described: "little prolactin", "big prolactin" (macroprolactin). The importance of makroprolactines is not yet clear. Their presence can lead to an overestimation of prolactin concentration. In humans, elevated levels of prolactin lead to a suppression of oocyte maturation and ovulation.Hyperprolactinemia occurs in less than 1% of the general population and in 10-40% of patients with secondary amenorrhea. About 75% of patients with galactorrhea and amenorrhea have hyperprolactinemia. Of these patients 30% have prolactin-secreting tumors. Hyperprolactinemia can result from hypothyroidism, certain medications (eg antipsychotics), acute and chronic stress in pregnancy and fromstimulation of the nipples. The likelihood of a prolactin-producing tumor of the pituitary gland (prolactinoma) increases with the severity of hyperprolactinemia. Most prolactinomas occur between the age 20 and 40. Pituitary tumors, mostly adenomas, account for 10-15% of all intracranial tumors. Prolactinomas can be distinguished depending on the size of the MRI between micro (< 10 mm) and macroprolactinomas (> 10 mm). Depending on size, location, displacement symptoms (eg, optic chiasm), age and desire for fertility different treatment options such as medical treatment, neurosurgical and radiological treatment options are available. Drug therapy with dopamine agonists is the therapy of choice for most patients with prolactinomas, while surgery is reserved for cases withresistance to drug therapy andspecific indications. The pharmacological effects, side effects and the pharmacological profile of the dopamine agonists bromocriptine, DOPERGIN, Quinagolid and cabergoline is discussed. Cabergoline may result in long-term therapy to fibrosis and heart valve disorders, but only at high doses (> 2 mg in the context of Parkinson's disease therapy). Neurosurgical intervention is indicated as first-line therapy only for patients with infertility, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome or specific forms of macroprolactinomas. The differential diagnosis and management ofmicro-and macro-prolactinomas in patients with and without infertility are discussed. The primary goal of therapy in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas is the normalization of prolactin levels to prevent side effects of hyperprolactinemia (eg, estrogen deficiency symptoms) and tumor shrinkage in case of prolactinomas in order to avoid serious clinical side effects due to continued tumor growth. International guidelines are relevant to the Endocrine Society (USA) for the diagnosis and treatment of Hyperproaktinämie.

AB  - Disruption of sleep causes adverse health outcomes and poor quality of life. People with sleep disruption have higher levels than people without disrupted sleep of depression and anxiety and increased rates of cardiovascular diseases. Women have a higher incidence than men of insomnia and depression related to poor sleep. The types of complaints differ significantly between the sexes. Women are more likely than men to complain of insomnia, headache, irritability, and fatigue than the "typical" symptoms of loud snoring and breathing cessation during sleep. Hormones play an important role in sleep in women. Reproductive hormones were found to have a protective effect on sleep apnea in women of premenopausal age. Pregnancy is another period when the prevalence of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome increases from hormonal effect. Cardiovascular mortality is high in women with obstructive sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy improves outcomes in most cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and therapies for the three most common sleep disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome), along with effects of menopause, pregnancy, and social factors on sleep in women, are key considerations for clinicians caring for female patients across the adult life span.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas. Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and questions about demographics and sleep. Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISI≥10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS≥9 and 9% with EPDS<9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS≥9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS<9 who completed measures in Spanish. Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background: Adequate bowel preparation prior to colonic diagnostic procedures is essential to ensure adequate visualisation. Scope: This consensus aims to provide guidance as to the appropriate use of bowel preparation for a range of defined clinical circumstances. A consensus group from across Europe was convened and met to discuss appropriate bowel preparation. The use of polyethylene glycol (PEG), sodium picosulphate and sodium phosphate (NaP), together with other agents, prokinetics and simethicone, in colonoscopy and small bowel video capsule endoscopy were considered. A systematic review of the literature was carried out and additional unpublished data was obtained from the members of the consensus group where required. Recommendations were graded according to the level of evidence. Findings: PEG-based regimens are recommended first line for both procedures, since their use is supported by good efficacy and safety data. Sodium-picosulphate-based regimens are recommended second line as their cleansing efficacy appears less than PEG-based regimens. NaP is not recommended for bowel cleansing due to the potential for renal damage and other adverse events. However, the use of NaP is acceptable in patients in whom PEG or sodium picosulphate is ineffective or not tolerated. NaP should not be used in patients with chronic kidney disease, pre-existing electrolyte disturbances, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis or a history of hypertension. The timing of the dose, dietary restrictions, use in special patient groups and recording of the quality of bowel preparation are also considered for patients undergoing colonoscopy. During the development of the guidelines the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) issued guidance on bowel preparation for colonoscopy. The ESGE guidelines and these consensus guidelines share many recommendations; differences between the guidelines are reviewed. Conclusion: The use of bowel preparation should be tailored to the individual patient and their specific clinical circumstances. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Patients presenting for surgery often create challenges for the surgical and anaesthetic teams, and in many cases this is due to multifactorial issues rather than a single disease process. In many cases a range of challenging co-morbidities are present. This article focuses on the challenges patients with obesity, old age, immunosuppression and pregnancy bring when they present for surgical intervention. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypertension affects 10% of pregnancies, many with underlying chronic hypertension, and approximately 1-2% will undergo a hypertensive crisis at some point during their lives. Hypertensive crisis includes hypertensive urgency and emergency; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes a hypertensive emergency in pregnancy as persistent (lasting 15. min or more), acute-onset, severe hypertension, defined as systolic BP greater than 160. mmHg or diastolic BP >110. mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Pregnancy may be complicated by hypertensive crisis, with lower blood pressure threshold for end-organ damage than non-pregnant patients. Maternal assessment should include a thorough history. Fetal assessment should include heart rate tracing, ultrasound for growth and amniotic assessment, and Doppler evaluation if growth restriction is suspected. Initial management of hypertensive emergency (systolic BP >160. mmHg or diastolic BP >110. mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) generally includes the rapid reduction of blood pressure through the use of intravenous antihypertensive medications, with goal systolic blood pressure between 140. mmHg and 150. mmHg and diastolic pressure between 90. mmHg and 100. mmHg. First-line intravenous drugs include labetalol and hydralazine, but other agents may be used, including esmolol, nicardipine, nifedipine, and, as a last resort, sodium nitroprusside. Among patients with hypertensive urgency, slower blood pressure reduction can be provided with oral agents. The objective of this article is to review the current understanding, diagnosis, and management of hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and the postpartum period. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain (LBP) and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. Pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic or back pain in pregnancy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Quality of the evidence for outcomes was assessed using the five criteria outlined by the GRADE Working Group. Main results: We included 26 randomised trials examining 4093 pregnant women in this updated review. Eleven trials examined LBP (N = 1312), four examined pelvic pain (N = 661), and 11 trials examined lumbo-pelvic (LBP and pelvic) pain (N = 2120). Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to the results of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and unless noted, were compared to usual prenatal care. For LBP, there was low-quality evidence that in general, the addition of exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.53; six RCTs, N = 543), and disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; two RCTs, N = 146); and water-based exercise significantly reduced LBP-related sick leave (risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; one RCT, N = 241). Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested no significant difference in pain or function between two types of pelvic support belt, between osteopathic manipulation (OMT) and usual care or sham ultrasound (sham US). Very low-quality evidence suggested that a specially-designed pillow may relieve night pain better than a regular pillow. For pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced evening pain better than exercise; both were better than usual care. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that adding a rigid belt to exercise improved average pain but not function; acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture for improving evening pain and function, but not average pain; and evening pain relief was the same following either deep or superficial acupuncture. For lumbo-pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that an eight- to 20-week exercise program reduced the risk of women reporting lumbo-pelvic pain (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; four RCTs, N = 1344); but a 16-to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual care at preventing pelvic pain (one RCT, N = 257). Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced lumbo-pelvic-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, two RCTs, N = 1062), and improved function. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that OMT significantly reduced pain and improved function; either a multi-modal intervention that included manual therapy, exercise and education (MOM) or usual care significantly reduced disability, but only MOM improved pain and physical function; acupuncture improved pain and function more than usual care or physiotherapy; pain and function improved more when acupuncture was started at 26-rather than 20-weeks' gestation; and auricular (ear) acupuncture significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture. When reported, adverse events were minor and transient. Authors' conclusions: Moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16-to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP. There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out. Physiotherapy, OMT, acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone. Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was started at 26-rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were small. There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture. Very low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time LBP. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. Future research would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms. © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Many early life risk factors for childhood obesity are more prevalent among blacks and Hispanics than among whites and may explain the higher prevalence of obesity among racial/ethnic minority children. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in adiposity and overweight are explained by differences in risk factors during pregnancy (gestational diabetes and depression), infancy (rapid infant weight gain, feeding other than exclusive breastfeeding, and early introduction of solid foods), and early childhood (sleeping <12 h/d, presence of a television set in the room where the child sleeps, and any intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or fast food). DESIGN Prospective prebirth cohort study. SETTING Multisite group practice in Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS Participants included 1116 mother-child pairs (63%white, 17%black, and 4% Hispanic) EXPOSURE Mother's report of child's race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z score, total fat mass index from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and overweight or obesity, defined as a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher at age 7 years. RESULTS Black (0.48 U [95%CI, 0.31 to 0.64]) and Hispanic (0.43 [0.12 to 0.74]) children had higher BMI z scores, as well as higher total fat mass index and overweight/obesity prevalence, than white children. After adjustment for socioeconomic confounders and parental BMI, differences in BMI z score were attenuated for black and Hispanic children (0.22 U [0.05 to 0.40] and 0.22 U [-0.08 to 0.52], respectively). Adjustment for pregnancy risk factors did not substantially change these estimates. However, after further adjustment for infancy and childhood risk factors, we observed only minimal differences in BMI z scores between whites, blacks (0.07 U [-0.11 to 0.26]), and Hispanics (0.04 U [-0.27 to 0.35]).We observed similar attenuation of racial/ethnic differences in adiposity and prevalence of overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood adiposity and obesity are determined by factors operating in infancy and early childhood. Efforts to reduce obesity disparities should focus on preventing early life risk factors.

AB  - Objectives: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), in conjunction with other psychotropic medications, are increasingly used to treat psychiatric disorders in pregnancy. The few available studies investigating the reproductive safety of SGAs did not reach conclusive results, and none have compared monotherapy with polytherapy involving other psychotropic medications. Design: Descriptive cohort study using a prospectively collected database. Setting: Motherisk Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Participants: 133 women exposed to SGAs and other psychotropic drugs and 133 matched healthy controls were assessed and analysed. Outcomes of mother-child pairs exposed to SGAs in monotherapy (N=37) were compared with those exposed to SGAs with other psychotropic medications (in polytherapy; N=96). Main outcome measures: Maternal, pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcomes. Results: 72% of exposed women received SGAs in polytherapy, and 101 women took their medications throughout pregnancy. These women had significantly higher pre-pregnancy weight, experienced more associated comorbidities and instrumental deliveries, and delivered a greater proportion of large for gestational age neonates. There were no differences in maternal weight gain in pregnancy between the exposed and comparison groups and between the monotherapy-exposed and polytherapy-exposed subgroups. The exposed neonates were more likely to be born premature, were admitted more often to the neonatal intensive care unit, presented with poor neonatal adaptation signs and had higher rates of congenital malformations. All the aforementioned neonatal outcomes were found mainly in the polytherapy subgroup. Conclusions: The use of SGAs in polytherapy was prevalent in the assessed cohort and was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child. In utero exposure to SGA monotherapy appears to be associated with less risk to the fetus. Future research should focus on polytherapy in pregnancy in order to define its reproductive safety and to separate the effects of medication exposure, underlying psychopathology and associated comorbidities.

AB  - Objective:The objective of this study is to determine whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with reduced fetal growth, and whether nocturnal oxygen desaturation precipitates acute fetal heart rate changes.Study Design:We performed a prospective observational study, screening 371 women in the second trimester for OSA symptoms. 41 subsequently underwent overnight sleep studies to diagnose OSA. Third trimester fetal growth was assessed using ultrasound. Fetal heart rate monitoring accompanied the sleep study. Cord blood was taken at delivery, to measure key regulators of fetal growth.Results:Of 371 women screened, 108 (29%) were high risk for OSA. 26 high risk and 15 low risk women completed the longitudinal study; 14 had confirmed OSA (cases), and 27 were controls. The median (interquartile range) respiratory disturbance index (number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas or respiratory related arousals/hour of sleep) was 7.9 (6.1-13.8) for cases and 2.2 (1.3-3.5) for controls (p<0.001). Impaired fetal growth was observed in 43% (6/14) of cases, vs 11% (3/27) of controls (RR 2.67; 1.25-5.7; p = 0.04). Using logistic regression, only OSA (OR 6; 1.2-29.7, p = 0.03) and body mass index (OR 2.52; 1.09-5.80, p = 0.03) were significantly associated with impaired fetal growth. After adjusting for body mass index on multivariate analysis, the association between OSA and impaired fetal growth was not appreciably altered (OR 5.3; 0.93-30.34, p = 0.06), although just failed to achieve statistical significance. Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations accompanied nocturnal oxygen desaturation in one fetus, subsequently found to be severely growth restricted. Fetal growth regulators showed changes in the expected direction- with IGF-1 lower, and IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 higher- in the cord blood of infants of cases vs controls, although were not significantly different.Conclusion:OSA may be associated with reduced fetal growth in late pregnancy. Further evaluation is warranted to establish whether OSA may be an important contributor to adverse perinatal outcome, including stillbirth. © 2013 Fung et al.

AB  - Background: In the German-speaking world there are no evidencebased recommendations on the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of patients with opioid dependency. Aim: Development of a practically oriented guideline for doctors, who use buprenorphine/naloxone with patients with opioid dependency. Method: Analysis of the current data situation on the buprenorphine/naloxone treatment of patients with opioid dependency, taking into particular consideration the aspects "treatment aims", "adjustment/change to buprenorphine/naloxone", "quality of life with substitution treatment", "opioid dependence in women", "drug interactions", "overdose and consumption of other narcotic drugs" as well as "psychiatric comorbidity". Results: Buprenorphine has proved itself in the treatment of opioid dependency,the combination with naloxone reduces abuse and black market dealing.Cognitive functions, sexual functions, sleep quality,fitness to drive and quality of life are as a rule less impaired with buprenorphine/naloxone than with methadone. Interactions between buprenorphine/naloxone and other potential addictive drugs such as benzodiazepines or alcohol are less commonly observed. Also, the risk of drug interactions with antimicrobial substances and anti-depressants is lower for the majority of the examined substance classes. Relevant interactions concern drugs, which are also metabolised by CYP3A4. Basically substitution treatment with long-acting substances such as buprenorphine as mono preparation in accordance with WHO recommendations is the treatment of choice with pregnant women. However, according to Suboxone® specialist information (as at September 2011) the use of the combination buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy is not recommended. Because of its pharmacological properties ("ceiling effect" with partial |j receptor agonism), the danger of an overdose with life-threatening respiratory depression is lower with treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone than with full j opioid receptor agonists. With regard to the optimum treatment of comorbid psychiatric illnesses in opioid dependent patients undergoing substitution there is still a considerable need for clinical research, some data offers indications of benefits of buprenorphine, specifically with depressive opioid dependent patients. Conclusion: The aim of substitution treatment with patients with opioid dependency is the improvement of physical and mental health. Buprenorphine/naloxone substitution treatment represents a highly effective treatment option - with positive effects on quality of life and favourable safety profile. © ecomed Medizin, Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH, Landsberg.

AB  - Introduction: Type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is a lymphotropic and neurotropic retrovirus. Thus, it causes immunological and neurological alterations particularly in children. In the neonatal period the maturational changes of the central nervous system occur rapidly, and their alteration can be reflected in processes such as the sleep-awake pattern. Objective: To evaluate sleep organization, EEG and respiratory pattern in newborns to HIV-1 positive mothers. Methods: 22 infants underwent polysomnography. Delta brushes number in REM and NREM sleep, duration of interburst interval and interhemispheric synchrony were used to calculate EEG maturation. Analysis of the sleep architecture was based on polysomnographic sleep percentage of REM, NREM and transitional sleep to total sleep time. Results: The difference between electroencephalographically calculated and clinically calculated conceptional age was less than two weeks. Percentages of REM and NREM sleep ranged from 39-64 and 30-58 with a median of 52.5 and 36.5 respectively. Concordance was lower in newborns who had high transitional sleep percentages, compared to that in newborns who did not have high such characteristic (p<0.05). Discussion: Despite intrauterine exposure to HIV-1 and to antiretroviral drugs we did not observe a significant effect on EEG maturation. The decreased concordance in newborns with high transitional sleep percentages would suggest an alteration in the maturation process, but this aspect itself is not sufficient to consider that intrauterine exposure to HIV-1 and antiretrovirals affect the entire sleep architecture. Future studies should clarify whether the decreased concordance between behavior and NREM sleep is replicable.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate if there is a relation between quality of life and quality of sleep in pregnant women. Method. This was a cross-sectional study which participants were selected at Ipiranga Hospital and applied an evaluation form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), questionnaire of quality of life (SF-36), and was given a booklet of guidelines of sleep hygiene. Inclusion criteria was pregnancy; exclusion criteria was hearing loss, sleep disturbance, prior night occupation, neurological damage and that was not doing prenatal care. Results. 51 volunteers participated in the work, of which 32 were in the third trimester and 10 in the second trimester, the average age was 25,3 (±6,3) years, and 70% of the entire sample had poor sleep quality. It was also observed that multiparous pregnant women had worsening in sleep and quality of life. Conclusion. There was no correlation between quality of sleep and quality of life in pregnant women. But it was worst in the second trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - Oviparous species are model organisms for investigating embryonic development of endogenous physiological circadian rhythms without the influence of maternal biorhythms. Recent studies have demonstrated that heart rates and metabolic rates of embryonic turtles are not constant or always maximal and can be altered in response to the presence of embryos at a more advanced stage of development within the nest. A first step in understanding the physiological mechanisms underpinning these responses in embryonic ectothermic organisms is to develop metabolic profiles (e.g., heart rate) at different temperatures throughout incubation. Heart beat and rhythmic patterns or changes in development may represent important signals or cues within a nest and may be vital to coordinate synchronous hatching well in advance of the final stages of incubation. We developed baseline embryonic heart-rate profiles of embryos of the short-necked Murray River turtle (Emydura macquarii) to determine the stage of embryogenesis that metabolic circadian rhythms become established, if at all. Eggs were incubated at constant temperatures (26°C and 30°C) and heart rates were monitored at 6-h intervals over 24 h every 7-11 days until hatching. Circadian heart rate rhythms were detected at the mid-gestation period and were maintained until hatching. Heart rates throughout the day varied by up to 20% over 24 h and were not related to time of day. This study demonstrated that endogenous metabolic circadian rhythms in developing embryos in turtle eggs establish earlier in embryogenesis than those documented in other vertebrate taxa during embryogenesis. Early establishment of circadian rhythms in heart rates may be critical for communication among embryos and synchrony in hatching and emergence from the nest. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - There is evidence for the reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillation and reproduction, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with impaired menstrual functions and reduced fertility in women. However, only little information is available on the relationship between reproduction and chronotype. The aim of the present study is to better assess this relationship. The participants (aged 25 to 74 yrs) were selected randomly from the Finnish Population Information System. The data from 2672 female participants of the National FINRISK Survey 2007 were analyzed to test the associations between chronotype (morning, intermediate, or evening) and reproductive features. Of the participants, 139 (5.6%) were evening, 1217 (48.7%) intermediate, and 1145 (45.8%) morning chronotypes. Among the participants aged 25 to 54 yrs, the duration of menstrual cycle was longer among evening chronotypes (28.8 ± 4.4 d) than among morning (27.7 ± 2.6 d; p < 0.01) and intermediate (27.8 ± 3.3 d; p = 0.05) chronotypes. Significant correlations were found between the higher morningness-eveningness scores (the more of morning chronotype) and the shorter durations of menstrual bleeding, both in the whole sample (p < 0.001) and after limiting the analyses to women younger than 55 yrs (p < 0.05). In multivariable analyses on the whole sample, as compared with morning chronotypes, intermediate chronotypes had a significantly longer duration of menstrual bleeding (B = 0.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.044 to 0.276; p < 0.01) as well as a higher odds for difficulties in getting pregnant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.464, 95% CI = 1.118 to 1.917; p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that chronotype is related to the reproductive function in women. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Nutritional factors play a life-long role in human health. Indeed, there is growing evidence that one of the mechanisms by which nutrients and bioactive compounds affect metabolic traits is epigenetics. Complex interactions among food components and histone modifications, DNA methylation, non-coding RNA expression and chromatin remodeling factors lead to a dynamic regulation of gene expression that controls the cellular phenotype. Although perinatal period is the time of highest phenotypic plasticity, contributing largely to developmental programming, also during adulthood there is evidence about a nutritional influence on epigenetic regulation. Similarly to type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and other metabolic disorders, obesity predisposition and weight loss outcomes have been repeatedly associated to changes in epigenetic patterns. Different non-nutritional risk factors that usually accompany obesity seem also to be involved in these epigenetic modifications, especially hyperglycemia, inflammation, hypoxia and oxidative stress. There are currently three major objectives in epigenetic research in relation to obesity: to search for epigenetic biomarkers to predict future health problems or detect the individuals at most risk, to understand the obesity-related environmental factors that could modulate gene expression by affecting epigenetic mechanisms, and to study novel therapeutic strategies based on nutritional or pharmacological agents that can modify epigenetic marks. At this level, the major tasks are: development of robust epigenetic biomarkers of weight regulation, description of those epigenetic marks more susceptible to be modified by dietary exposures, identification of the active ingredients (and the doses) that alter the epigenome, assessment of the real importance of other obesity-related factors on epigenetic regulation, determination of the period of life in which best results are obtained, and understanding the importance of the inheritance of these epigenetic marks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study compared self-reported sleep latency (SL) and total sleep time (TST) to objective measures on polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Thirty-three women in the third trimester (T3) of pregnancy, 16 women in the first trimester (T1) of pregnancy, and 15 non-pregnant women underwent overnight PSG, and shortly after awakening reported their perceived SL and TST. Results showed that, on average, the T3 group slightly overestimated their TSTs, whereas the T1 and non-pregnant groups underestimated TSTs when compared with objective measurement. All groups overestimated SL, and perceived SL was closest to the first epoch of 10 min of uninterrupted sleep or the first epoch of slow-wave sleep, rather than the first epoch of sleep (the current definition used for diagnostic sleep studies). The wide variation in discrepancies between estimation and PSG measurement for both TST and SL shows that self-reports made by both pregnant and non-pregnant women tend to be unreliable, which has important implications both clinically and for the many studies based on self-reported sleep patterns in pregnancy. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing-related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies. © 2013 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - Data on the use of a combination of antidepressants during pregnancy are inadequate. This report presents the beneficial effect of low-dose mirtazapine added onto selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of the symptoms of severe nausea, insomnia and loss of appetite accompanying psychiatric disorders during pregnancy, which is an important problem in clinical practice. The psychiatric diagnoses were determined with the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Assessments were performed with the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale and the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Further studies should be carried out to confirm the positive effects and safety of an additional low-dose mirtazapine in these cases. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Leptin, a hormone that regulates appetite and energy expenditure, is increased in obese individuals, although these individuals often exhibit leptin resistance. Obesity is characterized by sleep/wake disturbances, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, increased REM sleep, increased nighttime arousals, and decreased percentage of total sleep time. Several studies have shown that short sleep duration is highly correlated with decreased leptin levels in both animal and human models. Arousal and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are regulated by the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). The goal of this project was to determine the role of leptin in the PPN, and thus in obesity-related sleep disorders. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted on PPN neurons in 9- to 17-day-old rat brainstem slices. Leptin decreased action potential (AP) amplitude, AP frequency, and h-current (I H). These findings suggest that leptin causes a blockade of Na+ channels. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of leptin on Na+ conductance. To determine the average voltage dependence of this conductance, results from each cell were equally weighted by expressing conductance as a fraction of the maximum conductance in each cell. I Na amplitude was decreased in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a direct effect of leptin on these channels. The average decrease in Na+ conductance by leptin was ~40 %. We hypothesize that leptin normally decreases activity in the PPN by reducing I H and I Na currents, and that in states of leptin dysregulation (i.e., leptin resistance) this effect may be blunted, therefore causing increased arousal and REM sleep drive, and ultimately leading to sleep-related disorders. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Aims: This paper aimed to review how scientific knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time. Methods: In this paper, the empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed. Results: When MDMA was a 'novel psychoactive substance', it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost-benefit ratios, and voluntary cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol levels increased by 800% in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric, although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Conclusions: The damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA are far more widespread than was realized a few years ago, with new neuropsychobiological deficits still emerging. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy and a fairly lifelong disorder that may significantly lower a patient's expectations and potential for a full life. Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and up to 85% of patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among anticonvulsants, valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may be poorly tolerated by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant women. Alternatives have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but also topiramate, zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy may be useful or even required. One should not forget the potential aggravation induced not only by some commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, but also, in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special settings, older drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But the management of JME should also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict avoidance of sleep deprivation and the management of copathologies, including the cognitive and psychiatric problems that are often encountered. With adequate management, there will only remain a small proportion of patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its related problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician has a fair chance of significantly helping the patient with medication and counseling. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder that is often seen in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the association between RLS and multiple sclerosis (MS) is still unclear and RLS is not considered as one of the MS symptoms. This study was conducted to assess the frequency of RLS and its associated factors in patients with MS. This was a cross-sectional study conducted during January and April 2010. A total of 205 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (164 females, 41 males, mean age 32.8 ± 8.9 years) were enrolled in the study and underwent a medical history interview and a neurological examination. The diagnosis of RLS was based on International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Criteria. 57 patients (27.8 %) met the RLS diagnostic criteria. In 90.1 % of the patients, the onset of RLS was simultaneous with or followed by MS onset. There was no significant difference between patients with and without RLS in respect of age, gender, disease duration, and MS pattern. There was an increased incidence of leg jerks before sleep in patients with RLS (P = 0.04). In patients suffering from RLS, there is greater complaint of insomnia (P = 0.03). Body mass index, history of anemia, excessive day-time somnolence, consuming caffeine-containing beverages, pregnancy numbers, smoking, and alcohol consumption were not associated with the presence of RLS. This study revealed high prevalence of RLS in MS patients. Screening of RLS in these patients should always be considered to improve management of MS. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background Quality of life assessments are increasingly recognised in healthcare. The aim of this study was to evaluate psychometric characteristics of Nottingham Health Profile in the postpartum period. Methods A random sample of 133 English speaking women completed the scale in hospital between 24 and 48 h of delivery and again at 7 days postpartum. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate psychometric parameters of the questionnaire. Results The questionnaire indicated that in the acute setting, physical ability, energy level and pain were most affected. At follow-up, women described greatest difficulties with energy level and pain domains. The scores for physical ability, pain, sleep and energy level improved compared to baseline (P < 0.05). Women who had caesarean delivery had lower scores for physical ability, pain and energy level domains at 1-2 week follow-up compared to the vaginal delivery group (P < 0.05). Conclusions The scale was found to be suitable for evaluation of quality of life in a population of postpartum women. However a more culturally and geographically diverse population is needed to test reliability and validity of the instrument. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the timing of hospital discharge, time to outpatient follow-up, and home care practices (breastfeeding initiation and continuation, tobacco smoke exposure, supine sleep position) for late-preterm (LPT; 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) and earlyterm (ET; 37 0/7-38/6/7 weeks) infants with term infants. METHODS: We analyzed 2000-2008 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. x2 Analyses were used to measure differences in maternal and infant characteristics, hospital discharge, outpatient care, and home care among LPT, ET, and term infants. We calculated adjusted risk ratios for the risk of adverse care outcomes among LPT and ET infants compared with term infants. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, LPT infants were less likely to be discharged early compared with term infants, whereas there was no difference for ET infants (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.65 [0.54-0.79]; 0.95 [0.88-1.02]). LPT and ET infants were more likely to have timely outpatient follow-up (1.07 [1.06-1.08]; 1.02 [1.02- 1.03]), more likely to experience maternal tobacco smoke exposure (1.09 [1.05-1.14]; 1.08 [1.06-1.11]), less likely to be initially breastfed (0.95 [0.94-0.97]; 0.98 [0.97-0.98]), less likely to be breastfed for $10 weeks (0.88 [0.86-0.90]; 0.94 [0.93-0.96]), and less likely to be placed in a supine sleep position (0.95 [0.93-0.97]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Given that LPT and ET infants bear an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, greater efforts are needed to ensure safe and healthy posthospitalization and home care practices for these vulnerable infants.

AB  - Lateral meningocele syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology, first described in 1977 and subsequently reported in nine other patients. These patients present distinctive craniofacial features and skeletal abnormalities in addition to multiple lateral meningoceles, suggesting a connective tissue disorder. Autosomal dominant inheritance is clearly suggested in one family and could explain familiar aggregation in another. We describe a simplex case of lateral meningocele syndrome with bicuspid aortic valve, supporting the hypothesis of a connective tissue basis for this disorder and further expanding the phenotype. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in Spain. Its high prevalence, its high survival rate, and its incidence are the reasons treatment is increasingly sought for common problems by young women who have survived it. Besides the contraception and fertility issues, many breast cancer survivors develop sexual disorders and menopausal symptoms, whether as a consequence of treatment-induced menopause or side effects of treatment. For such reasons, a panel of experts from the Spanish Menopause Society has met to develop usage recommendations for the relief of vasomotor symptoms and for sexual and reproductive health in patients with breast cancer based on the best evidence available. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common childbirth complication, which can have negative effects on both the newly delivered woman and her family. This condition is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated, while a biological diagnostic test is not yet available. Furthermore, postpartum thyroid dysfunction is common among new mothers, and some evidence point to an association between PPD and thyroid function disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between serum levels of thyroid hormones at the time of delivery, and the later development of depressive symptoms, using data from a population based cohort of Swedish women. Blood samples were collected during delivery from 347 participating women, delivering at Uppsala University Hospital. The participating women filled in at least one of three structured questionnaires, containing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), at five days, six weeks and six months postpartum. A cut-off of 12 or more was applied on the EPDS, to identify cases of self-reported PPD and controls. Using a binary logistic regression model (adjusting for previous psychiatric contact, smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and sleep), having a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level over the clinical cut-off level of 4.0. mU/L was associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms at six months postpartum (OR 11.30, 95% CI 1.93-66.11). A ROC analysis revealed that the predictive variable (PV) had significant predictive ability for PPD at 6 months postpartum, given that the AUC was 0.764, and at a PV cut-off value of 6.33, the sensitivity and specificity were 76.2% and 69.4%, respectively. If these findings are replicated in future studies, they can have important clinical implications, since TSH determination is an inexpensive routine blood test, and its inclusion in a biological screening test for PPD involving other parameters would be tempting. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Children develop in the domains of cognition, speech and language, motor, personal skills, social skills and activities of daily living in a predictable and organised manner. Between 3000 and 9000 Australian children born in any one year may be diagnosed with global developmental delay. Paediatricians are often faced with the dilemma of 'who' and 'how' to investigate, as the yield is often considered to be low. 'Best practice' guidelines on the investigation of global developmental delay have been published, but the evidence available for the specific recommendations varies significantly and is based mostly on levels III and IV evidence (non-experimental descriptive studies and expert opinions). This paper discusses the current views and suggests a possible algorithm for clinical practice in Australia. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - A Task Force was established by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations for the long-term pharmacologic treatment of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED). The Task Force reviewed the results of all studies of RLS/WED treatments with durations of 6. months or longer presented at meetings over the past 2. years, posted on Web sites of pharmaceutical companies, or published in peer-reviewed journals, asking the questions, "What is the efficacy of this treatment in patients with RLS/WED?" and "What is the safety of this treatment in patients with RLS/WED?". The Task Force developed guidelines based on their review of 61 papers meeting inclusion criteria, and using a modified evidence-grading scheme. Pregabalin has been established as effective for up to 1. year in treating RLS/WED (Level A evidence). Pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine have been established as effective for up to 6. months in treating RLS/WED (Level A). The following drugs have been established as probably effective (Level B) in treating RLS/WED for durations ranging from 1 to 5. years: gabapentin enacarbil, pramipexole, and ropinirole (1. year); levodopa (2. years); and rotigotine (5. years). Because of associated safety concerns, pergolide and cabergoline should not be used in the treatment of RLS/WED unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Other pharmacologic therapies have insufficient evidence to support their long-term use in treating RLS/WED.The IRLSSG Task Force also developed consensus-based strategies for the prevention and treatment of complications (such as augmentation, loss of efficacy, excessive daytime sleepiness, and impulse control disorders) that may develop with the long-term pharmacologic treatment of RLS/WED. The use of either a dopamine-receptor agonist or α2δ calcium-channel ligand is recommended as the first-line treatment of RLS/WED for most patients, with the choice of agent dependent on the patient's severity of RLS/WED symptoms, cognitive status, history, and comorbid conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Medical advancements in neonatology have significantly increased the number of high-risk preterm survivors. However, recent long-term follow-up studies have suggested that preterm infants are at risk for behavioral, educational, and emotional problems. Although clear relationships have been demonstrated between preterm infants and developmental problems during childhood and adolescence, less is known about the early indications of these problems. Recently, numerous studies on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) have demonstrated temporal correlations of activity between spatially remote cortical regions not only in healthy adults but also in neuropathological disorders and early childhood development. In order to compare RSFC of the cerebral cortex between preterm infants at term-equivalent ages and full-term neonates without any anatomical abnormality risk during natural sleep, we used an optical topography system, which is a recently developed extension of near-infrared spectroscopy. We clarified the presence of RSFC in both preterm infants and full-term neonates and showed differences between these groups. The principal differences were that on comparison of RSFC between the bilateral temporal regions, and bilateral parietal regions, RSFC was enhanced in preterm infants compared with full-term neonates; whereas on comparison of RSFC between the left temporal and left parietal regions, RSFC was enhanced in full-term neonates compared with preterm infants. We also demonstrated a difference between the groups in developmental changes of RSFC related to postmenstrual age. Most importantly, these findings suggested that preterm infants and full-term neonates follow different developmental trajectories during the perinatal period because of differences in perinatal experiences and physiological and structural development. © 2013 Fuchino et al.

AB  - During the last four decades, there have been considerable advances in the efficacy and precision of serum thyroid function testing. The development of the third generation assays for the measurement of serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) and the log-linear relationship with free thyroxine (T4) established TSH as the hallmark of thyroid function testing. While it is widely accepted that TSH outside of the normal range is consistent with thyroid dysfunction, a vast multitude of additional factors must be considered before an accurate clinical diagnosis can be made. This is especially important during pregnancy, when the thyroid is under considerable additional pregnancy-related demands requiring significant maternal physiological changes. This paper examines serum TSH measurement in pregnancy and some associated potential confounding factors. © 2013 Offie P. Soldin et al.

AB  - Objective: To describe the trends in hospital admissions associated with obesity as a primary diagnosis and comorbidity, and bariatric surgery procedures among children and young people in England. Design: National time trends study of hospital admissions data between 2000 and 2009. Participants: Children and young people aged 5 to 19 years who were admitted to hospital with any diagnosis of obesity. Main outcome measures: Age- and sex-specific admission rates per million children. Results: Between 2000 and 2009, age- and sex-specific hospital admission rates in 5-19 year olds for total obesity-related diagnoses increased more than four-fold from 93.0 (95% CI 86.0 to 100.0) per million children to 414.0 (95% CI 410.7 to 417.5) per million children, largely due to rising admissions where obesity was mentioned as a co-morbidity. The median age of admission to hospital over the study period was 14.0 years; 5,566 (26.7%) admissions were for obesity and 15,319 (73.3%) mentioned obesity as a comorbidity. Admissions were more common in girls than boys (56.2% v 43.8%). The most common reasons for admission where obesity was a comorbid condition were sleep apnoea, asthma, and complications of pregnancy. The number of bariatric surgery procedures has risen from 1 per year in 2000 to 31 in 2009, with the majority were performed in obese girls (75.6%) aged 13-19 years. Conclusions: Hospital admission rates for obesity and related comorbid conditions have increased more than four-fold over the past decade amongst children and young people. Although some of the increase is likely to be due to improved case ascertainment, conditions associated with obesity in children and young people are imposing greater challenges for health care providers in English hospitals. Most inpatient care is directed at dealing with associated conditions rather than primary assessment and management of obesity itself. © 2013 Jones Nielsen et al.

AB  - Night shift work has been thought to play a role in the etiology of chronic diseases through a disruption of the circadian rhythm, decreased synthesis of melatonin and sleep deprivation. Our aim was to review the epidemiological studies on the association between night shift work and some pathologies in nurses and midwives. We reviewed publications available in the MEDLINE database and published before June 2012, describing the cross-sectional (almost two thirds of all papers) and cohort studies. In total, we identified 26 original papers, including 5 epidemiological studies addressing diseases or disorders of the digestive system, 3 - metabolic syndrome, 2 - type 2 diabetes, 9 - cardiovascular diseases and CVD risk factors, 5 - obesity/overweight, 2 - menstrual disorders and 3 - poor pregnancy outcomes. The analysis of the literature indicates that night shift work of nurses and midwives is most strongly associated with a higher risk of obesity/overweight. In each of the five studies, which we identified this association was observed (confirmed by the statistical significance of the results), also after adjustment for confounders. The results for type 2 diabetes and disorders of the menstrual cycle are also suggestive. Epidemiological data on the other disorders or pathologies discussed in this article seem to be less certain - their results are inconsistent or their number is too small to draw definite conclusions. Further epidemiological studies of nurses and midwives working on night shifts and prospective observations in particular are recommended to find out whether potential association between the night work and discussed health issues is causal. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

AB  - Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - This study investigated episodic and procedural memory retention in early and late pregnancy and whether memory retention was related to sleep disruption. Twenty-six women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 20 women in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 24 non-pregnant controls were administered a battery of verbal and visual episodic memory tasks and two procedural memory tasks before undergoing an overnight sleep study. Memory retention was assessed the following morning. Results indicated that as compared with controls, both pregnant groups had reduced retention in verbal episodic memory but were unimpaired on visual and procedural memory tasks. The pregnant women also demonstrated significant disruption of sleep patterns. Reduced verbal memory retention during pregnancy was not attributable to any measure of sleep; however, small correlations between some indices of sleep and memory do not allow full dismissal of the sleep-dependent memory consolidation hypothesis. © 2012 The Australian Psychological Society.

AB  - Background: Regular mouthing movements (RMMs) are observed during fetal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) periods. Aim: To determine the correlation between RMM and fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns during NREM periods. Study design: Fetal eye and mouth movements and FHR patterns were observed and recorded. Subjects: 50 normal singleton pregnancies between 32 and 40. weeks of gestation. Outcome measures: Changes in the power spectrum ratio of 3-minute blocks of RMM clusters, FHR with RMM clusters (HR. +), and FHR without RMM clusters (HR. -) were calculated at a frequency band of 0.02. Hz among 3 gestational age groups: group 1, 32-34. weeks gestation; group 2, 35-37. weeks gestation; group 3, 38-40. weeks gestation. We calculated the percentage of cases showing dominant peak ratios of RMM and HR. + in the same frequency band, the maximum correlation coefficient, and its lag time. Results: In group 3, the dominant peaks of both RM and HR. + were present at the same frequency band, 0.06-0.08. Hz; this was not seen in the other groups' relative power spectral patterns. The percentage of cases showing dominant peaks of RMM and HR. + in the same frequency band increased with advancing gestational age. The maximum correlation coefficient in groups 1 (0.28. ±. 0.11) and 3 (0.45. ±. 0.14) differed significantly (p<. 0.05). Conclusions: The correlation between RMM and FHR patterns became stronger, and their rhythmicity was similar, from 38 to 40 gestational weeks, suggesting that a common center starts to govern both patterns at approximately 38. weeks gestation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over 25,000 epileptic women deliver viable pregnancies each year in the United States. Although medical management is the first line of treatment, many physiological changes associated with pregnancy can make optimal treatment challenging. Medication dosage is adjusted based on side effects and seizure frequency, with the goal being no seizures with the lowest medication dosage(s) and side-effect profile possible. Whenever possible, monotherapy is preferred. Many antiepileptic drugs have teratogenic potential, so preconceptional optimization of medication dosage(s) is recommended. Epilepsy has associated neurological comorbidities, the most common being migraines and sleep disorders. © 2013, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Background: Chronic noise is an environmental pollutant and well-known to cause annoyance and sleep disturbance. Its association with clinical and subclinical adverse health effects has been discussed. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to examine associations between chronic noise exposure during pregnancy or childhood and health outcomes in early and late childhood. Methods: Following a systematic electronic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE), an additional hand search and a critical evaluation of potential articles by 2 independent reviewers, 29 studies were included: 12 on pregnancy/birth outcomes with samples ranging from 115 to 22,761 and 17 on cardiovascular and immune-mediated health outcomes in childhood with samples ranging from 43 to 1542. Evidence levels (3 to 2++) were rated according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Results: Chronic noise exposure during pregnancy was not associated with birth weight, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, perinatal and neonatal death based on 6 cohort, 4 case-control, and 2 cross-sectional studies (highest evidence level 2+). There was some evidence supporting an association of chronic noise exposure with increased systolic blood pressure and stress hormone levels in urine and saliva in children evaluating 2 cohort and 15 cross-sectional studies (highest evidence level 2-). Conclusions: There seemed to be no associations between chronic noise and pregnancy outcomes based on studies with evidence levels up to 2+. Associations between chronic noise and health in children were based mainly on cross-sectional studies. However, the studies included in this comprehensive systematic review showed a high variation in study design, outcome, exposure and confounder assessments. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and highly burdensome sleep disorder. While relaxation therapies, including yoga, are often recommended for RLS management, rigorous supporting research is sparse. The goal of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of yoga on RLS symptoms and related outcomes in women with RLS. Methods: Participants were 13 nonsmoking women with moderate to severe RLS, who did not have diabetes, sleep apnea, or other serious concomitant chronic conditions, and who were not pregnant. The intervention was a gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire regarding their experience with the study. Results: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66 years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4±0.5 (of 16 possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1±0.3 (of 5 possible) homework sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice per session (r=0.70, p=0.025) and total homework minutes (r=0.64, p<0.05), suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's≤0.02), with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in women with RLS. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p=0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) are defined behaviorally, but they also involve multileveled disturbances of underlying biology that find striking parallels in the physiological impacts of electromagnetic frequency and radiofrequency radiation exposures (EMF/RFR). Part I (Vol 776) of this paper reviewed the critical contributions pathophysiology may make to the etiology, pathogenesis and ongoing generation of behaviors currently defined as being core features of ASCs. We reviewed pathophysiological damage to core cellular processes that are associated both with ASCs and with biological effects of EMF/RFR exposures that contribute to chronically disrupted homeostasis. Many studies of people with ASCs have identified oxidative stress and evidence of free radical damage, cellular stress proteins, and deficiencies of antioxidants such as glutathione. Elevated intracellular calcium in ASCs may be due to genetics or may be downstream of inflammation or environmental exposures. Cell membrane lipids may be peroxidized, mitochondria may be dysfunctional, and various kinds of immune system disturbances are common. Brain oxidative stress and inflammation as well as measures consistent with blood-brain barrier and brain perfusion compromise have been documented. Part II of this paper documents how behaviors in ASCs may emerge from alterations of electrophysiological oscillatory synchronization, how EMF/RFR could contribute to these by de-tuning the organism, and policy implications of these vulnerabilities. It details evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, immune system dysregulation, neuroinflammation and brain blood flow alterations, altered electrophysiology, disruption of electromagnetic signaling, synchrony, and sensory processing, de-tuning of the brain and organism, with autistic behaviors as emergent properties emanating from this pathophysiology. Changes in brain and autonomic nervous system electrophysiological function and sensory processing predominate, seizures are common, and sleep disruption is close to universal. All of these phenomena also occur with EMF/RFR exposure that can add to system overload ('allostatic load') in ASCs by increasing risk, and can worsen challenging biological problems and symptoms; conversely, reducing exposure might ameliorate symptoms of ASCs by reducing obstruction of physiological repair. Various vital but vulnerable mechanisms such as calcium channels may be disrupted by environmental agents, various genes associated with autism or the interaction of both. With dramatic increases in reported ASCs that are coincident in time with the deployment of wireless technologies, we need aggressive investigation of potential ASC-EMF/RFR links. The evidence is sufficient to warrant new public exposure standards benchmarked to low-intensity (non-thermal) exposure levels now known to be biologically disruptive, and strong, interim precautionary practices are advocated. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Nutritional state in the gestation period influences fetal growth and development. We hypothesized that undernutrition during gestation would affect offspring sleep architecture and/or homeostasis. Pregnant female mice were assigned to either control (fed ad libitum; AD) or 50% dietary restriction (DR) groups from gestation day 12 to parturition. After parturition, dams were fed AD chow. After weaning, the pups were also fed AD into adulthood. At adulthood (aged 8-9 weeks), we carried out sleep recordings. Although offspring mice displayed a significantly reduced body weight at birth, their weights recovered three days after birth. Enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was observed in the DR mice over a 24-hour period without changing the diurnal pattern or amounts of wake, NREM, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, DR mice also displayed an enhancement of EEG-SWA rebound after a 6-hour sleep deprivation and a higher threshold for waking in the face of external stimuli. DR adult offspring mice exhibited small but significant increases in the expression of hypothalamic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Pparα) and brain-specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1c) mRNA, two genes involved in lipid metabolism. Undernutrition during pregnancy may influence sleep homeostasis, with offspring exhibiting greater sleep pressure. © 2013 Shimizu et al.

AB  - Objective: Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension (GH) have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and treatment for even marginal SDB may improve blood pressure control in women with GH. We assessed whether the application SDB treatment could improve blood pressure in women with GH. Methods: This was a single-center randomized study. Subjects underwent an unattended home-based diagnostic sleep study. The study was then repeated with subjects wearing one of two randomly assigned treatments: auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (auto-CPAP) or mandibular advancement device (MAD) + nasal strip. First morning blood pressure and blood for standard GH measures plus inflammatory markers were taken after each study. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and tolerance of assigned therapy. Results: Twenty-four women completed the protocol - 13 in the MAD group and 11 in auto-CPAP. The overall rate of SDB was 38%. Auto-CPAP was more effective at treating SDB than MAD + nasal strip, although the women randomized to MAD + nasal strip reported the greater comfort with therapy. First morning blood pressure was not consistently improved with either therapy. When subjects were stratified according to those whose blood pressure increased or decreased with therapy, an association was suggested between blood pressure improvement and reduced levels of tumour necrosis factor-α. Conclusion: We demonstrated that 38% of women with GH had concurrent SDB. We did not find an improvement in blood pressure or inflammatory markers with a single night of either the auto-CPAP or MAD + nasal strip interventions. However important lessons from this study may guide future investigations in this area.

AB  - Background: Malaria remains a substantial public health problem in Togo. An integrated child health campaign was conducted in Togo in October 2011. This campaign included a component of free distribution of 2,799,800 long-lasting, insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to households throughout Togo. This distribution marked the first effort in Togo at universal LLIN coverage and was not targeted specifically to children under five years and pregnant women, but to all household members. This study reports the results of the LLIN distribution campaign in terms of bed net possession and utilization. Methods. A representative household survey was implemented during the rainy season nine months after the LLIN distribution component of the campaign. Some 6,015 households selected through two stages of probability proportion to size stratified random sampling were interviewed using a brief questionnaire that included a demographic section with questions on the number of household members and sleeping spaces, and a campaign participation section with questions used to evaluate non-LLIN aspects of the campaign. A net roster listed all nets and their characteristics, and a household roster listed all members and visitors with information about bed net use. The questions addressed different aspects of bed net and LLIN possession and utilization. Crude weighted frequencies, percentages, and t- tests of association were calculated using the Stata 12.0 Survey features. Results: Possession of at least one bed net and/or LLIN increased from 41.3% to 96.7% (P <0.001). Household possession of at least one campaign LLIN was 93.3%. Report LLIN among pregnant women was 77.5% and 79.3% for children under five. For the general population LLIN use was 68.3%. Conclusions: Due to the gap in LLIN possession and use and the significant number of individuals reporting a lack of nets as a reason for non-use, additional national LLIN distribution campaigns with a stronger educational component need to be implemented in order increase the use of available LLINs and to reach and maintain universal coverage of LLINs in Togo. The LLIN distribution campaign focusing on universal coverage of the general population in Togo was more successful at increasing LLIN possession and use of children under five years and pregnant women than other campaigns focusing only on these target groups. © 2013 Stevens et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The central theme of personalized medicine is the premise that an individual's unique physiologic characteristics play a significant role in both disease vulnerability and in response to specific therapies. The major goals of personalized medicine are therefore to predict an individual's susceptibility to developing an illness, achieve accurate diagnosis, and optimize the most efficient and favorable response to treatment. The goal of achieving personalized medicine in psychiatry is a laudable one, because its attainment should be associated with a marked reduction in morbidity and mortality. In this review, we summarize an illustrative selection of studies that are laying the foundation towards personalizing medicine in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. In addition, we present emerging applications that are likely to advance personalized medicine in psychiatry, with an emphasis on novel biomarkers and neuroimaging. © 2013 Ozomaro et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Depression is frequently observed in patients with untreated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the general population. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable since pregnancy increases the risk of both SDB and depressive symptoms. However, no study has investigated whether SDB symptoms prior to or in early pregnancy are associated with such mood problems.Methods: A retrospective chart review of pregnant women. Women were included if they attended prenatal clinics between June 2007 and July 2010, were ≥18 years old, pregnant with a single fetus, and had been screened for habitual snoring as well as depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS).Results: In total, 362 women were included and 32.3% reported habitual snoring. Twenty-nine percent of women had an EPDS score ≥10. Significantly more snoring women, compared to non-snorers, had an EPDS score ≥10 (42.7% vs. 22.9%, p < 0.001) despite the mean EPDS values not reaching statistical significance (6.1 ± 4.9 vs. 5.4 ± 5.0, p = 0.2). In a logistic regression model controlling for parity, the presence of pre-pregnancy obesity, presence of a partner, sleep quality, African American race, maternal educational level, pre-eclampsia, and diabetes, snoring was independently associated with a prenatal EPDS score ≥10 (O.R. 2.0, 95%CI 1.13-3.46; p = 0.023).Conclusion: Maternal snoring may be a risk factor for prenatal depressive symptoms. Further investigation of the temporal relationship between maternal snoring and depressive symptoms is warranted. © 2013 O'Brien et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that immune alterations, especially those related to inflammation, are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related brain alterations. Much of this work has focused on the prenatal period, because infections during pregnancy have been repeatedly (albeit inconsistently) linked to risk of schizophrenia. Given that most infections do not cross the placenta, cytokines associated with inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) have been targeted as potential mediators of the damaging effects of infection on the fetal brain in prenatal studies. Moreover, additional evidence from both human and animal studies suggests links between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, immune-related genes, and schizophrenia as well as brain alterations associated with the disorder. Additional support for the role of altered immune factors in the etiology of schizophrenia comes from neuroimaging studies, which have linked proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms with some of the structural and functional abnormalities repeatedly found in schizophrenia. These findings are reviewed and discussed with a life course perspective, examining the contribution of inflammation from the fetal period to disorder presentation. Unexplored areas and future directions, such as the interplay between inflammation, genes, and individual-level environmental factors (e.g., stress, sleep, and nutrition), are also discussed. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Pertussis immunity, whether acquired by natural infection or vaccination, is not permanent and wanes after 5-10 years. This may result in reinfection, or the development of pertussis in a previously vaccinated patient. The USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that pertussis seems to be making a comeback. Many cases are being reported in previously vaccinated children between the ages of 10 and 19 years. Vaccination remains the most important preventative strategy. Routine vaccination of children as part of the Expanded Program on Immunization is recommended, as well as booster doses for adults and pregnant women. Since pertussis is often diagnosed at a late stage, treatment is mainly supportive. Antibiotics are provided to reduce the severity of the disease and prevent further spread thereof. Infants and younger patients, immunocompromised patients and patients with co-morbidities are at increased risk of complications. Macrolides are the first-line treatment and prophylaxis. The choice of agent depends on the age of the patient, the potential for adverse effects and tolerability. This article will review the disease, treatment options and prevention of pertussis. © Medpharm.

AB  - Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidencebased data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John's wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective. © 2013 Qureshi and Al-Bedah, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Background: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a newly recognized risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events later in life. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum state. Objective: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of pregnancy resolve. Methods: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed. Results: Eighteen subjects (11 GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum (12.0 ± 12.3 vs 2.9 ± 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the same change (2.8 ± 5.3 vs 2.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of healthy women (P = 0.75). Conclusions: SDB in women with gestational hypertension improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

AB  - Purpose: Mounting evidence implicate habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, as an important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Little, however, is known about the determinants of habitual snoring among pregnant women. We sought to assess its prevalence and to identify maternal characteristics associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 1,303) receiving prenatal care provided information about habitual snoring before and during pregnancy in in-person interviews completed in early pregnancy. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) from multivariable models designed to identify factors associated with snoring during pregnancy. Results: Approximately 7.3 % of pregnant women reported habitual snoring during early pregnancy. The odds of habitual snoring during pregnancy was strongly related with maternal reports of habitual snoring prior to the index pregnancy (aOR = 24.32; 95 % CI, 14.30-41.51). Advanced maternal age (≥35 years) (aOR = 2.02; 95 % CI, 1.11-3.68), history of pregestational diabetes (aOR = 3.61; 95 % CI, 1.07-12.2), history of mood and anxiety disorders (aOR = 1.81; 95 % CI, 1.02-3.20), and prepregnancy overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2) (aOR = 2.31; 95 % CI, 1.41-3.77) and obesity (≥30 kg/m 2) (aOR = 2.81; 95 % CI, 1.44-5.48) status were statistically significant risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy (aOR = 2.70; 95 % CI, 1.17-6.26) was associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy. Conclusions: Identification of risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy has important implications for developing strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, promoting improved sleep hygiene and improved pregnancy outcomes among reproductive-age women. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that could prevent preterm delivery (PTD, &lt;37 weeks gestation). We examined the individual and joint associations of pre-pregnancy BMI, second trimester exercise and sleep on PTD. We conducted a nested, population-based case-control study interviewing postpartum 344 cases delivering at &lt;37 weeks, as identified by clinical estimate of gestational age from prenatal screening records, and 698 term controls, excluding term low birthweight. Eligible women participated in California's statewide Prenatal Screening Program, worked during pregnancy, and delivered a singleton birth in Southern California in 2002-2003. Modeled separately, moderate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.96 - per hour/week) and vigorous (OR = 0.67; 95 % CI = 0.46-0.98 for yes vs. no) exercise during the second trimester were associated with a reduced odds of PTD, and sleep duration was not (OR = 1.09, 95 % CI = 0.80-1.48 for &lt;7 h; OR = 0.88, 95 % CI = 0.57-1.48 for &gt;8 h vs. 7-8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85-0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m2 (OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79-0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both pre-conceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Knowledge translation has relied on research products that take years to disseminate, losing relevance for intended users. We used a mixed-methods approach to determine women's preferences for research results and format, intention to share results, and potential benefits. We sampled healthy, pregnant women who completed survey data during their third trimesters and wanted access to results. Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared. Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational contacts increased dissemination of the women's preferred information to nonstudy participants. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - It has been estimated that 20% of pregnant women suffer from depression and it is well documented that maternal depression can have long-lasting effects on the child. Currently, common treatment for maternal depression has been the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications (SSRIs) which are used by 2-3% of pregnant women in the Nordic countries and by up to 10% of pregnant women in the United States. Antidepressants cross the placenta and are transferred to the fetus, thus, the question arises as to whether children of women taking antidepressants are at risk for altered neurodevelopmental outcomes and, if so, whether the risks are due to SSRI medication exposure or to the underlying maternal depression. This review considers the effects of maternal depression and SSRI exposure on offspring development in both clinical and preclinical populations. As it is impossible in humans to study the effects of SSRIs without taking into account the possible underlying effects of maternal depression (healthy pregnant women do not take SSRIs), animal models are of great value. For example, rodents can be used to determine the effects of maternal depression and/or perinatal SSRI exposure on offspring outcomes. Unraveling the joint (or separate) effects of maternal depression and SSRI exposure will provide more insights into the risks or benefits of SSRI exposure during gestation and will help women make informed decisions about using SSRIs during pregnancy. © 2013 Olivier, Åkerud, Kaihola, Pawluski, Skalkidou, Högberg and Sundström_poromaa.

AB  - Hypertensive pregnancy disorders complicate 6% to 8% of pregnancies and cause significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The goal of treatment is to prevent significant cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events in the mother without compromising fetal well-being. Current guidelines differentiate between the treatment of women with acute hypertensive syndromes of pregnancy and women with preexisting chronic hypertension in pregnancy. This review will address the management of hypertension in pregnancy, review the various pharmacologic therapies, and discuss the future directions in this field. © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Many changes that normally occur during pregnancy disrupt sleep and may lead to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). However, given that pregnancy may also predispose to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), we sought to investigate whether EDS may be associated with snoring, gasping, or apneas, further suggesting SDB. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of women in the immediate postpartum period was conducted. Participants answered questions from the multivariable apnea prediction index regarding snoring, gasping, and witnessed apneas in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Participants were also asked to answer Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questions, and a score 0-24 was calculated (>10 considered abnormal). Medical history and medication use were obtained both by history and review of the medical record. Results: Out of 1,000 women recruited, 990 women answered the ESS questionnaire completely. Mean prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 ± 6.2 with 21.7 % of the sample having a prepregnancy BMI ≥30. Mean ESS score was 7.1 ± 3.9, and 1.7 % of the total sample scored 16 or greater. ESS increased significantly with age, BMI, and neck circumference. All three symptoms of SDB were associated with higher mean ESS scores. In a multiple linear regression analysis, loud snoring, gasping, and apneas were statistically significant independent predictors of mean ESS score. Conclusions: EDS measured by ESS is a common finding in pregnancy. Snoring, gasping, and apneas appear to be independent predictors of mean ESS scores. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - There is a need for interventions that address postpartum fatigue and sleep problems. Of the women who experience this, few receive the needed nursing care during the weeks after childbirth when severe postpartum fatigue and poor sleep are most prevalent. These health problems are significant not only for the well-being of the new mother, but for her infant and other family members. This article outlines four steps in applying theory in research, using a "top-down and bottom-up" approach to develop a nursing intervention for self-management of postpartum fatigue and sleep. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pregnant women are highly motivated to stop or suspend smoking once they learn they are pregnant. Many women resume smoking following delivery and the reasons that they relapse are often linked to stress, sleep deprivation, lack of motivation and confidence to remain smoke free, and lack of alternative strategies for stress reduction. Programs targeting new mothers and their spouses as a couple have a more beneficial impact on reducing postpartum smoking relapse rates than merely focusing on the mother. More strategies are needed to support mothers long-term to remain tobacco smoke free and no single strategy works for every women. Although pharmacologic interventions may assist women to stop smoking, few women wish to take medications during pregnancy, and nicotine patch use during the postpartum period may transfer nicotine in smaller amounts into the breastmilk. Effective strategies that minimize pregnancy weight retention during the postpartum period need to be developed to assist women not to return to smoking to lose weight after delivery. More emphasis on coupling smoking cessation during pregnancy and promotion of breastfeeding will prolong the period of postpartum freedom from smoking. Well-established and effective programs are available to obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians to provide parents stop-smoking and counseling and other supportive therapies, but they must be offered and used in order to be effective. As emphasized above, these programs must become the standard of care for any women found to be smoking at anytime during pregnancy and to all family members who continue to smoke during the postpartum period or while an infant may remain hospitalized in the post birth period. Although current gaps do exist in translating research-based programs into routine clinical practice, use of information technologies, through the use of the internet, social media, text messaging, short videos on mobile telephones, makes it possible to reach nearly every women who smoke and to provide meaningful information that should provide some protection for her newborn and growing infant. Public health efforts to 'glamorize' smoking in the media, restrict or ban smoking in public places, ban smoking in multidwelling apartments, in restaurants, and at social gatherings where children may be present provide normative behavioral cues to pregnant women and new mothers, as well as their families. Minimizing social cues associated with smoking relapse are critical if we are to have continued success. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs especially at rest. Symptoms worsen in the evening and night and improve with activity such as walking. RLS may be secondary to, or exacerbated by, a number of conditions that include iron deficiency, pregnancy, end stage renal disease, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, or with neurological disorders such as peripheral neuropathy. Treatments for RLS include: dopaminergic agents, dopamine receptor agonists, opioids, sedative hypnotics, anticonvulsants, clonidine, minerals and vitamins et al.

AB  - Background: Morbidity and mortality in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants during their hospital stay have been well described. However, there are insufficient data regarding health problems after discharge. Study design: In a multicenter study performed between January 2009 and December 2010 including 2493 VLBW infants, questionnaires were sent out to all participating parents in the first year of life. We compared the parental reported health of VLBW infants with a national cohort (KIGGS). Results: The reported health of VLBW infants born after 29. weeks of gestation was identical to term infants. Even in the group of infants born before 24. weeks of gestation health was regarded as very good or good in > 70% of cases. However, parents described a delayed development in > 50% increasing to > 70% with lower gestational age. In the first year of life VLBW infants have an increased risk of visual and hearing problems. Bronchitis was more frequent in VLBW infants but there were no differences in other infections typical for that age group. VLBW infants had less sleeping problems. No gender differences were described. Conclusion: VLBW infants in our study require slightly more medical care compared to their peers. However, medical problems are relatively small compared to the developmental needs as perceived by their parents. Therefore, close follow-up and advice by specialists in infant development are needed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Maternal smoking is detrimental to the development of fetuses and neonates. This meta-analysis was performed to measure the accumulated association of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) risk with both prenatal and postnatal maternal smoking. The odds ratio (OR) corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the associations between maternal smoking and SIDS risk. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and I2 statistics. The data for this meta-analysis were available from 35 case-control studies. The prenatal and postnatal maternal smoking was associated with a significantly increased risk of SIDS (OR=2.25, 95% CI=2.03-2.50 for prenatal maternal smoking analysis, and OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.77-2.19 for postnatal maternal smoking analysis, respectively) by random effects model. After stratified analyses, regardless of prenatal or postnatal smoking, heavy cigarette consumption increased the risk of SIDS and significantly elevated SIDS risk was found to be associated with co-sleeping with postnatal smoking mothers. Our results suggested that maternal smoking were associated with elevated SIDS risk, the effects were dose-dependent. In addition, SIDS risk was significantly increased in infants co-sleeping with postnatal smoking mothers. © 2012 .

AB  - Background: Detailed associations between physical activity (PA) subcomponents, sedentary time, and body composition in preschoolers remain unclear. Objective: We examined the magnitude of associations between objectively measured PA subcomponents and sedentary time with body composition in 4-y-old children. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 398 preschool children recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. PA was measured by using accelerometry, and body composition was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between light physical activity, moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity; sedentary time; and body composition were analyzed by using repeated-measures linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, birth weight, maternal education, maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sleep duration. Sedentary time and PA were also mutually adjusted for one another to determine whether they were independently related to adiposity. Results: VPA was the only intensity of PA to exhibit strong inverse associations with both total adiposity [P<0.001 for percentage of body fat and fat mass index (FMI)] and abdominal adiposity (P = 0.002 for trunk FMI). MVPA was inversely associated with total adiposity (P = 0.018 for percentage of body fat; P = 0.022 for FMI) but only because of the contribution of VPA, because MPA was unrelated to fatness (P<0.077). No associations were shown between the time spent sedentary and body composition (P<0.11). Conclusions: In preschoolers, the time spent in VPA is strongly and independently associated with lower adiposity. In contrast, the time spent sedentary and in low-to-moderate-intensity PA was unrelated to adiposity. These results indicate that efforts to challenge pediatric obesity may benefit from prioritizing VPA. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - Aim To describe how recipients of portable sleeping spaces (PSSs) for babies received and used these devices, offered as emergency baby beds in earthquake-ravaged Christchurch, New Zealand, 2011. Method The PSS package responded to increased risk to babies from disrupted living and sleeping conditions in families. 'Door-to-door' distribution offered easy access to those in need. A subgroup of recipients gave feedback via a survey. Results From 642 families who received PSSs between March and August, 139 were invited to complete a survey on usage and 100 (72%) responded. Risks identified were 'earthquake related' (82%), bed-sharing (41%), smoking in pregnancy (26%) and prematurity or low birthweight (11%). PSSs were used for same-bed co-sleeping by 87%. They were used even though most families (96%) also had a cot or bassinet. Features most appreciated were 'having baby close' (90%), 'peace of mind' (88%) and portability (74%). Conclusion PSSs were acceptable to parents and used as instructed. Enabling physical protection of babies when same-bed co-sleeping, they gave peace of mind to parents. PSSs could be considered in ordinary times for protecting babies from sudden infant death. © 2013 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

AB  - In mammals, clock-gene proteins are expressed in the neurons of hypot halamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and that of other CNS structures, in the muscles, visceral organs and vessels, thus forming circadian rhythms of many functions. Little is known about the factors of formation of the circadian mechanism at the prenatal period. In the rats, E20 stage is characterized by a high level of oxytocin and selective expression of the first protein of clock-genes PER1. The goal of present study was to check the suggestion on the positive feedback between PER1 and oxytocin at the prenatal period, as well as to elucidate a possible role of PER1 in the regulation of oxytocin and GABA interactions at the period of formation of the cerebral circadian mechanism of clockgenes. With aid of western-blotting, we analyzed the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of anterior hypothalamus homogenate from the pregnant females and rat embryos (E20). Retinol metabolites through their nuclear receptor RORa are known to be bound to promoters of oxytocin and per 1 genes. Next day after administration of retinol to the females, a rise in PER1 content was noted in their cytoplasm, whereas in their embryos PER1 content was elevated in the nucleus. In the embryo cytoplasm there was a significant rise in production of oxytocin receptors and a decrease in the level of enzymes of GABA synthesis (glutamate decarboxylases 67 and 65). The results indicate the oxytocin- and retinol-dependent increase in the PER1 expression and the subsequent change in the ratio of oxytocin and GABA efficiency at the prenatal stage of formation of the circadian clockmechanism in the rat embryo anterior hypothalamus. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

We exposed the most important risk factors, such as diabetes duration, poor metabolic control, pregnancy, puberty, hypertension, poor control of blood lipids, renal disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. We describe the pathogenesis of the disease, small retinal vessel microangiopathies which produce extravasation, edema and ischemia phenomena. We put special emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its pathogenic importance. They are also described the main clinical symptoms as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard and soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), venous disorders, formation of new vessels and diabetic macular edema (the latter being the most common cause of vision loss). Finally we describe the latest diagnostic techniques and eye treatment, with special emphasis on obesity surgery importance as more important preventive factor to eliminate the predisposing and precipitating disease symptoms.

AB  - Objectives: Our objectives were to 1) determine whether first-trimester use of gabapentin is associated with an increased risk for major malformations; 2) examine rates of spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions, stillbirths, mean birth weight and gestational age at delivery; and 3) examine rates of poor neonatal adaptation syndrome following late pregnancy exposure. Methods: The study design was prospective. Women were included who initially contacted the services between 5 and 8 weeks with a comparison group of women exposed to nonteratogens, collected in a similar manner. Results: We have data on 223 pregnancy outcomes exposed to gabapentin and 223 unexposed pregnancies. The rates of major malformations were similar in both groups (p = 0.845). There was a higher rate of preterm births (p = 0.019) and low birth weight <2,500 g (p = 0.033) in the gabapentin group. Among infants who were exposed to gabapentin up until delivery, 23 of 61 (38%) were admitted to either the neonatal intensive care unit or special care nursery for observation and/or treatment, vs 6 of 201 (2.9%) live births in the comparison group (p < 0.001). There were 2 cases of possible poor neonatal adaptation syndrome in neonates exposed to gabapentin close to delivery, compared with none in the comparison group, although it must be noted that these infants were concomitantly exposed to other psychotropic drugs. Among the women who took gabapentin, the major indications were pain (n = 90; 43%) and epilepsy (n = 71; 34%); the remainder were for other indications, mostly psychiatric. Conclusion: Our results suggest that although this sample size is not large enough to make any definitive conclusions, and there was no comparator group treated with other antiepileptic drugs, gabapentin use in pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk for major malformations. This finding and the increased risk for low birth weight and preterm birth require further investigation. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioural-educational sleep intervention delivered in the early postpartum in improving maternal and infant sleep. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Postpartum units of two university affiliated hospitals. Participants 246 primiparous women and their infants randomised while in hospital with an internet based randomisation service to intervention (n=123) or usual care (n=123) groups. Interventions: The behavioural-educational sleep intervention included a 45-60 minute meeting with a nurse to discuss sleep information and strategies to promote maternal and infant sleep, a 20 page booklet with the content discussed, and phone contacts at one, two, and four weeks postpartum to reinforce information, provide support, and problem solve. The usual care group received calls at weeks one, two, and four to maintain contact without provision of advice. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was maternal nocturnal (9 pm to 9 am) sleep (minutes) and secondary outcome was longest stretch of infant nocturnal sleep (minutes) measured at six and 12 weeks postpartum by actigraphy. Other outcomes measured at six and 12 weeks were number of maternal and infant night time awakenings by actigraphy, fatigue visual analogue scale, general sleep disturbance scale, and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale. Rates of exclusive breast feeding were measured at 12 weeks postpartum only. Results: All women who completed any outcome measures at six or 12 weeks were included in analysis. Sleep outcomes were completed at one or both of six and 12 weeks postpartum for 215 of 246 (87%) women (110/123 intervention and 105/123 usual care). Longitudinal mixed effects model analyses indicated no significant differences between the groups on any of the outcomes. The estimated mean difference in maternal nocturnal sleep between the intervention and usual care groups was 5.97 minutes (95% confidence interval -7.55 to 19.5 minutes, P=0.39). No differences in any outcomes were noted based on the specific nurse delivering the intervention or the number of phone contacts received. Conclusion: A behavioural-educational intervention delivered in the early postpartum, in hospital, and in the first weeks at home, was ineffective in improving maternal and infant sleep or other health outcomes in the first months postpartum. Trial registration: ISRCT No 13501166.

AB  - Data about circadian blood pressure (BP) in normotensive patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are lacking. Thus, we sought to compare dipper and nondipper circadian variation of BP profile between normotensive women complicated with GDM and normal pregnant women. Forty-two women with GDM and 33 normal uncomplicated pregnant women who met the entry criteria for the study were enrolled in the study. Twenty-four-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography to measure the left ventricle mass index and diastolic parameters were performed. Nocturnal blood pressure dipping was calculated as follows: (awake BP-sleep BP) × 100/awake BP. Patients with a nocturnal reduction in average daytime systolic BP and diastolic BP of less than 10% were classified as nondippers. Left ventricle mass index was higher in normotensive pregnant women with GDM group than in normal pregnant subjects (101.98 ± 24 g/m2 vs. 90.67 ± 15 g/m 2, P &lt; .018). Significant nocturnal systolic and diastolic nondippings were observed in GDM groups compared with normal subjects. From diastolic variables, the mitral E velocity and isovolumetric relaxation time were compatible with diastolic dysfunction relaxation abnormalities (P = .003 and P = .015, respectively) in nondipper group. From all confounding factors, only E velocity (P = .002) and diagnosis of GDM (P &lt; .001) were predictive of nondipper circadian variation. This study shows that (i) circadian BP is impaired in normotensive pregnant subjects with GDM, (ii) the left ventricle mass index is higher in pregnant subjects with GDM than in normal pregnant subjects who despite a 24-hour BP are within normal limits, and (iii) in nocturnal nondipper group, the tendency to having diastolic relaxation abnormalities is noted. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Understanding sleep disorders in childhood requires a good knowledge of the development of waking states and sleep-wake cycle since such disorders are often age-specific. Sleep states are present in utero from the beginning of the third trimester of gestation. In premature babies, active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) are observed at 27 weeks of gestation and may be differentiated from one another. Approaching term, sleep is characterised by stable periods of QS and a very high percentage of AS. Beyond the first month of life, AS/REM sleep decreases significantly, while QS/NREM sleep increases and differentiates into stages N1, N2, and N3. Sleep onset no longer occurs in REM sleep after nine months. The progressive disappearance of nocturnal waking during the first year of life and the disappearance of naps between three and six years are two key factors for stable nocturnal sleep development. It is likely that foetuses have functional circadian pacemakers guided by maternal circadian rhythms. These circadian rhythms are lost at birth, and neonatal sleep and wakefulness follow an ultradian rhythm. The emergence of postnatal circadian rhythmicity depends on parental time cues as well as the day and night cycle.

AB  - Dysfunction of the circadian clock genes is involved in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and T2D share common genetic and phenotypic features, in the present study, we investigated the status of the circadian clock in a cohort of 40 Greek pregnant women with GDM, four with T2D and 20 normal controls. Peripheral blood mRNA transcript levels of 10 clock genes (CLOCK1, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, PER3, PPARα, PPARD, PPARG, CRY1 and CRY2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. GDM patients expressed significantly lower transcript levels of BMAL1, PER3, PPARD and CRY2 compared to control women (p<0.05). No significant difference was documented between GDM women maintained either under insulin treatment or diet. A positive correlation was found between the expression of BMAL1 versus CRY2 (r=0.45, p=0.003) and BMAL1 versus PPARD (r=0.43, p=0.004). Further investigation on the functional relevance of these clock genes, disclosed that expression of PER3 correlated negatively with HbA1C levels (r=-0.36, p=0.022). These data document for the first time that the expression of BMAL1, PER3, PPARD and CRY2 genes is altered in GDM compared to normal pregnant women and support the notion that deranged expression of clock genes may play a pathogenic role in GDM. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Circadian clocks have been described in each tissue of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. Although a role for the clock in the timing of ovulation is indicated, the impact of diseases that disrupt fertility on clock function or the clocks' role in the etiology of these pathologies has yet to be fully appreciated. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a particularly devastating endocrinopathy, affecting approximately 10% of women at childbearing age. Common features of PCOS are a polycystic ovary, amenorrhea, and excess serum androgen. Approximately 40% of these women have metabolic syndrome, including hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperleptinemia. It has been suggested that excess androgen is a critical factor in the etiology of PCOS. We have examined the effects of androgen excess during puberty on the phase of circadian clocks in tissues of the metabolic and hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axes. Female period1-luciferase (per1-luc) rats were exposed to androgen (5α-dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) or placebo for 4-6 weeks (short term) or 9-15 weeks (long term). As expected, DHT-treated animals gained more weight than controls and had disrupted estrous cycles. At the end of treatment, tissues, including the liver, lung, kidney, white adipose, cornea, pituitary, oviduct, and ovarian follicles, were cultured, and per1-luc expression in each was recorded. Analysis of per1-luc expression revealed that DHT exposure increased phase distribution of multiple oscillators, including ovarian follicles, liver, and adipose, and altered phase synchrony between animals. These data suggest that excess androgen during puberty, a common feature of PCOS, negatively affects internal circadian organization in both the reproductive and metabolic axes.

AB  - A 27-year-old woman presented with Cushing's syndrome. Typical clinical symptoms and signs developed at the beginning of each pregnancy. The latest three pregnancies all ended with natural abortion at about three months. It was the fourth time that she was pregnant. By week 18 of gestation, plasma cortisol diurnal rhythm was absent, basal urinary free cortisol was 1650 μg/24 h and ACTH levels were suppressed. The diagnosis of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome was established. Cushing's syndrome in the patient resolved within four weeks of abortion. But signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism recurred in the fifth pregnancy and resolved soon after abortion during the follow-up. The mechanisms by which pregnancy-induced Cushing's syndrome occurred in this patient are unclear. Aberrant responsiveness or hyperresponsiveness of adrenocortical cells to a non-ACTH and non-CRH substance produced in excess in pregnancy should be considered. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Background: Modafinil (Provigil) was marketed in the UK in 1998 to promote wakefulness in the treatment of narcolepsy. In April 2004, the licence was extended to include chronic pathological conditions; 2 years later, the prescription of modafinil was restricted to patients with shift work sleep disorder, narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Following a recent review of the safety data, the licence has been further restricted to only treat patients with narcolepsy. The review highlighted the degree of off-label usage of modafinil, including patients with multiple sclerosis. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the safety profile of modafinil in real-world clinical usage and across a range of prescribing indications, including multiple sclerosis. Methods: The study was conducted using the observational cohort technique of Modified Prescription-Event Monitoring. Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions issued by primary care physicians from July 2004 to August 2005. Patient demographics and information on prescribing behaviour were included in the questionnaire sent to the prescribing general practitioner (GP) 6 months after the initial prescription for each patient. The questionnaire sought data on any events that patient may have experienced during that time, reasons for stopping treatment with modafinil, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), potential interaction with contraceptives, and pregnancies. Incidence densities (IDs) were calculated for all events, and stratified according to indication and dose. Specific events were evaluated by requesting further information. Results: Of the 4,023 questionnaires sent to GPs, 2,416 were returned (response rate 60.1 %). Of these, only those patients issued modafinil after April 2004 (with the associated broadening of the indications for treatment) were included in the study, resulting in a final cohort of 1,096 patients: 497 (45.3 %) male, median age of 52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41-63), and 599 (54.7 %) female, median age of 47 years (IQR 38-57). Nine patients were aged 16 years or younger; no serious skin reactions were reported in this group. Thirty-four percent of the cohort had an indication of multiple sclerosis. In this study, the majority of the clinical events that were most frequently reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping or that occurred in month 1 have been previously documented with modafinil. The results of the study show that less than half of the women of child-bearing potential were established on a recommended contraceptive programme; three women became pregnant whilst taking modafinil and the oral contraceptive pill. Stratification of IDs by dose revealed certain additional events occurred during month 1 of treatment at the higher dose only. Assessment of individual cases of cardiac, psychiatric and skin events indicated causal associations with modafinil. Conclusions: This study provides important additional safety data on the use of modafinil in patients in 'real-world' use, including those for whom the prescribing indication is outside the terms of licence, as per recent changes to the licensed indications for treatment. In addition to safety data, our study provides useful utilization data. Results from this study indicate that a significant number of women of child-bearing potential had not been commenced on appropriate contraceptive programmes prior to starting modafinil. There were three pregnancies that occurred whilst taking contraception, highlighting the necessity of ensuring effective contraceptive cover for women during and after stopping treatment with modafinil. Analysis of the data showed that the majority of events reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping and ranked events during the first month of treatment had been previously documented with the use of modafinil. Stratification of events according to dose revealed a number of events that occurred at the higher dose only, including serious events such as psychosis. The targeted events for which causality assessments were undertaken confirmed the potential of modafinil to induce certain types of events in individual patients, including cardiac and psychiatric events. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Aim To investigate whether or not infants exposed to methamphetamine prenatally have impaired arousal responses from sleep. Methods The polygraphic nap studies involved 42 infants aged 3 months exposed to methamphetamine in utero and a comparison group of 57 infants. A proportion of mothers in both groups smoked cigarettes and/or marijuana and drank alcohol during pregnancy. White noise from 50 to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10 dB intervals twice within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and arousal thresholds measured. Results Combining groups, 306 tests were completed (128 and 178 within REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more likely to wake at lower thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95% CI, 3.78-8.23 p < 0.0001). No significant differences in arousal threshold were found between methamphetamine and comparison groups, before or after controlling for other substance use (NREM sleep; 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.59 and REM sleep; 1.03, 95% CI, 0.56-1.89). Conclusions These findings suggest that arousal responses of methamphetamine-exposed infants remain intact, providing no support for the hypothesis that prenatal exposure could increase their vulnerability to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) through arousal deficits. ©2012 The Author(s)/Acta Pædiatrica ©2012 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

AB  - Objective To describe the prevalence of, reasons given for, and factors associated with sick leave during pregnancy. Design Longitudinal, population-based descriptive study. Setting Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Population All women scheduled to give birth at the hospital (November 2008 to April 2010). Methods Consenting women were handed a questionnaire at the routine ultrasound check at 17 weeks of gestation. Women returning this questionnaire received a second questionnaire at 32 weeks of gestation. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations with somatic, psychiatric and social factors. Main outcome measures Rates and duration of sick leave. Results By 32 weeks of gestation, 63.2% of the 2918 women included were on sick leave, and 75.3% had been on sick leave at some point during their pregnancy. Pelvic girdle pain and fatigue/sleep problems were the main reasons given for sick leave. Being on sick leave in all trimesters was strongly associated with hyperemesis, exercising less than weekly, chronic pain before or during pregnancy, infertility treatment (all P < 0.001); younger maternal age, conflicts in the workplace (both P < 0.01); multiparity, previous depression, insomnia and lower education (all P < 0.05). Sick leave was associated with elective caesarean section and higher infant birthweight (P < 0.01). Adjustment of the work situation was associated with 1 week shorter duration of sick leave. Conclusions Most women receive sick leave during pregnancy, but sick leave might not be caused by pregnancy alone. Previous medical and psychiatric history, work conditions and socio-economic factors need to be addressed to understand sick leave during pregnancy. © 2012 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2012 RCOG.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is more prevalent among women with preeclampsia than among normotensive controls. Study design: Preeclamptic patients admitted to the hospital for observation and normotensive, gestational age matched controls hospitalized for obstetrical indications other than preeclampsia were recruited for an overnight sleep evaluation. Watch-PAT100, a validated wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SDB, was used to complete all sleep studies. Results: Twenty preeclamptic patients and 20 controls were recruited. Preeclamptic subjects had a higher mean BMI (32.6 ± 9.5 vs. 24.5 ± 3.5, P = 0.001). Preeclamptic subjects had higher mean respiratory disturbance (RDI, mean difference 4.9 events/hour of sleep), apnea hypopnea (AHI, mean difference 5.7 events/hour of sleep) and oxygen desaturation (ODI, mean difference 4.5 events/hour of sleep) indices, however these differences did not reach statistical significance. Preeclamptic subjects were more likely to have more severe forms of SDB compared to controls (ODI ≥ 5, 20% vs. 0%, p =.047). Conclusion: Compared to normotensive controls, preeclamptic subjects experience more SDB events and a greater degree of nocturnal hypoxemia. Further research is needed to determine if SDB, independent of BMI, is a significant contributing factor to the risk of developing preeclampsia. © 2013 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.

AB  - Background: The management of pregnancy in patients with narcolepsy poses many questions regarding therapy, including the risk to the mother and fetus related to the disease, potential risks at the time of conception, the risk to both the mother and the fetus of the medications used to treat narcolepsy, and the risk to the infant from medications that might be secreted in breast milk. There are no detailed practice parameters on the treatment of narcolepsy patients during pregnancy. We surveyed narcolepsy specialists from around the world to determine their clinical approach to the management of patients with narcolepsy at the time of conception, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Methods: Survey invitations were sent via e-mail to 75 clinicians worldwide between 2/2011 and 3/2011 with 34 responses (USA, n= 10; Brazil, n= 3; Czech Republic, n= 2; France, n= 2; Italy; n= 2; Netherlands, n= 2; Canada, n= 1; Denmark, n= 1; Finland, n= 1; Germany, n= 1; Japan, n= 1; Spain, n= 1; unknown n= 7). Responders who completed the survey had 20. years (median range, 5-35) of experience in sleep medicine practice with a median number of five narcolepsy patients seen per week. The number of pregnant narcoleptic patients followed per physician was five (median range 1-40). Results: The survey results indicated that the management of patients with narcolepsy varies greatly from clinician to clinician and from country to country. The majority of the clinicians stopped the narcolepsy medications at the time of conception, during pregnancy, and during breastfeeding some reduced the dose and others did not change the dosage, depending on the particular medication. Conclusions: The findings from our survey and literature review suggest that the perceived risks of narcolepsy medication during pregnancy to the mother and the fetus usually are overestimated, as the risk for teratogenic effects from narcolepsy medications in therapeutic doses is essentially nonexistent. However, the potential for rare complications during pregnancy and congenital abnormalities cannot be excluded. Most narcolepsy patients have vaginal delivery without complications. In rare cases patients had cataplexy that interfered with delivery, but if caesarian is required there appears to be no increased anaesthetic or surgical risks. Further prospective information for the appropriate treatment of narcolepsy patients during pregnancy is needed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Advances in diabetes technologies allow patients to manage their diabetes with greater precision and flexibility. Many recent studies show that continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can be used to tighten glycemic control safely and to ease certain burdens of diabetes self-management. Recent Findings: The following summary reflects the most recent findings in CGM and provides an overall review of who would most benefit from CGM use. Benefits of CGM may vary based on age, type of diabetes, pregnancy, health, sleep, or heart rate. Accuracy and reliability are critical in current uses of CGM and especially for new and future systems that automate insulin partially (e.g., low glucose suspend) or entirely (e.g., 'fully closed-loop' artificial pancreas). Clinicians are simultaneously testing available products in new patient groups such as the critically ill and type 2 diabetes patients not using mealtime insulin. Summary: In a widening set of circumstances, use of CGM has been shown to promote safer and more effective glycemic control than self-monitoring of blood glucose. Imperfections remain in certain scenarios such as hypoglycemia and in certain populations such as young children. Ongoing research on sensors and calibration software should translate to better systems. Copyright © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - A second child of nonconsanguineous parents was born at term by Caesarean section for foetal distress, after a normal pregnancy. Birth weight was 3.4 kg (25th centile). Early developmental milestones were delayed-he sat at 9 months, crawled at 14 months and walked at 20 months. Fine motor development was also delayed. Hearing and vision were normal. Initial assessment by a clinical geneticist was performed at 14 months of age. On examination at that time, occipital-frontal circumference was found to be below the third centile, weight was on the 25th centile and length was on the 50th centile. Dysmorphic features included low set ears, upslanting palpebral fissures with epicanthic folds, a high arched palate and prominent lips (Fig. 1). There was generalized hypotonia, with normal power and reflexes. He had behavioural problems, which included self-injurious behaviour involving biting and head banging. There was a strawberry haemangioma on the abdominal wall. Investigations at that time included comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) (Breen et al., 1999), which identified a de-novo 14q duplication (14q12-q13.1). © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Epidemiological studies initially demonstrated that maternal undernutrition leading to low birth weight may predispose for energy balance disorders throughout life. High birth weight due to maternal obesity or diabetes, inappropriate early post-natal nutrition and rapid catch-up growth may also sensitise to increased risk of obesity. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease concept, the perinatal perturbation of foetus/neonate nutrient supply might be a crucial determinant of individual programming of body weight set point. The hypothalamus-adipose axis plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of energy homoeostasis controlling the nutritional status and energy storage level. The perinatal period largely corresponds to the period of brain maturation, neuronal differentiation and active adipogenesis in rodents. Numerous dams and/or foetus/neonate dietary manipulation models were developed to investigate the mechanisms underlying perinatal programming in rodents. These models showed several common offspring hypothalamic consequences such as impaired neurogenesis, neuronal functionality, nuclei structural organisation and feeding circuitry hardwiring. These alterations led to a persistent reprogrammed appetite system that favoured the orexigenic pathways, leptin/insulin resistance and hyperphagia. Impaired hypothalamic sympathetic outflow to adipose tissue and/or reduced innervation may also account for modified fat cell metabolism. Thus, enhanced adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis capacities may predispose the offspring to fat accumulation. Abnormal hypothalamus-adipose axis circadian rhythms were also evidenced. This review mainly focuses on studies in rodents. It highlights hormonal and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for long-lasting programming of energy balance in the offspring. Dietary supplementation may provide a therapeutic option using a specific regimen for reversing adverse programming outcomes in humans. © 2013 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant acting as an MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. Because of its peculiar pharmacological profile, this drug caters the potential to correct the abnormalities of circadian rhythms associated with mood disorders, including abnormalities of the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we examined the effect of chronic agomelatine treatment on sleep architecture and circadian rhythms of motor activity using the rat model of prenatal restraint stress (PRS) as a putative 'aetiological' model of depression. PRS was delivered to the mothers during the last 10 d of pregnancy. The adult progeny ('PRS rats') showed a reduced duration of slow wave sleep, an increased duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increased number of REM sleep events and an increase in motor activity before the beginning of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. In addition, adult PRS rats showed an increased expression of the transcript of the primary response gene, c-Fos, in the hippocampus just prior to the beginning of the dark phase. All these changes were reversed by a chronic oral treatment with agomelatine (2000 ppm in the diet). The effect of agomelatine on sleep was largely attenuated by treatment with the MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor antagonist, S22153, which caused PRS-like sleep disturbances on its own. These data provide the first evidence that agomelatine corrects sleep architecture and restores circadian homeostasis in a preclinical model of depression and supports the value of agomelatine as a novel antidepressant that resynchronizes circadian rhythms under pathological conditions. © CINP 2012.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Napping is highly prevalent in pregnant women, but the relation between nighttime sleep and daytime naps in pregnant women is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the temporal association of nighttime sleep quality and quantity with subsequent daytime naps and the temporal association of daytime naps with sleep quality and quantity the following night in women during the third trimester of pregnancy in Taiwan. METHODS: Sleep was assessed in 80 Taiwanese nulliparous women aged 31.70 years (SD = 4.58 years) using actigraphy and diaries for 7 consecutive days. Subjective sleep quality was examined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multiple linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were used to examine the temporal associations of nighttime sleep and daytime naps. RESULTS: All women napped sometime during the study week, and mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score was 6.6, indicating poor sleep quality. Fewer weekly work hours and shorter sleep duration the preceding night were associated with longer nap duration the next day. More work hours, longer nap duration, and more intense fatigue were associated with shorter sleep duration the following night. DISCUSSION: Naps during pregnancy might indicate insufficient nighttime sleep, and longer daytime naps could compromise subsequent nighttime sleep. Further research is needed to determine if short sleep duration and longer daytime naps are associated with negative pregnancy outcomes. Copyright © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of Kurjak's Antenatal Neurodevelopmental Test (KANET), a new test for fetal neurodevelopment. Methods: One hundred seventeen prenatal neurological tests were performed by the KANET scoring system between 28 and 38 weeks of gestation in 24 low-risk (24 fetuses) and 26 at-risk pregnancies (32 fetuses). The study was completed within 12 months from July 2011 onward. All 56 babies were assessed for early neurological outcome at birth by neonatologists. Results: There were no abnormal KANET scores. Two thirds of all borderline scores were found in the at-risk group. Because KANET was performed more than once in most pregnancies, we introduced the average KANET score. Only one fetus of the "at-risk group" had a borderline average score. This fetus had the only abnormal early neurological outcome of all 56 fetuses. When we compared all 18 borderline KANET scores with fetal diurnal rhythm based on maternal observation, we found that 89% of the borderline scores of the "at-risk" group were at times characterized by the mother as usually "active" periods compared with 33.3% in the low-risk group. Conclusion: KANET is suggestive of expressing the risk for neurodevelopmental fetal disorders. Studies designed to investigate the potential connectivity of fetal diurnal rhythm and pregnancy risk status should follow. © 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2013.

AB  - Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are major contributors to perinatal morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of gestational hypertension still relies on conventional clinic blood pressure (BP) measurements and thresholds of ≥140/90 mm Hg for systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) BP. However, the correlation between BP level and target organ damage, cardiovascular disease risk, and long-term prognosis is greater for ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) than clinic BP measurement. Accordingly, ABPM has been suggested as the logical approach to overcoming the low sensitivity and specificity of clinic BP measurements in pregnancy. With the use of ABPM, differing predictable BP patterns throughout gestation have been identified for clinically healthy and hypertensive pregnant women. In normotensive pregnancies, BP steadily decreases up to the middle of gestation and then increases up to the day of delivery. In contrast, women who develop gestational hypertension or preeclampsia show stable BP during the first half of pregnancy and a continuous linear BP increase thereafter until delivery. Epidemiologic studies have also consistently reported sex differences in the 24-h patterns of ambulatory BP and heart rate. Typically, men exhibit a lower heart rate and higher BP than women, the differences being larger for SBP than DBP. Additionally, as early as in the first trimester of gestation, statistically significant increased 24-h SBP and DBP means characterize women complicated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies. However, the normally lower BP in nongravid women as compared with men, additional decrease in BP during the second trimester of gestation in normotensive but not in hypertensive pregnant women, and significant differences in the 24-h BP pattern between healthy and complicated pregnancies at all gestational ages have not been taken into consideration when establishing reference BP thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy. Several studies reported that use of the 24-h BP mean is not a proper test for an individualized early diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy defined on the basis of cuff BP measurements, thus concluding that from such an awkward approach ABPM is not useful in pregnancy. The 24-h BP pattern that characterizes healthy pregnant women at all gestational ages suggests the use for diagnosis of a time-specified reference limit reflecting that mostly predictable BP variability. Once the time-varying threshold, given, for instance, by the upper limit of a tolerance interval, is available, the hyperbaric index (HBI), as a determinant of BP excess, can be calculated as the total area of any given subject's BP above the threshold. This tolerance-hyperbaric test, where diagnosis of gestational hypertension is based on the HBI calculated with reference to a time-specified tolerance limit, has been shown to provide high sensitivity and specificity for the early identification of subsequent hypertension in pregnancy, as well as a valuable approach for prediction of pregnancy outcome. ABPM during gestation, starting preferably at the time of the first obstetric check-up following positive confirmation of pregnancy, provides sensitive endpoints for use in early risk assessment and guide for establishing prophylactic or therapeutic intervention, and should thus be regarded as the required standard for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy.

AB  - Diurnal patterns of salivary alpha amylase (sAA) in pregnant women have not previously been described. The current study employed ecological momentary assessment to examine the association between the diurnal sAA, obstetric history, maternal demographics, and mood during pregnancy. Saliva was self-collected by 83 pregnant women (89% White, age 25.3-43.0 years; mean gestational age 21.9 weeks, range 6-37 weeks; gravida 1-6) at home over three days. Results indicated that current pregnancy (gestational age and fetal sex) and maternal demographics were not related to diurnal sAA. In contrast, a history of previous miscarriage (Parameter=-.17; SE=.05; p<.05) was associated with an atypical diurnal pattern. Even after accounting for obstetric history, trait anxiety (Parameter=.16; SE=.04; p<.001) was associated with increased sAA over the day while chronic levels of fatigue (Parameter=-.06; SE=.03; p<.05) were associated with decreased sAA. In a separate model, we also tested the time varying covariation of sAA and mood. The effects of momentary mood were in contrast to those for trait mood. Both momentary depression (Parameter=.22; SE=.09; p<.01) and vigour/positive mood (Parameter=.12; SE=.04; p<.001) were associated with momentary increases in sAA while momentary anxiety and fatigue were not related to sAA. The findings suggest that basal sAA during pregnancy is sensitive to emotional arousal. Evaluating diurnal patterns of sAA holds promise for advancing understanding of how emotional arousal during pregnancy may affect fetal development. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Several tests have been proposed to diagnose patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS). The aims of the study were: i) to evaluate the performance of salivary cortisol (SC) in hypercortisolism and ii) to compare SC with serum cortisol (SeC) and urinary cortisol. Design and patients: This was a diagnostic study. Twenty-seven patients with untreated Cushing's disease (CD untr), 21 women consuming oral contraceptive pill (OCP), 18 pregnant women, and 89 healthy subjects (controls) were enrolled. Methods: SC and SeC at baseline and after the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) and urinary free cortisol (UFC) were measured. Results: Midnight SC had a sensitivity of 100% in the CD untr group and a specificity of 97.7% in the controls. Specificity remained high (95.2%) in women taking OCP, while in pregnant women, it decreased to 83.3%. SC after the LDDST showed a sensitivity of 96.3% in the CD untr group; specificity was 97.7% in the controls and 90.5% in OCP women. Midnight SeC had a sensitivity of 100% in the CD untr group. SeC after the LDDST had a sensitivity of 100% in the CD untr group while specificity was 97.7% in the controls and 61.9% in women taking OCP. For UFC, sensitivity was 92.6% in the CD untr group while specificity was 97.7% in the controls and 100% in the OCP group. Conclusions: SC is a reliable parameter for the diagnosis of severe hypercortisolism, with high sensitivity and specificity. In women during pregnancy or taking OCP, the measurement of SC, identifying the free fraction, could be helpful to exclude CS. © 2013 European Society of Endocrinology.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined the patterns and psychosocial predictors of sleep quality in Taiwanese pregnant women. Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used. A convenience sample of 400 pregnant women from two urban hospitals in Taiwan participated in this study. Data were collected using six self-report measures: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Attitude to Body Image Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. Results: Our findings revealed that the prevalence of pregnancy-associated sleep disturbance (PSQI score >5) was 65.5%. The mean score of the global PSQI was 7.25 ± 3.43, indicating that participant pregnant women in general reported mild sleep disturbance. Trend analyses of PSQI score indicated a linear trend, with a gradual decline in the sleep quality as the pregnancy progressed. Sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality scores differed significantly by trimesters. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the best subsets to predict sleep quality were prenatal depression, prepregnancy sleep quality, current body image, and week of gestation for Taiwanese pregnant women. Clinical Implications: These findings offer evidence that healthcare professionals should provide sleep counseling to pregnant women, and incorporate depression and body image into a supportive model of sleep-related prenatal care. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that first-born children and adults are phenotypically different to later-born children. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether birth order would be associated with changes in metabolism in childhood. Methods: We studied 85 healthy prepubertal children aged 4 to 11 years, born 38 to 40 weeks' gestation, and birth weight appropriate for gestational age: 32 first-born and 53 later-born children. Clinical assessments included measurement of children's height, weight, fasting lipid and hormonal profiles, anddual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition. Children also underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tests with Bergman's minimal model. Results: First-born children were approximately 3 cmtaller (height SD scores 0.88 vs 0.39; P=.009) and were slimmer (body mass index SD scores -0.05 vs 0.39; P=.048) than later-born children. Consistent with their taller stature, first-born children also had a 27% increase in IGF-I concentrations (227 vs 173 ng/mL; P=.002). Insulin sensitivity was reduced by 21% among first-borns compared to later-borns (8.4 vs 10.6 × 10-4/min/[mU/L]; P=.019). Further, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that first-borns had higher daytime systolic (+5 mm Hg; P=.032) and diastolic (+4 mm Hg; P=.029) blood pressure. Blood lipids were unaffected by birth order. Conclusions: Although first-borns were taller and slimmer, these children had reduced insulin sensitivity and increased daytime blood pressure compared to later-borns. Thus, first-borns may be at a greater risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in adult life. This finding may have important public health implications, in light of a worldwide trend toward smaller families. Copyright © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Purpose: This study was intended to evaluate the attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by a sleep questionnaire to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant women. Berlin questionnaire was employed for symptom-based OSA screening during the third trimester and obstetric outcome data were obtained in 276 deliveries. The relationship between symptom-based OSA and outcomes were explored using SPSS version 18.0 and stratified by obesity (BMI strata <30 and ≥30). Our primary outcome was the compound occurrence of SGA (fetal) or preeclampsia (maternal). Multivariate models were applied in controlling for potential confounders. Results: The overall prevalence of OSA was 32.2 % and it was significantly related with the higher maternal BMI, more body weight at delivery, and weight gain during pregnancy (p = 0.007, p = 0.003, p = 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences in the primary outcomes according to the positivity of OSA by screening, regardless of the stratification by obesity. The cesarean delivery rate was significantly higher in the OSA positive group (36.0 vs 22.5 %, p = 0.018), but it was not significant in the each strata of obesity. In multivariate analysis, the outcomes of birth weight, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and small for gestational age were also not different according to the positivity of OSA. Conclusions: It seems that the prevalence of OSA by a sleep questionnaire is overestimating OSA in Korean pregnant women. Polysomnography might be needed to diagnose OSA and to evaluate the relationship between OSA and the occurrence of SGA or preeclampsia. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Current knowledge suggests that laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are involved in the occurrence of certain neonatal apneas/bradycardias, especially in the preterm newborn. While caffeine and/or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) are the most frequent options used for treating apneas in preterm newborns, their effects on LCR-related apneas/bradycardias are virtually unknown. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that caffeine and/or nCPAP decreases LCR-related cardiorespiratory inhibition in a preterm ovine model. Seven preterm lambs were born vaginally on gestational day 133 (normal gestation: 147 days) after intramuscular injections of betamethasone and mifepristone. Five days after birth, a chronic surgical instrumentation was performed to record states of alertness, electrocardiogram, systemic arterial pressure, and electromyographic activity of a laryngeal constrictor muscle, as well as to insert a transcutaneous supraglottal catheter. LCR were induced in quiet sleep under four conditions: 1) control (without caffeine or nCPAP); 2) nCPAP (5 cmH2O, without caffeine); 3) caffeine (10 mg/kg infused intravenously for 30 min, without nCPAP); and 4) nCPAP + caffeine. Our results showed that nCPAP consistently blunted LCR-related cardiorespiratory inhibition vs. control condition, contrary to caffeine whose overall effect was nonsignificant. In addition, nCPAP condition was characterized by a more consistent and rapid arousal after HCl injection. No significant differences were observed between all tested conditions with regard to swallowing and cough. It is concluded that nCPAP should be further assessed for its usefulness in treating neonatal apneas linked to LCR. Copyright © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. Conclusions: This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested. © 2013, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2013, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of children under the age of 15, making it a very common neurological disorder in the pediatric population (Russ et al., 2012 [1]). In addition, ~. 0.4-0.8% of all pregnant women have some form of epilepsy (Hauser et al., 1996a,b; Borthen et al., 2009; Krishnamurthy, 2012 [2-5]). Despite the potential deleterious effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the developing brain, their use is still required for seizure control in pregnant women (Krishnamurthy, 2012 [5]), and they represent the standard approach for treating children with epilepsy (Chu-Shore and Thiele, 2010; Quach et al., 2010; Verrotti et al., 2011 [6-8]). Even when AEDs are effective, there are potential side effects, including cognitive and affective changes or altered sleep and appetite. The consequences of AED exposure in development have been studied extensively (Canger et al., 1999; Modi et al., 2011a,b; Oguni, 2011 [9-12]). Despite intensive study, there is still debate about the long-term consequences of early life AED exposure. Here, we consider the evidence to date that AED exposure, either prenatally or in early postnatal life, has significant adverse effects on the developing brain and incorporate studies of laboratory animals as well as those of patients. We also note the areas of research where greater clarity seems critical in order to make significant advances. A greater understanding of the impact of AEDs on somatic, cognitive and behavioral development has substantial value because it has the potential to inform clinical practice and guide studies aimed at understanding the genetic and molecular bases of comorbid pathologies associated with common treatment regimens. Understanding these effects has the potential to lead to AEDs with fewer side effects. Such advances would expand treatment options, diminish the risk associated with AED exposure in susceptible populations, and improve the quality of life and health outcomes of children with epilepsy and children born to women who took AEDs during pregnancy.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "The Future of Translational Epilepsy Research". © 2012.

AB  - Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinal cause of vision loss. This review surveys the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, natural history and pathophysiology of CSCR. Studies suggest an annual incidence rate of 10 per 100 000 in men, with CSCR occurring six times more commonly in men compared with women. Most acute CSCR cases resolve spontaneously within 2-3 months. Prognosis is highly dependent on presenting visual acuity; patients with initial visual acuities of 6/6 remain at that level, while patients with initial visual acuities of less than 6/9 recover on average two to three Snellen lines over the next few years. The main risk factors for CSCR are systemic corticosteroid use, type A personality, pregnancy and endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The pathophysiology of CSCR remains obscure, although disorders in both the choroidal circulation and retinal pigment epithelium are implicated. © 2012 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.

Thrombosis of cerebral vasculature during postpartum period may present as postpartum psychosis where catatonia may be the presenting symptoms. It is known that catatonia responds to benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy. In this case report, a young woman presented with postpartum psychosis where catatonia is the major clinical presentation. She had cortical venous thrombosis due to which focal neurological deficits were also present. Owing to poor response to benzodiazepines, the patient was treated with electroconvulsive therapy, to which she responded well, and even her neurological deficits improved. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The quality of the maternal diet is fundamental for the infant's brain development. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as the omega-3, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and the omega-6, arachidonic acid (AA), along with brain-selective nutrients such as iodine, iron, zinc, copper, iodine, selenium, vitamins A and B, choline and folate are critical for healthy brain development, during both the foetal and early postnatal stage when areas of the brain are undergoing rapid development. During the last trimester of pregnancy and first 18 months of life, DHA and AA build up, in part due to the transfer of preformed DHA/AA from the mother to the fetus in utero, rapidly throughout the central nervous system and then post-birth during the transfer of human milk via the mother. This perinatal increase in cortical DHA concentrations coincides with very active periods of neurogenesis, axonal myelination and synaptogenesis. Diets high in saturated fats are increasingly associated with the reduction of molecular substrates that support cognitive function, consequently increasing the risk of neurological dysfunction in both animal and humans. There is a general agreement among scientists in this field that animals reared on diets deficient in omega-3 fatty acids result in impaired learning, memory and other neurological dysfunction while repletion of omega-3 reverses some of these impairments. Human diets deficient in omega-3 fatty acids are also associated with an elevated risk of mental disorders including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), Schizophrenia, Dyslexia, Dementia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Nutritional deficiencies (and for that matter excesses) may affect the infant's brain and subsequent development and behaviour in severe cases permanently. For example, iodine and iron deficiency (anemia) in infancy has been linked to (1) suboptimal human development demonstrated by poorer performance in global measurements of cognitive, motor and social-emotional behaviour and (2) alterations in regulatory processes such as the sleep-wake cycle. This chapter will provide an extensive overview of the evidence predominantly from published randomised, placebo-controlled double blind, clinical trials which have investigated the potential effects of LC-PUFA on neurodevelopmental outcomes in clinical and non-clinical child/adolescent groups thus far. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The development of these updated guidelines was commissioned by the AACE, TOS, and ASMBS Board of Directors and adheres to the AACE 2010 protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Each recommendation was re-evaluated and updated based on the evidence and subjective factors per protocol. Examples of expanded topics in this update include: the roles of sleeve gastrectomy, bariatric surgery in patients with type-2 diabetes, bariatric surgery for patients with mild obesity, copper deficiency, informed consent, and behavioral issues. There are 74 recommendations (of which 56 are revised and 2 are new) in this 2013 update, compared with 164 original recommendations in 2008. There are 403 citations, of which 33 (8.2%) are EL 1, 131 (32.5%) are EL 2, 170 (42.2%) are EL 3, and 69 (17.1%) are EL 4. There is a relatively high proportion (40.4%) of strong (EL 1 and 2) studies, compared with only 16.5% in the 2008 AACE-TOS-ASMBS CPG. These updated guidelines reflect recent additions to the evidence base. Bariatric surgery remains a safe and effective intervention for select patients with obesity. A team approach to perioperative care is mandatory with special attention to nutritional and metabolic issues.

AB  - Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy is a key contributor to offspring diseases that develop in adult life. To explore the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy in primates, we exposed pregnant capuchin monkeys to constant light (eliminating the maternal melatonin rhythm) from the last third of gestation to term. Maternal temperature and activity circadian rhythms were assessed as well as the newborn temperature rhythm. Additionally we studied the effect of daily maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy on these rhythms. Ten pregnant capuchin monkeys were exposed to constant light from 60% of gestation to term. Five received a daily oral dose of melatonin (250 μg kg/body weight) at 1800 h (LL+Mel) and the other five a placebo (LL). Six additional pregnant females were maintained in a 14:10 light:dark cycles and their newborns were used as controls (LD). Rhythms were recorded 96 h before delivery in the mother and at 4-6 days of age in the newborn. Exposure to constant light had no effect on the maternal body temperature rhythm however it delayed the acrophase of the activity rhythm. Neither rhythm was affected by melatonin replacement. In contrast, maternal exposure to constant light affected the newborn body temperature rhythm. This rhythm was entrained in control newborns whereas LL newborns showed a random distribution of the acrophases over 24-h. In addition, mean temperature was decreased (34.0±0.6 vs 36.1±0.2°C, in LL and control, respectively P<0.05). Maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy re-synchronized the acrophases and restored mean temperature to the values in control newborns. Our findings demonstrate that prenatal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the newborn temperature rhythm and supports normal body temperature maintenance. Altogether these prenatal melatonin effects highlight the physiological importance of the maternal melatonin rhythm during pregnancy for the newborn primate. © 2013 Seron-Ferre et al.

AB  - Background: Induction of labour is a common intervention in obstetric practice. Traditionally, in most hospitals induction of labour with medication starts early in the morning, with the start of the working day for the day shift. In human and animal studies spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm with a preference for start of labour in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous labour starts in the evening, the total duration of labour and delivery shortens and fewer obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one might assume that starting induction of labour in the evening, in harmony with the circadian rhythm of natural birth, is more beneficial for both mother and child. Objectives: To assess whether induction of labour starting in the evening, coinciding with the endogenous circadian rhythm, improves the outcome of labour compared with induction of labour starting in the early morning, organised to coincide with office hours. Search methods: We contacted the Trials Search Co-ordinator to search the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to 16 February 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 16 February 2012). Selection criteria: We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We excluded trials that employed quasi-random methods of treatment allocation. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. Main results: The search resulted in 2693 articles that we screened on title and abstract for eligibility.Thirteen studies were selected for full text assessment. We included three randomised trials involving 1150 women. Two trials compared the administration of prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening in women with an unfavourable cervix, and one trial compared induction of labour in the morning versus the evening in women with a favourable cervix and/or ruptured membranes with intravenous oxytocin. Because of the different mechanism, we have reported results for these two comparisons separately. In the two trials comparing prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening there were few clinically significant differences between study groups for maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a statistically significant preference by women to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the morning. In the trial examining induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin, the number of neonatal admissions was statistically significantly increased in the group of women that started induction in the morning. This finding was unexpected, and while the trial authors offered some possible explanations for this, it is important that any future trials examine neonatal outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Taking into account women's preferences that favoured administration of prostaglandins in the morning, we conclude that caregivers should preferably consider administering prostaglandins in the morning. There is no strong evidence that induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is more or less effective than induction in the morning. Consideration may be given to start induction of labour with oxytocin in the evening when indicated. © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - Background & Aims: Maternal undernutrition programs metabolic adaptations which are ultimately detrimental to adult. L-tryptophan supplementation was given to manipulate the long-term sequelae of early-life programming by undernutrition and explore whether cultured cells retain circadian clock dysregulation. Methods: Male rat pups from mothers fed on low protein (8%, LP) or control (18%, CP) diet were given, one hour before light off, an oral bolus of L-tryptophan (125 mg/kg) between Day-12 and Day-21 of age. Body weight, food intake, blood glucose along with the capacity of colonization of primary cells from biopsies were measured during the young (45-55 days) and adult (110-130 days) phases. Circadian clock oscillations were re-induced by a serum shock over 30 hours on near-confluent cell monolayers to follow PERIOD1 and CLOCK proteins by Fluorescent Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (FLISA) and period1 and bmal1 mRNA by RT-PCR. Cell survival in amino acid-free conditions were used to measure circadian expression of MAP-LC3B, MAP-LC3B-FP and Survivin. Results: Tryptophan supplementation did not alter body weight gain nor feeding pattern. By three-way ANOVA of blood glucose, sampling time was found significant during all phases. A significant interaction between daily bolus (Tryptophan, saline) and diets (LP, CP) were found during young (p = 0.0291) and adult (p = 0.0285) phases. In adult phase, the capacity of colonization at seeding of primary cells was twice lower for LP rats. By three-way ANOVA of PERIOD1 perinuclear/nuclear immunoreactivity during young phase, we found a significant effect of diets (p = 0.049), daily bolus (p<0.0001) and synchronizer hours (p = 0.0002). All factors were significantly interacting (p = 0.0148). MAP-LC3B, MAP-LC3B-FP and Survivin were altered according to diets in young phase. Conclusions: Sequelae of early-life undernutrition and the effects of L-tryptophan supplementation can be monitored non-invasively by circadian sampling of blood D-glucose and on the expression of PERIOD1 protein in established primary cell lines. © 2013 Nascimento et al.

AB  - Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) causes burden to the sufferer, the healthcare system and society. Most studies have focused on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) after a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS); however, the overall morbidity prior to an SDB diagnosis has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to identify morbidity prior to a SDB diagnosis to identify patients at risk for having/developing SDB. Methods: Using data from the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2006), we identified all patients nationwide given a diagnosis of OSA (19,438) or OHS (755) in all hospitals and clinics. For each patient, we randomly selected 4 citizens matched for age, sex, and socioeconomic status from the Danish Civil Registration System Statistics. Results: Patients with OSA or OHS presented with increased morbidity at least 3 years prior to their SDB diagnosis. The most common contacts with the health system (odds ratio [OR]/confidence interval [CI]) for OSA/OHS were due to musculoskeletal system (1.36[1.29-1.42]/1.35[1.05-1.74]); CVD (1.38[1.30-1.46]/1.80[1.38-2.34]); endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases (1.62[1.50-1.76]/4.10[2.90-5.78]) ; diseases of the nervous system (1.62[1.0-1.76]/3.54[2.56-4.88]); respiratory system (1.84[1.73-1.96]/2.83[2.07-3.89]); skin and subcutaneous tissue (1.18[1.07-1.30]/2.12[1.33-3.38]); gastrointestinal (1.17[1.10-1.24]/NS); infections (1.20[1.08-1.33]/NS); genitourinary system (1.21[1.13-1.30]/NS); and ear, nose, and throat (1.44[1.32-1.56]/NS). Conclusions: Patients with SDB show significant morbidities several years prior to a diagnosis of OSA or OHS. OSA should be considered in all medical specialties as an important comorbidity. In our study, evidence points to particular emphasis for considering this diagnosis in endocrinology and metabolic specialties.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep. Methods: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen. Results: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS >20 and 100% had a PSQI >5. Hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS. Conclusion: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to determine commonalities and differences in physical conditions and depressive symptoms of Chinese postpartum mothers in the United States and Taiwan, and whether their relationship differs by country. Data from 151 Chinese mothers in the United States and 238 Taiwanese mothers were analyzed. A physical health condition checklist and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale were used. More Taiwanese mothers experienced depression. Depression scores were correlated with physical conditions. Over 50% of mothers with depression experienced physical exhaustion, sleep disturbances, interrupted sleep, and decreases in memory. Active assessments and cultural care for managing physical conditions may prevent postpartum depression. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Rational: Depression is prevalent among women of childbearing age and is frequently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). As some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Flx), can cross the placenta, it is possible that the neurodevelopment of the fetus may be affected, leading to altered behavior in adulthood. Objectives: In this study, we examined the effects of perinatal Flx exposure on the subsequent expression of circadian rhythms in adult mice. Methods: Dams were treated with 25 mg/kg/day Flx in their drinking water from embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 12. Circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed in the offspring starting at 6 weeks of age. Results: We found that perinatal Flx exposure led to larger light-induced phase advances (1.19 ± 0.51 vs. 0.55 ± 0.25 h), smaller phase advances to the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the mid-subjective day (0.44 ± 0.15 vs. 0.70 ± 0.17 h), and a shorter free-running period in constant darkness (23.47 ± 0.13 vs. 23.64 ± 0.13 h). Conclusions: These results suggest that perinatal exposure to SSRIs may have consequences for the functioning of the circadian system later in life. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Aims: Recently a relationship between circadian clock function and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been shown. BMAL1 is a key component of the mammalian molecular clock. Two SNPs in the BMAL1 gene have been identified to confer T2D susceptibility. In the present study we investigated for the first time the association between the BMAL1 gene and the risk for GDM, in a Greek population. Methods: We studied 185 women with GDM and 161 non-diabetic controls for BMAL1 polymorphisms. For BMAL1 mRNA expression, peripheral leukocytes were harvested from 20 GDM and 20 control women, harboring different genotypes for the tested polymorphisms, using real-time quantitative PCR. Results: The minor allele (A) of the BMAL1 rs7950226 (G > A) polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM (P= 0.025). Analysis of the second BMAL1 rs11022775 (T > C) polymorphism, showed that the C-allele frequency was strongly increased in women with GDM (P= 4.455e-06). The CC genotype was also significantly overrepresented in GDM vs. controls (P= 0.00001). Additionally, the rs7950226G/rs11022775C and rs7950226A/rs11022775C haplotypes were also found to be associated with increased susceptibility to GDM. Furthermore, the expression levels of BMAL1 mRNA were significantly lower in GDM patients than in controls. Conclusion: These data suggest that the impairment of the BMAL1 clock gene expression is closely associated with GDM susceptibility. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Although the onset of spontaneous human parturition has long been known to occur preferentially during the nighttime and early morning hours, no convincing physiological explanation for this pattern has yet been proposed. This review focuses on the circadian timing of mammalian parturition, particularly in the human. It is proposed that differences in the phasing of parturition among different species are likely a function of opposite uterine responses to humoral cues, in particular those coding for time of day. The brain hormone melatonin fulfills many of the prerequisites to serve as a circadian signal for initiating uterine contractions that lead to human parturition. These encompass direct actions of melatonin on myometrial smooth muscle cells that are synergistic with oxytocin in facilitating greater uterine contractions at night. This may not only help to explain the nocturnal phasing of human parturition but also open new avenues for the management of term and preterm labor. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - The etiology of preeclampsia (PE) remains unknown. There are many different etiopathogenetic theories that have been proposed. One theory is based on immunologic factors that may be regulated by hormones.The primary objective of the present study was to review the main hormones that may be involved in the PE pathophysiology.The current literature has suggested the involvement of many different hormonal systems in the pathogenesis of PE such as cortisol, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, arginine vasopressin, epinephrine and norepinephrine, natriuretic atrial peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and melatonin.These findings suggest the complexity of the pathophysiology of PE, which involves many different hormonal systems. In conclusion, PE is a systemic disease with all of the aforementioned hormones being involved in the mechanism of systemic arterial hypertension. This consequently plays an important role in the circadian characteristics of the maternal blood pressure in PE.Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physiciansLearning Objectives: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to understand the pathogenesis and pathophysiologic process involved in this disease, improve the treatment of the disease, educate medical students and residents with a better comprehension of the pathophysiologic process of the disease, stimulate new researches to establish the regulations of these hormones all together in the pathophysiologic process of preeclampsia, and develop new methods for screening and prevention preeclampsia based on maternal serum evaluations of hormonal levels. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Diurnal(06:00-19:00)time budgets and activity rhythms for 24 captive Chinese water deer(Hydropotes inermis) (12♀, 12♂) were observed from March to July, 2008 in the Huaxia Park of Pudong, Shanghai using instantaneous scan sampling and all-occurrence recording methods. The behaviors recorded included resting, ruminating, standing, alertness, feeding, moving, auto-grooming, urinating and social behaviors. In both spring and summer, resting was the principal activity of the Chinese water deer, followed by feeding and moving. The diurnal behaviors of the Chinese water deer had a clear rhythm, the active periods were concentrated near dawn (06:00-08:00) and dusk (16:00-18:00). The deer spent significantly more time resting but significantly less time standing, urinating, auto-grooming and moving in summer than they did in the spring (One-way ANOVA analysis and Mann-Whitney U Test). Compared to males females spent significantly more time standing and ruminating, but significantly less time resting, auto-grooming and displaying alertness. As to the females, there were more significant difference in standing, urinating, auto-grooming, moving and social behaviors and significantly difference in feeding between spring and summer. In spring, the females spent more time standing, urinating, auto-grooming and moving than in summer. Females spent more time feeding and on social behaviors because they have high energy pregnancy and post-partum requirements in summer. To the males, resting, feeding, auto-grooming, alerting and social behaviors showed more significantly differences than standing, ruminating, urinating and moving between spring and summer. In spring, they spent more time on feeding, auto-grooming, alerting, standing, ruminating, urinating, moving and social behaviors, except resting. The results indicated that the Hydropotes inermis in the Huaxia Park had time budgets and activity rhythms similar to those of the wild population and the welfare of the deer was well satisfied. We believe that the results will be useful to new management practices and could be the theoretical basis for release to the wild in Shanghai.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted with the aim of studying how dietary fat source, reproductive stage (Exp. 1), and diurnal variation (Exp. 2) affect plasma ketone bodies in sows. In Exp. 1, 40 second-parity sows were fed 1 of 5 lactation diets from 7 d pre-partum until 28 d postpartum, with low or high levels (3% or 8%) of dietary fats with different proportions of medium- and long-chain fatty acids. Blood was obtained by jugular venipuncture on d 3 and 7 prepartum, and d 1, 10, 17, and 28 postpartum, and concentrations of plasma beta-hydroxy butyric acid (BHBA), aceto-acetate + acetone (AcAc+Ac), glucose, NEFA, lactate, acetate, and butyrate were determined. For 4 out of 5 treatments, plasma BHBA decreased slightly, whereas plasma AcAc+Ac remained stable. However, plasma BHBA (P < 0.01) and AcAc+Ac (P < 0.001) doubled after d 10 of lactation in sows fed 4% octanoic acid and 4% fish oil diet (4+4% FO; P < 0.001), compared with earlier in lactation (P < 0.001). Plasma AcAc+Ac was positively related to BHBA (P < 0.01), glucose (P < 0.05), and butyrate (P < 0.001), and negatively related to the acetate:butyrate ratio (P < 0.001). In addition, plasma BHBA was positively related to lactate (P < 0.01), acetate, and butyrate (P < 0.05). In Exp. 2, diurnal variations of plasma metabolites were studied in 5 sows sampled every second hour from a jugular catheter throughout a 24-h period on d 5 and 17 of lactation and analyzed as in Exp. 1. In addition, milk and urine samples were collected and analyzed for BHBA and AcAc+Ac. No diurnal variations in plasma BHBA or AcAc+Ac were observed and plasma AcAc+Ac was unchanged from d 5 to 17 of lactation (3.7 μM), whereas BHBA declined from 58 μM on d 5 of lactation to 52 μM on d 17 of lactation (P < 0.05). Minor amounts of AcAc+Ac were found in urine (8.6 μM) and this was not affected by days in milk, whereas the content of AcAc+Ac in milk and BHBA in milk and urine were less than the detection limit in 4 of 5 sows. In conclusion, dietary fat source affected plasma concentrations of ketone bodies, but the concentrations were much less than normally observed in dairy cows and, therefore, primary ketosis does not appear to be a major problem in sows. In addition, this study indicates that the intermediary metabolism of sows was challenged when sows were exposed to high fat diets in late gestation. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in pregnancy. The cause is multifactorial, including a decreased or transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and gastrointestinal motility disturbances. Aims: Evaluate the incidence of GERD in pregnancy and assess predictors and predisposing factors. Method: This is a secondary analysis of a survey of postpartum women regarding symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and GERD performed at a large tertiary care center. Patients rated heartburn frequency during pregnancy as either never, occasionally/sometimes, or frequently/always. Pregnancy outcomes and newborn information was collected. Categorical variables were compared by Fisher's exact test and continuous variables were compared by Anova or Kruskal-Wallis test. Multinominal logistic regression was also performed. Results: Information regarding 1000 mothers and 1025 newborns was reviewed. The majority of mothers were Caucasian (68.8%) with mean age 29±6.1. years. A total of 56.7% had GERD frequently/always; and 25.5% had none. GERD symptoms correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), BMI at delivery, maternal age, smoking and symptoms of SDB. There was no significant correlation between fetal weight and maternal weight gain with GERD symptoms. Symptoms were more frequent in white non-Hispanic women than in other racial groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that GERD symptoms correlate with pre-pregnancy BMI and BMI at delivery, but not with the amount of weight gain during pregnancy. Maternal age, smoking, race, and SDB are also associated with GERD. Interestingly, fetal weight/uterine size did not seem predictive of developing GERD in pregnancy. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common chronic sensory-motor neurological disorder that remains a clinical diagnosis. Most RLS patients present with sleep complaints in the form of initiation and/or maintenance insomnia as RLS has a circadian rhythmicity. An increased number of periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) is a supportive criterion in the diagnosis of RLS. Abnormalities in the central dopaminergic and iron systems are involved in the physiopathology of RLS. There is a higher prevalence of RLS and PLMS in sleep-disordered breathing patients, particularly those with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the most common sleep disorder in western societies. The complex mechanisms underlying the association between OSA, RLS and PLMS remain unclear. Untreated OSA can lead to adverse cardiovascular consequences due to cardio-metabolic dysfunction. It remains controversial whether RLS could further adversely impact the cardiovascular consequences of OSA. The PLMS do not have an additive effect on the hypersomnia experienced by some sleep-disordered breathing patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective therapy for OSA. The presence of PLMS during CPAP treatment could be a marker of an incomplete resolution of sleep-disordered breathing in the form of increased upper airway resistance syndrome, despite treatment. Dopaminergic agonists are the preferred agent for the treatment of RLS, and are indicated when RLS symptoms are frequent and affect quality of life. PLMS and RLS do not seem to contribute to the residual hypersomnia that can be observed in some sleep-disordered breathing patients despite adequate compliance and effective CPAP therapy. © 2012 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.

AB  - Background: Women with a history of sexual assault are at increased risk for sleep difficulties and depression in their first year of motherhood. Breastfeeding improves sleep parameters and lowers risk of depression for women in general. However, it is unknown whether breastfeeding is related to maternal depression, sleep quality, and maternal well-being in sexual assault survivors. We examined the association between sexual assault and several indices of sleep, depression, and maternal well-being in a large sample of sexual assault survivors in the first year postpartum. We also explored whether feeding method was related to our outcome variables for both sexually assaulted and non-assaulted women. Subjects and Methods: A sample of 6,410 mothers of infants 0-12 months old participated in the online Survey of Mothers' Sleep and Fatigue; 994 women had a history of sexual assault. Results: As predicted, women with a history of sexual assault had a number of sleep difficulties, increased risk of depression, and overall poorer subjective well-being than their non-assaulted counterparts. However, sexual assault survivors who were breastfeeding were at lower risk on all of the sleep and depression parameters than sexual assault survivors who were mixed or formula feeding. Conclusions: Sexual assault has a pervasive negative effect on new mothers' sleep quality and risk of depression. However, these negative effects were less severe for the breastfeeding mothers than they were for the mixed- or formula-feeding mothers. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not always been assessed. Aims: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy. Study design: Exposed and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and neurobehavioral factors and exposure status. Subjects: 67 infants (61 controls and 6 exposed to SRIs). Outcome measures: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale, APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference. Results: Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development, lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to unexposed infants. Conclusion: Results of this study show differences in autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness. Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and unexposed infants of depressed mothers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Children and adolescents with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at high-risk for developing sleep problems (SPs) triggering daytime behavioral co-morbidities such as inattention, hyperactivity, and cognitive and emotional impairments. However, symptoms of sleep deprivation are solely associated with typical daytime diagnosis, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and treated with psychotropic medications. To understand how and why SPs are missed, we conducted qualitative interviews (QIs) with six parents and seven health care professionals (HCPs), and performed comprehensive clinical sleep assessments (CCSAs) in 27 patients together with their caregivers referred to our clinic for unresolved SPs. We used narrative schema and therapeutic emplotment in conjunction with analyzes of medical records to appropriately diagnose SPs and develop treatment strategies. The research was conducted at British Columbia Children's Hospital in Vancouver (Canada) between 2008 and 2011. In the QIs, parents and HCPs exhibited awareness of the significance of SPs and the effects of an SP on the daytime behaviors of the child and the associated burdens on the parents. HCPs' systemic inattention to the sequelae of SPs and the affected family's wellbeing appears due to an insufficient understanding of the various factors that contribute to nighttime SPs and their daytime sequelae. In the CCSAs, we found that the diagnostic recognition of chronic SPs in children and adolescents was impaired by the exclusive focus on daytime presentations. Daytime behavioral and emotional problems were targets of pharmacological treatment rather than the underlying SP. Consequently, SPs were also targeted with medications, without investigating the underlying problem. Our study highlights deficits in the diagnostic recognition of chronic SPs among children with chronic neurodevelopmental disorders/disabilities and proposes a clinical practice strategy, based on therapeutic emplotment that incorporates patients and parents' contributions in recognizing SPs and related sequelae in designing appropriate treatment and care. © 2012 .

AB  - Background: The modern phenomenon of delayed parenthood applies not only to women but also to men, but less is known about what characterises men who are expecting their first child at an advanced age. This study investigates the sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviour, health problems, social relationships and timing of pregnancy in older first-time fathers.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 14 832 men who were expecting their first child, based on data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) carried out by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Data were collected in 2005-2008 by means of a questionnaire in gestational week 17-18 of their partner's pregnancy, and from the Norwegian Medical Birth Register. The distribution of background variables was investigated across the age span of 25 years and above. Men of advanced age (35-39 years) and very advanced age (40 years or more) were compared with men aged 25-34 years by means of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.Results: The following factors were found to be associated with having the first child at an advanced or very advanced age: being unmarried or non-cohabitant, negative health behaviour (overweight, obesity, smoking, frequent alcohol intake), physical and mental health problems (lower back pain, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, sleeping problems, previous depressive symptoms), few social contacts and dissatisfaction with partner relationship. There were mixed associations for socioeconomic status: several proxy measures of high socioeconomic status (e.g. income >65 000 €, self-employment) were associated with having the first child at an advanced or very advanced age, as were several other proxy measures of low socioeconomic status (e.g. unemployment, low level of education, immigrant background).The odds of the child being conceived after in vitro fertilisation were threefold in men aged 34-39 and fourfold from 40 years and above.Conclusions: Men who expect their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age constitute a socioeconomically heterogeneous group with more health problems and more risky health behaviour than younger men. Since older men often have their first child with a woman of advanced age, in whom similar characteristics have been reported, their combined risk of adverse perinatal outcomes needs further attention by clinicians and researchers. © 2013 Nilsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Induction of labour (IOL) is one of the commonest obstetric interventions, with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery. Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.Methods: Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.Results: OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).Conclusions: OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246. © 2013 Henry et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy may impair glucose mechanism. This study aimed to examine associations of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep, and nap duration with 1-h glucose challenge test (GCT) levels in pregnant women after controlling for known risk factors for gestational diabetes. Method:s This is a case-control study of 104 pregnant women. All women underwent full polysomnography and a GCT and completed the multivariable apnea prediction and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality indexes. The primary outcome was maternal hyperglycemia measured by GCT. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: Over 13 % subjects reported habitual snoring in the first trimester. Only 9.3 % women with normoglycemia (GCT<135) were habitual snorers, whereas 45.5 % women with hyperglycemia (GCT≥135) had habitual snoring (p< 0.001). Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (loud snoring, snorting/gasping, and apneas) (odds ratio (OR) 2.85; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.50-5.41; p=0.001) and total nap duration (OR 1.48; 95 % CI 0.96-2.28; p=0.08) were associated with hyperglycemia. After adjusting for confounders, sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (OR 3.37; 95 % CI 1.44-8.32; p=0.005) and nap duration (OR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.00-2.681.02; p=0.05) continued to be associated with hyperglycemia. However, the primary exposure measure, the apnea/hypopnea index in the first trimester was not significantly associated with hyperglycemia (OR 1.03; 95 % CI 0.83-1.28; p=0.77). Conclusion:s Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms and nap duration are associated with hyperglycemia. Sleep duration was not associated with hyperglycemia. Research is needed concerning whether women with sleep-disordered breathing and/or daytime napping are at risk for gestational diabetes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - According to the Barker hypothesis, the period of pregnancy and the intrauterine environment are crucial to the tendency to develop diseases like hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, metabolic disorders, pulmonary, renal and mental illnesses. The external environment affects the development of a particular phenotype suitable for an environment with characteristics that closely resemble intrauterine conditions. If the extra-uterine environment differs greatly from the intra-uterine one, the fetus is more prone to develop disease. Subsequent studies have shown that maternal diseases like depression and anxiety, epilepsy, asthma, anemia and metabolic disorders, like diabetes, are able to determine alterations in growth and fetal development. Similarly, the maternal lifestyle, particularly diet, exercise and smoking during pregnancy, have an important role in determining the risk to develop diseases that manifest themselves both during childhood and particularly in adulthood. Finally, there are abundant potential sources of pollutants, both indoor and outdoor, in the environment in which the child lives, which can contribute to an increased probability to the development of several diseases and that in some cases could be easily avoided. © 2013 Capra et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Normal sleep quality and quantity are necessary for optimal functioning and emotional and physical well being. Sleep problems associated with systemic disorders frequently disrupt initiation and maintenance of sleep, or cause symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness or parasomnia behavior. Restless legs may result from iron deficiency, renal insufficiency, or pregnancy. Sleep-disordered breathing is frequently caused by cardiac and pulmonary disorders, and cancer and chronic pain disorders frequently disrupt sleep, resulting in insomnia and symptoms of fatigue and daytime sleepiness. This chapter reviews sleep-related symptoms and disorders associated with systemic disorders involving endocrine, pain, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, oncologic, and paraneoplastic, infectious, critical illness, and drug and toxin exposure, and discusses appropriate diagnostic evaluation and treatment approaches to sleep disorders in patients with systemic disease. Recognition of the frequency and morbidity of sleep disorders is growing, and comprehensive care of neurological patients requires that practitioners consider and address disordered sleep in their patients. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Women with epilepsy face many challenges with childbearing and child-rearing, and the postpartum period is a particularly vulnerable time due to medication changes, altered sleeping patterns, increased psychosocial stressors, and breastfeeding. Having a newborn often leads to sleep deprivation, a known seizure risk, and the stress associated with a new child, particularly if finances are limited, pose a challenge to many mothers. Breastfeeding for many mothers is a struggle, but in women with epilepsy the concerns over antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in breast milk, the potential adverse effects of further AED exposure through breast milk, and the sleep disruption associated with breastfeeding leaves some women with epilepsy not breastfeeding. Postpartum depression is seen in nearly 15% of all women, and is increased in women with epilepsy. Newborn safety is often overlooked in educating patients but is of major concern to women with epilepsy. This chapter addressed the issues women with epilepsy face in the postpartum period. © John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Physical symptoms are common in pregnancy and are predominantly associated with normal physiological changes. These symptoms have a social and economic cost, leading to absenteeism from work and additional medical interventions. There is currently no simple method for identifying common pregnancy related problems in the antenatal period. A validated tool, for use by pregnancy care providers would be useful. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory for use by health professionals. Methods: A list of symptoms was generated via expert consultation with health professionals. Focus groups were conducted with pregnant women. The inventory was tested for face validity and piloted for readability and comprehension. For test-re-test reliability, the tool was administered to the same women 2 to 3 days apart. Finally, midwives trialled the inventory for 1 month and rated its usefulness on a 10cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: A 41-item Likert inventory assessing how often symptoms occurred and what effect they had, was developed. Individual item test re-test reliability was between .51 to 1, the majority (34 items) scoring ≥0.70. The top four " often" reported symptoms were urinary frequency (52.2%), tiredness (45.5%), poor sleep (27.5%) and back pain (19.5%). Among the women surveyed, 16.2% claimed to sometimes or often be incontinent. Referrals to the incontinence nurse increased > 8 fold during the study period. Conclusions: The PSI provides a comprehensive inventory of pregnancy related symptoms, with a mechanism for assessing their effect on function. It was robustly developed, with good test re-test reliability, face validity, comprehension and readability. This provides a validated tool for assessing the impact of interventions in pregnancy. © 2013 Foxcroft et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Disrupting maternal circadian rhythms through exposure to chronic phase shifts of the photoperiod has lifelong consequences for the metabolic homeostasis of the fetus, such that offspring develop increased adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia and poor glucose and insulin tolerance. In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by which these poor metabolic outcomes arise, we investigated the impact of chronic phase shifts (CPS) on maternal and fetal hormonal, metabolic and circadian rhythms. We assessed weight gain and food consumption of dams exposed to either CPS or control lighting conditions throughout gestation. At day 20, dams were assessed for plasma hormone and metabolite concentrations and glucose and insulin tolerance. Additionally, the expression of a range of circadian and metabolic genes was assessed in maternal, placental and fetal tissue. Control and CPS dams consumed the same amount of food, yet CPS dams gained 70% less weight during the first week of gestation. At day 20, CPS dams had reduced retroperitoneal fat pad weight (-15%), and time-of-day dependent decreases in liver weight, whereas fetal and placental weight was not affected. Melatonin secretion was not altered, yet the timing of corticosterone, leptin, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations were profoundly disrupted. The expression of gluconeogenic and circadian clock genes in maternal and fetal liver became either arrhythmic or were in antiphase to the controls. These results demonstrate that disruptions of the photoperiod can severely disrupt normal circadian profiles of plasma hormones and metabolites, as well as gene expression in maternal and fetal tissues. Disruptions in the timing of food consumption and the downstream metabolic processes required to utilise that food, may lead to reduced efficiency of growth such that maternal weight gain is reduced during early embryonic development. It is these perturbations that may contribute to the programming of poor metabolic homeostasis in the offspring. © 2013 Varcoe et al.

AB  - Objective: The aims of this study were to systematically identify and summarize the literature examining the impact of physiologic and psychologic triggers on spasticity and discuss the evidence supporting various types of triggers. Design: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases were searched using specific keyword combinations. Only studies using clinical tests or self-reports of spasticity were included. Results: A total of 1152 articles were scanned for relevance, and of 44 relevant articles, 24 were reviewed. Pregnancy, posture, cold, circadian rhythm, and skin conditions increased spasticity and were measured using objective clinical tests. Self-reports of spasticity suggest that triggers such as bowel- and bladder-related issues, menstrual cycle, mental stress, and tight clothing can all increase spasticity. No literature evidence of increase in spasticity in response to heterotopic ossification, hemorrhoids, deep vein thrombosis, fever, and sleep patterns was found. Conclusions: Although self-reports indicate a strong possibility of increasing spasticity, without objective examination, the true effects of these triggers on spasticity remain inconclusive. Most studies reviewed here were performed in the spinal cord injury population; therefore, it is not known whether these triggers induce similar effects in persons with other neurologic etiologies.

AB  - Background: In the rodent and human fetus, a diurnal cortisol rhythm is observed that is entrained in antiphase to the maternal rhythm. However, after birth, the adrenal circadian rhythm becomes unsynchronized with the clock time, and an adult-type, 24-h rhythm is observed only after a few months. Little is known about when and how the fetal adrenal circadian rhythm is synchronized with the day-night cycle. Methods: To investigate the function of adrenal circadian clock in the newborn infant, eight serial saliva samples were collected every 3 h over 24 h (starting at 0900 h) in 27 newborn infants. Results: Cortisol levels were higher during the period 1500 to earlier than 2100 h than during 0900 to earlier than 1500 h and 0300 to earlier than 0900 h (both P < 0.05). Salivary cortisol levels collected during 0 to <6, 6 to <12, and 12 to <18 hours after the clock time at birth (birth time) were higher than those collected during 18 to <24 hours after the birth time (P < 0.005, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively). The acrophase of salivary cortisol was linearly correlated with the birth time within the first 5 d of life (P < 0.005) but not thereafter. Conclusion: In the newborn infant, diurnal increase in cortisol was observed in the late afternoon and in correspondence with the birth time. The adrenal circadian rhythm acquired in utero may be reentrained by endocrinological events at birth. Such complex regulation of the adrenal circadian clock may inhibit a swift synchronization of the circadian clock to the day-night rhythm. Copyright © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Daily rhythms in behavior and physiology are programmed by a hierarchical collection of biological clocks located throughout the brain and body, known as the circadian system. Mounting evidence indicates that disruption of circadian regulation is associated with a wide variety of adverse health consequences, including increased risk for premature death, cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular dysfunction, immune dysregulation, reproductive problems, mood disorders, and learning deficits. Here we review the evidence for the pervasive effects of circadian disruption in humans and animal models, drawing from both environmental and genetic studies, and identify questions for future research. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Effect of ischemia of the uterine artery supplying with blood the main rhythmogenic zone (the ovarian region) of the uterine horn on parameters of activity both of this locus and of all subsequent pacemaker areas up to the uterine cervix was studied in non-pregnant rats. The most pronounced changes in characteristics of the activity (amplitude, frequency, and burst genesis duration) were revealed in the ovarian horn end. The uterine corpus and the horn cervical end were less affected by ischemia. Meanwhile, under these conditions, amplitude of the slow-wave oscillations rose more than 1.5 times. The obtained data allow us to conclude about the presence of a certain connection between the horn ovarian end and the uterine cervix. Morphological studies have revealed strong vascularization of the upper part of uterine horn.

AB  - In normal physiology, fatigue may be weakness (or weariness) from repeated exertion or a decreased response of cells, tissues, or organs after excessive stimulation or activity. Sleepiness plays a major role in nonpathological forms of mental fatigue. A thorough sleep history is an essential part of any fatigue risk-management program. Increasingly sophisticated computerized detection, monitoring, and surveillance systems provide the opportunity to help engineer new solutions to old problems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In developed countries, rising rates of union disruption have induced an increase in the share of people experiencing several fertile partnerships during their fertile life-span. However, from the large-scale 1999 French Family Survey, in the 1939-1954 birth cohorts it appears that completed fertility of repartnered men is slightly higher than that of never-separated men while repartnered women have fertility levels similar to those who remain in a first intact partnership. Following this observation, this article aims to study whether people, and especially women, have enough time to have children in the context of second union before they become limited by the "biological clock". Using a cure model, we find that once age-related sterility is controlled for, the decrease in risk of having children with age is not visible anymore up to age 40. This offers some evidence that people in their second partnership, especially women, are constrained in their childbearing by the decline in fecundity with age. Additionally, childless women seem to respond proactively to the decline in fecundity with age by accelerating childbearing. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Insomnia is a common condition which includes trouble falling, or staying, asleep. This condition can range from being mild to severe, depending on how often it occurs, and for how long. The main focus of treatment for insomnia should be directed towards finding the underlying cause. Once a cause is identified, it is important to manage and control the underlying problem, as this alone may be able to eliminate the insomnia. Treating the symptoms of insomnia, without addressing the underlying cause, is rarely successful. In the majority of cases, chronic insomnia can be resolved if its medical or psychiatric causes are identified, and treated appropriately. © Medpharm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the effect of chronic melatonin treatment on human reproductive function. We report here on the effect of 10 months treatment with a controlled-release melatonin preparation (Circadin, 2 mg) on spermatogenesis and gonadotropic hormone status in a pinealectomised patient whose melatonin secretion was abolished. METHODS: Semen analysis, hormone (Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), inhibin B, prolactin, testosterone and estradiol) and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHB G) concentrations were determined before and at the end of 4 and 10 months of, treatment. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, prolactin and inhibin B levels did not display significant variation with time, whereas FSH and LH levels showed a tendency to a decrease, but remained in the normal range. Sperm concentration and total spermatozoa count dropped below the lower limit of the reference range during melatonin treatment, whereas motility and normal form percentages remained in the normal range. Fertility was preserved, since the patients wife became pregnant during month 10 of melatonin treatment and gave birth to a healthy female baby. CONCLUSIONS: this isolated clinical observation shows that more investigations in large patient series are needed to document possible side-effects of melatonin administration on male reproductive function. One.should therefore be cautious about melatonin prescription for circadian rhythm sleep disorders in young males. ©2013 Neuroendocrmoloqy Letters.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the diurnal fluctuation of salivary cortisol and its overall diurnal secretion are associated with the length of gestation in patients who were admitted to the hospital with an assigned diagnosis of possible preterm labor (PL) at a gestational age of 28-33 weeks. Methods: In 22 patients, maternal saliva samples were collected for a cortisol assay 4 times per day (8 AM, 12 AM, 4 PM and 8 PM) on day 4 and day 6 after antenatal corticosteroid prophylaxis to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Results: Eight patients who ultimately delivered before term (32.6 ± 1.7 gestation weeks) showed an inverted fluctuation of salivary cortisol on both days 4 and 6, morning cortisol levels being significantly lower than evening levels. In contrast, in 14 patients who delivered at term (39.5 ± 0.6 gestation weeks), the physiological diurnal fluctuation of salivary cortisol was maintained. In addition, a distinctive feature of women delivering before term was a significantly hampered salivary cortisol diurnal production measured on day 6. Conclusions: Corticoadrenal activity is dysregulated and anticipates very preterm delivery in women with an assigned diagnosis of possible PL. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

The TT genotype or T allele of angiotensinogen M235T gene polymorphism is associated with the risk of preeclampsia. Plasma renin activity signifi cantly decreases under conditions of preeclampsia. The TT genotype of angiotensin M235T gene polymorphism is associated with highest renin activity and highest 24-h diastolic BP in comparison with MT and MM genotypes in patients with preeclampsia. Plasma aldosterone level is lower in patients with preeclampsia, but this is not related to angiotensinogen M235T gene polymorphism. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes. METHODS: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168) at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events. RESULTS: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (<7 hours) was associated with higher interleukin (IL)-8 across time (β = 0.506, p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (<85%) was associated with higher IL-6 (β = 0.205, p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor α (β = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values <.053). Among depressed women, interferon-γ increased risk for preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.175, p = .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (β = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-γ and lower birth weight (β = -19.92, p < .069), and increased IL-8 and babies weighing less than 4000 grams (odds ratio = 0.72, p < .083) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships. Copyright © 2013 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

AB  - Objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is related with cardiovascular risk factors. Non-dipping blood pressure pattern and high mean platelet volume, which is an indicator of increased platelet activation, are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study is to determine circadian variation of blood pressure and to study the impact of hematological indices on blood pressure dipping and non-dipping patterns in patient with GDM. Material and methods: A total of 42 patients who were diagnosed with GDM and 33 patients with healthy pregnancies were included into the study. Patients' blood pressures were monitored and were grouped due to their blood pressure circadian pattern. If the blood pressure while sleeping decreased more than 10% from the blood pressure while awake, the patient was classified as a "dipper". If the decrease was less than 10%, the patient was classified as a "non-dipper". Biochemical and hematological parameters were measured and clinical features were recorded for all study groups. Results: Ambulatory blood pressures monitoring of two groups revealed that average systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as the day-phase diastolic and night-phase systolic and diastolic blood pressures of GDM patients were significantly increased than those of the control group. Besides, control patients had a more significant decrease in night-phase systolic and diastolic blood pressures than GDM patients (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between hematological indices and dipping status, except for mean platelet volume (MPV). MPV in non-dippers was significantly higher than dippers one (p<0.001). Step-wise multivariate linear regression demonstrated that MPV and GDM can be used as independent predictors of non-dipping status. Conclusion: According to our results the circadian variation of blood pressure is impaired and MPV is increased in GDM patients. Increasing in MPV is associated with non-dipping status of blood pressure. It is possible that non-dipping status and increased MPV levels may be additional risk factors for increased cardiovascular disease events in gestational diabetes patients.

AB  - Background: The methylation status of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 in newborns has been reported to be sensitive to prenatal maternal mood. This study investigates both the association between maternal cortisol and emotional state during pregnancy and the methylation state of the promoter region of NR3C1 gene. Methods: We examined 83 pregnant women. Psychological data and diurnal cortisol data were assessed to evaluate maternal stress once each trimester. DNA methylation at different loci of the NR3C1 gene, including exon 1B, 1D and 1F, was analyzed in genomic DNA from cord blood mononuclear cells. Results: Univariable analyses indicated pregnancy related anxiety to be the strongest psychological parameter throughout pregnancy. Most significant findings concerned 1F. Particularly the methylation state of CpG9 was significantly associated with maternal emotional wellbeing. In a multivariable model the proportion of variance in methylation state of F9 explained (PVE) by pregnancy related anxiety was 7.8% (p=0.023) during T1.Furthermore different CpG-units located at the nerve growth factor inducible protein A (NGFI-A) binding sites of 1F were associated with maternal anxiety [(F20.21: PC PRAQ and fear of integrity in T1: respectively PVE:8.9% and PVE:9.0%; Fear of delivery T2: PVE:8.0%, Fear of integrity T2: PVE:6.0% and STAI T2: PVE:5.9%) - (F12.13: PC PRAQ T1: PVE:6.9%, fear of integrity T2: PVE:6.0% and fear of delivery T2: PVE:8.0%)] and cortisol (F38.39: PVE:8.9%) in T2. Conclusion: These data indicate that prenatal maternal emotional state, particularly pregnancy related anxiety, are associated with the methylation state of the NR3C1 gene in the child. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The regulation of blastocyst implantation in the uterus is orchestrated by the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones act via their nuclear receptors to direct the transcriptional activity of the endometrial compartments and create a defined period in which the uterus is permissive to embryo implantation termed the "window of receptivity". Additional members of the nuclear receptor family have also been described to have a potential role in endometrial function. Much of what we know about the function of these nuclear receptors during implantation we have learned from the use of mouse models. Transgenic murine models with targeted gene ablation have allowed us to identify a complex network of paracrine signaling between the endometrial epithelium and stroma. While some of the critical molecules have been identified, the mechanism underlying the intricate communication between endometrial compartments during the implantation window has not been fully elucidated. Defining this mechanism will help identify markers of a receptive uterine environment, ultimately providing a useful tool to help improve the fertility outlook for reproductively challenged couples. The aim of this review is to outline our current understanding of how nuclear receptors and their effector molecules regulate blastocyst implantation in the endometrium. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To assess the current state of knowledge regarding sleep disorders and their relationship to obstetric outcomes. Study Design A systematic literature review of the previous two decades (1991 to 2010) was conducted. The exposure was sleep disorders during pregnancy, and the outcomes of interest were feto-infant morbidity and maternal complications. Results Sleep apnea, snoring, and sleep quantity/duration were identified as the most frequently examined sleep disorders among pregnant women. Although our review found that studies examining the impact of sleep disorders on feto-infant outcomes were lacking, previous research indicates that such disorders may enhance the risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the current body of evidence suggests that sleep disorders adversely impact maternal health, increasing the likelihood of preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Conclusion Existing research points to the potentially harmful effects of sleep disorders on obstetric outcomes. The limited research in this arena highlights the need for further studies regarding the nature and strength of this relationship. Given the multiple dimensions of sleep and pregnancy, multivariate research approaches that incorporate biological and psychosocial factors are warranted.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to induce fetal brain growth deficits at different embryonic stages. We focused this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis at midgestation using activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)-9, a peptide (SALLRSIPA) derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, and NAP, a peptide (NAPVSIPQ) derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein. We used an established fetal alcohol exposure mouse model. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) group with 25 % (4.49 %, v/v) ethanol-derived calories, (2) pair-fed (PF) control group, (3) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9) group, (4) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of NAP (ALC/NAP) group, (5) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of ADNF-9 (PF/ADNF-9) group, and (6) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of NAP (PF/NAP) group. On day 15 (E15), fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ADNF-9 or NAP was administered daily from E7 to E15 alongside PF or ALC liquid diet exposure. Our results show that NAP and ADNF-9 significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of fetal brains. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP or ADNF-9 administration alongside alcohol exposure significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium of the cingulate cortex and ganglionic eminence. These findings may pave the path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during pregnancy stages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are prevalent due to physical and hormonal changes. Insufficient sleep causes metabolic and neuroendocrine alterations that may contribute to impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. There is little information about association between insufficient sleep and glucose metabolism during pregnancy. So, this study was done to investigate the relationship between sleep duration and results of glucose challenge test in pregnancy. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 177 pregnant women who referred to Iran, Mashhad health center n:3 in 2012. Participants were selected through available sampling method. All participants completed demographic questionnaire, depression, anxiety, stress scale 21 and Pittsburgh sleep quality index during 26-30 weeks of their pregnancy, then they undergo glucose challenge test. Short sleep duration was defined as less than 7 hours of sleep per night. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 11.5 and Pearson correlation test, Mann-whitney, independent t test and chi-square tests. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: 87 women (49.2%) had short sleep duration. Variables such as stress, anxiety, diet and exercise had no significant differences between two groups (p>0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between sleep duration and results of glucose challenge test (r=-0.19, p=0.01). Impaired glucose challenge test was significantly more prevalent in participants with short sleep duration (p=0.01). Conclusion: Short sleep duration is associated with impaired glucose metabolism in pregnancy and health care providers are advised to screen for sleep duration and quality.

AB  - Purpose: The sleep disorder in pregnant women remains unfamiliar to perinatal care providers, resulting in lack of appropriate care. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women and to identify the associated risk factors. Method:s Married pregnant women were enrolled from their first trimester and followed up until delivery. Nonpregnant married healthy women were selected as controls. A survey questionnaire was administered to each of them. Results: We successfully performed a survey to 1,993 pregnant women and 598 nonpregnant women. The overall prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women was significantly higher than the controls (56.1 vs. 29.9 %, P< 0.05). There was higher prevalence of snoring (30.2 %), observed sleep apnea (1.1 %), mouth breathing (23.7 %), nocturnal arousal (46.5 %), insomnia (35.1 %), and daytime sleepiness (52.6 %) in pregnant women. There were no significant differences of the prevalence of bruxism (7.0 vs. 6.7 %), sleep talking (8.1 vs. 7.2%), and sleep walking (0.4 vs. 0.2%) between the two groups (P>0.05). Nocturnal sleep time (8.0± 1.3 h) was less in the third trimester compared with the nonpregnant women (8.2±1.1 h) (P<0.05). Smoking (OR03.39), drinking (OR02.40), allergic rhinitis/asthma (OR01.71), an obvious difference in neck circumference (OR01.11), andwaistline (OR01.07) changes between the first and third trimesters were the risk factors for sleep disorder-related problems. Conclusion:s There is a high prevalence of sleep disorderrelated symptoms in pregnant women. Our data may provide a baseline for prevention and treatment of sleep disturbances in pregnant women. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Objective To assess sleep practices, and investigate their relationship with maternal and fetal outcomes, among pregnant Ghanaian women. Methods In a cross-sectional study conducted at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana, between June and July 2011, postpartum women were interviewed within 48 hours of delivery about sleep quality and practices during pregnancy. Interviews were coupled with a systematic review of participants' medical charts for key outcomes including maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Results Most women reported poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Snoring during pregnancy was independently associated with pre-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.5; P = 0.007). The newborns of women who reported supine sleep during pregnancy were at increased risk of low birth weight (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-20.2; P = 0.025) and stillbirth (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.5-43.2; P = 0.016). Low birth weight was found to mediate the relationship between supine sleep and stillbirth. Conclusion The present findings in an African population demonstrate that maternal sleep, a modifiable risk factor, has a significant role in pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, and subsequently stillbirth. © 2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - Study Objectives: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. Design, Setting, and Participants: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP. Intervention: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure. Measurements and Results: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). Conclusions: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

AB  - Objective To investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and to evaluate factors associated with RLS in a population of Iranian pregnant women. Methods In the present cross-sectional study, 443 consecutive pregnant women admitted for delivery underwent an interview within 2 days of parturition. The diagnosis of RLS was established by the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The severity of RLS was assessed through the IRLSSG Rating Scale. Results Seventy-nine (17.8%) women met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with most (74.7%) having RLS of moderate severity. The mean RLS duration before delivery was 3.1 ± 2.1 months among 69 (87.3%) women; 10 (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Sleep disturbances including insomnia and early awakening were significantly more common among women with RLS than among those without (P < 0.001), and the frequency of cesarean delivery was also significantly higher (58.2% versus 44.5%, P = 0.027; odds ratio 2.4). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, number of pregnancies, folate and iron supplementation, hemoglobin level, and neonatal anthropometric data. Conclusion Restless legs syndrome is common during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep and an increased risk of cesarean delivery.

AB  - Mastocytosis is a rare disorder caused by the proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in various organs. It has a broad variety of clinical manifestations, including cardiovascular collapse. Diverse stimuli trigger the release of vasoactive substances and parturients with systemic mastocytosis are at high risk for precipitating mast cell degranulation. As a result, women with systemic mastocytosis should have an anaesthetic plan for labour and delivery. Anxiety, stress, sleep deprivation, pain and numerous pharmacological agents are all triggers for mast cell degranulation. For pain relief in labour, epidural analgesia is recommended. Pharmacological agents with a high potential for triggering mast cell degranulation should be avoided. This is particularly important in the case of an emergency caesarean section. Resuscitation equipment must be available should life-threatening haemodynamic instability occur during surgery. We report the case of a pregnant woman with systemic mastocytosis who required emergency caesarean section. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For many psychiatric illnesses, the onset of symptoms begins during the late teens to the early thirties [1]. This is especially concerning in women as it coincides with the childbearing years. Pregnancy was once thought to be protective from psychiatric illness. However, as the recent explosion of literature addressing the safety of psychotropic agents in pregnancy illustrates, the puerperal period is not exempt from mental illness [2–4]. The presence of mental illness in pregnancy is associated with poor compliance with prenatal care; increased tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substance use; inadequate maternal nutrition; poor mother–infant bonding; and disruption of the home environment [5]. While the diagnostic criteria are the same as in non-pregnant patients, many symptoms common in mental illness, such as fatigue, low energy, and disrupted sleep, are also normal for pregnancy [6]. Medication treatment is a controversial issue: in the case of the pregnant patient, there are at least two (or more!) patients, mother and unborn child, and many of the treatments available to address mental illness can potentially harm the fetus [3]. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - Background: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders. Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population. Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women's Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS. Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach's alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1. α= 754; Factor 2. α= 524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established. Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim: To describe the prevalence of paediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms in extremely low gestational age infants and identify neonatal risk factors, including early exposure to hypoxia and hyperoxia. Methods Patients: &lt;28weeks gestation were monitored with high-resolution pulse oximetry. Hypoxia/hyperoxia variables were defined as percentage time of first 4weeks of life that SaO2&lt;80% or SaO2&gt;98%, respectively. Parents completed part of the OSA-18 questionnaire for symptoms of SDB at 18-22months. Logistic regression was used to test the association between risk factors and sleep symptoms. Results: Of 182 patients recruited, 138 (76%) completed the questionnaire. The mean gestation was 26weeks, and mean birth weight 887 grams. Loud snoring (21%) and restless sleep (24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of loud snoring (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.13-6.5). Prolonged mechanical ventilation, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged caffeine use, however, were inversely correlated with loud snoring. Neither neonatal hypoxia nor hyperoxia were associated with sleep symptoms. Conclusions: While the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms is similar to reported rates, we found a sex difference not previously reported. Interestingly, markers for severity of illness show a pattern of being protective against loud snoring. © 2012 The Author(s)/Acta Pædiatrica.

AB  - Itching is a common complaint in pregnancy, occurring in up to 14 to 23% of women. Pruritus may be so severe that it affects sleep and quality of life. It has a prevalence of 0.7 to 5% in different populations.1 Prevalence is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and varies between populations worldwide. In Chile, 2.4% of all pregnancies are affected with a 5% prevalence in women of Araucanian-Indian origin.1 Obstetric cholestasis (OC) (also referred to as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy) is a multifactorial condition of pregnancy characterized by pruritus in the absence of a skin rash with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), neither of which has an alternative cause and both of which resolve after delivery.2 Investigations to exclude other causes of pruritus and of abnormal LFTs should be performed. Obstetric cholestasis has a potential for fetal risks, which may include spontaneous preterm birth, iatrogenic preterm birth and fetal death. Intense pruritus causes. Maternal morbidity and sleep deprivation. An interdisciplinary management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy by dermatologists, hepatologists, gynecologists and pediatricians is absolutely mandatory.

AB  - A 31-year old pregnant female complained skin itching and sleep disturbance at 14 weeks of her second pregnancy. At 20 weeks of the pregnancy, jaundice was noted and she was admitted to our hospital. Despite of intensive examination, including assays for viral infections and auto-antibodies such as anti-nuclear antibody, etiology of the jaundice-causing hepatitis was not determined. Since hepatoprotective therapies did not improve her liver function or fetal ascites diagnosed by ultrasonography, termination of pregnancy was performed at her and her family's desire at 21 weeks and 6 days of her pregnancy. Immediately after the termination, her liver function turned to be improved. Two weeks after the termination, however, serum levels of transaminases were sharply re-elevated (i.e., 367 IU/mL in ALT). Based on the histological diagnosis for AIH, predonisolone therapy (40 mg/body) was started, showing favorable response to ameliorate her liver function immediately. Although trigger for both maternal AIH and fetal ascites was unclear, breakdown of maternal-fetal immune tolerance might be involved. © 2013 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly affects young women of childbearing age. Thus, the challenges of the disease are often faced simultaneously with the challenges of early adult life and family planning. This has led to great interest in the effects of pregnancy and breastfeeding on MS. It is now well known that the risk of MS relapse declines during pregnancy but increases in the first 3-4. months postpartum. However, important gaps in knowledge remain and are the focus of this review. What factors predict postpartum relapses? Are there modifiable factors, such as breastfeeding, particularly exclusive breastfeeding, that could reduce the risk of postpartum relapses? Does pregnancy or breastfeeding have any long-term effects on MS disease course? What immunological mechanisms underlie the effects of pregnancy and breastfeeding? Answering these questions will improve our ability to care for women with MS and may provide a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective Obstructive sleep apnea, a breathing disorder caused by the repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, results in a state of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Although the etiology and consequences of CIH are extensively investigated in the adult, the developmental ramifications of this disease process are unknown. Design This study was done to investigate the effect of CIH during gestation on offspring development. Pregnant female Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIH throughout the gestational period. Results Postnatal day-1 offspring from CIH mothers were asymmetrically growth restricted, with decreased body weights and elevated brain-weight:liver-weight ratios. Furthermore, CIH newborns had elevated heart- and brain-weight:body weight ratios, and decreased liver-weight:body weight ratios. By adulthood, body weights of growth restricted offspring were significantly greater, as were the liver-weight:body weight ratios. CIH offspring also had greater body fat deposition, were hyperglycemic and had elevated plasma levels of insulin during development into adults. Conclusion These data suggest that alteration of the maternal intrauterine environment by gestational CIH effects the long-term development of the offspring and increases the risk of the offspring to metabolic diseases in adulthood. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - To identify fetuses at high risk of poor neurological outcomes using a novel ultrasound evaluation system. We assessed an ultrasound evaluation system based on our previous findings, consisting of screening for decreased or lack of fetal movements, abnormal patterns of fetal heart rate, congenital CNS malformations, polyhydramnios of unknown cause, and a " brief ultrasound evaluation" of fetal brain functions, including movement of extremities, breathing movements, ultradian rhythm, REM period, and NREM period. We then assessed the correlation between fetal brain functions and neurological outcomes in infancy (MR, CP, and low Developmental Quotient). During screening, we prospectively evaluated 4978 fetuses receiving prenatal and intrapartum management between January 2000 and December 2009 in our hospital that were later delivered between 32 and 41. weeks' gestation and identified 93 cases as suspicious for impairment. Of the 93 fetuses, 26 underwent the second step of brief ultrasound examination at 35-40. weeks' gestation. Our findings revealed that this method was adequately sensitive (80%) and specific (88%) in identifying neurological impairment. We concluded that this method was mainly useful in the clinical setting for establishing the first indication for fetal CNS examination for functional impairment, rendering it suitable for clinical application. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the morphology of the common iliac artery and vein (CIA&V) comparing right and left sides in females versus males. Pregnant women favour lying on one side at rest and during sleep. The reason for this may be due to the morphology and orientation between the CIA&V. Virtually all women during their pregnancy suffer from lower limb swelling. This study provides an anatomical explanation for the propensity to lie consistently on one side, for lower limb swelling, and offers prevention measures. A literature search was conducted on anatomical texts, atlases, journals, and websites regarding the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA&V, lower limb oedema, and sleeping positions during pregnancy. Measurements from 15 dissected cadavers were conducted on the right and left CIA&V. The literature search revealed very limited studies on the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA&V with no studies relating this orientation to lower limb oedema or sleeping positions during pregnancy. Cadaver dissection revealed a relatively direct anterior to posterior orientation left CIA&V and an oblique lateral to medial right CIA&V. This study suggests an explanation of why women lie on their left side when resting and sleeping during the third trimester due to the clinically relevant anatomy between the CIA&V.

AB  - Introduction: Sexual dysfunctions are highly prevalent among men and women. Pregnancy is one of the predisposing factors of sexual dysfunctions and it is associated with a wide variety of physical and psychological causes as well. The aim of this study was to compare sexual dysfunctions of men before and during pregnancy of their wives. Methods: This study was a descriptive-analytical and cross sectional and retrospective study in which, 100 men whose wives had experienced recent pregnancy were surveyed. Subjects were selected through multi stage sampling and they were given a researcher-made questionnaire measuring sexual dysfunctions in men before and during their wives' pregnancy. Collected data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical tests using SPSS software version 16. P value less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Results: Remarkable numbers of men have experienced at least one of the sexual dysfunctions before and during their wives' pregnancy. Dysfunctions included premature ejaculation, sleep ejaculation, masturbation, impaired erection, altered sex drive and inability to reach orgasm, respectively. Wilcoxon test also revealed a significant relationship between altered sex drive, inability to reach orgasm and premature jaculation in subjects before and during their wives' pregnancy (p<0.01). Conclusion: Intensity of some sexual dysfunctions increase in men during their wives' pregnancy. So, it is suggested that education about sexual issues should be considered for couples particularly for men during their wives' pregnancy.

AB  - Introduction: Narcolepsy is a rare disorder classified as hypersomnia of central origin. Its core symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. Associated symptoms, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, automatic behavior, and sleep fragmentation, are unspecific. Genetic, autoimmune, and environmental factors contribute to hypocretin deficiency. Areas covered: This article focuses on therapies for narcolepsy symptoms and comorbid disorders. Despite the enormous increase of knowledge about narcolepsy's pathologies no substance has been developed that can cure the disease. So far hypocretin substitution is not available. Substances targeting the autoimmune mechanism have failed to show objective improvement despite subjective improvement. The standard medication in adults comprises stimulants and anticataplectics. Only few substances are capable of improving core and associated symptoms. Within the last years, only modafinil and its enantiomer armodafinil and sodium oxybate have been approved as new substances. Expert opinion: The choice of stimulants to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy needs to be expanded and anticataplectic medication needs to be approved for the indication. Head-to-head comparisons between the established medications, studies of high evidence in older non-evidence-based medications, in children, pregnant women, and of behavioral therapy need to be performed including the long-term effects on metabolic and cardiovascular risks. Narcolepsy is a model disease for so many sleep disorders, among which it has the most severe daytime sleepiness. New insights into its etiology have advanced sleep medicine immensely. Still it stays an orphan in terms of treatment options which are challenging because narcolepsy covers so many symptoms from neuropsychological metabolic-, cardiovascular-, endocrinological-, movement disorders, and parasomnias to name a few. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Conflicting reports on potential risks of antidepressant exposure during gestation for the infant have been reported in the literature. This systematic review and meta-analysis on immediate neonatal outcomes were conducted to clarify what, if any, risks are faced by infants exposed to antidepressants in utero. Subanalyses address known methodological limitations in the field. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched from their start dates to June 2010. Various combinations of keywords were utilized including, but not limited to, depressive/mood disorder, pregnancy/pregnancy trimesters, antidepressant drugs, and neonatal effects. Study Selection: English language and cohort and casecontrol studies reporting on a cluster of signs defined as poor neonatal adaptation syndrome (PNAS) or individual clinical signs (respiratory distress and tremors) associated with pharmacologic treatment were selected. Of 3,074 abstracts reviewed, 735 articles were retrieved and 12 were included in this analysis. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of the articles. Results: Twelve studies were retrieved that examined PNAS or the signs of respiratory distress and tremors in the infant. There was a significant association between exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy and overall occurrence of PNAS (odds ratio [OR] = 5.07; 95% CI, 3.25-7.90; P < .0001). Respiratory distress (OR = 2.20; 95% CI, 1.81-2.66; P < .0001) and tremors (OR = 7.89; 95% CI, 3.33-18.73; P < .0001) were also significantly associated with antidepressant exposure. For the respiratory outcome, studies using convenience samples had significantly higher ORs (Q<inf>1</inf> = 5.4, P = .020). No differences were found in any other moderator analyses. Conclusions: An increased risk of PNAS exists in infants exposed to antidepressant medication during pregnancy; respiratory distress and tremors also show associations. Neonatologists need to be prepared and updated in their management, and clinicians must inform their patients of this risk. © Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed potential early-life factors and their interrelationships with obesity among young Canadian children. METHODS: Data from a nationally representative sample of children aged 6 to 11 years in the Canadian Health Measures Survey were analyzed. The associations of perinatal and early childhood behaviours and socio-economic factors with overweight or obesity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PARFs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 968 term-born children, 21% were overweight and another 13% were obese. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.15) was positively associated with obesity. This association was mediated by birth weight (suppression effect); once controlled, the strength of the association between smoking and child obesity increased by 12%. Birth weight per 100 g (1.05; 1.005-1.09) was significantly associated with obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (0.44; 0.31-0.61), adequate sleep hours (0.39; 0.16-0.94) and being physically active (0.50; 0.26-0.93) were found to be protective. Breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, significantly reduced obesity risk among children whose mothers never smoked in pregnancy. PARFs indicated that 24.4%, 11.5%, 11.3% and 6.0% prevalent cases of child obesity might be prevented by exclusive breastfeeding, smoking cessation during pregnancy, adequate sleep during childhood, and avoiding high birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified multiple perinatal and childhood factors associated with obesity in young Canadian children. Effective prevention strategies targeting four modifiable maternal and child risk factors may reduce childhood obesity by up to 54% in Canada. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2013.

AB  - Cramps are painful sensations caused by intense involuntary contractions of skeletal muscles, mostly in the calves, usually lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. Although cramps are mostly idiopathic, theycan bea symptom of other forms of myalgia, restless legs syndrome or spasticity. Especially nocturnal cramps can cause considerable distress for patients requiring fast pain reduction and effective prophylaxis. Stretching the calf muscles helps preventing nocturnal cramps. Pharmacological treatment of leg cramps includes magnesium and quinine.

AB  - In pediatrics recording of EEG can range from premature infants aged just 25 weeks of gestation to young adults. Recording EEG in pediatrics ranges from 25 weeks of gestation premature in the incubator to young adults. Hence, recording conditions need to be adapted to very different situations, not only of age but also of environment, asepsis, and behavior.This requires that recording conditions be adapted to very different situations, not only of age but also of environment, asepsis and behavior. The two major determinants of EEG features are the level of vigilance and age. Standard examination includes spontaneous sleep until the age of 5 years, and hyperventilation and intermittent light stimulation in older children. Hyperventilation may modify the tracing in a physiological way until adolescence. One of the major characteristics of a child's EEG recording is its course over time that parallels rapid brain maturation. EEG changes are particularly rapid in early age and they involve both temporal and spatial organization. In premature babies modifications appear by two 2 weeks, in infancy by 1 month and in childhood by 1 year, before reaching the adult patterns at an age varying between 8 and 12 years of age. Apart from being aware of the normal EEG patterns according to thein children of different ages, it is important to recognize unusual patterns that are not linked to a pathological situation. Most important are the interpretation and the conclusion of the EEG tracing and any conclusions reached, for which and a precise knowledge besides clinical information is mandatory for this purpose is essential. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective To review the literature on the association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression. Sources A review of literature found on MEDLINE/PubMed database. Summary of findings The literature consistently shows that breastfeeding provides a wide range of benefits for both the child and the mother. The psychological benefits for the mother are still in need of further research. Some studies point out that pregnancy depression is one of the factors that may contribute to breastfeeding failure. Others studies also suggest an association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression; the direction of this association is still unclear. Breastfeeding can promote hormonal processes that protect mothers against postpartum depression by attenuating cortisol response to stress. It can also reduce the risk of postpartum depression, by helping the regulation of sleep and wake patterns for mother and child, improving mother's self-efficacy and her emotional involvement with the child, reducing the child's temperamental difficulties, and promoting a better interaction between mother and child. Conclusions Studies demonstrate that breastfeeding can protect mothers from postpartum depression, and are starting to clarify which biological and psychological processes may explain this protection. However, there are still equivocal results in the literature that may be explained by the methodological limitations presented by some studies. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Some professional associations advocate bedsharing to facilitate breastfeeding, while others recommend against it to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and suffocation deaths. A better understanding of the quantitative influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration is needed to guide policy. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal data were from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, which enrolled mothers while pregnant and followed them through the first year of infant life. Questionnaires were sent at infant ages 1 to 7, 9, 10, and 12 months, and 1846 mothers answered at least 1 question regarding bedsharing and were breastfeeding at infant age 2 weeks. EXPOSURES: Bedsharing, defined as the mother lying down and sleeping with her infant on the same bed or other sleeping surfaces for nighttime sleep or during the major sleep period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival analysis to investigate the effect of bedsharing on duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding. RESULTS: Longer duration of bedsharing, indicated by a larger cumulative bedsharing score, was associated with a longer duration of any breastfeeding but not exclusive breastfeeding, after adjusting for covariates. Breastfeeding duration was longer among women who were better educated, were white, had previously breastfed, had planned to breastfeed, and had not returned to work in the first year postpartum. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Multiple factors were associated with breastfeeding, including bedsharing. Given the risk of sudden infant death syndrome related to bedsharing, multipronged strategies to promote breastfeeding should be developed and tested.

AB  - Carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors transduce low arterial O(2) tension into increased action potential activity on the carotid sinus nerves, which contributes to resting ventilatory drive, increased ventilatory drive in response to hypoxia, arousal responses to hypoxia during sleep, upper airway muscle activity, blood pressure control and sympathetic tone. Their sensitivity to O(2) is low in the newborn and increases during the days or weeks after birth to reach adult levels. This postnatal functional maturation of the CB O(2) response has been termed "resetting" and it occurs in every mammalian species studied to date. The O(2) environment appears to play a key role; the fetus develops in a low O(2) environment throughout gestation and initiation of CB "resetting" after birth is modulated by the large increase in arterial oxygen tension occurring at birth. Although numerous studies have reported age-related changes in various components of the O(2) transduction cascade, how the O(2) environment shapes normal CB prenatal development and postnatal "resetting" remains unknown. Viewing CB "resetting" as environment-driven (developmental) phenotypic plasticity raises important mechanistic questions that have received little attention. This review examines what is known (and not known) about mechanisms of CB functional maturation, with a focus on the role of the O(2) environment. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Entering of high-tech methods used in the treatment of premature infants carries the risk of increased invasiveness which causes the pain and stress in them. The aim of this literature review is to present the achievements in the study of neonatal pain, causes and responses to it, the short-term effects on their status and their later development, as well as the ways of pain's assessment. The newborn after 26-30 weeks of gestation has functionally mature pain receptor apparatus. Numerous invasive procedures cause in the prematurely born baby psycho-physiological abnormalities (changes in heart rate, breathing, blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and behavioral abnormalities (facial expression, motion activity of the body and extremities, sleep disturbances, characteristics of crying). The last mentioned are basis for creating a rating scale for procedural and prolonged pain. Future studies are aimed at creating an universal scales. At the time of intensive treatment, the premature infant is under the adverse effects of acute or repeated pain incentives. They worsen the status, prolong the hospital stay and influence the later neurological development and outcome of the premature infant. In everyday clinical practice, prevention of pain, establishing its severity and its evaluation reduce its negative effects on the newborn.

AB  - Background:Severe obesity has increased >300% in US children since 1976, and is associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and high adult obesity rates.Objective:The objective of this study was to identify predictors of severe obesity in kindergarteners.Methods:Multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) were used to identify prenatal/pregnancy, infant, and early childhood predictors of severe kindergarten obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥99th percentile) in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort, a nationally representative longitudinal study that followed children from birth through kindergarten.Results:For the 6800 children, the severe kindergarten obesity prevalence was 5.7%, with higher adjusted odds for crossing the 85th percentile of BMI at 2 years old (odds ratio (OR), 8.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.1-15.7), preschool age (OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 4.9-12.8) and 9 months old (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6); maternal severe obesity (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9-5.8) and gestational diabetes (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.5); drinking tea or coffee between meals/before bedtime at 2 years old (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.5); Latino (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.7) and multiracial (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8) race/ethnicity; and drinking sugary beverages at kindergarten age at least weekly (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.7). Ever-attending center-based daycare (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9), eating fruit at least weekly at kindergarten age (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7), and maternal history of a prior newborn birth weight ≥4000 g (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.02-0.6) were associated with reduced odds of severe obesity. RPA identified low severe obesity prevalence (1.9%) for non-85th BMI-percentile preschool crossers and high severe obesity (56-80%) for predictor clusters which included crossing the 85th BMI percentile at earlier ages, low parental education, specific maternal age cutoffs, preschooler bedtime rules, and outside walking/play frequency for 9-month-olds.Conclusions:Certain parental, prenatal/pregnancy, infant, and early childhood factors, both alone and in combination, are potent predictors of severe obesity in kindergarteners. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects not only mothers, but also entire families. Postpartum follow-up should address emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and child-related factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother's lack of satisfaction with the baby's sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

AB  - There is an epidemic of diabetes in Asia. Type 2 diabetes develops in East Asian patients at a lower mean body mass index (BMI) compared with those of European descent. At any given BMI, East Asians have a greater amount of body fat and a tendency to visceral adiposity. In Asian patients, diabetes develops at a younger age and is characterized by early β cell dysfunction in the setting of insulin resistance, with many requiring early insulin treatment. The increasing proportion of young-onset and childhood type 2 diabetes is posing a particular threat, with these patients being at increased risk of developing diabetic complications. East Asian patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of developing renal complications than Europeans and, with regard to cardiovascular complications, a predisposition for developing strokes. In addition to cardiovascular-renal disease, cancer is emerging as the other main cause of mortality. While more research is needed to explain these interethnic differences, urgent and concerted actions are needed to raise awareness, facilitate early diagnosis, and encourage preventive strategies to combat these growing disease burdens. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background/Aims: The aim of this longitudinal case-control study was to investigate variables associated with caries development from birth to 36 months. Methods: Children (n = 1,017) who were followed up every 6 months from birth to 36 months were grouped into those that developed caries by age 30 and 36 months, respectively, and compared with children without caries. Results: By 30 months (n = 608) there were 24 children (4%) who had caries and an additional 23 developed first caries at 36 months (n = 552), giving a total prevalence of 47 children with caries (9%) at 36 months. Children who showed caries by 30 months were more likely to be mutans streptococci (MS) colonised by 18 months (p = 0.001) compared to those who developed caries at 36 months, and showed the following variables: MS counts of &gt; 105 CFU/ml at 12 months (p = 0.005), missing enamel (p = 0.001), sugar in pacifier at 18 months (p = 0.02), child sleeping next to mother at 6, 18 and 24 months (p = 0.001 to p = 0.02), and exposure to household cigarette smoke at 24 months (p = 0.02). Caries at 36 months was associated with pregnancy problems (p = 0.024), mother having dental cavitations (p = 0.001) and MS presence at 36 months (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 0.1, p = 0.01 for counts &lt; 10 5 CFU/ml). Caries at both 30 and 36 months was associated with MS presence at 18 months (AOR = 6.3, p = 0.005 and AOR = 4.9, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Children who developed caries by 30 months are colonised by MS at younger ages and with higher MS counts compared with children who develop caries at 36 months. © 2012 S.

AB  - To assess expectant mothers on their knowledge and awareness of factors affecting paediatric oral health. Seven hundred and six women in different stages of pregnancy were recruited from the antenatal clinic of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over a period of four weeks. A self-administered structured questionnaire on socio-demographic information, oral health knowledge and oral health behaviour was filled by the participants. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 17. The mean age of the subjects was 29.6 (SD + 4.4) years. Seventy percent of them had tertiary education and 63.9% were unemployed. A significant proportion (83.4%) of the women had medium to high score (> 50%) in the knowledge of causal and preventive factors in dental caries and gingivitis. Over seventy nine percent (79.2%) of them acknowledged that primary teeth are important, but 43.6% did not know whether primary teeth should be restored or not. Only 39.3% of the women knew that leaving a feeding bottle/breast in the mouth of a sleeping child could be harmful to the teeth. Knowledge of the role of bacteria in gingivitis (81.3%) and dental caries (86.6%) was high. Over 45% of participants agreed that mothers could transmit cariogenic bacteria to their children. Only 0.7% of the women had taken their children to the dental clinic for routine checkup. Most of the participants had medium to high knowledge of the factors that affect paediatric oral health, yet the participants did not demonstrate adequate and proper concomitant oral health practice.

AB  - Co-occurrence of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and Hirschsprung disease is known as Haddad syndrome. Affected patients develop with variable expressivity a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. We report the natural history of a full-term newborn infant presenting multiple features of autonomic system dysfunction that were already noted antenatally. The presence of a nonpolyalanine repeat expansion mutation in the PHOX2B gene confirmed postnatally the diagnosis of Haddad syndrome. This case suggests that patients presenting with autonomic system dysfunction may already present signs of the disease during the fetal period. Furthermore, antenatal presentations may correlate with a more severe presentation of the disease. In conclusion, antenatal signs of dysautonomy should stimulate multidisciplinary prenatal approach to orientate proper postnatal intervention and facilitate treatment strategies. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objective: Using two cohorts born 29 years apart in Dunedin, New Zealand we aim to examine changes in risk factors and their associations with body mass index (BMI) at ages 3 and 7 years, and estimate their contribution to the secular changes in BMI at age 7 years. Methods: Birth weight and anthropometric measures at ages 3, 5 and 7 years were obtained for 974 participants in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS), born in 1972-1973, and 241 in the Family Lifestyle, Activity, Movement and Eating Study (FLAME), born in 2001-2002. Information about maternal age, education and smoking in pregnancy, as well as breastfeeding, children's television time and time in bed, was obtained by questionnaire. Results: The increase in BMI over the 29-year period was 0.84 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06) kg m-2 at age 7. A 1-unit difference in the mother's BMI was associated with a 0.06 (0.03, 0.08) kg m-2 difference in offspring in both studies; the 3.4 (2.8, 4.0) kg m-2 increase in the mothers' BMIs accounts for a change of 0.19 kg m-2 in the children's BMI. The much smaller generational increase in fathers' BMI (0.7 kg m-2) correspondingly had a more limited effect on change in child BMI over time (0.06 kg m-2). Although smoking in pregnancy decreased by 15% (8, 21) its association with BMI increased from 0.20 (-0.01, 0.42) in the DMHDS cohort to 1.24 (0.76, 1.71) kg m-2 in the FLAME cohort, contributing 0.18 kg m-2 to the increase in children's BMI. Conclusions: Societal factors such as higher maternal BMI and smoking in pregnancy contribute most to the secular increase in BMI, with changes in behavioural factors, including sleep and television viewing, having little effect in this setting. © 2012 International Association for the Study of Obesity.

AB  - Despite free distribution of insecticide treated nets in Nigeria, the use it as a means of malaria prevention and control has not been fuIly embraced. The aim of this survey was to determine the level of awareness, ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets among residents of Abavo community, Delta State Nigeria It is a descriptive cross-sectional survey conducted among 250 heads of households. One hundred and seventy five (70%) respondents were aware of insecticide treated net as a means of prevention against malaria, 111 (44%) claimed to own insecticide treated nets. On further inspection of houses of those who claimed to own ITNs, seventy four (66%) actually had theirs hanged, the rest were either in their packs or not seen. Ninety five (38%) respondents out of the total sleep under insecticide treated net. About 92 (70%) households having under-five and 39 (81.3%) of households having pregnant women claim to use ITNs. It was observed that the level of education (chi2 = 48.35, p = 0.001), presence of under 5 children in a household ?2 = 7.229, p = 0.027) influenced ownership of Insecticide treated nets. In conclusion despite a high level of awareness about ITN found in this survey, ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets were low.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to 1 in 8 women. The early postpartum period is characterized by a downward physiological shift from relatively elevated levels of sex steroids during pregnancy to diminished levels after parturition. Sex steroids influence functional brain connectivity in healthy non-puerperal subjects. This study tests the hypothesis that PPD is associated with attenuation of resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fc) within corticolimbic regions implicated in depression and alterations in neuroactive steroid concentrations as compared to healthy postpartum women. Subjects (. n = 32) were prospectively evaluated during pregnancy and in the postpartum with repeated plasma neuroactive steroid measurements and mood and psychosocial assessments. Healthy comparison subjects (HCS) and medication-free subjects with unipolar PPD (PPD) were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) within 9 weeks of delivery. We performed rs-fc analysis with seeds placed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral amygdala (AMYG), hippocampi (HIPP) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs). Postpartum rs-fc and perinatal neuroactive steroid plasma concentrations, quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, were compared between groups. PPD subjects showed attenuation of connectivity for each of the tested regions (i.e. ACC, AMYG, HIPP and DLPFC) and between corticocortical and corticolimbic regions vs. HCS. Perinatal concentrations of pregnanolone, allopregnanolone and pregnenolone were not different between groups. This is the first report of a disruption in the rs-fc patterns in medication-free subjects with PPD. This disruption may contribute to the development of PPD, at a time of falling neuroactive steroid concentrations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To explore the status of women's quality of life and analyze risk factors related diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Methods We applied the method of convenient sampling to investigate 61 patients with DOR (DOR group) and 60 women with normal ovarian reserve function (control group) who visited a reproductive centre of a Triple-A hospital from February to May 2013, using a questionnaire which included basic information table, Menopausal Quality of Life Scale (MENQOL) and SF-36 Health Survey for quality of life, and Kupperman Index Scale (KI) for the degree of clinical symptoms. Ten, statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 software. Results Compared with the control group (43.60±16.82), the level of women's quality of life in the DOR group (73.42±24.15) was significantly lower (P<0.01), while the degree of clinical symptoms was significantly higher (P<0.01). There were positive associations between quality of life and degree of clinical symptoms. Te risk factors related to DOR were various such as age, weight, quality of sleep, menstrual disorders, number of abortion, age of the first pregnancy, gynecologic surgery, economic income, education, family relationship, unsatisfactory sexual life, and psychological factors. Conclusion In order to improve women's quality of life, effective treatment should be conducted to relieve clinical symptoms of women with DOR. Good life style, harmonious family relationship, healthy mind and avoiding the risk factors, which could effectively help the prevention and treatment of the disease. © 2013 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

AB  - The present study was designed to identify the association between work hours and obesity in Korean adult manual and nonmanual workers, and to determine whether there is a gender difference in this association. Methods: The study was conducted using Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected between 2007 and 2010. Individuals aged below 25 or over 64 years, pregnant women, part-time workers, soldiers, housewives and students were excluded. The total number of individuals included in the analysis was 8,889 (5,241 male and 3,648 female subjects). The outcome variable was obesity, defined as body mass index ≥25 kg/m2. Variables considered in the model were age, education, income, marital status, alcohol drinking, smoking, daily energy intake, physical activity, sleep hours per day, the type of job, work hours, and work schedule. Work hours were categorized as &lt;40, 40-48 (reference), 49-60, and &gt;60 hours per week. Results: In the multiple SURVEYLOGISTIC regression analyses, the adjusted odds ratio of obesity for long work hours (&gt;60 hours per week) in male manual workers was 1.647 (95% confidence interval 1.262-2.151). Long work hours did not significantly increase the odds ratio for obesity in male nonmanual workers and female manual and nonmanual workers. Conclusions: More than 60 work hours per week increased the risk of obesity in Korean male manual workers. This result might be helpful in preventing obesity in Korean adult workers, especially male manual workers.

AB  - Objectives: We investigated the locus coeruleus complex in the brainstems of 78 subjects aged from 24 gestational weeks to 8 postnatal months, who died of unknown (sudden unexplained fetal and infant deaths) and known causes (controls). The goals of this study were: (1) to obtain basic information about the morphology of the locus coeruleus complex and the expression of different biological parameters (tyrosine hydroxylase, neuromelanin and apoptosis) during the first phases of human nervous system development; (2) to evaluate possible alterations of this structure in victims of sudden death; and (3) to verify any correlation with risk factors. Methods: All the victims were subjected to a complete autopsy, including an in-depth histological examination of the autonomic nervous system and in particular of the locus coeruleus complex, the target of this study. Adrenergic neurons were identified by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry and neuromelanin-containing neurons were specifically visualized by the application of Lillie's method. In addition, the activation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) was studied by investigating DNA fragmentation (TUNEL-positive cells). Results: Alterations of the noradrenaline system, decreased neuromelanin, hypoplasia, in addition to a high neuronal death rate, were observed almost exclusively in the locus coeruleus complex of fetal and infant sudden deaths, and were significantly correlated to maternal smoking. Discussion: The developmental defects found in the locus coeruleus complex in victims of sudden unexplained fetal and infant death imply alterations of the vital activities related to the widespread brain connections arising from this neuronal center, including coordination of the sleep-waking cycle and control of the cardio-respiratory system. © W.

AB  - Imbalanced maternal nutrition during gestation can cause alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system in offspring. The present study investigated the effects of maternal low- and high-protein diets during gestation in pigs on the maternal-fetal HPA regulation and expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2) and c-fos mRNAs in the placenta and fetal brain. Twenty-seven German Landrace sows were fed diets with high (HP, 30%), low (LP, 6.5%) or adequate (AP, 12.1%) protein levels made isoenergetic by varying the carbohydrate levels. On gestational day 94, fetuses were recovered under general anesthesia for the collection of blood, brain and placenta samples. The LP diet in sows increased salivary cortisol levels during gestation compared to the HP and AP sows and caused an increase of placental GR and c-fos mRNA expression. However, the diurnal rhythm of plasma cortisol was disturbed in both LP and HP sows. Total plasma cortisol concentrations in the umbilical cord vessels were elevated in fetuses from HP sows, whereas corticosteroid-binding globulin levels were decreased in LP fetuses. In the hypothalamus, LP fetuses displayed an enhanced mRNA expression of 11β-HSD1 and a reduced expression of c-fos. Additionally, the 11β-HSD2 mRNA expression was decreased in both LP and HP fetuses. The present results suggest that both low and high protein:carbohydrate dietary ratios during gestation may alter the expression of genes encoding key determinants of glucocorticoid hormone action in the fetus with potential long-lasting consequences for stress adaptation and health. © 2012 Kanitz et al.

AB  - Chiari I malformation (CM-I) manifests with tonsillar herniation below foramen magnum. These patients are at high risk of respiratory depression and bulbar dysfunction in the perioperative period with underlying obstructive sleep apnea. However, the safe use of both general and regional anaesthesia has been documented in a known CM-I parturients. We describe the successful management of a patient who had hypercapnic respiratory failure in the post-anaesthetic care unit following an uneventful subarachnoid block for left knee replacement surgery. This patient was retrospectively diagnosed with occult CM-I and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in the postoperative period.

AB  - Menopause means a definitive end of the generative ovarian function and mostly occurs in women aged 40-58. It is well-known that the sooner it occurs the more serious consequences may result, even in the case of early menopausal hormone therapy. The most serious short-term consequences of menopause are menopausal symptoms (depression, hot flushes, sleep disorders, loss of libido), while long-term estrogen deficiency leads to osteoporosis, cardiovascular system diseases, depression, neurodegenerative diseases, urogenital area atrophy, skin and sense organ disorders. Therefore, an important task is to select women at risk of premature termination of the ovarian function. An important issue thus appears to be identification of factors influencing the age of the last natural menstrual period. Analysis of heritability results has brought the conclusion that the age of menopause is a multifactorial trait. The proportion of the impact of environmental and genetic factors, however, was not precisely estimated. Among environmental determinants the influence of many factors is being considered, including reproductive factors (related to the reproductive period), such as age of menarche, number of pregnancies and children, socio-economic factors, such as education, economic status, health determinants, such as the use of oral contraceptives or lifestyle-related factors, such as physical activity and the use of stimulants. Among the genetic factors, a genetic polymorphism of genes encoding enzymes of the estrogen biosynthesis pathway and other independent markers scattered throughout the genome (linkage studies and genome-wide association studies - GWAS) is taken into consideration.

AB  - Background: There is a high association between disturbed (poor quality) sleep and depression, which has lead to a consensus that there is a bidirectional relationship between sleep and mood. One time in a woman's life when sleep is commonly disturbed is during pregnancy and following childbirth. It has been suggested that sleep disturbance is another factor that may contribute to the propensity for women to become depressed in the postpartum period compared to other periods in their life. Post Natal Depression (PND) is common (15.5%) and associated with sleep disturbance, however, no studies have attempted to provide a sleep-focused intervention to pregnant women and assess whether this can improve sleep, and consequently maternal mood post-partum. The primary aim of this research is to determine the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational sleep intervention compared with a control group to improve sleep management, with a view to reduce depressive symptoms in first time mothers.Method: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 214 first time mothers during the last trimester of their pregnancy. Participants will be randomised to receive either a set of booklets (control group) or a 3hour psychoeducational intervention that focuses on sleep. The primary outcomes of this study are sleep-related, that is sleep quality and sleepiness for ten months following the birth of the baby. The secondary outcome is depressive symptoms. It is hypothesised that participants in the intervention group will have better sleep quality and sleepiness in the postpartum period than women in the control condition. Further, we predict that women who receive the sleep intervention will have lower depression scores postpartum compared with the control group.Discussion: This study aims to provide an intervention that will improve maternal sleep in the postpartum period. If sleep can be effectively improved through a brief psychoeducational program, then it may have a protective role in reducing maternal postpartum depressive symptoms.Registration details: This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register under the registration number ACTRN12611000859987. © 2012 Kempler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Women in low-income countries are generally considered to have a high physical workload which is sustained during pregnancy. Although most previous studies have been based on questionnaires a recent meta-analysis of doubly labeled water data has raised questions about the actual amount of physical activity performed. In this study we report objectively assessed levels of physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness among pregnant urban Ethiopian women, and their association with demographic characteristics and anthropometric measures.Methods: Physical activity was measured for seven consecutive days in 304 women using a combined uniaxial accelerometer and heart rate sensor. Activity energy expenditure was determined using a group calibration in a branched equation model framework. Type and duration of activities were reported using a 24-hour physical activity recall and grip strength was assessed using a dynamometer.Results: Median (interquartile-range, IQR) activity energy expenditure was 31.1 (23.7-42.0) kJ/kg/day corresponding to a median (IQR) physical activity level of 1.46 (1.39-1.58). Median (IQR) time in sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity was 1100 (999-1175), 303 (223-374) and 40 (22-69) min/day, respectively. Mean (standard deviation) sleeping heart rate was 73.6 (8.0) beats/min and grip strength was 21.6 (4.5) kg. Activity energy expenditure was 14% higher for every 10 cm2 difference in arm muscle area and 10% lower for every 10 cm2 difference in arm fat area and 10-week difference in gestational age.Conclusion: The level and intensity of physical activity among pregnant women from urban Ethiopia is low compared to non-pregnant women from other low income countries as well as pregnant European women from high-income countries. © 2012 Hjorth et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances in late pregnancy are common. This study aimed to survey sleep problems in third trimester pregnant women and to compare sleep in the pre-pregnancy period with the third trimester.Methods: Third-trimester women (n=650) were sent a postal survey containing questions relating to sleep experience, including perceived sleep quality, sleep difficulties, night waking, sleep environment, snoring, daytime tiredness and daytime napping. Time periods reported on were before pregnancy and in the last week. Results: Respondents numbered 244 (38%). Before pregnancy, the mean reported duration of night-time sleep was 8.1 (SD 1.1) hours; in the last week this had decreased to 7.5 (SD 1.8) hours (p<.0001). Only 29% rated their sleep quality in the last week as very good or fairly good, compared with 82% rating their sleep this way before the pregnancy. The main reasons for sleeping difficulties were discomfort (67%) and pain (36%). Snoring increased significantly over the course of the pregnancy, with 37% reporting snoring often or every night in the last week. Those with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of greater than 25 were significantly more likely to snore (p=.01). Only 4% of women had an abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (i.e. >10) prior to pregnancy, whereas in the last week 33% scored in the abnormal range. Likewise, 5% had regularly napped during the daytime before pregnancy, compared with 41% in the last week. Conclusions: Sleep problems are common in women in late pregnancy, and increase markedly compared with before pregnancy. © 2012 Hutchison et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in biological systems and regulate metabolic processes throughout the body. Misalliance of these circadian rhythms and the systems they regulate has a profound impact on hormone levels and increases risk of developing metabolic diseases. Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, is one of the major signaling molecules used by the master circadian oscillator to entrain downstream circadian rhythms. Several recent genetic studies have pointed out that a common variant in the gene that encodes the melatonin receptor 2 (MTNR1B) is associated with impaired glucose homeostasis, reduced insulin secretion, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Here, we try to review the role of this receptor and its signaling pathways in respect to glucose homeostasis and development of the disease. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Human and rodent studies indicate a role for circadian rhythmicity and associated clock gene expression in supporting normal parturition. The importance of clock gene expression in tissues besides the suprachiasmatic nucleus is emerging. Here, a Bmal1 conditional knockout mouse line and a novel Cre transgenic mouse line were used to examine the role of myometrial Bmal1 in parturition. Ninety-two percent (22/24) of control females but only 64% (14/22) of females with disrupted myometrial Bmal1 completed parturition during the expected time window of 5p.m. on Day 19 through to 9a.m. on Day 19.5 of gestation. However, neither serum progesterone levels nor uterine transcript expression of the contractile-associated proteins Connexin43 and Oxytocin receptor differed between females with disrupted myometrial Bmal1 and controls during late gestation. The data indicate a role for myometrial Bmal1 in maintaining normal time of day of parturition. © 2012 CSIRO.

AB  - Loss of sleep can result from multiple medical and psychiatric conditions as well as from primary sleep disorders. Large epidemiological studies indicate that obstructive sleep apnea a higher risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Insomnia, as well as sleep restriction may increase worsen cardiac disease. Metabolic consequences of poor sleep include higher risk of diabetes and obesity. Parasomnias may be seen in association with various conditions, for example of REM behavior disorder is frequently associated with Parkinson's disease.

AB  - We observed 137 patients, 72 of whom (53%) had hypertension in II trimester of pregnancy, and 65 patients (47%) who had hypertension in perimenopausal period. The comprehensive clinical and instrumental examination was carried out in all patients, including simultaneous 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) recording (with BP pattern), assessment of vegetative tone using the vegetative index (index Kerdo). Sympathetic/adrenergic activity (SAA) was quantified as β-receptor binding (β-RB). Hypertension in pregnant women is associated with increased activity of the sympathetic-adrenal system, as evidenced by high values of P-ARM, the Kerdo index and the presence of correlation between these parameters. Parasympathicotonia in perimenopausal women prevails.

AB  - Obesity has recently become an epidemic. The rise in the childhood obesity incidence is of particular concern. High density caloric diets and physical inactivity are the main causes of obesity. Besides that, is generally accepted that obesity has a genetic predisposition, unchanged for the past few decades. Te environment via endocrine disruptors might be, at least partly responsible for the globally obesity epidemic. Endocrine disruptors are environmental chemical compounds produced by human activity that either mimic or block hormonal actions. Many of them modulate lipid metabolism and adipogenesis, contributing to obesity initiation and/or exacerbation. Here we provide an overview of the role of the environmental chemical obesogens and their impact on obesity.

AB  - Existing outcomes for DSD individuals are inadequate because reports are based upon information collected retrospectively. This paper is presented to review existing data emphasizing information needed to lead to better future care, is based on presentations and discussions at a multi-disciplinary meeting on DSD held in Annecy in 2012, and is not intended to define the present status of management of each of the various DSD diagnoses. Rather it is intended to provide information needed to do studies regarding outcome data from the treatment of children with DSD by providing a summary of recommendations of 'patient-centered' topics that need investigation. The hope is that by being concerned with what is not known, new protocols will be developed for improving both early management and transition to adult life. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The goal of the present investigation was to examine effects of a cognitive-behavioral group intervention for pregnant women with subclinically elevated stress, anxiety and/or depression on perceived stress and salivary cortisol levels. Expectant mothers were recruited in gynaecologist practices. They participated in a screening, a standardized diagnostic interview (Munich-Composite Diagnostic Interview, M-CIDI), and were randomly assigned to an intervention (N = 21) and treatment as usual control group (N = 40). The intervention consisted of a manualized cognitive-behavioral group program for expectant mothers with subclinically elevated stress, depression, and/or anxiety symptoms. Stress questionnaire (prenatal distress (PDQ), perceived stress (PSS)) as well as diurnal salivary cortisol assessment took place at T1 (antenatal, preintervention), at T2 (antenatal, post-intervention) and T3 (3-month postpartum). Subjects that participated in the intervention exhibited a significant post-treatment change in morning cortisol (cortisol awakening response, CAR) in contrast to control subjects, F(8,51) = 2.300, p = 0.047. Intervention participants showed a smaller CAR subsequent to the intervention, displaying a lessened stress reaction. This effect was not observed in the control group. In contrast, we failed in discovering a significant difference between the research groups regarding the cortisol area under curve parameter (AUC) and the applied subjective stress questionnaires. Evaluation results were thus heterogeneous. Nevertheless, intervention effects on the CAR are promising. Our results suggest that a cognitive-behavioral intervention might lead to an improvement in the biological stress response of pregnant women with subclinically elevated stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - One of the basic neuro-immune-endocrine interaction is the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) to harmonize immune response to inflammatory stressors. Immune defense mechanisms mediated by cytokines and other humoral factors play particularly important roles in this communication. They are also potent activators in the CNS and factors of the HPA axis, like an increased secretion of glucocorticoids (GC). They can act as major feedback regulator of the vertebrate immune response via suppression of a wide range of cytokines, as well as interferons. Increases in systemic GC levels, however, often play dual role: do not suppress all cytokines since inhibition of a particular cytokine may result in elevated production of others. External stimuli/acute stress can compromise activation of the HPA axis and activate immune processes for defense, redirecting leukocytes from the circulation to the environment/organism interface. Overall it results in release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to activate cells of the innate immune system, which is resolved by neural, hormonal or immune mechanisms. The chronic stress leads to chronic immune arousal and subsequent sterile, low-grade inflammation, which has been identified in most 'stress-related or 'civilized' disorders in humans. The role of pituitary-gonadal axis in the activation of HPA axis results in a gender difference in HPA response to immunological challenges: e.g. can be varied during the estrus cycle, pregnancy or lactation. That corresponds to the results of recent experimental data that reveals an important role of certain neurotramsitters (such as dopamine) in immune regulation. Internal constitutional-factors of neuro-immune-endocrine interaction, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its receptors (CRF-R1 and CRF-R2), melanocortin peptides, glucocorticoids or pro-inflammatory cytokines can also act as an immunoregulator, since their receptors is present in lymphoid organs, also in peripheral blood and organs that are enhanced under inflammatory conditions. In spite of series experimental data, the role of CRH and other members of its family, as well as its receptors in inflammation are still controversial. This dual role may be due to different CRF receptors and altered functionality. There are several putative mechanisms or 'ports of entry', in which the cytokines may affect HPA activity and CRH release. Some influences of cytokines on the HPA axis may be exerted by an indirect way. The aim of our review was to summarize and outline of key interacting agents based upon recent experimental results. © 2012-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background & objectives: Sleep restriction is a common feature of modern lifestyle and its effects can be extended to pregnancy. Several neurobehavioural consequences of sleep restriction during pregnancy have been reported, among which stand out perinatal depression and maternal fatigue, however, its effects over mother-infant relationship warrant further investigation. Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy over maternal behaviour and maternal aggression through animal models. Methods: Eighteen 90-day-old female Wistar rats were distributed in two groups: (i) Control - not submitted to any manipulation during pregnancy, and (ii) Sleep restriction - submitted to sleep restriction during the entire pregnancy (21 days) through the multiple platforms technique. In the postpartum day 5, resident-intruder paradigm and the latencies test were performed to assess both maternal behaviour and maternal aggression. Results: The sleep-restricted females displayed grooming in less frequency and duration, and with higher latency when compared to normal animals, while maternal aggression and maternal behaviour parameters remained equivalent between groups. Interpretation & conclusions: Considering the maintenance of maternal behavioural parameters, the inhibition of grooming seems to exert an adaptive mechanism, enabling sleep-restricted rats to display maternal behaviour properly.

AB  - This archival cross-sectional investigation examined the impact of mood, reproductive status (RS), and age on polysomnographic (PSG) measures in women. PSG was performed on 73 normal controls (NC) and 64 depressed patients (DP), in the course of studies in menstruating, pregnant, postpartum, and peri-and postmenopausal women. A two-factor, betweensubjects multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test the main effects of reproductive status (RS: menstrual vs pregnant vs postpartum vs menopausal) and diagnosis (NC vs DP), and their interaction, on PSG measures. To further refine the analyses, a two-factor, between subjects MANOVA was used to test the main effects of age (19 to 27 vs 28 to 36 vs 37 to 45 vs 46+ years) and diagnosis on the PSG data. Analyses revealed that in DP women, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage was significantly elevated relative to NC across both RS and age. Significant differences in sleep efficiency, Stage 1%, and REM density were associated with RS; differences in total sleep time, Stage 2 percentage, and Stage 4 percentage were associated with differences in age. Both RS and age were related to differences in sleep latency, Stage 3 percentage, and Delta percentage. Finally, wake after sleep onset time, REM percentage, and REM latency did not vary with respect to RS or age. Overall, this investigation examined three major variables (mood, RS, and age) that are known to impact sleep in women. Of the variables, age appeared to have the greatest impact on PSG sleep measures, reflecting changes occurring across the lifespan. © 2012 LLS SAS.

AB  - Purpose of review: This article aims to draw together recent thinking on pregnancy and obesity, with a particular emphasis on prevention strategies and emerging clinical complications. Recent findings: New studies including a large meta-analysis have highlighted that weight reduction strategies are not associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes, and there are suggestions that an approach of dietary modification alone may be associated with reduction in gestational weight gain. These findings are critically discussed with reference to future planned trials. New literature regarding hitherto under-reported complications of obesity in pregnancy such as ischaemic heart disease, schizophrenia and sleep disorders is highlighted. Summary: There will be a need to focus on obesity prevention in the pregnant population as resources will not be adequate to the increasing incidence of the problem. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Acupuncture for tension-type headache in pregnancy: a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Aim: This study was undertaken to test, under real-life conditions, the effects of acupuncture on headaches during pregnancy and compare this with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone. Methodology: Forty-three conventionally treated (lifestyle modifications and stretching) pregnant women were randomly allocated into two groups to routine care or acupuncture. The severity and disability caused by this pain and its affect on mood, sleep and work were assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The main end-point was the mean difference between the first and the last interview after eight weeks of treatment. Secondary end points were the changes over time in the NRS assessments of pain intensity, disturbances in mood, sleep and working and the use of medications.Differences between initial and final sessions were analyzed by a two-sample test. Changes over time in the NRS assessment were analyzed by the Fisher exact test. Mood's test for medians was used and a p-value < 0.05 indicated a significant difference. Results: All women completed the treatment. No important adverse effects related to acupuncture treatment or to pregnancy's outcome were reported. Significant improvements were demonstrated for pain at the end of the trial in the study group, 3.9 vs 1.7 difference in favor to acupuncture group (p< 0.05). This group also used less medication and had a greater improvement in mood and sleep when compared with the control group. Conclusions: This study suggests acupuncture alleviates tension-type headaches during pregnancy. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine which factors during pregnancy and postpartum predict pelvic girdle pain (PGP) at 12 weeks postpartum among working women. A total of 548 Dutch pregnant employees were recruited in 15 companies, mainly health care, child care, and supermarkets. The definition of PGP was any pain felt in the pelvic girdle region at 12 weeks postpartum. Participants received questionnaires at 30 weeks of pregnancy and at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum with demographic, work-related, pregnancy-related, fatigue, psychosocial, PGP-related and delivery-related questions. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Almost half of the women experienced pain in their pelvic girdle at 12 weeks postpartum. However, the level of pain and the degree of disability due to postpartum PGP was low. Pregnancy-related predictors for PGP at 12 weeks were history of low back pain, higher somatisation, more than 8 hours of sleep or rest per day, and uncomfortable postures at work. The pregnancy and postpartum-related predictors were: more disability at 6 weeks, having PGP at 6 weeks, higher mean pain at 6 weeks, higher somatisation during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum, higher birth weight of the baby, uncomfortable postures at work and number of days of bed rest. Based on these results, it is concluded that extra attention should be given to women who experience PGP during pregnancy to prevent serious PGP during late pregnancy and postpartum. More research is needed to confirm the roles of hours of sleep, somatisation, and bed rest in relation to PGP. © 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This narrative review explains the development of excess weight gain in babies and children. It takes a life course approach which includes genetics, pre-conception, pregnancy, infancy and childhood. The paper focuses on feeding behaviours, physical activity, parental influences and the wider social and environmental context. Risk factors which can cumulatively lead to excess childhood weight gain include: under- or overweight during pregnancy; the presence of diabetes during pregnancy; low or high birth weight; having obese parents; early weaning; prolonged formula feeding; rapid weight gain in the first year; disinhibited eating patterns and the consistent availability of energy dense food at home; feeding practices which are not responsive to the child's cues; insufficient sleep among preschool children; sedentary parents; low parental education; living in poor socio-economic circumstances; absence, or perceived absence, of safe play areas; parents who lack time or confidence to authoritatively parent; environments where there is poor access to affordable lower energy dense foods; and parents who do not accept that excess weight is a health problem. Recommendations for health professionals are made. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - There is debate concerning whether Primary snoring (PS) is a benign symptom or Sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which merits diagnostic procedures and specific therapeutic approaches.In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Second Edition (ICSD-II) (2005), snoring is defined as a respiratory sound generated in the upper airway during sleep that occurs without episodes of apnea or hypoventilation and that does not cause symptoms of daytime sleepiness or insomnia, implying the idea that snoring is a "benign symptom". Also, there are some reports that failed to determine the relationship between snoring and diurnal symptoms, such as sleepiness, describing snoring as an apparently non-pathological symptom. In addition, it has been reported that a history of loud snoring alone has not been sufficiently consistent to possess sufficient diagnostic sensitivity upon which to base a recommendation for surgery.Despite the aforementioned, air turbulence in snoring causes the irregular vibration of upper airway structures as a result of changes inupper airway configuration and properties (from the nasopharynx to the laryngopharynx) that occurs during sleep.Recently, the relationship has been described between snoring and co-morbidity (high blood pressure, cephalea, increased cerebral blood flow velocity, localized edema), risk factors (obesity, parental smoking), and nasal (deviated septum, inferior turbinate hypertrophy, polyps, chronic and allergic nasal congestion), nasopharyngeal (enlarged adenoids and nasopharyngeal growths), oral (enlarged tongue base, small jaw, enlarged uvula or tonsils), and throat and neck sources, and even asthma, masculine gender, pregnancy, substance consumption (tobacco, alcohol, sleeping pills), psychological and behavioral disturbances (anxious/depressed mood, hyperactive and inattentive behavior), cognitive deficits (diminished academic performance and executive functions), nocturnal and diurnal symptoms (insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness), and alterations in sleep architecture (rises in light sleep and awakenings and decreases in sleep efficiency and deep sleep) have been described in pediatric and adult patients with snoring.It is noteworthy that PS (without episodes of apnea, oxygen desaturation, hypoventilation) merits additional research regarding with diagnosis and management; however, it must not be considered an isolated, or benign, symptom. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To examine the continuity and discontinuity of trouble sleeping behaviors (TSB) from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood in a community-based prospective birth cohort study. Methods: The original study comprised 7223 mother-offspring pairs who were followed prospectively at pregnancy, 6. months, 5, 14 and 21. years post-delivery. Participant numbers differ by follow-up stages. There were 3184 offspring for whom we have consistently collected information on TSB retrospectively at 2-4. years, and prospectively at 14 and 21. years of age. Results: These comprised maternal-reported offspring TSB at 2-4. years and 14. years, and offspring-reported trouble sleeping at 14 and 21. years. One in two children had persistent trouble sleeping from 2-4 to 14. years and two-thirds from 14 to 21. years. In the adjusted analysis, compared with 2-4-years-old children with no trouble sleeping, those who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.44) times more likely to have trouble sleeping at 21. years. Similarly, adolescents who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.27) times more likely to experience trouble sleeping at 21. years. Conclusions: There is a continuity of TSB from early childhood through adolescence and young adulthood, although the persistence of TSB is strongest from adolescence to young adulthood. Interventions improving sleep in young children may prevent longer term difficulties in adolescents and young adults. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a devastating consequence of HIV infection during pregnancy and is largely preventable. Evidence-based interventions such as universal antenatal screening, provision of antiretroviral therapy, delivery by elective caesarean section and avoidance of breastfeeding have ensured that the rates of MTCT remain low in Malaysia. This review discusses the most recent advances in the management of HIV infection in pregnancy with emphasis on antiretroviral treatment strategies and obstetric care in a middle income country.

AB  - Benzodiazepines and so-called 'Z' drugs are used as hypnotics. Their mode of action is to enhance the activity of central γ-aminobutyric acid. Adverse effects include anterograde amnesia and paradoxical reactions. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal symptoms can develop, which may be minimized by intermittent dosing. Concurrent administration with central nervous system (CNS) depressants is not recommended as this produces additive CNS effects. Melatonin is also used as a hypnotic. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purposes: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is underdiagnosed and poorly understood by clinicians and the general public alike; accordingly, a broad literature review with information most relevant to general practice is needed to help dispel misconceptions and improve level of care. Methods: Specifically, this review comprehensively provides an epidemiological analysis of RLS and examines the risk factors and treatment options for RLS by compiling the findings of past RLS studies. These RLS studies were identified through a retrospective PubMed search. The epidemiological analysis was conducted by calculating a weighted mean average of all the relevant general population RLS prevalence studies, separated into geographical/racial categories. Results: A comprehensive analysis of RLS epidemiological studies finds the prevalence rate of RLS to be 5-15% in the general population with 2.5% of adults having symptoms severe enough to require medical intervention. Some of the risk factors for RLS include female gender, pregnancy, low iron levels, lower socioeconomic status, poor health, elderly age, comorbidity with Parkinson's disease, positive family history of RLS, and comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. A wide array of treatment options exist for RLS including pharmacological and nonpharmacologic interventions. Conclusions: Clinicians' understanding of RLS enigma has recently improved due to the increased intensity of RLS research over the past decade. This review summarizes the current findings in the RLS field as well as providing guidelines for future RLS-related research. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Importance of the field: The cholestatic liver diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders which, left untreated, usually progresses to cirrhosis and liver failure. Most are recognized before the onset of advanced fibrosis, thereby affording an opportunity for disease modifying therapy. Areas covered: This review will cover the current pharmacologic management of the most common causes of cholestatic liver disease in adults, including primary biliary cirrhosis, primary biliary cirrhosis-autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, intestinal failure-associated liver disease, and immunoglobulin G4-associated cholangitis. Pharmacologic management of complications of cholestasis will also be reviewed. Expert opinion: Effective therapy for most cholestatic liver disease is lacking. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) slows the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis but the majority of patients do not have a full response. Even in those with a complete response, UDCA does not cure the disease. There is currently no effective medical therapy for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Symptoms and serum liver biochemistry values in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are improved with UDCA, but it is not certain if this alters the course of disease. Immunoglobulin G4-associated cholangitis is responsive to steroids but may relapse. The farnesoid X receptor agonists are a promising new class of drugs currently being tested in cholestatic liver disease. © Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - H1-antihistamines are inverse agonists that combine with and stabilize inactive conformation of H1-receptors. Thus they interfere with actions of histamine at H1-receptors. They are widely used for treatment of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, urticaria, coughs, colds and insomnia. H1-antihistamines are classified as older 'first generation' and newer 'second generation'. First generation H1-antihistamines have poor receptor H1-receptor selectivity, and cross blood-brain-barrier. They have a lot of adverse events such as anti-muscarinic, anti-α-adrenergic, anti-serotonin, and sedative effects. In contrast, second generation H1-antihistamines were highly selective for the histamine H1-receptor, do not cross the blood brain barrier, and have minimal adverse events. The risks of first-generation H1-antihistamines have been clearly underestimated, particularly when purchased as nonprescribed over the counter medications by public. This review summarizes curent literature to evaluate antihistamines including their mechanism, indications and side-effects. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Stress factors impair physiological and psychological balance state of the individuals. This situation can cause various diseases. Today, diseases caused by stress are treated with methods like educational program for coping with stress, psychotherapy, drug therapy. Recently, acupuncture treatment is added to these methods. Acupuncture treatment effects to modulate various neurophysiologic mechanisms in during resistance period of stress. This mechanism provides support for the person's psychological state. Acupuncture treatment increases the secretion of hormones such as endomorphine, beta endorphine, enkephalin, serotonin and cortisol from central nervous system. Stress factors increase endomorphin, beta endorphin, enkephalin, serotonin and oxytocin levels in the central nervous system and plasma in the resistance period to stress. Acupuncture applications increase the synthesis and release of endomorphin, beta endorphin, enkephalin, serotonin and oxytocin from the central nervous system which strengthens the individual's resistance period to cope with stress. Therefore, method of acupuncture is also used in the treatment of diseases caused by stress.

AB  - The transition from fetus to newborn is the most complex adaptation that occurs in human experience. Lung adaptation requires coordinated clearance of fetal lung fluid, surfactant secretion, and onset of consistent breathing. The cardiovascular response requires striking changes in blood flow, pressures, and pulmonary vasodilation. Energy metabolism and thermoregulation must be quickly controlled. The primary mediators that prepare the fetus for birth and support the multiorgan transition are cortisol and catecholamine. Abnormalities in adaptation are frequently found following preterm birth or cesarean delivery at term, and many of these infants need delivery room resuscitation to assist in this transition. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, psychomotor regression, seizures and stereotypical hand movements. Recently, deletions and inactivating mutations in FOXG1, encoding a brain-specific transcription factor that is critical for forebrain development, have been found to be associated with the congenital variant of RTT. Here we report the clinical features and molecular characteristics of two cases of the congenital variant of RTT. We conducted mutation screenings of FOXG1 in a cohort of 15 Japanese patients with a clinical diagnosis of atypical RTT but without MECP2 and CDKL5 mutations. Two unrelated female patients had heterozygous mutations (c.256dupC, p.Gln86ProfsX35 and c.689G>A, pArg230His). Both showed neurological symptoms from the neonatal period, including hypotonia, irritability and severe microcephaly. Further, their psychomotor development was severely impaired, as indicated by their inability to sit unaided or acquire speech sounds, and they had a hyperkinetic movement disorder, because both displayed hand stereotypies and jerky movements of the upper limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed delayed myelination with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and frontal lobe. These cases confirm the involvement of FOXG1 in the molecular etiology of the congenital variant of RTT and show the characteristic features of FOXG1-related disorder. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction. Hirsutism and elevated free testosterone levels are the most consistent signs of the androgen excess. Irregular, infrequent, or absent menses and infertility are symptoms of ovulatory dysfunction. Obesity is also a feature of this syndrome and contributes to associated metabolic abnormalities. Lifestyle modification should be the first treatment and is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms. The ovulatory infertility associated with PCOS can be overcome in most cases with oral (clomiphene citrate or letrozole) or injectable (gonadotropins) agents. Surgical intervention is reserved for cases resistant to medical management. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Premenstrual psychosis has been described as a psychotic condition beginning shortly before, or during menstruation, in adolescent girls and young women. In this article, we present a case that developed sudden onset psychosis a few days before menstruation which resolved completely upon menstrual bleeding. Importantly, the recovery from psychotic symptoms was independent of antipsychotic treatment. A 30 year-old female was diagnosed with disorganized type schizophrenia ten years prior to this case study. She first suffered from auditory hallucination and persecutory delusion after her first menstrual cycle when she was in elementary school. She was treated with oral haloperidone 20 mg per day. The psychotic symptoms were frequently recurrent and her family thought the recurrence was due to poor drug compliance. The patient then started to receive long term injections of risperidone one year ago. It was discontinued because of the lack of efficacy. Aripiprazole 10 mg per day was prescribed and thereafter titrated to 20 mg per day. During the following, vivid auditory hallucination, self-talking and self-laughing were frequently noted. There was no treatment effect of aripiprazole on these psychotic symptoms. In this case antipsychotic treatment was continuously received, including haloperidone, long term injection of risperidone and aripiprazole.However, psychotic features were still recurrent even in the presence of antipsychotic treatment. This case report suggests that cyclic psychoses associated with the menstrual cycle may be a specific entity, not included under the recognized functional psychoses. In some cases, these psychoses could be classified as a subgroup of premenstrual syndromes.

AB  - Background: Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients. Methods: The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update. Results: Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered. Conclusions: Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Active fragments of neurotrophic factors release by astrocyte under the stimulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) respectively, have shown therapeutic potential for developmental delay and learning deficits. Previous work demonstrated that NAP+SAL prevent developmental delay and glial deficit in Ts65Dn that is a well-characterized mouse model for Down syndrome. The objective of this study is to evaluate if prenatal treatment with these peptides prevents the learning deficit in the Ts65Dn mice. Pregnant Ts65Dn female and control pregnant females were randomly treated (intraperitoneal injection) on pregnancy days 8 through 12 with saline (placebo) or peptides (NAP 20 μg +SAL 20 μg) daily. Learning was assessed in the offspring (8-10 months) using the Morris Watermaze, which measures the latency to find the hidden platform (decrease in latency denotes learning). The investigators were blinded to the prenatal treatment and genotype. Pups were genotyped as trisomic (Down syndrome) or euploid (control) after completion of all tests. Statistical analysis: two-way ANOVA followed by Neuman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons, P<0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. Trisomic mice who prenatally received placebo (Down syndrome -placebo; n = 11) did not demonstrate learning over the five day period. DS mice that were prenatally exposed to peptides (Down syndrome-peptides; n = 10) learned significantly better than Down syndrome -placebo (p<0.01), and similar to control-placebo (n = 33) and control-peptide (n = 30). In conclusion prenatal treatment with the neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) prevented learning deficits in a Down syndrome model. These findings highlight a possibility for the prevention of sequelae in Down syndrome and suggest a potential pregnancy intervention that may improve outcome.

AB  - Rhythmic neural network activity patterns are defining features of sleep, but interdependencies between limbic and cortical oscillations at different frequencies and their functional roles have not been fully resolved. This is particularly important given evidence linking abnormal sleep architecture and memory consolidation in psychiatric diseases. Using EEG, local field potential (LFP), and unit recordings in rats, we show that anteroposterior propagation of neocortical slow-waves coordinates timing of hippocampal ripples and prefrontal cortical spindles during NREM sleep. This coordination is selectively disrupted in a rat neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: fragmented NREM sleep and impaired slow-wave propagation in the model culminate in deficient ripple-spindle coordination and disrupted spike timing, potentially as a consequence of interneuronal abnormalities reflected by reduced parvalbumin expression. These data further define the interrelationships among slow-wave, spindle, and ripple events, indicating that sleep disturbances may be associated with state-dependent decoupling of hippocampal and cortical circuits in psychiatric diseases.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are autosomal dominant disorders classically characterized by muscle weakness, myotonia, and early-onset cataracts. Patients may also experience dysfunction of the heart, brain, gastrointestinal, endocrine, skin, and respiratory systems. The pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy is related to trinucleotide (DM1) and tetranucleotide (DM2) repeat expansions that produce toxic mutant mRNA with subsequent interference of RNA-splicing mechanisms. Optimal disease management includes symptomatic care, screens for asymptomatic disease, counseling, and a multidisciplinary approach. The authors review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic tests, and standard management of DM1 and DM2 and outline promising clinical research for patients with these disorders.

AB  - In comparison with the vast epidemiological literature on postpartum depression (PPD), relatively few studies have examined the biological aspects of the disorder. However, research into the biological mechanisms of PPD is a challenging task, as normal pregnancy and the postpartum period cause adaptive endocrine changes, which would otherwise be considered pathological in nonpregnant women. This review focuses on the adaptive changes of childbearing and nursing, which ultimately may put women at increased risk of PPD. In light of the normal physiology, the authors also attempt to describe the current evidence of the biological changes associated with the development of depression in the postpartum period, including ovarian steroids, the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis, the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, the thyroid system and inflammatory markers. In addition, current knowledge on candidate genes associated with PPD is reviewed. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.

However, the use of progesterone in the pathophysiology of pregnancy remains controversial. Progesterone, and its synthetic form 17 α- hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17 OHP-C), offer an effective intervention when the continuation of pregnancy is at risk from immunological factors, luteinic and neuroendocrine deficiencies, and myometrial hypercontractility. Progesterone has been successfully used as prophylaxis in the prevention of spontaneous miscarriage, with treatment beginning from the first trimester of pregnancy. There is substantial evidence, too, to indicate that women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage may benefit from the immunomodulatory properties of progesterone in early pregnancy. The use of progesterone and 17 OHP-C has been extensively studied in the prevention of preterm birth in a variety of settings. Transvaginal ultrasound measurement of cervical length in singleton pregnancies between 19 and 24 weeks' gestation has been deemed the best way to identify women (approximately 2% of the pregnant population) who would benefit from prophylactic progesterone treatment for the prevention of spontaneous preterm birth. This paper reviews the evidence for the safety and efficacy of the use of progesterone in each of these indications. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and maternal and neonatal morbidities in a cohort of obese gravid women. Methods: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to screen for OSA and describe the possible risk factors for and outcomes of OSA among obese (body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]] 30 or higher) pregnant women. Women underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor. Studies were manually scored by a central masked sleep reading center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea hypopnea index of 5 or more was considered diagnostic of OSA. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women with and without OSA. Results: Among 175 women, OSA prevalence was 15.4% (13 mild, 9 moderate, 5 severe). Compared with no OSA (apnea hypopnea index less than 5), the OSA group had a higher BMI (46.8±12.2 compared with 38.1±7.5; P=.002) and more chronic hypertension (55.6% compared with 32.4%, P=.02). Maternal complications included maternal death (n=1, amniotic fluid embolus [no OSA group]) and cardiac arrest (n=1, intraoperative at cesarean delivery [OSA group]). One previable birth and two stillbirths occurred in the no OSA group. Among live births, OSA was associated with more frequent cesarean delivery (65.4% compared with 32.8%; P=.003), preeclampsia (42.3% compared with 16.9%; P=.005), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (46.1% compared with 17.8%; P=.002). After controlling for BMI, maternal age, and diabetes, OSA (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-11.3), previous preeclampsia (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.09-7.19), and hypertension (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.67-10.77) were associated with development of preeclampsia. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea among obese pregnant women is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and cesarean delivery. © 2012 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Objective: To describe the development of the integrative capacity of the fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) according to gestational age and emerging behavioral states, assuming that developing integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability markers. Methods: Magnetocardiograms of 114 healthy fetuses (21-40 weeks of gestation) were recorded. Level of fetal activity (quiet/active sleep) was estimated according to characteristic heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation functions of (i) fetal heart rate and (ii) time patterns of SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal intervals) were calculated and autocorrelation was determined over different time scales. Age and activity related changes were examined using linear regression and non-parametric tests. Results: During pregnancy, autocorrelation increased in fetal heart rate signals and time patterns of SDNN and RMSSD. Short-time correlation (0-20 s) changed between 21 and 31 gestational weeks. Long-time correlation (75-300 s) accelerated later in pregnancy and did not increase in quiet heart rate patterns. Strong state-dependent changes were found with time patterns of SDNN. Conclusions: Emerging integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate fluctuations over increasing time scales. The period from 21 to 31 gestational weeks seems to be critical to ANS development. Increasing long-time correlation is specific to active sleep states.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Review recent research on the roles of gender, race/ethnicity, residential socioeconomics and age in obstructive sleep apnea syndromes (OSA) and their treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Men have a higher prevalence of OSA than women and require higher continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressures for treatment, given similar severity of OSA. When comparing age, women have less severe apnea at all ages. Menopause, pregnancy and polycystic ovarian syndrome increase the risk for OSA in women. Neck fat and BMI influence apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) severity in women; abdominal fat and neck-to-waist ratio do so in men. Obesity, craniofacial structure, lower socioeconomic status and neighborhood disadvantage may better explain ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA. Ethnicity was no longer significantly associated with OSA severity when WHO criteria for obesity were used. SUMMARY: OSA has a male predominance; women have a lower AHI than men during certain stages of sleep; women require less CPAP pressure for treatment of similar severity of OSA, and there are ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA but these may be due to environmental factors, such as living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

AB  - Supine hypotensive syndrome is characterized by severe supine hypotension in late pregnancy, whose clinical presentation ranges from minimal cardiovascular alterations to severe shock, resulting from inferior vena cava compression by gravid uterus. We report a case of a 41-year-old 39-week-pregnant woman found dead supine. Autopsy revealed the following: cyanosis of the limbs; congestion of the jugular and subclavian veins; abundant abdominal subcutaneous fatty tissue; uterus displacing intestine and diaphragm; collapsed inferior vena cava; both femoral veins dilated and filled with blood; edematous and congested lungs; and placenta 790g, fetus 3475g, amniotic fluid 800cm3. The diagnosis of supine hypotensive syndrome as the probable cause of death is supported by the position of the body and autopsy findings. This syndrome can be considered as the first stage of the physio-pathological mechanism that led to death in the case presented herein and should be considered by pathologists as a cause of sudden death. © 2012 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

AB  - Background This study presents findings on the characteristics of women who used antidepressants in pregnancy and how such mothers compare to depressed and non-depressed mothers in terms of their demographics and health across pregnancy. We also present findings on the birth outcomes for these three groups of women. Methods Data were drawn from the first wave of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). This study examined n=5,107 infants, who were assessed in their first year. Mothers reported antidepressants as a prescribed medicine over their pregnancy. Results In this nationally representative study, the 2.1% of Australian women who indicated that they took antidepressants during their pregnancy also took more general medications, were more likely to smoke and drink alcohol during pregnancy, and also reported higher depression scores at wave one and more infant sleep problems than the non-depressed control group. Infants exposed to antidepressants showed reduced length at birth. Conclusions Antidepressant use during pregnancy in Australian women is reasonably prevalent. Caution in prescription is needed given that adverse child developmental outcomes have not been ruled out by existing studies. The current findings point to the complexity of multiple in utero exposures from smoking, alcohol, depression and antidepressants impacting on child developmental outcomes. Clinical guidelines are needed to provide optimal clinical care for infants who were exposed in utero to antidepressants.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the extent of antiepileptic drug (AED) use in pregnancy, particularly for newer agents. Our objective was to assess whether AED use has increased among pregnant women in the US, 2001-2007. Methods: We analysed data from the Medication Exposure in Pregnancy Risk Evaluation Program (MEPREP) database, 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2007. We identified liveborn deliveries among women, aged 15-45 years on delivery date, who were members of MEPREP health plans (n = 585 615 deliveries). Pregnancy exposure to AEDs, determined through outpatient pharmacy dispensing files. Older AEDs were available for clinical use before 1993; other agents were considered newer AEDs. Information on sociodemographic and medical/reproductive factors was obtained from linked birth certificate files. Maternal diagnoses were identified based on ICD-9 codes. Results: Prevalence of AED use during pregnancy increased between 2001 (15.7 per 1000 deliveries) and 2007 (21.9 per 1000 deliveries), driven primarily by a fivefold increase in the use of newer AEDs. Thirteen per cent of AED-exposed deliveries involved a combination of two or more AEDs. Psychiatric disorders were the most prevalent diagnoses, followed by epileptic and pain disorders, among AED users regardless of AED type, year of conception or gestational period. Conclusions: AED use during pregnancy increased between 2001 and 2007, driven by a fivefold increase in the use of newer AEDs. Nearly one in eight AED-exposed deliveries involved the concomitant use of more than one AED. Additional investigations of the reproductive safety of newer AEDs may be needed. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Women are more commonly affected than men by restless legs syndrome, and prevalence is highest amongst those of northern European heritage. The motor manifestations include nonvolitional myoclonus (periodic leg movements). Disinhibition of spinal sensorimotor circuits may underlie these primary features and can be affected by peripheral as well as supraspinal networks. Insufficient mobilizable iron stores increase expressivity in some individuals. The sensorimotor features are relieved by dopamine, especially dopamine agonists, gabapentin and its derivatives, and opioids. A diagnosis relies on recognition of key primary and supportive features, and treatments are generally well tolerated, efficacious, and life-changing. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To identify maternal and infant characteristics associated with accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ASSB) in US infants. Using 2000-2002 US linked infant birth and death certificate cohort files, we compared ASSB deaths to survivors. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) from logistic regression were used to analyze associations between selected maternal and infant characteristics and ASSB mortality. During 2000-2002, 1,064 infants died from ASSB, resulting in an ASSB mortality rate of 9.2 per 100,000 live births. Most ASSB deaths (71%) occurred before an infant reached 4 months old. Maternal factors associated with an increased risk of ASSB were younger age (using maternal age of 25-29 years as reference aOR 2.6 for mothers <20 years old and 1.6 for mothers 20-24 years old), lower educational attainment (aOR 4.3 for <12 years and 3.3 for 12 years compared to ≥16 years), multiparity (aOR 1.7, 2.2, and 3.5 for parity 2, 3, and 4 or higher, respectively) and smoking during pregnancy (aOR 2.8). Compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks (aOR 1.8) and American Indians (aOR 1.8) were more likely to have an ASSB death. Being male and born preterm were also associated with a higher ASSB mortality risk. Younger, less educated, mulitparous, non-Hispanic black or American Indian women and their families who smoke during their pregnancy and deliver male or preterm infants, may need more intense safe sleeping education during the infant's first year of life, especially during the first 4 months of age. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - Background: Postnatal unit rooming-in promotes breastfeeding. Previous research indicates that side-cars (3-sided bassinets that lock onto the maternal bed frame) facilitate breastfeeding after vaginal birth more than stand-alone bassinets (standard rooming-in). No study has previously investigated side-car bassinet use after cesarean, despite the constraints on maternal-infant interactions that are inherent in recovery from this birth mode. Objective: To test the effect of the side-car bassinet on postnatal unit breastfeeding frequency and other maternal-infant behaviors compared to a stand-alone bassinet following cesarean birth. Methods: Participants were recruited and prenatally randomized to receive the side-car or stand-alone bassinet for their postnatal unit stay between January 2007 and March 2009 in northeastern England. Mother-infant interactions were filmed over the second postpartum night. Participants completed face-to-face interviews before and after filming. The main outcome measures were infant location, bassinet acceptability, and breastfeeding frequency. Other outcomes assessed were breastfeeding effort, maternal-infant contact, sleep states, midwife presence, and infant risk. Results: Differences in breastfeeding frequency, maternal-infant sleep overlap, and midwife presence were not statistically significant. The 20 dyads allocated to side-car bassinets breastfed a median of 0.6 bouts/ hour compared to 0.4 bouts/hour for the 15 stand-alone bassinet dyads. Participants expressed overwhelming preference for the side-car bassinets. Bed sharing was equivalent between the groups, although the motivation for this practice may have differed. Infant handling was compromised with stand-alone bassinet use, including infants positioned on pillows while bed sharing with their sleeping mothers. Conclusions: Women preferred the side-car, but differences in breastfeeding frequency were not statistically significant. More infant risks were observed with stand-alone bassinet use. © The Author(s) 2012.

Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11-17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0-4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories. Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43). Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB  - In analogy with the accepted view that behaviour is shaped by gene. ×. environment (G. ×. E) interactions, G. ×. E studies are exponentially increasing in the field of psychiatry. Whereas research was primarily driven by the premature view that negative environmental stimuli can trigger psychopathology in those subjects that are genetically predisposed, a closer look at the available data shows that G. ×. E interactions are much more complex than initially thought. Here, we discuss G. ×. E studies focussing on serotonin transporter (5-HTT, SERT, SLC6A4) gene variation in humans, monkeys, and rodents. Recent studies, across species, confirm the theorized 'for-better-and-for-worse' effect of low activity serotonin transporter genotypes. In addition, while 5-HTT. ×. E interactions were thought to take place in early life, recent evidence illustrates that these interactions are also manifested in adulthood. Therefore, we discuss data based on 5-HTT. ×. E interactions, and propose a model in which predictive adaptive responses (PARs), as shaped by early life 5-HTT. ×. E interactions, shape responses to environmental challenges in later life, i.e. reflecting 5-HTT. ×. E. ×. E interactions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gender-specific data focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) are becoming increasingly available. This is of great importance, given that CVD has become the number 1 killer of women, and unlike for men, mortality rates do not seem to be declining. Many factors are cited as the causes of sex-based differences, including delays in recognizing symptoms, underutilization of diagnostic tests and treatments, as well as anatomic, physiological, and genetic factors. Evidence of fundamental biological differences in vascular function and the underlying pathologic processes is only beginning to elucidated, motivated by growing evidence of differences in clinical presentations and outcomes between men and women. The good news is that we are starting to see improvements in outcomes for women, such as after coronary revascularization; decrease in complication rates with the advent of new techniques, such as radial access for cardiac catheterizations; as well as increased participation of women in clinical trials. The underlying mechanisms of ischemic heart disease remain to be elucidated, and will help guide therapy and ultimately may explain the higher prevalence of: subendocardial myocardial infarctions, spontaneous arterial dissections, plaque erosion, increased vasospastic disorders, such as coronary microvascular disease, and pulmonary hypertension in women compared with men. We have made great progress in understanding gender-related differences in CVDs, but much remains to be done to optimize the prevention of CVD for both men and women. (Curr Probl Cardiol © 2012.

AB  - In many cultures and countries alcohol is an integral part of the social lifestyle and cultural celebrations. Once the legitimate age for alcohol consumption is reached there are few reasons for the complete abstinence of alcohol consumption, with the exception of pregnancy. The detrimental effects of alcohol consumption during this time are well documented and policy recommendations are clear in their abstinence message. Based on these directives it is apparent that education campaigns to reduce alcohol consumption antenatally have been effective. Internationally policy direction for alcohol consumption in the postnatal period is unclear and often non-existent despite that postnatal alcohol consumption in lactating women also has the potential to cause harmful effects in the new born infant. Alcohol enters the breastmilk within 30 - 60 minutes after maternal ingestion and if transferred to the infant through the breastmilk can result in immediate changes in sleep-wake patterning behaviours. Research surrounding recommendations for lactating women is limited due to ethical reasons, however with correct timing alcohol consumption during the period of lactation is a possibility. There have been recommendations for caution in consuming alcohol while breastfeeding for some years however these have often not been discreet from the recommendations for pregnancy. Currently alcohol policy differs considerably both internationally and within the same country. Unlike the universal adoption of public health policy for abstinence during pregnancy the implementation of policy for breastfeeding women has been less progressive. It is anticipated that the universal adoption of congruent alcohol policy will help support the safe consumption of alcohol and promote the extended duration of breastfeeding. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a non-pregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in brain regions known to regulate the sleep/wake cycle and body temperature might reflect altered rhythms in these overt functions. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS in early pregnant and diestrous rats in the medial septum (MS), vertical and horizontal diagonal bands of Broca (VDB and HDB), perifornical lateral hypothalamus (LH), and ventrolateral, medial, and median preoptic areas (VLPO, MPA, and MnPO, respectively). In the pregnant animals, FOS expression was reduced and the daily rhythms of expression were lost or attenuated in the MS, VDB, and LH, areas known to support wakefulness, and in the MPA, a brain region that may coordinate sleep/wake patterns with temperature changes. However, despite the well-documented differences in sleep patterns between diestrous and pregnant rats, reproductive state did not affect FOS expression in the VLPO or MnPO, two brain regions in which FOS expression usually correlates with sleep. These data indicate that plasticity in sleep/wake patterns during early pregnancy may be driven by a reduction in wakefulness-promotion by the brain, rather than by an increase in sleep drive. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Obesity in men is associated with infertility in numerous studies, and the temporal trend for a decline in semen parameters parallels the increasing prevalence of obesity in the developed world. In addition to impaired semen quality, fertility among obese men may be affected by decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. This spectrum of expression of hypogonadism among obese men originates from multiple interacting factors including reduced levels of gonadotropins and testosterone, altered androgen-to-estrogen ratios, insulin resistance, and sleep apnea. No evidence-based treatment that increases the likelihood of pregnancy for the infertility associated with male obesity has been demonstrated to date. Interventions associated with improvement of intermediate outcomes that include the endocrine profile, semen parameters, and sexual function may be appropriately selected based on history, physical findings, as well as endocrine and metabolic evaluation. Among these interventions are weight loss through lifestyle change, relief from sleep apnea, use of aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin administration, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and insulin-sensitizing agents.

AB  - Purpose: Identify epilepsy-associated factors and calculate measures of impact, stigma, quality of life (QOL), knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) and treatment gap in Prey Veng, Cambodia. Methods: This first Cambodian population-based case-control study had 96 epileptologist-confirmed epilepsy cases and 192 randomly selected matched healthy controls. Standard questionnaires, which have been used in similar settings, were used for collecting data on various parameters. Univariate and multivariate regression was done to determine odds ratios. Jacoby stigma, 31-item QOL, KAP etc were determined and so were the factors associated with them using STATA software. Treatment gap was measured using direct method. Key findings: Multivariate analyses yielded family history of epilepsy, difficult or long delivery, other problems beside seizures (mainly mental retardation, hyperthermia), and eventful pregnancy of the subject's mother as factors associated with epilepsy. There was high frequency of seizure precipitants esp. those related to sleep. Population attributable risk (%) was: family history (15.0), eventful pregnancy of subject's mother (14.5), long/difficult birth (6.5), and other problem beside seizures (20.0). Mean stigma (1.9±1.1, on a scale of 3) was mainly related to treatment efficacy. Mean QOL (5.0±1.4 on a scale of 10) was mainly related to treatment regularity. Cause or risk factor could be determined in 56% of cases. Treatment gap was 65.8%. Significance: Factors in pre- and perinatal period were found to be most crucial for epilepsy risk in Cambodia which inturn provides major prevention opportunities. A global action plan for treatment, stigma reduction and improvement of QOL should be set-up in this country. © 2012 Bhalla et al.

AB  - It has been proposed that the underlying epileptic process is mediated by changes in both excitatory and inhibitory circuits leading to the formation of hyper-excitable seizure networks. In this review we aim to shed light on the many physiological factors that modulate excitability within these networks. These factors have been discussed extensively in many reviews each as a separate entity and cannot be extensively covered in a single manuscript. Thus for the purpose of this work in which we aim to bring those factors together to explain how they interact with epilepsy, we only provide brief descriptions. We present reported evidence supporting the existence of the epileptic brain in several states; interictal, peri-ictal and ictal, each with distinct excitability features. We then provide an overview of how many physiological factors influence the excitatory/inhibitory balance within the interictal state, where the networks are presumed to be functioning normally. We conclude that these changes result in constantly changing states of cortical excitability in patients with epilepsy. © 2012 IBRO.

AB  - Autonomic information flow (AIF) characterizes fetal heart rate (FHR) variability (fHRV) in the time scale dependent complexity domain and discriminates sleep states [high voltage/low frequency (HV/LF) and low voltage/high frequency (LV/HF) electrocortical activity (ECoG)]. However, the physiologic relationship of AIF time scales to the underlying sympathetic and vagal rhythms is not known. Understanding this relationship will enhance the benefits derived from using fHRV to monitor fetal health non-invasively. We analyzed AIF measured as Kullback-Leibler entropy (KLE) in fetal sheep in late gestation as function of vagal and sympathetic modulation of fHRV, using atropine and propranolol, respectively (n = 6), and also analyzed changes in fHRV during sleep states (n = 12). Atropine blockade resulted in complexity decrease at 2.5 Hz compared to baseline HV/LF and LV/HF states and at 1.6 Hz compared to LV/HF. Propranolol blockade resulted in complexity increase in the 0.8-1 Hz range compared to LV/HF and in no changes when compared to HV/LF. During LV/HF state activity, fHRV complexity was lower at 2.5 Hz and higher at 0.15-0.19 Hz than during HV/LF. Our findings show that in mature fetuses near term vagal activity contributes to fHRV complexity on a wider range of time scales than sympathetic activity. Related to sleep, during LV/HF we found lower complexity at short-term time scale where complexity is also decreased due to vagal blockade. We conclude that vagal and sympathetic modulations of fHRV show sleep state-dependent and time scale-dependent complexity patterns captured by AIF analysis of fHRV. Specifically, we observed a vagally mediated and sleep state-dependent change in these patterns at a time scale around 2.5 Hz (0.2 s). A paradigm of state-dependent non-linear sympathovagal modulation of fHRV is discussed. © 2012 Frasch, Frank, Last and Müller.

AB  - In the search of the sleep substance, many studies have been addressed for different hormones, responsible for sleep-wake cycle regulation. In this article we mentioned the participation of steroid hormones, besides its role regulating sexual behavior, they influence importantly in the sleep process. One of the clearest relationships are that estrogen and progesterone have, that causing changes in sleep patterns associated with the hormonal cycles of women throughout life, from puberty to menopause and specific periods such as pregnancy and the menstrual cycle, including being responsible for some sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and insomnia. Another studied hormone is cortisol, a hormone released in stressful situations, when an individual must react to an extraordinary demand that threatens their survival, but also known as the hormone of awakening because the release peak occurs in the morning, although this may be altered in some sleep disorders like insomnia and mood disorders. Furthermore neurosteroids such as pregnanolone, allopregnanolone and pregnenolone are involved in the generation of slow wave sleep, the effect has been demonstrated in experimental animal studies. Thus we see that the sleep and the endocrine system saved a bidirectional relationship in which depends on each other to regulate different physiological processes including sleep. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background: Psychiatric disorders have been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints and disorders among pregnant women with psychiatric disorders.Methods: A cohort of 1,332 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We ascertained psychiatric diagnosis status and collect information about sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Approximately 5.1% of the cohort (n=68) reported having a physician-diagnosis of mood or anxiety disorder before interview. Compared with women without a psychiatric diagnosis, the multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) for short sleep duration in early pregnancy (≤6 hours) were 1.95 (1.03-3.69). The corresponding OR (95%CI) for long sleep duration (≥9 hours) during early pregnancy was 1.13 (0.63-2.03). Women with psychiatric disorders had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR=2.41; 95%CI 1.46-4.00) and elevated perceived stress (OR=3.33; 95%CI 1.89-5.88). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight/obese women.Conclusions: Women with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to report short sleep durations, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent mood/anxiety-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women. © 2012 Qiu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Circadian rhythm disorders represent an important component underlying the pathology of depression. One of the subtypes of depression, in which these disorders may play a crucial role, is the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The bright light therapy (BLT) has been reported as a novel, promising treatment method for SAD since 1984, and most of the data revealing its efficacy has been referred to adult patients, without comorbid disorders. However, in the recent years, more and more reports have been presented, which confirm the usefulness of BLT in some specific subpopulations of patients, including children, adolescents and pregnant women. The present review summarizes the applications of BLT in antepartum depression, childhood and adolescence depression as well as in patients suffering from eating disorders. Although the body of evidence is still too small to recommend the use of BLT as the first line of treatment for the depression or eating disorders in these patient subpopulations; it appears that BLT may be a useful alternative or adjunctive therapy for these diseases. However, the specific clinical applications of BLT in these areas need further investigation. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by upper airway collapse and obstruction during sleep. It is estimated to affect nearly 5% of the general female population. Obesity is often associated with OSA. The physiological changes associated with pregnancy may increase the severity of OSA with a higher risk of maternal and fetal morbidity. However, very few parturients are diagnosed during pregnancy. These undiagnosed parturients pose great challenge to the attending anaesthesiologist during the perioperative period. Parturients at risk should be screened for OSA, and if diagnosed, treated. This review describes the anaesthetic concerns in obese parturients at risk for OSA presenting to the labor and delivery unit.

AB  - Study Objectives: We compared sleep problems during pregnancy and sleep dissatisfaction 18 months after pregnancy in pregnant women with binge eating disorder (BED) symptoms and pregnant women without an eating disorder. Design: Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Patients or Participants: Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent). Measurements and Results: Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01). Conclusions: BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if reproductive experience is associated with cumulative effects on human memory performance during pregnancy and if these effects persist into the postpartum period. Methods: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The data indicate that the previously documented adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality. Conclusions: Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Taiwanese women. Methods: We enrolled 461 pregnant women (18-45. years) admitted at Mackay Memorial Hospital for delivery from September 2010 to May 2011. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included assessment of RLS diagnostic criteria, and questions related to RLS. Results: The overall prevalence rate of RLS among the study participants was 10.4%; 2.8% were categorized as having chronic RLS. Participants without RLS reported higher folate and iron supplement consumption than those with RLS. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations of RLS with anemia and peptic ulcer disease. Participants with transient RLS during pregnancy reported more regular coffee consumption before pregnancy, and better sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, than those with chronic RLS. Overall, 81.2% of RLS sufferers reported sleep disturbances. Conclusions: Our study revealed highly prevalent but poorly recognized RLS among Taiwanese pregnant women. The identification of predictors such as medical comorbidities, and protectors such as folate and iron supplements, is warranted for obstetric RLS. In most cases, symptoms began during the second or third trimester and resolved within a week after delivery. Restricted coffee consumption before pregnancy is encouraged, but further evidence is needed to support this recommendation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background. Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design. This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods. Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21-40years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results. Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion. When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Methods An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA1c levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses. Results Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA1c (p=0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p=0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Conclusions Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA1c and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

AB  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e. g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause. © 2012 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common pregnancy complication. However, it is often overlooked by medical practitioners and patients alike. This study aimed to describe CTS in relation to pregnancy and assess how significant the disease was among pregnant women. Methods In a prospective cross-sectional study, 333 respondents were randomly selected from among pregnant women attending the primary care maternal health clinic in a university hospital. CTS was diagnosed clinically based on patient history and physical examination. The severity of CTS was assessed using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. Symptomatic respondents were asked whether they had mentioned their problems to doctors and received appropriate treatment. Resu lts 82 (24.6%) pregnant women presented with symptoms of CTS, a majority of whom were ethnic Malays (Malay 87.8%; non-Malay 12.2%). The risk for developing CTS during the third trimester of pregnancy was found to be two-fold among Malay women compared to patients of other ethnicities (odds ratio 2.262; 95% confidence interval 1.10-4.46; p = 0.024). The commonest complaint was daytime numbness (76.8%). The severity of CTS among patients was predominantly mild (80.5%), and the symptoms were severe enough to affect hand function in approximately onethird (34.1%) of the group. However, only 25.6% of symptomatic patients mentioned their problems to their doctors, and of these, 9.5% received treatment. Conclusion CTS is prevalent in the third trimester of pregnancy, especially among Malay women, in whom the risk of developing the syndrome is two-fold. Yet, this troublesome complication of pregnancy appears to be under-recognised, with most patients not being treated appropriately.

AB  - Fulminant Type 1 diabetes is a subtype of Type 1 diabetes characterized by (1) abrupt onset of diabetes, (2) very short duration of hyperglycaemia with mildly elevated HbA1c (&lt;69mmol/mol, 8.5%), (3) rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis, (4) very low C-peptide level, and (5) often associated with elevated serum pancreatic enzymes, and absence of diabetes-related autoantibodies. We encountered a case of fulminant Type 1 diabetes that developed with an initial manifestation of the insulin autoimmune syndrome and rapidly progressed to diabetic ketoacidosis during pregnancy. A 31-year-old Korean woman presented with recurrent sudden onset of sweating and change of consciousness during sleep at 19weeks gestation. During a 72-h fasting test, hypoglycaemia (1.72mmol/l) occurred at 4h after the start of the test. At that time, there was a high insulin level (370.2μU/ml), a paradoxically low C-peptide level (0.01nmol/l) and a positive insulin autoantibody test. An oral glucose tolerance test revealed postprandial hyperglycaemia. She was initially diagnosed as the insulin autoimmune syndrome. On the day 5 of admission, she developed diabetic ketoacidosis. Her HbA1c was 62mmol/mol (7.8%). The rapid progression of diabetic ketoacidosis altered the diagnosis to fulminant Type 1 diabetes. This case differed from typical fulminant Type 1 diabetes because it presented with hypoglycaemia, and positive insulin and anti-phospholipid antibody tests. Her HLA typing was HLA-DQA1*0302, 0501, HLA-DRB1*0301 (DR3), 0901(DR9). Her glucose level was subsequently very well controlled with multiple insulin injections and she successfully delivered a healthy baby. © 2012 The Authors. Diabetic Medicine © 2012 Diabetes UK.

AB  - Summary: Narcolepsy and other syndromes associated with excessive daytime sleepiness can be challenging to treat. New classifications now distinguish narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency (also called type 1 narcolepsy), a lifelong disorder with well-established diagnostic procedures and etiology, from other syndromes with hypersomnolence of unknown causes. Klein-Levin Syndrome, a periodic hypersomnia associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, is also considered a separate entity with separate therapeutic protocols. Non hypocretin-related hypersomnia syndromes are diagnoses of exclusion. These diagnoses are only made after eliminating sleep deprivation, sleep apnea, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and psychiatric comorbidities as the primary cause of daytime sleepiness. The treatment of narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency is well-codified, and involves pharmacotherapies using sodium oxybate, stimulants, and/or antidepressants, plus behavioral modifications. These therapies are almost always needed, and the risk-to-benefit ratio is clear, notably in children. Detailed knowledge of the pharmacological profile of each compound is needed to optimize use. Treatment for other syndromes with hypersomnolence is more challenging and less codified. Preferably, therapy should be conservative (such as modafinil, atomoxetine, behavioral modifications), but it may have to be more aggressive (high-dose stimulants, sodium oxybate, etc.) on a case-by-case, empirical trial basis. As cause and evolution are unknown in these conditions, it is important to challenge diagnosis and therapy over time, keeping in mind the possibility of tolerance and the development of stimulant addiction. Kleine-Levin Syndrome is usually best left untreated, although lithium can be considered in severe cases with frequent episodes. Guidelines are provided based on the literature and personal experience of the author. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - We analyzed the effectiveness of linear short- and long-term variability time domain parameters, an index of sympatho-vagal balance (SDNN/RMSSD) and entropy in differentiating fetal heart rate patterns (fHRPs) on the fetal heart rate (fHR) series of 5, 3 and 2min duration reconstructed from 46 fetal magnetocardiograms. Gestational age (GA) varied from 21 to 38 weeks. FHRPs were classified based on the fHR standard deviation. In sleep states, we observed that vagal influence increased with GA, and entropy significantly increased (decreased) with GA (SDNN/RMSSD), demonstrating that a prevalence of vagal activity with autonomous nervous system maturation may be associated with increased sleep state complexity. In active wakefulness, we observed a significant negative (positive) correlation of short-term (long-term) variability parameters with SDNN/RMSSD. ANOVA statistics demonstrated that long-term irregularity and standard deviation of normal-to-normal beat intervals (SDNN) best differentiated among fHRPs. Our results confirm that short- and long-term variability parameters are useful to differentiate between quiet and active states, and that entropy improves the characterization of sleep states. All measures differentiated fHRPs more effectively on very short HR series, as a result of the fMCG high temporal resolution and of the intrinsic timescales of the events that originate the different fHRPs. © 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - Comorbidity may be defined as the association of two or more diseases in individuals at a frequency greater than that expected statistically by chance. Studying the cooccurrence of two disorders requires a careful statistical analysis before any clear conclusion on causality is reached. Many studies have looked for an association between migraine and many diseases, reporting several sometimes controversial comorbidities in migraine subjects. Although migraine is more common in women than in men, very few studies have analyzed the comorbidity of perimenstrual migraine, a migraine sub-type characterized by attacks of migraine without aura related to menstruation. We review the studies on migraine comorbidities, particularly migraine without aura in women. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - PRRT2 is the gene recently associated with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), benign familial infantile epilepsy, and choreoathetosis infantile convulsions. We report four family members with PRRT2 mutations who had heterogeneous paroxysmal disorders. The index patient had transient infantile paroxysmal torticollis, then benign infantile epilepsy that responded to carbamazepine. The index patient's father had PKD and migraine with aphasia, and his two brothers had hemiplegic migraine with onset in childhood. All four family members had the same PRRT2 c.649dupC mutation. We conclude that heterogeneous paroxysmal disorders are associated with PRRT2 mutations and include paroxysmal torticollis and hemiplegic migraine. We propose that PRRT2 is a new gene for hemiplegic migraine. © The Authors. Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology © 2012 Mac Keith Press.

AB  - Introduction: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder typically affecting young, obese women, producing a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without identifiable cause. State of the art: Despite a large number of hypotheses and publications over the past decade, the etiology of IIH is still unknown. There continues to be no evidence-based consensus or formal guidelines regarding management and treatment of the disease. Treatment studies show that the diagnostic lumbar puncture is a valuable intervention beyond its diagnostic importance, and that weight management is critical. However, many questions remain, regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and cerebral transverse venous sinus stenting. Identification of subgroups of patients at high-risk for irreversible visual loss, such as black patients, men, morbidly obese patients, and patients with fulminant IIH, helps determine management approaches and refine follow-up strategies. Perspective: Better understanding of the pathophysiology and ongoing clinical trials will hopefully help inform treatment strategies over the next few years. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Having the right care is essential for the wellbeing of all people with diabetes. There is a minimum level of health care that every person with diabetes should expect. In 2010, Diabetes UK produced a list of 15 essential checks and services that people with diabetes should expect to receive. We wanted to assess whether we were adequately achieving all of these targets in our own diabetes service and assess whether the targets were themselves adequate and appropriate. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 200 randomly selected patients attending the diabetes review clinic in a district general hospital. We recorded whether the parameters outlined in the Diabetes UK '15 health care essentials' had been achieved in the last 12 months and then collated the data. The data showed that we scored well in terms of monitoring HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, retinal screening and cholesterol. However, we scored sub-optimally in terms of the following parameters: smoking cessation, pregnancy planning, structured education, measurement of waist circumference and psychological assessment. In conclusion, the Diabetes UK 'essentials' checklist may be viewed as mechanistic, but it provides a useful starting point to assess the effectiveness of a diabetes service in providing the basics of patient care in much the same way as the WHO surgical checklist reduces adverse outcomes. We have been able to see where the deficiencies in our own service lie and have made amends to ensure that these areas are covered in future. One issue that arose is that there are certain other 'essentials' that would be good to include in such a checklist, such as: erectile dysfunction (as suggested by the NICE guidelines), obstructive sleep apnoea, vitamin D deficiency, neuropathy screening and monitoring of liver function to rule out incipient steatohepatitis/fatty liver disease.

AB  - The study aims were twofold: 1) identify the localization and the cytoarchitecture of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) in the human fetus and infant and 2) ascertain if the RTN, given its essential role in animal studies for the maintenance of breathing and chemoreception, showed abnormalities in victims of sudden perinatal and infant death (sudden intrauterine unexplained death/SIUD - and sudden infant death syndrome/SIDS). We examined SIDS and SIUD cases and Controls (n = 58) from 34 gestational weeks to 8. months of postnatal age by complete autopsy, in-depth autonomic nervous system histological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis of the PHOX2B gene, a transcriptional factor involved in Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome that has been defined as a marker of rat RTN neurons.We identified a group of PHOX2B-immunopositive neurons within the caudal pons, contiguous to the facial/parafacial complex, in 90% of Controls, likely the homologous human RTN (hRTN). We observed structural and/or PHOX2B-expression abnormalities of the hRTN in 71% of SIUD/SIDS cases vs 10% of Controls (p < 0.05).In conclusion we suggest that developmental abnormalities of the hRTN may seriously compromise chemoreception control, playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of both SIUD and SIDS. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While women have a higher objective sleep efficiency than do men, they paradoxically report more sleep problems. It is unclear whether the reporting gap is a descriptive difference or measurement problem. Certainly, some sleep disorders, such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and hypersomnolence, are more frequent in women, whereas others, such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), are more prevalent in men. This chapter reviews gender-specific sleep disorders and the impact of pair-sleeping in the context of sex differences in sleep, reproductive phases, and circadian timing across the life span. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

AB  - The development of the EEG during childhood takes place in a typical, but individually variable way. The period of EEG maturation lasts from the 16th Week of gestation into early adulthood and undergoes, both during wakefulness and sleep, characteristic phases with typical EEG patterns, which differ to some extent from those of mature adult EEGs. This article will provide an overview of the maturation of EEG background activity and, as far as they are known, of their normal variants in the course of childhood. In the immature EEG of the preterm infant, the EEG-patterns of conventional EEG-recordings are compared to those of amplitude-integrated EEGs. In the EEG of later childhood, typical patterns of maturation are demonstrated and the main pathologic differential diagnoses of these signs of normal brain-development are mentioned. © 2012.

AB  - Atripla is the first once-daily, single-tablet, triple-combination antiretroviral therapy. It is recommended for the initial treatment of the naïve patient with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in all current guidelines, based on its proven efficacy in numerous head-to-head randomized clinical trials. Not only has it proven efficacy, but the fixed-dose combination, Atripla, has resulted in an improvement in adherence, quality of life, and satisfaction among naïve as well as virally suppressed patients switching from another regimen. Despite the advantages, tolerability issues can arise that are related primarily to the efavirenz component, which is known to cause central nervous side effects such as dizziness, abnormal dreams, and anxiety. Although generally self-limited, these side-effects can lead to treatment discontinuation in the short- or long-term. Based on the observation of neural tube defects in macaque models, and isolated case reports in human fetuses with first trimester exposure, it is rated as Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category D, and considered as contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy where alternatives are available. Given the low genetic barrier of each of the individual components, resistance remains an important issue for patients with poor adherence, but is balanced in part by the long half-life of the drugs. Transmitted resistance is described in up to 16% of newly infected patients in population surveys, and is particularly prevalent in men who have sex with men. Minority variants that may impart resistant to efavirenz are not detected with currently used HIV-1 genotype assays, but nonetheless may also be implicated in patients who fail initial treatment. Several single-tablet regimens are recently licensed or in development that will challenge Atripla as the single-tablet first-line option, but none have shown superior efficacy to date. © 2012 Rebick and Walmsley, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Togo is one of the poorest countries on our planet. The lack of knowledge of good hygiene practices compounded by the scarcity of resources in health facilities affects the chances of survival for children and pregnant women. Plan France and its partners developed a 42 month pilot project aimed at reducing mortality in children under five years of age and pregnant women in Togo by teaching good practice guidelines in prevention and care developed by the WHO. The project, which was implemented in the East Mono district (Plateau region), required a high level of involvement from the beneficiary communities as well as from representatives of the Ministry of Health. Three hundred and ten community health agents received training in the prevention of health risks in children under 5 and pregnant women as well as the management of simple cases of illness in children and newborns. They were provided with educational material, mosquito nets for demonstration, bicycles and pharmacy boxes. The main target groups for the project were children under 5 years of age (more than 17,000) and pregnant women (over 1600). Close to 90,000 inhabitants from 52 communities benefited indirectly from the project, through awareness-raising, the improvement of skills among health centre personnel and better access to drugs. The final evaluation of the project showed that the involvement of all actors was considerable. Many positive impacts were observed both in prevention and care practices in the communities involved and the state of health of the target groups. For instance the proportion of children under the age of five who sleep under ITMN increased from 9.5% in 2004 (before the project) to 88.7% in 2010 (end of project). The Ministry of Health wishes to extend the project to other health districts throughout the country, but one of the difficulties will be the compensation of CHAs which requires financial resources that are not available. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Clock-gene proteins are expressed in mammals in neurons of the hypothalamus suprachiasmatic nucleus and of other CNS structures, in muscles, viscercal organs, and vessels, and form circadian rhythms of many functions. Little is known about the factors of formation of the circadian mechanism at the prenatal period. In rats the E20 stage is characterized by a high level of oxytocin and selective expression of the first protein of the clock-genes PER1. The foal of the present study was to check the suggestion about the positive feedback between PER1 and oxytocin at the prenatal period as well as to elucidate a possible role of PER1 in regulation of interactions between oxytocin and GABA at the period of formation of the cerebral circadian mechanism of clock-genes. With aid of western-blotting, we analyzed the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from anterior hypothalamus homogenate in pregnant females and embryos of rats (E20). The retinol metabolites through their nuclear receptor RORalpha are known to be bound to promoters of genes of oxytocin and per 1. Next day after administration of retinol to the females, a rise of PER1 content was noted in their cytoplasm, whereas in their embryos the PER1 content was elevated in the nucleus. In the embryo cytoplasm there was a significant rise of production of oxytocin receptors and a decrease of the level of enzymes of GABA synthesis (glutamate decarboxylases 67 and 65). The results indicate the oxytocin- and retinol-dependent increase of the PER1 expression and the subsequent change of ratio of efficiency of oxytocin and GABA at the prenatal stage of formation of the circadian clock-mechanism of the rat embryo anterior hypothalamus.

AB  - Introduction: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in non-pregnant samples. However, it is not yet known whether CSA is associated with HPA dysregulation over pregnancy. In the present study we assessed whether maternal cortisol levels across pregnancy differed in women with CSA histories compared to women with histories of non-sexual child abuse (CA) and no abuse (NA). Methods: 135 pregnant mothers (CSA = 30, CA = 58, NA = 47) provided salivary cortisol samples at wakeup, wake +30. min, and bedtime for 3 consecutive days at 1-3 time points over second and third trimester. Cortisol awakening responses and slopes were computed. Results: Women with CSA histories displayed increasing cortisol awakening response over pregnancy compared to women with CA and NA histories. Group differences were not observed for slope. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that cortisol awakening responses increase over pregnancy in women with CSA histories compared to women with CA and NA histories. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gestational diabetes is associated with increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Activation of sympathetic nervous system affects blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet activation by several mechanisms. We aimed to study the relationship of sympathetic nervous system, coagulation and platelet function in gestational diabetes. Forty-one white women with gestational diabetes, 22 healthy pregnant and 14 nonpregnant controls were studied. We assayed serial nocturnal (at 12 p.m., 4 a.m. and 7 a.m.) changes of the adrenergic transmitter noradrenaline, coagulation variables and platelet activation with PFA-100. Plasma noradrenaline increased from 4 to 7 a.m. in both pregnant groups. During the same time period, prothrombin time (PT) shortened in gestational diabetes compared with healthy pregnant and nonpregnant controls. In gestational diabetes, nocturnal FVIII:C levels were lower compared with normal pregnancy and also variables associated with von Willebrand factor tended to be lower. Platelet activity increased at midnight in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women without differences between gestational diabetes and normal pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is associated with concomitant early morning sympathetic stimulation and activation of extrinsic coagulation pathway (shortened PT). Decreased FVIII:C may refer to compensatory anticoagulatory mechanism. These alterations could reflect increased risk of pregnancy-related thromboembolism in gestational diabetes. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - The respiratory system provides continuous homeostasis of partial pressures of arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels during constantly changing physiologic conditions. This system responds promptly to subtle variations in metabolism. Modifications occur in the regulation and control of respiration with the onset of sleep, which differ with specific sleep stages. These alterations can lead to sleep-related breathing disorders and limit the usual respiratory compensatory changes to specific disease states. This article reviews the normal physiology of respiration in both awake and sleep states, and discusses the effects of common disease processes and medications on the respiratory physiology of sleep. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the relationship of anxiety and quality of life and sleep variables to recurrent miscarriages (RMs) in patients during two stages of their treatment in an RM-dedicated clinic - before and after the evaluation and determine what factors could aggravate anxiety and worsen global well-being outcomes. Study design: Thirty-nine women who had experienced two or more RMs were measured before and after their evaluation and investigation in the RM clinic. A battery of questionnaires including the STAI scale and various instruments were administered to record anxiety, mental, and physical components of quality of life and sleep quality. Several statistical tests including canonical correlation were performed. Results: All the patients revealed a mild to moderate level of anxiety, low numbers of physical and mental health but reasonably normal values of the global quality of sleep. The evaluation in the RM clinic and investigation for possible causes accounting for RM did not significantly change anxiety levels. The children-to-pregnancies ratio introduced into the analysis proved to correlate significantly with the sleep quality and mental health. Summarized anxiety in a given RM woman could be predicted based on the set of the variables, characterizing the woman's reproductive status and her psychological health. Conclusions: This study establishes anxiety as a common response in RM patients, and suggests factors that predict it. Knowing these factors may help clinicians to identify more accurately those RM patients who would be prone to a high level of anxiety and therefore need more attention and reassurance. © by Walter de Gruyter.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as increased motor activity and elevated anxiety, that may last a lifetime. Persistent sleep disruption may underlie these problems. Using a rat model, we investigated long-term alterations of sleep-wake behavior following AE during a critical early developmental period. Male rats received 2.6. g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group), or were sham-intubated (S group). On PD52-80, they were instrumented for tethered electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram recording and habituated to the recording procedures. Sleep-wake behavior was then recorded during one 24. h-long session. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored in 10. s epochs during 6. h of the lights-on (rest) and 6. h of the lights-off (active) periods. During the active period, REMS percentage was significantly lower (4.7. ±. 0.9 (SE) . vs. 8.2. ±. 0.9; . p<. 0.02) and the percentage of SWS tended to be lower (p=0.07) in AE than S rats (N=6/group). During the rest period, sleep and wake amounts did not differ between the groups, but AE rats had longer latency to both SWS and REMS onset (. p=. 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). Our data demonstrate that, in a rat model of prenatal AE, impaired sleep-wake behavior persists into the adulthood. Disordered sleep may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral disorders seen in human victims of prenatal AE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To assess characteristics of short sleepers and long sleepers and to assess association between sleep duration and central obesity in a population-based sample of women. Method: Non-pregnant women 20. years that were randomly selected from the population-registry of Uppsala, Sweden, answered a questionnaire (n= 6461) including questions on sleeping habits and somatic disorders. Results: There was a U-shaped association between sleep duration and waist circumference. Short sleeping women (<5. h) had a waist circumference of 89.2. ±. 14.9. cm (mean. ±. SD) decreasing to 82.9. ±. 11.9. cm for women sleeping 7-<8. h and increasing to 89.0. ±. 16.7. cm for women sleeping 10. h. Both short sleepers and long sleepers were more often physically inactive, smokers, ill or taking medication, and psychologically distressed than normal sleepers (6-<9. h). In women <50. years both short and long sleep duration were risk factors for central obesity. Short sleep duration remained a risk factor for central obesity, whereas the association with long sleep duration did not reach statistical significance after adjustments. Conclusions: Short sleepers and long sleepers showed differences in characteristics compared to normal sleepers. Furthermore, we showed an independent association between short sleep duration and central obesity, which was strongest in younger women. It is important to identify short sleepers, especially in younger women. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare disorder characterized by alveolar hypoventilation and autonomic dysregulation, is caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene. Most mutations occur de novo, but recent evidence suggests that up to 25% are inherited from asymptomatic parents with somatic mosaicism for these mutations. However, to date, germline mosaicism has not been reported. This report describes a family with recurrence of PHOX2B mutation-confirmed CCHS due to germline mosaicism. The first occurrence was a baby girl, noted on day 2 of life to have multiple episodes of apnea, bradycardia, and cyanosis while breathing room air. PHOX2B gene testing confirmed the diagnosis of CCHS with a heterozygous polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (PARM); genotype 20/27 (normal 20/20). Both parents tested negative for this mutation using fragment analysis (limit of detection <1%). Upon subsequent pregnancy [paternity confirmed using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis], amniocentesis testing identified the PHOX2B 20/27 genotype, confirmed with repeat testing. Elective abortion was performed at 21.5 weeks gestation. Testing of abortus tissue confirmed amniocentesis testing. The PHOX2B 20/27 expansion was not observed in a paternal sperm sample. This case represents the first reported family with recurrence of PHOX2B mutation-confirmed CCHS without detection of a parental carrier state or mosaicism, confirming the previously hypothesized possibility of germline mosaicism for PHOX2B mutations. This is an important finding for genetic counseling of CCHS families, suggesting that even if somatic mosaicism is not detected in parental samples, there is still reason for careful genetic counseling and consideration of prenatal testing during subsequent pregnancies. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - From 2006 to 2008, 261 women in the United Kingdom died either as a direct or indirect result of pregnancy. More than half of these received critical care input. The support required varied from observation and supportive management to multi-organ support. In many women death occurred despite optimal care, but in a number substandard care was identified when the cases were reviewed as part of the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths. An understanding of the different types of organ support and treatment that are available in a critical care setting and when these are indicated is therefore crucial for medical professionals caring for these unwell obstetric patients.Described here are the technical aspects of organ support that can be utilized in a critical care setting and the alterations in physiology that occur in pregnancy which influence the use of each treatment modality. Also highlighted in more detail are conditions that are common or life threatening in pregnancy and key points about management of these conditions when they mandate critical care support. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A complete diagnosis of epilepsy involves the diagnosis of seizures (based on the clinical history), the epileptic syndrome, and the underlying aetiology. Epilepsy may be genetic or have a structural or metabolic cause (identified or unknown). The most common differential diagnoses are syncope and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Seizures may be generalized or focal, and take different forms. All patients developing seizures should have an ECG, and neuroimaging should be undertaken in all patients developing epilepsy in whom a focal cause is suspected, with the exception of genetic focal epilepsies. Antiepileptic medication should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient, with particular reference to the seizure type(s) and epilepsy syndrome. Other needs, such as the likelihood of pregnancy, and the presence of co-morbidities including learning disability and psychiatric disorders also need to be taken into account. Patients not responding to antiepileptic drugs may be candidates for surgery. The need for ongoing medication should be regularly reviewed in patients in long-term remission. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Certain causes of newborn mortality such as sudden unexpected infant death, which includes sleep-related infant death and sudden unexplained infant death syndrome, are potentially preventable. Obstetricians are uniquely positioned to counsel new parents about safe practices regarding newborn sleep, feeding, and transportation. Patients often do not develop a relationship with their pediatricians until the neonate has been discharged, and the newborn period is a time of particular vulnerability. Newborn safety should be routinely taught in obstetric curricula, and the American College/Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) should partner to disseminate updated literature and guidelines to health care providers regarding newborn safety. Current guidelines from the Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Sudden Infant Syndrome are summarized in this article. © 2012 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the tolerability of mefloquine intermittent preventive treatment (MQ IPTp) for malaria in HIV-infected pregnant women compared with HIV-negative women. Design: Prospective cohort study comparing samples of HIV-negative and HIV-infected pregnant women from 2 clinical trials conducted in Benin. Methods: One hundred and three HIV-infected women from the ongoing PACOME trial were compared with 421 HIV-negative women from a former trial, both trials aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MQ IPTp, administered at the dose of 15 mg/kg. Descriptive analysis compared the proportion of women reporting at least 1 adverse reaction, according to HIV status. Multilevel logistic regression identified factors associated with the probability of reporting an adverse reaction for each MQ intake. Results: Dizziness and vomiting were the most frequent adverse reactions. Adverse reactions were less frequent in HIV-infected women (65% versus 78%, P = 0.009). In multilevel analysis, HIV infection [odds ratio (OR) = 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08 to 0.61] decreased the risk for adverse reactions, whereas detectable viral load (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.07 to 5.66), first intake (versus further intakes, OR = 5.26, 95% CI = 3.70 to 7.14), older age (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.32), and higher education level (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.61) increased the risk. Moderate and severe adverse reactions were more frequent when antiretrovirals were started concomitantly with a MQ intake. Conclusions: This study provides reassuring data on the use of MQ IPTp in HIV-infected pregnant women. However frequent, adverse reactions remained moderate and did not impair adherence to MQ IPTp. In this high-risk group, MQ might be an acceptable alternative in case sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine loses its efficacy for intermittent preventive treatment. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - In humans, painful stimuli can arrive to the brain at 20-22 weeks of gestation. Therefore several researchers have devoted their efforts to study fetal analgesia during prenatal surgery, and during painful procedures in premature babies. Aim of this paper is to gather from scientific literature the available data on the signals that the human fetus and newborns produce, and that can be interpreted as signals of pain. Several signs can be interpreted as signals of pain. We will describe them in the text. In infants, these signs can be combined to create specific and sensible pain assessment tools, called pain scales, used to rate the level of pain. © 2012 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

AB  - Accumulating evidence of the benefits of intensive home haemodialysis has led to increased international interest in this modality as a viable option for renal replacement therapy. Until the late 1970s, haemodialysis was primarily performed at home; however, the development of in-centre and satellite dialysis units and the advent of peritoneal dialysis led to decreased numbers of patients being managed by home haemodialysis. Over the past decade, a move towards once again providing and supporting haemodialysis at home has emerged, due to a desire to offer a more convenient form of dialysis for the patient in a more cost-effective manner. This shift has generated clinical evidence indicating benefits both from receiving haemodialysis at home, and from the option to provide intensive dialysis treatment in this setting. With the development of new home haemodialysis programs, specific patient-related, physician-related and cost-related barriers to their introduction have been encountered, including patient fear of self-cannulation and lack of expert medical knowledge in the area. This Review discusses the benefits and barriers associated with intensive home haemodialysis. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic compound which has an unique place in the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition clozapine has been reported to be efficacious in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, Huntington's disease and patients with head injury. Some studies suggest clozapine could be of benefit in the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia. Due to its risk of producing agranulocytosis its use is limited to therapy-resistant cases and patients who do not tolerate conventional antipsychotics. For safe use the dose should be increased gradually and weekly monitoring of white blood cell count is needed during the first 18 weeks of treatment. Other side-effects associated with clozapine are seizures, exacerbations of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, cardiovascular disorders, diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal hypomotility, hypersalivation and weight gain.

AB  - At the end of pregnancy, fetal behavioral states can be determined by examining the fetal heart rate patterns alone. However, drawing conclusions on fetal heart rate variability (HRV) in different states which have themselves been determined on the basis of heart rate patterns may be self-predictive. In order to better understand the relationship between HRV and behavioral states, we examined the HRV in neonates in whom the behavioral states could be determined not using heart rate patterns but on the basis of Prechtl's criteria. Five newborns were observed and their behavior protocolled in a quiet environment for 44-187 min. (median: 122 min.) within 2-7 (3) days after birth at term. Electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and video recordings were simultaneously obtained. Behavioral state episodes of 3 min duration were determined according to standard criteria for quiet sleep (S1), active sleep (S2), quiet awake (S3) and active awake (S4). For each episode, RR intervals, their standard deviation (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) were calculated. A total of 129 episodes were identified (N in S1/S2/S3/S4: 44/36/21/28). The HRV measures values differed with respect to behavioral state (p<0.001): RR interval was longer in the quiet states, SDNN tended to increase over S1 to S4 while RMSSD tended to decrease. Linear discriminant analysis based on the HRV measures classified 67% of the episodes in the correct state (S1/S2/S3/S4: 84%/72%/91%/18%). All states could be well separated except S4 from S2 and S3. The results suggest that time domain HRV measures may help identify behavioral states except for S4 in neonates. This should be considered when determining fetal behavioral states in at-term fetuses on the basis of their heart rate patterns. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

AB  - Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder, manifesting by an urge to move one's legs. This is caused by disturbing sensations within the legs which is usually present during rest or at night. Direct consequences interfering with patients' daily functioning and quality of life are discomfort, serious sleep disturbance, and fatigue. Prevalence in the general population ranges from 7.2 to 9.6 %, and is referred to be twice as high as in men. Pregnancy increases the risk even more. It is supposed that in genetically predisposed women changes associated with pregnancy - fall in hemoglobin, iron stores, vitamin B12 and folic acid - together with the physiological hormonal changes lead to or worsen RLS symptoms. Algorithms for treatment of RLS include both, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective. RLS is a well defined and successfully treatable condition; it remains, however, under-diagnosed.

AB  - Background Average annual fertility rates in industrialised countries have been below two children per woman for the past 3 decades. The reasons behind women's childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of awareness regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome the 'biological clock' may be contributory factors. Objective A narrative review guided by the research question: What do women need to know about the consequences of delayed childbearing in order to make informed decisions about their fertility? Discussion There are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing and; some women's ideas about their fertility don't match the 'the scientific facts'. General practitioners are well placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research is needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.

Circumvention of first-pass hepatic metabolism in the gut, rapid onset of action, easy access via the oral cavity, easy administration for patients with dysphagia and a high level of patient acceptance are the principal advantages of the oral transmucosal route. Key clinical and commercial strategies driving the development of oral transmucosal formulations are addressed. A case study of Cynapsus Therapeutics' APL-130277, a sublingual apomorphine formulation in clinical development for Parkinson's disease exemplifies the scientific, clinical and commercial considerations for systemic oral transmucosal drug delivery.

AB  - Cinnabar, a naturally occurring mercuric sulfide (HgS), has long been used in Chinese mineral medicine for more than 2000 years. Although mercury is well-known for its toxicity, whether cinnabar induces neurotoxicity, especially in infants and children, is unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore the neurotoxic effects of low-dose of cinnabar (10mg/kg/day) on developing mice. The results revealed neurobehavioral defects in F1-C-Cin group, which were associated with Hg accumulation, increased NOx levels in whole blood, and Na +/K +-ATPase activities in brain tissues. F1- and F2-Cin-V groups were found to increase brain Hg contents and prominent neurobehavioral defects compared with F1-C-V group, suggesting that the fetal brain was more susceptible to irreversible effects for cinnabar-induced damage. Moreover, F1- and F2-Cin-Cin groups had severely neurobehavioral dysfunctions, closely correlated with the further alteration of NO x levels and Na +/K +-ATPase activities than F1- and F2-C-Cin groups. Effects in F2-Cin-Cin group were more significant than those in F1-Cin-Cin group. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that exposure to low-dose of cinnabar during the perinatal and developmental stages results in irreversible and severe injuries of the neurotoxicity in offspring, and NO x and Na +/K +-ATPase activities may exist potential and useful biomarkers for neurotoxicity-induced by low-doses of mercuric compounds. © Copyright 2012 Chun-Fa Huang et al.

AB  - Study Objective: The Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are commonly used to screen for sleep apnea in non-pregnant populations. We sought to evaluate the Berlin and ESS in pregnancy and to determine whether an alternative screening approach could better detect sleep apnea in pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women at high risk for sleep apnea (women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) completed a sleep survey composed of the Berlin and ESS, and participated in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch- PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted device designed to diagnose sleep apnea, defined as an apnea hypopnea index ≥ 5. Using multivariable statistics, demographic, clinical, and subjective symptoms that were independently associated with sleep apnea were determined and a prediction rule for the presence of sleep apnea was developed. The predictive capacity of this newly developed system was compared to that of the Berlin and ESS using receiver-operating curve (ROC) statistics. Results: Of the 114 women who participated and had a valid WP100 study, 100 completed the Berlin and 96 the ESS. The Berlin and ESS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this high-risk pregnancy cohort, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.54 (p = 0.6) and 0.57 (p = 0.3), respectively. Conversely, a model incorporating frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, age, and body mass index performed significantly better (AUC 0.86, p > 0.001). Conclusion: The Berlin and ESS are not appropriate tools to screen for sleep apnea in high-risk pregnant women. Conversely, our four-variable model more accurately predicts sleep apnea in pregnancy.

AB  - Study Objectives: Sleep problems in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are reportedly common but not well characterized. Objectives were to: (1) assess sleep concerns in children with FASD using a caregiver-report survey, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ); (2) compare CSHQ results with those of previously reported community sample; and (3) describe pilot polysomnography findings in children with FASD. Methods: Children with FASD were recruited from a behavioral intervention study, and participating caregivers completed the CSHQ. CSHQ results were compared with the original data from a previously published community sample of similar age. Participants with FASD and elevated CSHQ scores were offered overnight polysomnography. Results: Thirty-three children with FASD (4.1-12.1 years) were enrolled; 85% of children with FASD scored above the clinical cutoff Total Score of 41, reflecting marked sleep disturbance. Elevated subdomain scores occurred primarily in areas concerning for pediatric insomnia. Those with comorbid ADHD had elevated CSHQ on additional subdomains with no difference in Total Scores. Compared with the community sample, children with FASD had higher Total Scores on the CSHQ (52 vs. 39, p < 0.001). Polysomnography, completed in 5 subjects, revealed mild sleep disordered breathing and fragmented sleep with elevated non-respiratory arousal indices. Conclusions: Clinically significant sleep problems are present in children with FASD on both subjective and objective measures. Further investigation is needed to better describe these sleep disturbances and their impact on overall health and daytime neurobehavioral problems in this clinical population.

AB  - In mammals, the circadian system is composed of the central clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei and of peripheral clocks that are located in other neural structures and in cells of the peripheral tissues and organs. In adults, the system is hierarchically organized so that the central clock provides the other clocks in the body with information about the time of day. This information is needed for the adaptation of their functions to cyclically changing external conditions. During ontogenesis, the system undergoes substantial development and its sensitivity to external signals changes. Perinatally, maternal cues are responsible for setting the phase of the developing clock, while later postnatally, the LD cycle is dominant. The central clock attains its functional properties during a gradual and programmed process. Peripheral clocks begin to exhibit rhythmicity independent of each other at various developmental stages. During the early developmental stages, the peripheral clocks are set or driven by maternal feeding, but later the central clock becomes fully functional and begins to entrain the periphery. During the perinatal period, the central and peripheral clocks seem to be vulnerable to disturbances in external conditions. Further studies are needed to understand the processes of how the circadian system develops and what degree of plasticity and resilience it possesses during ontogenesis. These data may lead to an assessment of the contribution of disturbances of the circadian system during early ontogenesis to the occurrence of circadian diseases in adulthood. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Surprisingly, in our modern 24/7 society, there is scant information on the impact of developmental chronodisruption like the one experienced by shift worker pregnant women on fetal and postnatal physiology. There are important differences between the maternal and fetal circadian systems; for instance, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master clock in the mother but not in the fetus. Despite this, several tissues/organs display circadian oscillations in the fetus. Our hypothesis is that the maternal plasma melatonin rhythm drives the fetal circadian system, which in turn relies this information to other fetal tissues through corticosterone rhythmic signaling. The present data show that suppression of the maternal plasma melatonin circadian rhythm, secondary to exposure of pregnant rats to constant light along the second half of gestation, had several effects on fetal development. First, it induced intrauterine growth retardation. Second, in the fetal adrenal in vivo it markedly affected the mRNA expression level of clock genes and clock-controlled genes as well as it lowered the content and precluded the rhythm of corticosterone. Third, an altered in vitro fetal adrenal response to ACTH of both, corticosterone production and relative expression of clock genes and steroidogenic genes was observed. All these changes were reversed when the mother received a daily dose of melatonin during the subjective night; supporting a role of melatonin on overall fetal development and pointing to it as a 'time giver' for the fetal adrenal gland. Thus, the present results collectively support that the maternal circadian rhythm of melatonin is a key signal for the generation and/or synchronization of the circadian rhythms in the fetal adrenal gland. In turn, low levels and lack of a circadian rhythm of fetal corticosterone may be responsible of fetal growth restriction; potentially inducing long term effects in the offspring, possibility that warrants further research. © 2012 Mendez et al.

AB  - Thalidomide and its one analogue, lenalidomide (CC5103 or revlimid) are recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by an overproduction of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. The journey of thalidomide was started in 1956 when it was marketed as a non-barbiturate sedative agent. It was considered as a "wonder drug" that provided safe and sound sleep and hence, used to cure morning sickness in pregnant women. Later, in 1961, it was withdrawn from the world market due to its serious side effects, i.e., teratogenic activity. However, the recent decade has witnessed a true renaissance in interest in its broad biological activity. In particular, thalidomide was reevaluated and attracted significant attention due to its selective inhibitory activity of tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α), which is a clinically important activity against serious diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, leprosy, AIDS, and various cancers. The comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Recently, the drug has got FDA approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the last few years, number of thalidomide analogues have been synthesized and are in clinical development as a class of immunomodulatory drugs. Among these, lenalidomide is more potent than thalidomide, and is also non-neurotoxic. It was shown in vitro studies to induce apoptosis or arrest growth even in resistant multiple myeloma cell lines, decrease binding of the cells to bone marrow stromal cells, and stimulate host natural killer cell immunity. It also inhibits tumour growth and decreases angiogenesis. Earlier reviews have described the pharmacological aspects of thalidomide and a review has focused only on synthetic aspect of thalidomide. However, review focusing on chemistry and metabolism and mechanism of biological activity is still lacking. In this review, we will concisely describe the therapeutic aspects, metabolism and synthesis of thalidomide. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background: Obstetrical interventions, including caesarean sections, are increasing in Canada. Canadian women's psychological states, fatigue, and sleep have not been examined prospectively for contributions to obstetric interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes.Context and purpose of the study: The prospective study was conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada with 650 low-risk pregnant women. Of those women, 624 were included in this study. Women were recruited through providers' offices, media, posters, and pregnancy fairs. We examined associations between pregnant women's fatigue, sleep deprivation, and psychological states (anxiety and childbirth fear) and women's exposure to obstetrical interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes (preterm, admission to NICU, low APGARS, and low birth weight).Methods: Data from our cross-sectional survey were linked, using women's personal health numbers, to birth outcomes from the Perinatal Services BC database. After stratifying for parity, we used Pearson's Chi-square to examine associations between psychological states, fatigue, sleep deprivation and maternal characteristics. We used hierarchical logistic regression modeling to test 9 hypotheses comparing women with high and low childbirth fear and anxiety on likelihood of having epidural anaesthetic, a caesarean section (stratified for parity), assisted vaginal delivery, and adverse neonatal outcomes and women with and without sleep deprivation and high levels of fatigue on likelihood of giving birth by caesarean section, while controlling for maternal, obstetrical (e.g., infant macrosomia), and psychological variables.Results: Significantly higher proportions of multiparas, reporting difficult and upsetting labours and births, expectations of childbirth interventions, and health stressors, reported high levels of childbirth fear. Women who reported antenatal relationship, housing, financial, and health stressors and multiparas reporting low family incomes were significantly more likely to report high anxiety levels. The hypothesis that high childbirth fear significantly increased the risk of using epidural anaesthesia was supported.Conclusions: Controlling for some psychological states and sleep quality while examining other contributors to outcomes decreases the likelihood of linking childbirth fear anxiety, sleep deprivation, and fatigue to increased odds of caesarean section. Ameliorating women's childbirth fear to reduce their exposure to epidural anaesthesia can occur through developing effective interventions. These include helping multiparous women process previous experiences of difficult and upsetting labour and birth. © 2012 Hall et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Research shows that obesity prevention has to start early. Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2-6years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity. Methods/Design. Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n=5,902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n=92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 1year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements. Discussion. If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.

AB  - Effects of prenatal environmental enrichment (EE) were examined in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) " depressive- and anxious-like" rats and Wistar rats. During gestation, dams lived in standard cages or in EE cages. Their behavior during gestation and lactation was observed. On weaning day, they were tested in the forced swimming test, and corticosterone concentration was measured from their plasma. The offspring, reared in standard environment, were tested as juveniles or young adults in the elevated plus maze, open field and forced swimming tests. Corticosterone concentration in feces was analyzed. EE offspring showed more anxiety-like behaviors and less activity, compared to controls. Effects were more prominent in youth than in adulthood and in Wistar rats more than in WKY. EE lowered corticosterone concentration in young WKY rats' feces. EE induced changes in the dams' behavior during gestation and lactation. These changes in dams' behavior could be mediators of the effects on the offspring. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN. A cross-sectional, multicenter study. OBJECTIVE. To determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnant Spanish women and to identify the factors associated with a higher risk. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors for LBP and PGP have shown inconsistent results. METHODS. Sixty-one clinicians across 5 regions in Spain recruited 1158 women with a median (interquartile range) pregnancy of 35 (range, 31-38) weeks. Validated methods were used to gather data on the prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP, anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics, history of LBP, obstetrical history, physical activity before and during pregnancy, mattress and sleep characteristics, disability, anxiety, and depression. Separate multiple logistic regression models were developed to identify the variables associated with LBP, LP, and PGP. RESULTS. The 4-week prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP was 71.3%, 46.2%, and 64.7%, respectively. Main factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting pain for LBP were history of LBP related and unrelated to previous pregnancy and postpartum, pain augmenting with time spent in bed, and anxiety. Previous lumbar surgery was associated with a lower risk. The factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting LP were reporting LBP, lower academic level, younger age, depression, a lower number of hours of sleep per day, and a higher BMI, and for PGP were higher score for depression, a higher body mass index, and a more advanced stage of pregnancy. CONCLUSION. Factors associated with a higher risk vary between LBP and PGP. History of LBP, related or not to previous pregnancy or postpartum, LBP surgery, and anxiety were the factors more strongly associated with pregnancy-related LBP. When these variables are taken into account, obstetrical data from current or previous pregnancies and other variables do not show a significant association with LBP. Stage of pregnancy and depression were associated with PGP. © 2012, Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

AB  - Insulinomas are rare pancreatic β-cell tumors with an estimated incidence of 1:250.000 persons/year. We present a novel case of insulinoma manifesting immediately after childbirth. Eight days after delivery, a 21-year-old, previously healthy woman presented paresthesia in hands, upper and lower limbs muscle weakness with difficult walking, which worsened during breastfeeding sessions. Laboratory tests showed blood glucose levels between 37 and 55 mg/dL with inappropriately normal insulin levels (7.78 μUI/mL; normal range: 5-29). An abdominal computed tomography showed a nodular lesion measuring 2 cm at the head of the pancreas. Tumor enucleation resulted in complete resolution of hypoglycemia. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis were consistent with an insulinoma. About 27 cases of insulinoma associated with pregnancy have been reported to date, mostly diagnosed before the 16th week. The beginning of symptoms soon after delivery is less common. Understanding the interactions between pancreatic β-cell function and all the physiological metabolic and hormonal adaptations associated with gestation is essential for the adequate management of hypoglycemic disorders in pregnant women. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - A small number of studies have, thus far, evaluated the association between maternal snoring and fetal growth revealing conflicting results. No study has compared fetal growth between women with habitual snoring who snored before pregnancy and women with habitual snoring that started to snore during pregnancy. Objectives: To examine the effect of maternal snoring on fetal outcome and to investigate the differences between "chronic snorers" and "new-onset snorers". Methods: Women of singleton, uncomplicated, full-term pregnancies completed a questionnaire. Obstetric and labor records were reviewed. Newborn records were reviewed for gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score and gender. Results: 246 low risk women were studied. Mean BMI at the beginning of pregnancy was 22.3 ± 3.5 kg/m2. 32% reported habitual snoring. Of those, 26% were chronic snorers and 74% were new-onset snorers. Neither significant difference in fetal growth was found between snorers and non-snorers nor between chronic snorers and new-onset snorers. Increased rate of nulliparous women was found in new-onset snorers compared with both chronic snorers and non-snorers (54 vs. 25 and 29% respectively; p = 0.001). Conclusions: In pregnant women with no apparent risk factors, maternal snoring does not affect fetal growth. No differences in maternal characteristics or fetal outcome were found between chronic snorers and new-onset snorers. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition found in pregnancy. As such, all neurologists, internists, and obstetricians should know how to counsel women with epilepsy as they are considering pregnancy. While all of the usual recommendations for women of childbearing potential apply, including preconceptual and ongoing use of folic acid, calcium, and vitamin D, additional consideration must be given to the need for adjustment or change of anticonvulsant therapy. Monotherapy with the lowest dose of medication needed to control seizures should be prescribed prior to conception. Most anticonvulsants have a favorable profile when used in pregnancy; older anticonvulsants such as valproate and carbamazepine should be avoided, as they are associated with higher rates of fetal malformation, and in the case of valproate, with proven cognitive deficits in children exposed to this medication in utero. With use of any anticonvulsant medication, dosing throughout pregnancy will need to be adjusted to maintain an appropriate serum concentration. Dosing of anticonvulsants needs to be decreased after delivery to avoid medication-related toxicity, although sleep deprivation and hormonal fluctuation can increase the risk of seizures in postpartum women. With proper management, the majority of women with epilepsy can have uneventful pregnancies and healthy babies. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - The aims of this study were to examine: (1) the association between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and sleep quality in a population-based cohort of Australian women and (2) possible influence of reproductive status and mental and physical health factors on these associations. Data on 3,655 women (mean age046.6 years, range 34.3- 67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study. Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to divide women into three categories: normal (65.2 %), moderately poor (26.4 %), and very poor sleep quality (8.5 %). Other covariates were measured at 21-year follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality. Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Due to the progress in fetal surgery, it is important to acquire data about fetal pain. Material and methods: We performed a Medline research from 1995, matching the following key words: "pain" and "fetus", with the following: "subplate", "thalamocortical", "myelination", "analgesia", "anesthesia", "brain", "behavioral states", "substance p". We focused on: (a) fetal development of nociceptive pathways; (b) fetal electrophysiological, endocrinological and behavioral reactions to stimuli and pain. Results: We retrieved 217 papers of which 157 were highly informative; some reported similar data or were only case-reports, and were not quoted. Most endocrinological, behavioral and electrophysiological studies of fetal pain are performed in the third trimester, and they seem to agree that the fetus in the 3rd trimester can experience pain. But the presence of fetal pain in the 2nd trimester is less evident. In favor of a 2nd trimester perception of pain is the early development of spino-thalamic pathways (approximately from the 20th week), and the connections of the thalamus with the subplate (approximately from the 23rd week). Against this possibility, some authors report the immaturity of the cortex with the consequent lack of awareness, and the almost continuous state of sleep of the fetus. Conclusions: Most studies disclose the possibility of fetal pain in the third trimester of gestation. This evidence becomes weaker before this date, though we cannot exclude its increasing presence since the beginning of the second half of the gestation. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Sleep is an essential human behavior that shows prominent gender differences. Disturbed sleep, in particular, is much more prevalent in females than males. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) as one cause of disturbed sleep was observed to be somewhat more common among women than men in Ekbom's 1945 seminal series of clinical cases with the disease. He, however, reported this gender difference mainly for those with more severe symptoms. Since then numerous studies have reported that women are affected by RLS about twice as often as males for mild as well as moderate to severe RLS. The present review focuses on RLS in females from the perspectives of both epidemiology and pathophysiology. RLS will generally become worse or might appear for the first time during pregnancy. Parity increases the risk of RLS later in life suggesting that pregnancy is a specific behavioral risk factor for developing RLS. Some evidence suggests that dysfunction in iron metabolism and high estrogen levels might contribute to RLS during pregnancy. But, menopause does not lower the incidence of RLS nor does hormone replacement therapy lead to an increase, suggesting a quite complex uncertain role of hormones in the pathophysiology of RLS. Therefore, further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the factors causing RLS in women. These studies should include genetic, clinical and polysomnographic variables, as well as hormonal measures and variables assessing iron metabolism. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this research was to analyze the relation between coping strategies and somatic symptomatology in pregnant Spanish women and the influence of a previous miscarriage on these variables. We used a correlational retrospective design, which included 207 expectant mothers (44with a previous miscarriage). The instruments included a questionnaire on coping with stress and questions about first-trimester symptoms. Regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between sleep disturbances and overt emotional expression coping, between tiredness/fatigue and avoidance coping, and between nausea and religious coping. The influence of coping strategies on somatic symptomatology did not differ significantly between women who had had or had not had a previous miscarriage, although women with a previous miscarriage scored higher on the use of religious coping and positive reappraisal and reported more nausea. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For women with epilepsy (WWE), the postpartum period is a vulnerable time owing to medication alterations, disrupted sleep, increased stress, and the challenges of breastfeeding. Sleep deprivation and the stress of having a new child can be challenging for WWE. Concerns over antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in breast milk and sleep disruption associated with breastfeeding leads some WWE to discontinue breastfeeding. Adjustment of AEDs in the postpartum period can lead to difficulties in seizure control. Postpartum depression is increased in WWE, and patient education about newborn safety remains a concern. This article covers these important topics in postpartum WWE. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Malaria control efforts and elimination in Africa are being challenged by the development of resistance of parasites to antimalarial drugs and vectors to insecticides. We investigated whether the combination of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LLINs) with indoor residual spraying (IRS) or carbamate-treated plastic sheeting (CTPS) conferred enhanced protection against malaria and better management of pyrethroid-resistance in vectors than did LLINs alone. Methods: We did a cluster randomised controlled trial in 28 villages in southern Benin, west Africa. Inclusion criteria of the villages were moderate level of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors and minimum distance between villages of 2 km. We assessed four malaria vector control interventions: LLIN targeted coverage to pregnant women and children younger than 6 years (TLLIN, reference group), LLIN universal coverage of all sleeping units (ULLIN), TLLIN plus full coverage of carbamate-IRS applied every 8 months (TLLIN+IRS), and ULLIN plus full coverage of CTPS lined up to the upper part of the household walls (ULLIN+CTPS). The interventions were allocated to villages by a block randomisation on the basis of preliminary surveys and children of each village were randomly selected to participate with computer-generated numbers. The primary endpoint was the incidence density rate of Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria in children younger than 6 years as was analysed by Poisson regression taking into account the effect of age and the sampling design with a generalised estimating equation approach. Clinical and parasitological information were obtained by active case detection of malaria episodes during 12 periods of 6 consecutive days scheduled at six weekly intervals and by cross-sectional surveys of asymptomatic plasmodial infections. Children or study investigators were not masked to study group. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN07404145. Findings: Of 58 villages assessed, 28 were randomly assigned to intervention groups. 413-429 children were followed up in each intervention group for 18 months. The clinical incidence density of malaria was not reduced in the children from the ULLIN group (incidence density rate 0·95, 95% CI 0·67-1·36, p=0·79), nor in those from the TLLIN+IRS group (1·32, 0·90-1·93, p=0·15) or from the ULLIN+CTPS group (1·05, 0·75-1·48, p=0·77) compared with the reference group (TLLIN). The same trend was observed with the prevalence and parasite density of asymptomatic infections (non significant regression coefficients). Interpretation: No significant benefit for reducing malaria morbidity, infection, and transmission was reported when combining LLIN+IRS or LLIN+CTPS compared with a background of LLIN coverage. These findings are important for national malaria control programmes and should help the design of more cost-effective strategies for malaria control and elimination.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This article discusses hormonal milestones and the influence that hormonal fluctuations make in the frequency and severity of migraine in women and includes information on acute, short-term, and preventive strategies for hormonally influenced migraine and the situations in which hormonal therapies may be offered.Recent Findings: Genomic patterns in adolescent girls differentiate between menstrually related migraine and non-menstrually related migraine. The age at initiation of estrogen replacement therapy appears to be significant with respect to stroke. No increase in stroke occurred in women on low-dose (50 μg or less) transdermal estrogen replacement compared to women not using estrogen replacement. Childhood maltreatment is more common in women with migraine and depression than in women with migraine alone.Summary: Management of hormonally influenced migraine involves a clear identification of the relationship between migraine and hormone change. A thorough history and detailed diary are critical in identifying this relationship and in predicting response or following response to hormonal therapies. The evolution of migraine in an individual may be strongly driven by hormonal shifts. Although limited, clinical evidence suggests that oral contraceptive use in young women with episodic migraine may transform their pattern into chronic migraine. Thus, particular attention to changes in migraine patterns following either endogenous or exogenous hormonal changes is crucial. Providing reassurance and education that migraine is a biological disorder and providing an understanding of the role of estrogen in the frequency and severity of migraine can guide treatment choices. Pharmacologic treatments include acute therapy, with short-term and standard prevention offered where appropriate. Hormonal therapies are not first-line therapies but may be important choices for a woman with migraine whose estrogen fluctuation is continually exacerbating migraine attacks. Given the many hormonal stages during the life of a woman with migraine, therapies may vary according to hormonal stage and status. Overall wellness should also be emphasized; regular exercise, balanced diet, smoking cessation, weight control, and sleep hygiene are important in the management of migraine.

AB  - This double-blind, randomised, multicentre, conversion to monotherapy, historical control study (N01280; NCT00419094) evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of levetiracetam extended release (LEV XR) 2000. mg/day once daily for the treatment of patients with partial-onset seizures compared with a historical control. Patients aged 12-75 years with 2-40 partial-onset seizures per 4 weeks, taking 1-2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and receiving a stable dosage for ≥4 weeks prior to screening were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to LEV XR 2000 or 1000. mg/day. The study comprised baseline (8 weeks), LEV XR up-titration (2 weeks), baseline AED tapering (6 weeks), LEV XR monotherapy (10 weeks), and entry into open-label follow-up study or down-titration (1 week). The primary efficacy variable was the cumulative exit rate at Day 112 due to predefined exit criteria compared with the historical control. Of the 171 patients randomised to LEV XR 2000. mg/day and 57 randomised to 1000. mg/day, 141 (82.5%) and 50 (87.7%) completed the study. The cumulative exit rate for patients on LEV XR 2000. mg/day (0.375 [95% CI 0.297, 0.453]) was significantly lower than historical control (0.653). Both LEV doses were well tolerated. The most common adverse events during the treatment period were somnolence (21.9%), headache (19.7%) and convulsion (14.9%). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) due to traumatic brain injury is a diagnosis with multifactorial causes, diverse clinical presentations, and an evolving concept of management. Due to sports injuries, work-related injuries, vehicular accidents, and wartime combat, there is rising demand to understand the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of PTE. PTE could occur at any time after injury and up to decades post-injury. The frontal and temporal lobes are the most commonly affected regions, and the resulting epilepsy syndrome is typically localization related. PTE should be actively considered as a diagnosis in any patient with a history of head trauma and episodic neurologic compromise regardless of how temporally remote the trauma occurred. The standard work-up includes a thorough history, neurological examination, neuroimaging, and electroencephalogram. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have a high comorbidity with seizures and need to be carefully excluded. PTE can spontaneously remit. For patients who do not go into remission, treatment for confirmed PTE includes antiepileptics, vagal nerve stimulator, and, when appropriate, surgical resection of an epileptogenic lesion. Lifestyle modification and counseling are critical for patients with PTE and should be routinely included in clinical management. The published evidence on the efficacy of various treatment modalities specific to PTE consists largely of retrospective studies and case reports. Despite a unique pathogenesis, the majority of current care parameters for PTE parallel those of standard care for localization-related epilepsy. The potential and need for rigorous clinical research in PTE continue to be in great demand. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA) 2012.

AB  - Context: New trial data and drug regimens that have become available in the last 2 years warrant an update to guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults in resource-rich settings. Objective: To provide current recommendations for the treatment of adult HIV infection with ART and use of laboratory-monitoring tools. Guidelines include when to start therapy and with what drugs, monitoring for response and toxic effects, special considerations in therapy, and managing antiretroviral failure. Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction: Data that had been published or presented in abstract form at scientific conferences in the past 2 years were systematically searched and reviewed by an International Antiviral Society-USA panel. The panel reviewed available evidence and formed recommendations by full panel consensus. Data Synthesis: Treatment is recommended for all adults with HIV infection; the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence increase with decreasing CD4 cell count and the presence of certain concurrent conditions. Recommended initial regimens include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/ lamivudine) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz), a ritonavirboosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir or darunavir), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (raltegravir). Alternatives in each class are recommended for patients with or at risk of certain concurrent conditions. CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA level should be monitored, as should engagement in care, ART adherence, HIV drug resistance, and quality-of-care indicators. Reasons for regimen switching include virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure and drug toxicity or intolerance. Confirmed treatment failure should be addressed promptly and multiple factors considered. Conclusion: New recommendations for HIV patient care include offering ART to all patients regardless of CD4 cell count, changes in therapeutic options, and modifications in the timing and choice of ART in the setting of opportunistic illnesses such as cryptococcal disease and tuberculosis. ©2012 American Medical Association.

AB  - Purpose: To compare obstetric outcomes between patients with positive and negative Berlin Questionnaire results. Methods: An observational study comparing outcome between these two groups was carried out in seven hospitals, representing seven different regions of Turkey. In each center, pregnant women who were admitted for normal pregnancy follow-up or labor, were consecutively recruited in the study. Each participant completed a sleep apnea questionnaire from the Berlin Questionnaire. This questionnaire tests snoring and daytime sleepiness. Fetal outcome and pregnancy outcome are recorded from patient files. Results: A total of 465 consecutive patients who completed the Berlin Questionnaire were analyzed. Patients with a positive questionnaire had a higher BMI, pre-pregnancy medical disorder rate and cesarean rate (68% vs 51%) than the negative group. Preeclampsia and gestational diabetes were more prevalent in the positive questionnaire group than the negative questionnaire group [19 (28%) vs 18 (5%) for preeclampsia, 8 (12) vs 13 (3%) for gestational diabetes, respectively]. At logistic regression analysis, gravidity, gestational age at birth and a positive questionnaire were independent predictors for preeclampsia. BMI and history of maternal medical disorders were independent predictors of gestational diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea may be related to preeclampsia.

AB  - The aims of the current study were to evaluate the effects of diazepam (D) and/or xylazine (X) on the induction of sedation and anesthesia, performing ovarian transplantation and litter size upon administration during pregnancy. One hundred and five albino rat females were classified randomly into four groups given intraperitoneal (IP) injection of physiological saline (group I), diazepam (6.2 mg /kg body weight group II), xylazine (13.2 mg/kg/body weight group III) and 6.2 mg/kg body weight diazepam and 13.2 mg/kg body weight xylazine (group IV). Induction of sedation and anesthesia were monitored. The onset of anesthesia, duration of surgical anesthesia and sleep time after injections was recorded. Rectal temperatures were monitored at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 120 min after injection. Blood samples were collected at 0 and 120 min post injection for determination of hemoglobin, glucose and urea concentrations. Ovarian transplantation was performed in females anesthesized with DX drugs. Mated females were injected with physiological saline, 6.2 mg/kg diazepam and/or 13.2 mg/kg xylazine at day 4, 11 and 18 of pregnancy and litter sizes were recorded. Sedation was obtained after injection of diazepam or xylazine alone whereas surgical anesthesia was obtained upon injection of both diazepam and xylazine. The onset of anesthesia, duration of anesthesia and sleep time after DX injection was 4.6, 144.1 and 79.1 min, respectively. Rectal temperature decreased (P<0.05) after injection of diazepam and/or xylazine. The hemoglobin (P<0.05), glucose and urea blood concentrations increased after injection of diazepam and/or xylazine. Upon ovarian transplantation, all animals recovered and ovarian follicles were found in the transplanted ovaries. Number of offspring per animal did not differ due to diazepam and/or xylazine injection at day 4, 11 and 18 of pregnancy. In conclusion, DX injection induced surgical anesthesia in rats sufficient for performing major surgeries.

AB  - The current literature suggests that nighttime sleep is compromised during late pregnancy and early postpartum periods, but little is known about the 24-hour sleep pattern during this time. This study aims to first, explore the day-to-day changes in the quantity and quality of objectively measured sleep during the week immediately before and after the day of delivery, and second, to provide descriptive data on timing of naps during late pregnancy and the first week postpartum. Twenty-four healthy women completed one week of actigraphy assessment during the third trimester, and six days before and after delivery. Demographic and obstetric information was collected via questionnaires. Nighttime sleep was significantly disrupted and shortened immediately after giving birth, while napping behavior significantly increased. Total sleep time across 24hours, however, remained stable due to increased napping behaviors. Across the first postpartum week, nighttime sleep improved linearly, with its quantity, but not quality, comparable to that of the third trimester on the sixth postpartum day. Napping behavior decreased linearly during the first postpartum week, although participants continued to take more naps on the sixth postpartum day than during the third trimester. During antenatal periods, naps were most likely to occur during early afternoon, while during the first postpartum week, naps were evenly distributed across late morning to early evening. These findings suggest that sleep is redistributed across 24-hour periods during immediate postpartum, and this redistribution raises questions on the restorative value of sleep women obtain after giving birth. © 2012 Sleep and Biological Rhythms © 2012 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

AB  - Physiological rhythms entrained by the circadian clock are present in virtually all organs including those of the reproductive system. In mammals, circadian timing is driven by a 'master clock' in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that influences peripheral tissue clocks via endocrine, autonomic and behavioral cues. The molecular clock machinery comprises a network of 'clock' genes, namely Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2. These clock genes generate endogenous oscillations that drive rhythmic expression of downstream genes and thus physiological and behavioral processes. Importantly, disturbances in clock gene expression are implicated in a range of pathologies including cancer and obesity. The recent recognition that clock genes are expressed in the placenta, together with observations linking circadian disruption with compromised placental function, suggests that circadian variation may be an important component of the normal placental phenotype. In this review we consider this possibility in the context of maternal circadian physiology in pregnancy. While there is good evidence for rhythmic expression of several genes in the rodent placenta, the conventional transcriptional-translational feedback loops of the clock machinery appear less robust and coordinated. Further study is needed to elucidate the function of the placental clock genes across gestation and among different species, particularly those in which greater circadian development occurs in utero. Such studies will likely provide important insights into placental physiology and pathology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A high percentage of the division's doctors and employees work at night to guarantee urgent assistance and diagnostic services to patients. Night work is not recommended for persons with rather serious case histories due to the disruption of circadian rhythms or the increased workload required of certain operators during nighttime hours. All of the evaluations of health operators with a limited capacity to work on the night shift in our hospital were analysed, except for female workers restricted from night work during pregnancy or Puerperium, as provisioned by the regulation that protects working mothers. Forty-two cases were considered (six physicians and 36 operators in the division) out of a total of 2676 employees assigned to night work and the conditions that led to the formulation of the decision are divided as follows: 16 Mental disturbances currently subject to treatment (depression, post-traumatic anxiety disorder, primary insomnia⋯), 8 Tumours (breast, colon, Ewing Sarcoma), 7 Neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, myasthenia), 6 Cardiovascular disease (previous IMA; arrhythmias, arterial hypertension not controlled by theraphy) and 5 others patologies (total 45) The cases will be analysed in detail with an analysis of the characteristics of the exempt group of workers and with reference to the temporary or indefinite nature of the exemption. © PI-ME, Pavia 2012.

AB  - Background: Serotonin influences the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system; therefore prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) may alter HPA axis development and function. To address this, prenatal exposure to SSRIs and maternal mood were examined in relation to neonatal and infant levels of cortisol and its binding protein, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). Methods: Serum cortisol and CBG levels were assayed from SSRI-exposed and non-exposed mothers and their neonates at delivery. Maternal mood symptoms were documented at 36 weeks gestation. To determine the long-term implications of changes in CBG, levels of salivary cortisol were assessed in infants at 3 months of age. Results: Prenatal SSRI exposure significantly increased serum CBG levels in neonates after vaginal delivery (. p≤. 0.038), even when controlling for maternal depression. Neonatal serum cortisol levels did not vary with SSRI exposure or antenatal maternal mood, but were significantly higher following vaginal delivery (. p≤. 0.003). Neonatal serum CBG levels were associated with infant salivary levels of evening cortisol (. p≤. 0.051). In SSRI-exposed infants, increased levels of neonatal CBG predicted a smaller diurnal change in infant salivary cortisol (. p≤. 0.028), regardless of maternal depression. Conclusions: Prenatal SSRI exposure affects the developing HPA system by altering serum CBG levels in neonates and infant salivary cortisol levels. Further research is warranted on the long-term functional implications of the effect of prenatal SSRI exposure on fetal hepatic CBG gene expression and the developing HPA system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - A common approach to screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the universal testing of all pregnant women with a 1-h, 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT), followed by a diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in those in whom the GCT is positive (≥7.8 mmol/L). More important, the GCT is performed at any time of day, but there has been limited study of the effect of time of day on test performance. Thus, using their subsequent OGTT (performed in the morning), we sought to characterize the metabolic function of women with positive GCTs in relation to the timing of their test. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 927 women with positive GCTs underwent a 3-h 100-g OGTT. They were stratified into four groups by time of day (hours) of their GCT:&lt;0900 (n = 171), 0900-1059 (n = 288), 1100-1259 (n = 189), and ≥1300 (n = 279). RESULTS - On the OGTT, the prevalence of GDM progressively decreased across the GCT groups from &lt;0900 h (26.9%) to 0900-1059 h (25.0%) to 1100-1259 h (21.7%) to ≥1300 h (21.5%; P = 0.0022). After adjustment for GDM risk factors, mean adjusted glucose area under the curve (AUC gluc) similarly decreased across the groups, while insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and β-cell function (Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2) progressively increased (all P&lt;0.0001). In particular, compared with the &lt;0900- and 0900-1059-h groups, women whose positive GCT occurred after 1300 h had superior metabolic function, as evidenced by lower AUCgluc, higher insulin sensitivity, and better β-cell function (all P ≤ 0.0097). CONCLUSIONS - Among women with a positive GCT, those tested in the afternoon have better metabolic function and a lower risk of GDM on subsequent OGTT. © 2012 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Background: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n. - 3) is highly important during pregnancy for optimal development and functioning of fetal neural tissue. Infant ability to organize sleep and wake states following parturition is highly associated with later developmental outcomes. The impact of maternal DHA intake on sleep organization has not been previously investigated. Aims: To examine the effect of a DHA-containing functional food consumed during pregnancy on early neurobehavioral development as assessed by infant sleep patterning in the first 48 postnatal hours. Study design: A longitudinal, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design was used. Subjects: Women (18-35. y) with no pregnancy complications consumed a cereal-based functional food (92. kcal) containing 300. mg DHA an average of 5. d/week or placebo bars (n = 27 DHA, n = 21 Placebo). The intervention began at 24. weeks gestation and continued until delivery (38-40. weeks). Outcome measures: Infant sleep/wake states were measured on postnatal days 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) using a pressure sensitive mattress recording respiration and body movements. Results: Using ANCOVA and controlling for ethnic variation, there were significant group differences in arousals in quiet sleep on D1 (P = 0.006) and D2 (P = 0.011) with fewer arousals in the DHA intervention group compared to the placebo group. Similarly, arousals in active sleep on D1 were significantly lower in the DHA-intervention group (P = 0.012) compared to the placebo group. Conclusions: We conclude that increased prenatal supply of dietary DHA has a beneficial impact on infant sleep organization. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sleep disordered breathing and its symptoms have been associated with a multitude of fetal and maternal complications including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and possibly pre-term labour and other markers of alterations in fetal wellbeing. The disease remains underdiagnosed in the general population but likely also in pregnancy, mostly because providers do not appropriately screen for the disorder. Sleep disordered breathing may manifest differently in women, since women report more fatigue and less snoring than men do. This paper discusses typical presentations of sleep disordered breathing but also reports some less obvious presentations to help providers recognise those manifestations and screen for the disorder when warranted. Our case series describes patients with diagnoses such as chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, nocturnal asthma and panic attacks, who were diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing and offered treatment with CPAP during pregnancy. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy rhinitis manifests as nasal congestion, with resolution of symptoms after delivery. Eighteen to 30% of pregnant patients report symptoms of rhinitis. Pregnancy rhinitis may have an adverse effect on quality of life (QOL) and may cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which in turn may adversely affect the outcome of pregnancy. Previous examinations of the prevalence of pregnancy rhinitis during different stages of pregnancy have been inconclusive. This study aimed to determine rhinosinusitis-specific QOL during different stages of pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional observation study of patients in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy using the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) was conducted in the obstetric clinic at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, Canada. Seventy-six low- risk pregnant patients were included in the study. Thirty-two patients were in the second trimester of pregnancy and 44 patients were in the third trimester. Results: Average item scores for the entire questionnaire were significantly higher (p = 0.041), indicating more severe impairment of QOL, in the third trimester in comparison with the second trimester. A comparison between women with and without preexisting allergic rhinitis, in both the second and the third trimesters, shows significantly higher SNOT-22 scores for the allergic group (p = 0.007). QOL was lower in the third trimester than in nonrhinosinusitis patients (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Rhinosinusitis-specific QOL is lower in the third trimester of pregnancy in comparison with the second trimester and also in comparison with nonrhinosinusitis patients. Increased awareness may enhance the QOL of pregnant patients, prevent OSA, and thereby positively influence the outcome of pregnancy. Copyright © 2012, OceanSide Publications, Inc.

AB  - Objective. To study development of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during and after pregnancy, and whether RLS is related to snoring or other pregnancy-related symptoms. Design. Prospective study. Setting. Antenatal care clinics in the catchment area of Linköping university hospital, Sweden. Population. Five hundred consecutively recruited pregnant women. Methods. Sleep disturbances, including symptoms of RLS and snoring, were assessed with questionnaires in each trimester. A complementary questionnaire was sent three years after delivery to women experiencing symptoms of RLS during pregnancy. Main outcome measures. Symptoms of RLS in relation to snoring in each trimester. Results. Symptoms of RLS were reported by 17.0% of the women in the first trimester, by 27.1% in the second trimester and by 29.6% in the third trimester. Snoring in the first trimester was correlated to increased prevalence of RLS in all three trimesters (p = 0.003, 0.017 and 0.044 in the first, second and third trimester, respectively). No correlation was found between RLS and anemia, parity or body mass index. Among the women who experienced RLS, 31% still had symptoms three years after delivery. Fifty-eight per cent of those whose symptoms had disappeared stated that this happened within one month after delivery. Conclusions. Symptoms of RLS progressedmost between the first and second trimester. Women who snored in the first or second trimester of pregnancy had a higher prevalence of RLS in the third trimester, which indicates that snoring in early pregnancy might predict RLS later. Symptoms of RLS disappear quite soon after delivery, but about one-third of women with RLS during pregnancy may still have symptoms three years after childbirth. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - In recent years the number of functional neuroimaging studies on adolescence has exploded. These studies have led to important new insights about the relation between functional brain development and behavior. However, special consideration is warranted when working with adolescents. In this review, we review variables, including pubertal stage, sleep patterns and pregnancy, which are particularly relevant for developmental cognitive neuroscience studies involving adolescents. Consideration of the unique challenges associated with adolescence will help the growing field of developmental neuroimaging standardize procedures and will eventually facilitate interpretation across studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of IL-18 in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)-induced preeclampsia (PE), by comparison of the changes of serum IL-18 levels among different groups as well as before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in pregnant women with both OSAS and PE.
METHODS: In control group there were 18 normal pregnant women with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) < 5. In simple PE group 18 pregnant PE patients with an AHI < 5 were recruited. In PE plus OSAS group 16 PE patients with coexisting OSAS were collected. CPAP treatment was performed for 1 week in 6 patients with AHI > 15 from PE plus OSAS group.Serum IL-18 levels were measured with ELISA.
RESULT: There was a significant difference in serum IL-18 levels among control group [(261 ± 95) ng/L], simple PE group [(382 ± 121) ng/L], and PE plus OSAS group [(601 ± 89) ng/L, all P < 0.001]. Following CPAP treatment, there was a significant decrease in AHI, systolic blood pressures, and serum IL-18 levels, but a significant increase in minimal SpO₂ (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that serum IL-18 levels in PE patients with OSAS were significantly elevated, which suggested that OSAS might increase the incidence of PE by enhancing inflammatory response, while CPAP treatment could effectively improve the pathological process.

AB  - Objective: Both maternal depression and overweight carry potential adverse effects on perinatal health and are inter-related. We explored the relationship between weight and depressive symptoms in a high-risk maternal population. Methods: We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to all women attending the Motherisk Clinic at The Hospital for Sick Children between October 2007 and April 2010. We explored possible associations between the EPDS scores, maternal weight and other characteristics. Results: The study population consisted of 352 women, 43.7% of whom were pregnant, with a variety of exposures. Twenty seven percent of the study population had diagnosed depression. Depressed women had a significantly higher body weight compared to non-depressed women (p0.016). The same finding remained significant in the pregnant sub-group. The EPDS score, for the entire study population, was significantly correlated with body weight (p0.027). Use of antidepressants was an independent predictor of maternal weight in a multivariate regression analysis. Conclusions: There is a strong association between maternal weight and depressive symptoms, whether diagnosed or not. Antidepressant therapy is an independent predictor of maternal weight. Since both depression and maternal overweight may adversely affect pregnancy outcome, and are treatable, addressing both is essential for optimal pregnancy management. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Objective To assess the presence of insomnia and sleepiness and related factors in the late third trimester of pregnancy. Methods A total of 370 singleton gravids completed a general questionnaire containing personal data, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In addition, maternal anthropometry was recorded upon survey. Results Median [interquartile range] maternal age and gestational age upon survey was of 31 [7.0] years and 39 [1.8] weeks, respectively. A 73.5% of women displayed some degree of insomnia (Total ISI score 8-28) and 22.2% sleepiness (Total ESS score ≥10). Determined rho Spearman coefficients showed significant correlations between ISI scores and gestational age at survey and survey to birth interval (weeks) and between ESS scores and maternal weight and arm circumference at survey and neonatal birth weight. Multiple linear regression analysis found that smoking habit, higher blood pressure and shorter survey to birth interval (weeks) significantly predicted higher ISI scores, and hence a higher risk of insomnia. Employed status, increased arm circumference and neonatal weight predicted higher ESS scores (sleepiness). Conclusion Insomnia and sleepiness were prevalent in the late third trimester of pregnancy in which lifestyle factors and maternal and neonatal body composition were significant predictors. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for the treatment of substance abuse, harmful use, addiction and comorbidity with psychiatric disorders primarily focus on their pharmacological management. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and presented as recommendations to aid clinical decision making for practitioners alongside a detailed review of the evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in the treatment of these disorders, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of the evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after feedback from participants. The guidelines primarily cover the pharmacological management of withdrawal, short- and long-term substitution, maintenance of abstinence and prevention of complications, where appropriate, for substance abuse or harmful use or addiction as well management in pregnancy, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders and in younger and older people. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Background: One established means of preventing the adverse consequences of malaria during pregnancy is sleeping under an insecticide treated net (ITN) throughout pregnancy. Despite increased access to this intervention over time, consistent ITN use during pregnancy remains relatively uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa. Methodology/Principal Findings: We sought to identify determinants of ITN use during pregnancy. Utilizing a population-based random sample, we interviewed 500 women living in Jinja, Uganda, who had been pregnant in the past year. ITN ownership at the start of pregnancy was reported by 359 women (72%) and 28 women (20%) acquired an ITN after the first trimester of pregnancy. Among 387 ITN owners, 73% reported either always sleeping under the ITN during all trimesters of pregnancy, or after acquiring their net. Owning more than 1 net was slightly associated with always sleeping under an ITN during pregnancy (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28). Women who always slept under an ITN during pregnancy were more likely to be influenced by an advertisement on the radio/poster than being given an ITN free of charge (RR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.76). No differences were found between other socio-demographic factors, pregnancy history, ANC use or socio-cultural factors. Conclusions/Significance: While self-reported ITN ownership and use was common throughout pregnancy, we were unable to pinpoint why a sizable fraction of Ugandan women did not always adhere to recommendations for use of an ITN during pregnancy. More data are needed on the capacity of individual households to support the installation of ITNs which may provide insight into interventions targeted at improving the convenience and adherence of daily ITN use. © 2012 Sangaré et al.

AB  - Pregnancy in concomitant pituitary or adrenal disorders requires special medical attention and treatment since maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality may be increased. If previously known and adequately treated, pregnancy in Addison's disease can take an inconspicuous course. However, it is associated with an increased rate of premature deliveries and Caesarean sections. Fetal cortisol secretion may attenuate maternal symptoms of a hitherto unknown Addison's disease which may become apparent by a postpartum adrenal crisis. Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone substitutions should be increased by 30-50 % in the third trimester although this is discussed controversially. Pregnancy in Cushing's syndrome is rare and leads to considerably increased fetal mortality (~20 %) and maternal morbidity. Diagnostic investigation is hampered by the altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in pregnancy. For screening purposes, urinary free cortisol, midnight cortisol, and diurnal salivatory cortisol should be employed since circadian cortisol rhythm is maintained in a normal pregnancy. Surgery is the intended treatment of Cushing's syndrome in pregnant women although in the third trimester, adrenostatic drugs (metyrapon) provide an alternative. Acromegaly in pregnancy is accompanied by an increased fetal and maternal morbidity. Maternal growth hormone and IGF-1 do not pass the placental barrier and do not seem to influence fetal growth. In most cases, growth hormone-suppressive therapy can be ceased in pregnancy. Somatostatin analogues and dopamine agonists cross the placenta, and the former may lead to reduced fetal growth. Pregnancy in prolactinomas may lead to tumor growth with visual field defects especially in macroadenomas. Dopaminagonistic medication should be ceased with notice of pregnancy except for selected cases with extrasellar tumor growth. Regular clinical and perimetrical controls are obligatory as in case of tumor growth dopaminergic medication will be continued. Present expert knowledge on bromocriptin and cabergoline given in pregnancy did not show any adverse events.

AB  - The prevalence rate of epilepsy is between 4-10/1000 people in general population. It is a well-known fact that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used during pregnancy increase the rate of congenital malformations. However, there is not enough information about the electrophysiological effects of AEDs. In this study, 127 children whose mothers have epilepsyand 33 children whose mothers are healthy, were included. Twenty nine mothers did not use AEDs whereas 98 patients used AEDs during their pregnancy. Demographic features of both mothers and children, as well as epilepsy characteristics of mothers are recorded. The EEG examinations were done awake and/or during sleep. The children whose mothers have epilepsy had higher rate of EEG abnormalities and the ratio was statistically significant. EEG abnormalities were higher in the children whose mothers had polytherapy (%50) than in the group with monotherapy (%31,7). EEG abnormalities were mostly seen (%47) in children whose mothers used VPA. Children born of patients with epilepsy who did not use folic acid with AEDs had a higher rate of EEG abnormalities and this ratio was statistically significant. It was also observed that children, whose mothers have generalized EEG abnormalities, have generalized EEG abnormalities more frequently. It is necessary to examine patients who used AEDs during pregnancy not only in terms of congenital malformations but also electrophysiological effects and to advise taking folic acid. Examining children who are born under the effect of AEDs electrophysiologically in the years following their birth may provide predictions about whether the effects of AEDs.

AB  - Background: Circadian rhythms are biological rhythms generated by an organism or group of organisms that have an intrinsic period of 24 h. Among the many variables that exhibit circadian rhythmicity, body temperature has received considerable attention. The circadian rhythm of body temperature is a well-documented physiological phenomen. Also, it has been shown that changes in heat loss via convection and radiation are primarily caused by variations in skin blood flow, with consequent changes in skin temperature. For this reason, foot temperature assumes a great importance both as indicator of equine laminitis and foot-and-mouth disease in sheep. Particularly, the foot rot, term loosely used to describe lameness associated with the bovine foot, is characterized by acute inflammation of the skin and adjacent soft tissue of the interdigital cleft or space in which the modifications of temperature assume a great importance. In fact, the regulation of body temperature is an essential component of the process of fever, which plays an important role in an organism's response to infection and disease, and its manipulation is a standard procedure in various surgical and therapeutic procedures. In this regards, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of rectal temperature (RT) both in healthy Comisana sheep and in Comisana sheep affected by foot rot. Materials, Methods & Results: This experiment was carried out on 10 clinically healthy and not pregnant female sheep, and 10 not pregnant female sheep affected by foot rot. During the experimental period, all animals were kept under a natural photoperiod (sunrise 06:30, sunset 19:00). RT was measured every 3 h intervals for 24 consecutive hours starting at 11:00 on day 1 and ending at 11:00 on day 2. A trigonometric statistical model was applied to the average values of each time series, so as to describe the periodic phenomenon analytically, by characterizing the main rhythmic parameters according to the single cosinor procedure. Four rhythmic parameters were determined: mean level, amplitude (the difference between the peak, or trough, and the mean value of a wave), acrophase (the time at which the peak of a rhythm occurs), and robustness (strength of rhythmicity). The application of the periodic model showed a circadian rhythm of RT in healthy subjects and no circadian rhytmicity of RT was observed in ill sheep. Discussion: The analysis of the results obtained under experimental conditions used in the present study indicated the existence of a circadian periodicity of rectal temperature in healthy sheep whereas no circadian oscillations of rectal temperature were revealed in sheep affected by foot rot. A simple and coherent explanation for these pathological alterations is that the set point is elevated during the rising phase and returned to normal during the later phase. Taking together, the findings of the present study, along with those of others, emphasize the concept that RT exhibits a circadian rhythm that reflect the familiar circadian patterns of endogenous source and the existence of circadian oscillations around a set point with changes in mean body temperature and an absent rhythm when temperature is modified to a new set point, as observed in sheep affected by foot rot.

AB  - Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered byHG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation. © 2012 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Study Objectives: To determine the relationships between key variables obtained from ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) and the wrist-worn Watch-PAT 200 device in pregnant women. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, women in their third trimester of pregnancy underwent full overnight home PSG using the 22-channel MediPalm system and the Watch-PAT 200 device. PSGs were scored by a blinded, experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored automatically by the manufacturer's proprietary software. Results: A total of 31 pregnant women were studied. Mean age was 30.2 ± 7.1 years; mean gestational age was 33.4 ± 3.0 weeks; mean BMI was 31.9 ± 8.1 kg/m2; 39% of women were nulliparous. Key variables generated by PSG and Watch-PAT correlated well over a wide range, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.76, p < 0.001); respiratory disturbance index (RDI, r = 0.68, p < 0.001), mean oxygen saturation (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The area under the curve for AHI ≥ 5 and RDI ≥ 10 were 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Association between stage 3 sleep on PSG and deep sleep on Watch-PAT was poor. Watch-PAT tended to overscore RDI, particularly as severity increased. Conclusions: Among pregnant women, Watch-PAT demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity for identification of obstructive sleep apnea, defined as AHI ≥ 5 on full PSG. Watch-PAT may overestimate RDI somewhat, especially at high RDI values.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) is the key regulator of the stress response in mammals acting to restore homeostasis during these periods. Programming of the HPAA is influenced by events that occur in utero. For example, periods of maternal stress during gestation can lead to alterations in the programming of the fetal HPAA often leading to a hyper-active cortisol response to stress later in life. Animal models have proven useful for studying programming of the fetal HPAA and have provided insight into factors that influences it's programming such as the timing and type of stressor and gender differences. With increasing interest in this field of research, much has been learned about the possible mechanisms at play and treatment options available to restore functioning of the HPAA; this is the focus of this review. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Background: Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a highly malaria endemic country in the South-West Pacific with a population of approximately 6.6 million (2009). In 2004, the country intensified its malaria control activities with support from the Global Fund. With the aim of achieving 80% ownership and usage, a country-wide campaign distributed two million free long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). Methods: In order to evaluate outcomes of the campaign against programme targets, a country-wide household survey based on stratified multi-stage random sampling was carried out in 17 of the 20 provinces after the campaign in 2008/09. In addition, a before-after assessment was carried out in six purposively selected sentinel sites. A structured questionnaire was administered to the heads of sampled households to elicit net ownership and usage information. Results: After the campaign, 64.6% of households owned a LLIN, 80.1% any type of mosquito net. Overall usage by household members amounted to 32.5% for LLINs and 44.3% for nets in general. Amongst children under five years, 39.5% used a LLIN and 51.8% any type of net, whereas 41.3% of pregnant women used a LLIN and 56.1% any net. Accessibility of villages was the key determinant of net ownership, while usage was mainly determined by ownership. Most (99.5%) of the household members who did not sleep under a net did not have access to a (unused) net in their household. In the sentinel sites, LLIN ownership increased from 9.4% to 88.7%, ownership of any net from 52.7% to 94.1%. Usage of LLINs increased from 5.5% to 55.1%, usage of any net from 37.3% to 66.7%. Among children under five years, usage of LLINs and of nets in general increased from 8.2% to 67.0% and from 44.6% to 76.1%, respectively (all p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: While a single round of free distribution of LLINs significantly increased net ownership, an insufficient number of nets coupled with a heterogeneous distribution led to overall low usage rates. Programme targets were missed mainly as a result of the distribution mechanism itself and operational constraints in this very challenging setting. © 2012 Hetzel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The association between light exposure at night and sex hormone levels in utero has scarcely reported. We assessed the associations between sleep duration or being awake in the late evening hours, which can be as indicator of light exposure at night, and the maternal and umbilical blood hormone levels during pregnancy and at delivery among Japanese women. The data for 236 women and their newborns who visited a maternal clinic in Gifu, Japan, between May 2000 and October 2001 were analyzed. Maternal blood samples were obtained at approximately the 10th weeks, 29th weeks of gestation, and at delivery. Umbilical cord artery blood was immediately drawn after birth. Information for sleep during pregnancy was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. The levels of estradiol and testosterone were measured using radioimmunoassay. Maternal serum testosterone level in the 10th week was higher among those who were awake at or after 1:00 a.m. than among those who were asleep at that time (P = 0.032). Maternal estradiol level in the 29th week was inversely associated with sleep duration on weekends (P = 0.043). Umbilical testosterone level at delivery inversely correlated with sleep duration on weekdays (P = 0.030). These associations were somewhat stronger among mothers with female offspring than those with male offspring. These results suggested that exposure to light at night might increase sex hormone levels during pregnancy. © The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - Aim: Decreased basal body temperature measurements predict ovulation with an accuracy of 74%. The anovulatory cycle exhibits an ovarian monophasic pattern. This study evaluated the relationship between ovarian cycle pattern and sociodemographic characteristics, menstrual history and work characteristics of nurses in a Taiwan medical center. Methods: Of 200 nurses recruited, 151 were analyzed. Each subject completed questionnaires and provided life recordings and daily basal body temperature measurements during the 14-week study. Results: The analytical results demonstrated that work place (P=0.014) and work shift (P=0.048) are significantly related to ovarian cycle pattern. Nurses who worked in emergent care units and wards had a higher prevalence of irregular ovarian cycle pattern. Approximately 53% of nurses who worked rotating shifts exhibited irregular ovarian cycle pattern. Conclusions: Nurses who either had rotating shift work or worked in emergent care units and wards should be concerned with their own ovarian cycle pattern for their health. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The impact of ovarian hormones on hamster ultradian rhythms (URs) is unknown. We concurrently monitored URs and circadian rhythms (CRs) of home cage locomotor activity during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation of Syrian hamsters. URs with a mean period of 4-5 h were evident during the dark phase in more than 90% of females on days 1 and 2 of the estrous cycle but were significantly less prevalent on cycle days 3 and 4. The period of the UR did not vary as a function of estrous cycle stage, but at all stages, the UR period was longer in the dark than the light phase. The UR acrophase occurred significantly earlier on cycle day 4 than on days 1 and 2, and UR robustness and amplitude were reduced on days 3 and 4. Robustness, mesor, and amplitude of CRs were greater during cycle days 3 and 4; timing of the CR acrophase was delayed on day 4 relative to all other cycle days. Effects of the estrous cycle on URs were evident only during the dark phase. The proportion of hamsters displaying dark phase URs increased significantly during early and late gestation and decreased during lactation. Pregnancy significantly increased UR complexity, robustness, and amplitude. The emergence of URs over gestation was paralleled by decrements in the robustness and amplitude of CRs, which also were absent in a significant proportion of dams during lactation but re-emerged at weaning of litters. The changing endocrine profile of the estrous cycle, hormonal dynamics of pregnancy and lactation, and nursing demands placed on dams are each associated with alterations in the expression of ultradian and circadian locomotor rhythms. Diminution of CRs and augmentation of URs may afford greater behavioral flexibility during life stages when interactions with mates and offspring are less predictable. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To assess the relationship between nocturnal plasma melatonin and serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels in depressed pregnant women (DW) and matched healthy women (HW). Methods: We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression analyses on data obtained from pregnant HW and DW. Results: Log E2 and log P4 were positively correlated with measures of melatonin quantity in HW (p&lt;0.05) but not DW, controlling for age. Log E2 and log P4 were positively correlated with melatonin offset and duration in DW (p&lt;0.01) but not HW. Conclusions: Pregnant DW may be less sensitive than HW to modulation of melatonin secretion by E2 and P4. That melatonin timing measures are more sensitive to E2 and P4 variation in DW may reflect a circadian system more attuned to the need for realignment in DW than in HW. These altered sensitivities to reproductive hormones may reflect a biologic vulnerability that predisposes some pregnant women to depression. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

AB  - The availability to the DNA strand and the activity of the transcription machinery is crucial for the cell to use the information in the DNA. The epigenetic mechanisms DNA methylation, modification of histone tails, other chromatin-modifying processes and interference by small RNAs regulate the cell-type-specific DNA expression. Epigenetic marks can be more or less plastic perpetuating responses to various molecular signals and environmental stimuli, but in addition apparently stochastic epigenetic marks have been found. There is substantial evidence from animal and man demonstrating that both transient and more long-term epigenetic mechanisms have a role in the regulation of the molecular events governing adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis. Intrauterine exposure such as poor maternal nutrition has consistently been demonstrated to contribute to a particular epigenotype and thereby developmental metabolic priming of the exposed offspring in animal and man. Epigenetic modifications can be passed not only from one cell generation to the next, but metabolic disease-related epigenotypes have been proposed to also be transmitted germ-line. Future more comprehensive knowledge on epigenetic regulation will complement genome sequence data for the understanding of the complex etiology of obesity and related disorder. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and aims: Melatonin (MT) is rapidly transferred from the maternal to fetal circulation in humans. There is little knowledge about factors which influence the MT concentration (MTc) in the umbilical cord (UC) blood during delivery. The aim of our study was to evaluate the MT status in the UC blood according to the time and mode of delivery. Subjects and methods: Blood samples from umbilical artery (UA) and vein (UV) were collected from spontaneous vaginal deliveries (SVD, n = 122) and cesarean section deliveries (CSD, n = 188). MTc was measured using a commercially available radioimmunoassay. Results: The MTc was not significantly different between UA and UV blood both at daytime and at nighttime (p = 0.216 and p = 0.440, respectively). Both in UA and in UV, the MTc was significantly higher at nighttime than at daytime (p < 0.0001). Compared with the CSD group, MTc in the SVD group was significantly higher both at night- and daytime (p < 0.05). MTc both in UA and in UV was found to be not significantly different between patients with and without risk factors for stress including pregnancy complications (e.g., preeclampsia) and intrapartum complications (e.g., emergency section, pathological doppler, and pathological cardiotocography) (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Our study revealed for the first time that MTc both in UA and in UV depends on modus of labor. In agreement with other studies, we found a clear circadian MT rhythm in the UC blood of neonates. The results of our study may suggest to a physiological role of MT at the onset of labor. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Statement of problem: Few studies have examined the influence of physical activity on sleep among pregnant women. To examine the potential sleep-enhancing benefits of physical activity among pregnant women and to therefore see if physical activity may serve as a non-pharmacological treatment for sleep disturbances during pregnancy, this study's purpose was to examine the association between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep among a nationally representative sample of U.S. pregnant women. Methods: Data from the National Health and Examination Survey 2005-2006 was used for the present study. 138 pregnant women who had worn an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer on the right hip for at least 4 days for a minimum of 10 h per day were identified. Questions on sleep were asked during the household interview. Results: Of the 22 sleeping-related parameters assessed, physical activity was only associated with two. After controlling for depression, gestation, income and parity, for every 1-min increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, pregnant women were 17% less likely to have difficulty finishing a meal because of being tired or sleepy (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.98-1.38, p = 0.06). Conclusion: Our data suggests a weak relationship between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep. Additional research using a larger sample of pregnant women, as well as experimental studies, are needed to determine the extent to which physical activity may assist in improving sleeping-related parameters among pregnant women. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant and postpartum women, to estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, Berlin Questionnaire for sleep disordered breathing, the international restless leg syndrome (IRLS) Study Group criteria, and the Johns Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview Form (JHTDIF) for RLS. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0. Six hundred eighty-nine women completed sleep surveys. The overall percentage of women with very poor sleep quality (a PSQI score greater than 10), clinically significant insomnia (a total score of 9 or more), excessive daytime sleepiness (a total ESS score of 10 or more), short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) were 80.7%, 50.5%, 34.0% and 29.5%, respectively, and all of three parameters became increased as pregnancy progressed and after delivery (p 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The overall positive rates in Berlin and RLS questionnaires were 25.4% and 19.4%. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are prevalent among Korean pregnant and postpartum women, and increase significantly as pregnancy progresses and after delivery. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Sleep disruption has been suggested to contribute to postpartum mood, but few studies have explored differences in this relationship between nulliparous and multiparous mothers. This study compared the interaction of sleep and mood as a function of parity. Thirty-five nulliparous and 34 multiparous mothers completed questionnaires on mood and sleep, and wore actigraphs for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within 2 weeks postpartum. Mood and objective sleep were better in multiparas than in nulliparas after delivery. However, other than a stronger association between subjective sleep and stress in nulliparous mothers, the relationship between sleep and mood did not differ significantly between the two groups. This suggests that parity might play only a limited role in the interaction between sleep and mood during the immediate postpartum period. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction, resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia and sleep fragmentation. Pathophysiological sequelae include sympathetic activation, increased oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory response, culminating in endothelial dysfunction. These are the proposed mechanisms that mediate the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease among patients with OSA outside of pregnancy. It is intriguing to consider the consequences of these events on pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing literature on the impact of maternal OSA on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes and impaired fetal growth. The data, while promising, require confirmation with larger numbers to verify the findings. OSA may be an important mediator of the poor perinatal outcomes associated with maternal obesity; moreover, one which may be amenable to treatment. This review discusses OSA and summarizes the current literature linking OSA with adverse perinatal outcomes. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fetal movement is one index of fetal well-being. We designed and built a new recorder based on fetal movement acceleration measurement (FMAM). The FMAM recorder has a newly developed, capacitive acceleration sensor that can detect the oscillations of the maternal abdominal wall caused by fetal movements. In this study, the recorder was examined for its suitability for long-term home monitoring of fetal movement by pregnant women themselves. Experiment I: Fourteen pregnant women underwent 45 examinations in the laboratory at gestational 20-39 weeks. We simultaneously recorded fetal movement as detected by the recorder, ultrasonography, and maternal perception, and then calculated agreement among the three methods. We evaluated agreement using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Agreement for gross fetal movement as detected by FMAM and ultrasonography was substantial or almost perfect, while agreement between maternal perception and ultrasonography was moderate or substantial. Experiment II: Six pregnant women undertook 53 experiments at home by themselves. Fetal movement during maternal nocturnal sleep was successfully recorded 50 out of 53 times at home. In conclusion, there was high agreement for gross fetal movement between FMAM and ultrasonography. The recorder is promising for objective, accurate, and long-term home monitoring of gross fetal movement by pregnant women themselves. © 2011 IPEM.

AB  - A population-based questionnaire study of 2,816 women was conducted in week 32 of pregnancy to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for insomnia and depressive symptoms. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) measured insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) measured depressive symptoms. The prevalence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) was 61.9%, and mean BIS score 17.5 (SD = 10.5), significantly higher than among the general population. The prevalence of depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 10) was 14.6%. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with insomnia during late pregnancy, especially with sleep durations <5 or >10 hours, sleep efficiency <75%, daytime impairment, and long sleep onset latency. Pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain was associated with insomnia, but not with depressive symptoms. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Studies of children who undergo major non-cardiac surgery in the neonatal period are needed so that subsequent abnormal neurodevelopment can be better understood. Objective:It was the aim of our study to describe the influence of analgesic and sedative medication on the predominant background pattern and the development of sleep-wake cycling (SWC), as measured on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), in newborn infants born ≥32 weeks' gestation after major non-cardiac surgery. Methods:This prospective study included infants ≥32+0 weeks' gestation admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne who were undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. Data on morphine and midazolam given after surgery were recorded and the BrainZ Monitor was applied post-operatively. The maximum levels of morphine and midazolam were assessed as predictors of time to aEEG outcomes using linear regression. Results: Forty-seven eligible infants were included. Emergence of SWC was observed at a mean of 13 h after surgery. The maximum dose of morphine or midazolam was not predictive of time to either any or developed SWC. Conclusions: Despite high doses of morphine and midazolam, SWC was observed on aEEG in neonates ≥32 weeks' gestational age soon after major non-cardiac surgery. The aEEG background pattern was not affected by the maximum dose of either morphine or midazolam. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Objective: Women with a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis are at extremely high risk of relapse postpartum. Although lithium prophylaxis has demonstrated efficacy in reducing postpartum relapse, the timing of prophylaxis remains controversial given the balance of risks and benefits for the mother and fetus. The authors compared lithium use during pregnancy to its initiation postpartum in women at high risk for postpartum psychosis. Method: Between 2003 and 2010, 70 pregnant women at high risk for postpartum psychosis were referred to the authors' psychiatric outpatient clinic. Women who were initially medication free were advised to start lithium prophylaxis immediately postpartum. Women already taking maintenance lithium during pregnancy were advised to continue treatment. Results: All women with a history of psychosis limited to the postpartum period (N=29) remained stable throughout pregnancy despite being medication free. Of the women with bipolar disorder (N=41), 24.4% relapsed during pregnancy, despite prophylaxis use by the majority throughout pregnancy. The postpartum relapse rate was highest in women with bipolar disorder who experienced mood episodes during pregnancy (60.0%). In contrast, none of the 20 women with a history of postpartum psychosis only who used postpartum prophylaxis relapsed, compared to 44.4% of patients with postpartum psychosis only who declined prophylaxis. Conclusions: The authors recommend initiating prophylactic treatment immediately postpartum in women with a history of psychosis limited to the postpartum period, to avoid in utero fetal exposure to medication. Patients with bipolar disorder require continuous prophylaxis throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period to reduce peripartum relapse risk.

AB  - Objective: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring's neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use. Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD=38). Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus. Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the common endocrine diseases that affects women in their reproductive age. PCOS has diverse clinical implications that include reproductive (infertility, hyperandrogenism, hirsutism), metabolic (insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases) and psychological features (increased anxiety, depression and worsened quality of life). The exact patho-physiology of PCOS is complex and remains largely unclear. The prevalence of PCOS is estimated at 4-18%, depending on diverse factors discussed ahead. The phenotype varies widely depending on life stage, genotype, ethnicity and environmental factors including lifestyle and body weight. During the last decades, obesity and excess weight are major chronic diseases all around the word. Obesity increases some features of PCOS such as hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, infertility and pregnancy complications. Both obesity and insulin resistance increase diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, obesity impairs insulin resistance and exacerbates reproductive and metabolic features of PCOS. It is well known that obesity is associated with anovulation, pregnancy loss and late pregnancy complications (pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes). Obesity in PCOS is also linked to failure or delayed response to the various treatments including clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins and laparoscopic ovarian diathermy. It has been reported that, after losing as little as 5 % of initial body weight obese women with PCOS improved spontaneous ovulation rates and spontaneous pregnancy. Therefore, the weight loss prior to conception improves live birth rate in obese women with or without PCOS. The treatment of obesity may include lifestyle therapy (diet and exercise), pharmacological treatment and bariatric surgery. In summary, weight loss is considered the first-line therapy in obese women with PCOS. In the present review, the consequence and treatment of obesity in women with PCOS are discussed. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background. Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design. Cross-sectional study design. Methods. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results. The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Orexins play a role in many biological functions include sleep, feeding, and energy balance. They also regulate circadian rhythms and the way that we feel pain. Orexins have been identified in a variety of tissues including the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, hypothalamus, spinal cord, sensory ganglion, enteric nervous system, pituitary, adrenal, salivary and lacrimal glands, testis, vestibular gland, and skin. Orexins play a role in a variety of biological functions including arousal, sleeping, food and fluid intake, pain, memory, perception of odor, and sexual activity. Orexins have also been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism. The expression of orexin is induced by hypoglycemia, low food, pregnancy, and hemodialysis. In contrast, factors that inhibit the expression of orexins include obstructive sleep apnea, aging, depression, obesity, traumatic brain injury, and inflammatory molecules such as liposaccharide. In conclusion, orexins are widely distributed and involved in a large variety of biological activities. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

AB  - Background: The circadian clock has been linked to reproduction at many levels in mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have reported increased rates of reproductive abnormalities and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although whether the cause is circadian disruption or another factor associated with shift work is unknown. Here we test whether environmental disruption of circadian rhythms, using repeated shifts of the light:dark (LD) cycle, adversely affects reproductive success in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings: Young adult female C57BL/6J (B6) mice were paired with B6 males until copulation was verified by visual identification of vaginal plug formation. Females were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, phase-delay or phase-advance. Controls remained on a constant 12-hr light:12-hr dark cycle, whereas phase-delayed and phase-advanced mice were subjected to 6-hr delays or advances in the LD cycle every 5-6 days, respectively. The number of copulations resulting in term pregnancies was determined. Control females had a full-term pregnancy success rate of 90% (11/12), which fell to 50% (9/18; p<0.1) in the phase-delay group and 22% (4/18; p<0.01) in the phase-advance group. Conclusions/Significance: Repeated shifting of the LD cycle, which disrupts endogenous circadian timekeeping, dramatically reduces pregnancy success in mice. Advances of the LD cycle have a greater negative impact on pregnancy outcomes and, in non-pregnant female mice, require longer for circadian re-entrainment, suggesting that the magnitude or duration of circadian misalignment may be related to the severity of the adverse impact on pregnancy. These results explicitly link disruptions of circadian entrainment to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mammals, which may have important implications for the reproductive health of female shift workers, women with circadian rhythm sleep disorders and/or women with disturbed circadian rhythms for other reasons. © 2012 Summa et al.

AB  - Objective: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent restless legs syndrome (RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up. Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65,544 women (aged 41-58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs -5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15± times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65-6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53-8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS. Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future. Copyright © 2012 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

AB  - Incidence of cancer in children has increased in recent decades, and known risk factors can account for only a small minority of cases. Gestation and early childhood are particularly vulnerable periods in human development and an important aspect of development is in circadian rhythmicity. Emerging evidence implicates the molecular circadian mechanism in a vast array of other physiologic functions including metabolism, DNA damage response and cell-cycle regulation. Electric light exposure at night can disrupt circadian rhythms and, thereby, many other physiologic processes that are under circadian control. On this basis, it is proposed that ill-timed electric light exposure to pregnant women, to neonates, infants, and small children may increase cancer risk in those children. There are practical implications and interventions that accrue from this idea should it later be confirmed to be true. ©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Objective. To study the variation of protein excretion in short-interval day-and-night collections in hospitalized preeclamptic patients on continuous bed rest. Methods. We prospectively studied 50 patients admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Urine volumes in 2-, 4-, 12-, and 24-h durations were recorded. Protein concentrations in different volumes of urine were measured. Paired t-test was used to compare the volumes, concentrations, and the total amounts of protein in these samples of different durations. Results. There was no significant difference in the volume of urine and the concentration of proteinuria in the day when compared to night (12-h samples) (p > 0.05). The total amount of protein excreted was comparable for the two durations of samples. For shorter-duration collections (4- and 2-h), the difference in proteinuria between day and night samples remained blunted. Conclusion. This study concludes that there is blunting of variation in protein excretion as observed in short-interval urine collections at different times of the day in hypertensive pregnant patients on continuous bed rest. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Delaying motherhood should be a free choice made in full knowledge of all the consequences, but modern women have alarming misconceptions about their own reproductive systems and the effectiveness of assisted reproductive technologies. Doctors and health professionals must begin to discuss fertility preservation with their patients and make sure that young women truly understand all their options. Preventing age-related infertility is the responsibility not only of doctors and medical practitioners but also of society at large. Social, economic, and personal pressures are causing women to decide to conceive later in life, yet those who choose to delay motherhood are stigmatized as being selfish and unconcerned about starting a family. This stigma must be banished, and age-related infertility should be faced as a medical problem. © 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To provide practical and clinically meaningful treatment recommendations that amalgamate clinical and research considerations for several common, and as yet understudied, bipolar disorder complex presentations, within the framework of a proposed stratified model. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was undertaken using electronic database search engines (Medline, PubMed, Web of Science) using key words (e.g., bipolar disorder, anxiety, rapid cycling, and subsyndromal). All relevant randomised controlled trials were examined, in addition to review papers, meta-analyses, and book chapters known to the authors. The findings formed the basis of the treatment recommendations within this paper. Results: In light of the many broad presentations of bipolar disorder, a stratified model of bipolar disorder complexity was developed to facilitate consideration of the myriad of complexities that can occur during the longitudinal course of illness and the appropriate selection of treatment. Evidence-based treatment recommendations are provided for the following bipolar disorder presentations: bipolar II disorder, subsyndromal symptoms, mixed states, rapid cycling, comorbid anxiety, comorbid substance abuse, and for the following special populations: young, elderly, and bipolar disorder around the time of pregnancy and birth. In addition, some key strategies for countering treatment non-response and alternative medication recommendations are provided. Conclusions: Treatment recommendations for the more challenging presentations of bipolar disorder have historically received less attention, despite their prevalence. This review acknowledges the weaknesses in the current evidence base on which treatment recommendations are generally formulated, and additionally emphasises the need for high-quality research in this area. The stratified model provides a means for conceptualizing the complexity of many bipolar disorder presentations and considering their management. © 2012 John Wiley and Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance is common during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of sleep duration and its quality on labor and fetal outcome. Method: In a cross sectional study, primigravida women with singleton pregnancy (gestational age > 37 weeks) were recruited. Women with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or those who needed emergency cesarean section were excluded. Data regarding the type and length of delivery, the quality of sleep as well as the neonates' weight and Apgar scores were recorded. Results: Totally, 457 participants were recruited. There was a significant correlation between the sleep duration and length of delivery stages. In most participants with more than 8 hours sleep, the first stage of delivery lasted between 6 and 10 hours. They had normal vaginal delivery with induction, and their neonates' Apgar score was > 9 (p = 0.029, p = 0.018, and p = 0.001, respectively). Most mothers with refreshing sleep had normal vaginal delivery with induction, their neonates weighted ≥ 2500 g and with Apgar score > 9 (p = 0.010, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005 respectively). Conclusion: Sleep duration and quality of sleep can affect the type of delivery, length of labor stages, as well as neonates' Apgar score and birth weight. Such predictors of labor and fetal outcome should be assessed during prenatal evaluations. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%-16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17) but at a nonsignificant level. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of maternal depressive symptoms at 5 and 9 months postpartum in a low-income and predominantly Hispanic sample, and evaluate the impact on infant weight gain, physical health, and sleep at 9 months. Participants included 132 low-income mother-infant pairs who participated in a larger investigation on prenatal care utilization. Mothers were interviewed in person 24-48 h after birth and by phone at 5 and 9 months postpartum. Clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms were reported in 33% of the women at 5 months postpartum, and 38% at 9 months postpartum. Higher depressive symptoms at 5 months were associated with less infant weight gain from 5 to 9 months, p = .002, increased infant physical health concerns, p = .05, and increased infant nighttime awakenings at 9 months, p = .001. Results suggest a striking prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms through 9 months postpartum in this very low income, largely ethnic minority sample. Further, the effects of postpartum depression include significant ramifications for infant physical health. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Narcolepsy is a life-long neurodegenerative disorder that causes considerable impairment to quality of life. Until the 1970s, the treatment for one of the main symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, was restricted to stimulants, whereas the second core symptom, cataplexy, was treated with antidepressants, and the resultant fragmented night-time sleep with hypnotics. Sodium oxybate (Xyrem®, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) is an efficacious drug for all three symptoms which improves the quality of life of narcoleptic patients. Owing to its metabolic pathway, there is very little pharmacokinetic interaction with other drugs. In combination with modafinil, some of its therapeutic benefits are enhanced. Adverse events and side effects are moderate when taken according to indication and as recommended. Essential limitations have to be considered before starting the treatment (sleep-related breathing disorders, alcohol intake, hypnotic and sedative comedication, and epilepsy). This article gives an overview of sodium oxybate, which has been US FDA approved for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, and EMA approved for the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy. © 2012 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Untreated bipolar disorder during pregnancy leads to detrimental repercussions on the motherinfant pair's health. Despite different drugs having been proposed as mood stabilizers, lithium remains the first-choice agent for preventing mood changes. Areas covered: Analyzing up-to-date information on the reproductive safety of lithium and providing practice guidelines to optimize its use during pregnancy. Expert opinion: Findings from prospective and casecontrol studies confirm an increased, specific risk of Ebstein's anomaly (4.457.6/1000 live births), although lower than that previously reported. A potential increase in the risk of neural tube defects should also be taken into consideration. Moreover, several perinatal complications may occur, and even in the presence of relatively low infant serum levels, in the case of drug exposure during late pregnancy. Despite such concerns, lithium should still be considered the first-choice agent for treating bipolar disorder in pregnancy. Indeed, the U.S. FDA recently issued a new warning regarding the reproductive safety of antipsychotics. Moreover, the risk of fetal valproate/carbamazepine syndrome (and the confirmed neurodevelopmental teratogenicity of valproate) contraindicates the use of both medications, whereas the use of lamotrigine is limited by efficacy concerns. However, women who need lithium treatment during pregnancy should be carefully monitored: a strict gynecologic and psychiatric surveillance and, probably, preconception folate supplementation is highly advisable. Moreover, delivery should be programmed in Neonatal Intensive Care Units to ensure optimal management of potential iatrogenic perinatal complications. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - In order to perform safety-critical roles in emergency situations, flight attendants should meet minimum health standards and not be impaired by factors such as fatigue. In addition, the unique occupational and environmental characteristics of flight attendant employment may have consequential occupational health and safety implications, including radiation exposure, cancer, mental ill-health, musculoskeletal injury, reproductive disorders, and symptoms from cabin air contamination. The respective roles of governments and employers in managing these are controversial. A structured literature review was undertaken to identify key themes for promoting a future agenda for flight attendant health and safety. Recommendations include breast cancer health promotion, implementation of Fatigue Risk Management Systems, standardization of data collection on radiation exposure and health outcomes, and more coordinated approaches to occupational health and safety risk management. Research is ongoing into cabin air contamination incidents, cancer, and fatigue as health and safety concerns. Concerns are raised that statutory medical certification for flight attendants will not benefit either flight safety or occupational health. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury at birth is associated with 1-3/1000 cases of moderate to severe encephalopathy. Previously, we have shown that connexin 43 hemichannel blockade, with a specific mimetic peptide, reduced the occurrence of seizures, improved recovery of EEG power and sleep state cycling, and improved cell survival following global cerebral ischaemia. In the present study, we examined the dose response for intracerebroventricular mimetic peptide infusion (50 μmol/kg/h for 1 h, followed by 50 μmol/kg/24 h (low dose) or 50 μmol/kg/h for 25 h (high dose) or vehicle only (control group), starting 90 min after the end of ischaemia), following global cerebral ischaemia, induced by 30 min bilateral carotid artery occlusion, in near-term fetal sheep (128 ± 1 days gestation). Both peptide infusion groups were associated with a transient significant increase in EEG power between 2-12 h after ischaemia. The ischaemia-low dose group showed a significant recovery of EEG power from day five compared to the ischaemia-vehicle and -high dose groups. In contrast, the high dose infusion was associated with greater secondary increase in impedance (brain cell swelling), as well as a trend towards a greater increase in lactate concentration and mortality. These data suggest that higher doses of connexin mimetic peptide are not beneficial and may be associated with adverse outcomes, most likely attributable to uncoupling of connexin 43 gap junctions leading to dysfunction of the astrocytic syncytium. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Meningioma is a common primary brain tumor in adults. The treatment approach depends on its grade, size and symptoms. The case reported here was a repeatedly recurring transitional meningioma, previously treated with several surgical procedures and two sessions of cranial radiosurgery. At the time of last relapse, temozolomide was administered alone and combined with external beam radiation therapy. At the last follow-up after 38 months, the disease was stable. In conclusion, in this case of plurirecurrent meningioma, treatment with temozolomide alone and in combination with radiotherapy was feasible and associated with limited morbidity, providing clinical benefit and long local disease control. We discuss the case comparing our approach with other experiences reported in the literature. © Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of wheezing and its associated risk factors in infants in the first year of life in the province of Salamanca, Spain. Methods: A multicentre, cross-sectional, descriptive epidemiological study was designed to evaluate a representative sample of 750 infants in the first year of life, born in the province of Salamanca between 1 June 2008 and 30 September 2009.The study was based on a previously validated and standardised written questionnaire administered among the parents of those children seen for control at 12 months of age in any of the Primary Care centres in the province of Salamanca. Results: The recorded wheezing rate was 32.3%. Feeding and sleep were seen to be affected in 46.3% and 80.9% of the wheezing children, respectively, and parent activity was also altered in 39.3% of the cases.A relationship was found between wheezing and nursery attendance (OR: 1.66, 95% confidence interval [1.19-2.31]); weight at birth >3500. g (OR: 1.45 [1.02-2.06]); the presence of eczema at this age (OR: 2.72 [1.75-4.24]); exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (OR: 1.33 [0.98-1.81]); and maternal smoking during the last three months of pregnancy (OR: 1.60 [0.96-2.68]).The prevalence of recurrent wheezing (defined as three or more episodes) was 11.9%. Significant differences were observed with respect to nursery attendance (OR: 1.71 [1.08-2.72]), the presence of eczema at this age (OR: 2.55 [1.48-4.42]), a history of maternal asthma (OR: 2.19 [1.08-4.44]) and exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (OR: 1.53 [0.98-2.38]). Conclusions: In the province of Salamanca, one third of the infants studied suffered wheezing in the first year of life. Infants exclusively breastfed for less than three months; attending a nursery; having suffered eczema; or with an asthmatic mother showed significantly more wheezing than the rest. Wheezing proved recurrent in 11.9% of the cases. © 2011 SEICAP.

AB  - Glomerular hyperfiltration is a phenomenon that can occur in various clinical conditions including kidney disease. No single definition of glomerular hyperfiltration has been agreed upon, and the pathophysiological mechanisms, which are likely to vary with the underlying disease, are not well explored. Glomerular hyperfiltration can be caused by afferent arteriolar vasodilation as seen in patients with diabetes or after a high-protein meal, and/or by efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction owing to activation of the rening "angiotensin" aldosterone system, thus leading to glomerular hypertension. Glomerular hypertrophy and increased glomerular pressure might be both a cause and a consequence of renal injury; understanding the renal adaptations to injury is therefore important to prevent further damage. In this Review, we discuss the current concepts of glomerular hyperfiltration and the renal hemodynamic changes associated with this condition. A physiological state of glomerular hyperfiltration occurs during pregnancy and after consumption of high-protein meals. The various diseases that have been associated with glomerular hyperfiltration, either per nephron or per total kidney, include diabetes mellitus, polycystic kidney disease, secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis caused by a reduction in renal mass, sickle cell anemia, high altitude renal syndrome and obesity. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in glomerular hyperfiltration could enable the development of new strategies to prevent progression of kidney disease. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Amalgam has been used in dentistry since about 150 years and is still being used due to its low cost, ease of application, strength, durability, and bacteriostatic effect. When aesthetics is not a concern it can be used in individuals of all ages, in stress bearing areas, foundation for cast-metal and ceramic restorations and poor oral hygiene conditions. Besides all, it has other advantages like if placed under ideal conditions, it is more durable and long lasting and least technique sensitive of all restorative materials, but, concern has been raised that amalgam causes mercury toxicity. Mercury is found in the earth's crust and is ubiquitous in the environment, so even without amalgam restorations everyone is exposed to small but measurable amount of mercury in blood and urine. Dental amalgam restorations may raise these levels slightly, but this has no practical or clinical significance. The main exposure to mercury from dental amalgam occurs during placement or removal of restoration in the tooth. Once the reaction is complete less amount of mercury is released, and that is far below the current health standard. Though amalgam is capable of producing delayed hypersensitivity reactions in some individuals, if the recommended mercury hygiene procedures are followed the risks of adverse health effects could be minimized. For this review the electronic databases and PubMed were used as data sources and have been evaluated to produce the facts regarding amalgam's safety and toxicity.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and arterial hypertension (AH) are common and underrecognized medical disorders. OSA is a potential risk factor for the development of AH and/or may act as a factor complicating AH management. The symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are considered essential for the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which is a first line treatment of OSA. The medical literature and practice is controversial about the treatment of people with asymptomatic OSA. Thus, OSA patients without EDS may be left at increased cardiovascular risk. Case presentation: The report presents a case of 42 year old Asian woman with symptoms of heart failure and angina like chest pain upon admission. She didn't experience symptoms of EDS, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was seven points. Snoring was reported on direct questioning. The patient had prior medical history of three unsuccessful pregnancies complicated by gestational AH and preeclampsia with C-section during the last pregnancy. The admission blood pressure (BP) was 200/120 mm Hg. The patient's treatment regimen consisted of five hypotensive medications including diuretic. However, a target BP wasn't achieved in about one and half month. The patient was offered to undergo a polysomnography (PSG) study, which she rejected. One month after discharge the PSG study was done, and this showed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 46 events per hour. CPAP therapy was initiated with a pressure of 11 H20 cm. After 2 months of compliant CPAP use, adherence to pharmacologic regimen and lifestyle modifications the patient's BP decreased to 134/82 mm Hg. Conclusions: OSA and AH are common and often underdiagnosed medical disorders independently imposing excessive cardiovascular risk on a diseased subject. When two conditions coexist the cardiovascular risk is likely much greater. This case highlights a possible clinical phenotype of OSA without EDS and its association with resistant AH. Most importantly a good hypotensive response to medical treatment in tandem with CPAP therapy was achieved in this patient. Thus, it is reasonable to include OSA in the differential list of resistant AH, even if EDS is not clinically obvious.

AB  - Introduction: Assessment of loneliness, quality of sleep and affecting factors in elders. Materials and Method: A total of 428 elders were included in the research. The research data were collected using the loneliness scale (UCLA-LS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). One-way analysis of variance, t test and Pearson analysis of correlation were used to evaluate the data. Results: The average loneliness score was 41.87±8.43. The average loneliness score of those living in the nursing home was higher than that of those living in the home environment. The relationship between the average loneliness score and age, educational background, childbearing, and the number of visitors were significant (p<0.05). The average sleep quality score was 6.21±3.33. Educational background, income status, childbearing, having a chronic disease, number of visitors, and duration of residence in the nursing home were found to affect the quality of sleep (p<0.05). A slightly positive relationship (r=0.298; p=0.001) was observed between the average loneliness score and the quality of sleep score. Conclusion: Loneliness and sleep problems are common among elders. In order to improve their quality of life and health status, health care providers should recognize and take necessary actions to alleviate these problems.

AB  - Methamphetamine (MA) use increases the likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior and most MA-using women are of child-bearing age. Therefore, cognitive effects following MA exposure to the developing brain are concerning. Exposure of mice to MA during hippocampal development causes cognitive impairments in adulthood. These effects are more severe in female than male mice and mimicked by the H 3 receptor antagonist thioperamide (THIO). In this study, we assessed whether neonatal exposure to MA or THIO also affects cognition in adolescence. As these effects might be associated with alterations in circadian activity, we also assessed circadian activity in a subgroup of neonatally exposed mice. Sex-dependent treatment effects were seen in the water maze. While THIO-, but not MA-treated female mice showed hippocampus-dependent spatial memory retention in the first probe trial, MA-, but not THIO-treated female mice showed spatial memory retention in the probe trial following reversal training. In contrast, MA- and THIO-treated male mice showed spatial memory retention in both probe trials. When sensorimotor gating was assessed, MA-treated male mice showed greater pre-pulse inhibition than MA-treated female mice. Regardless of sex, THIO-treated mice gained on average more weight each day and showed an enhanced startle response. In addition, MA increased the length of the circadian period, with an intermediate effect following THIO treatment were observed. No treatment effects in exploratory behavior, measures of anxiety, or contextual or cued fear conditioning. Thus, the water maze is particularly sensitive to detect sex-dependent effects of neonatal MA and THIO exposure on spatial memory retention in adolescence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted for the purpose of investigating the effect of a web-based pregnancy counseling and childbirth educational program on pregnant women's activities of daily living. Methods: This is a quasi- experimental study. The web site: http://web.deu.edu.tr/gebelik was used in the education, counseling and data collection stages of the study. The study sample consisted of 32 pregnant women in their 12th-26th week of pregnancy. Individual counseling and a twoweek standard education were given to the pregnant women who participated in the study. In the data collection, forms developed by the researcher were used to determine the pregnant women's activities of daily living (ADL). The pregnant women were assessed before education (BE), as well as one (OM) and two months (TM) after education. Results: The pregnant women's ADL scores steadily increased (p<.001). This result shows that web-based childbirth education and counseling program has a positive effect on pregnant women's ADLs. Conclusions: Web-based childbirth education and counseling can be provided to pregnant women by nurses and midwives.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has a distinctive pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment compared with that of older children and adults. Infants have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction andgas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased chestwall compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia, hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has been associatedwith failure to thrive, behavioral deficits, and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia, mandibular distraction formicrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.

AB  - Background: Problems experienced within the first year of an infant's life can be precursors of later mental health conditions. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency and continuity of difficult behaviors in infants at 3 and 6 months of age and the associations of these difficulties with biomedical and psychosocial factors.Methods: This study was a part of an ongoing prospective birth-cohort study. Study participants were 189 uniparous mothers and their full-term newborns. The index of infant difficult behavior was constructed. This index was then associated with the following factors: delivery mode, newborn function after birth, maternal emotional well-being, risk behavior, subjective evaluation of the quality of the relationship of the couple, and attitudes toward infant-rearing.Results: Common difficult behaviors, including crying, sleeping and eating problems, were characteristic for 30.2% of 3 month old and for 22.2% of 6 month old full-term infants. The expression of infant difficult behaviors at the age of 3 months increased the likelihood of the expression of these difficulties at 6 months by more than 5 times. Factors including younger maternal age, poor prenatal and postnatal emotional well-being, prenatal alcohol consumption, low satisfaction with the couple's relationship before pregnancy, and deficiency of infant-centered maternal attitudes towards infant-rearing increased the likelihood of difficult behaviors in infants at the age of 3 months. Low maternal satisfaction with the relationship of the couple before pregnancy, negative emotional reactions of both parents toward pregnancy (as reported by the mother) and the deficiency of an infant-centered maternal attitude towards infant-rearing increased the likelihood of infant difficult behaviors continuing between the ages of 3 to 6 months. Perinatal biomedical conditions were not related to the difficult behaviors in infants.Conclusions: Our study suggests that early onset of difficult behavior highly increases the risk for the continuation of difficult behavior during infancy. In general, the impact of prenatal psychosocial environment on infant behavior decreases from the ages of 3 to 6 months; however, some prenatal and preconceptional psychosocial factors have direct associations with the continuity of difficult behaviors through the first half-year of an infant's life. © 2012 Sirvinskiene et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the coupling of the biological system of infant sleep and the social system of mother-infant synchrony. Before birth and shortly after birth the systems appear to be connected, but it is unclear whether this remains the case over time. This study therefore examined whether infant sleep measured at 6 weeks and 5 months could predict mother-infant gaze synchrony after a social challenge at 5 months (N=84). Infant sleep was measured in terms of sleep bout duration, which normally increases during this period. Gaze was defined in terms of looking at each other's head simultaneously, known as gaze synchrony, or looking elsewhere. Results showed that infant sleep could predict the temporal dynamics of the mother-infant interaction in terms of flexibility of gaze pattern shifts. The larger the increase in sleep bout duration over age, the more flexible the interaction appeared to be. Maternal Age, type of feeding and change of feeding appeared to function as confounding variables in this relation. Infant sleep could not predict percentage of synchrony (central tendency measure) or the average sequence length of gaze patterns (temporal dynamic measure). © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Some infants show a free-running rhythm in their rest-activity. We do not know why, nor do we know exactly what the entrainment factors are for the development of the normal 24-h rest-activity rhythm. Actigraphic recordings on 10 primiparae during late pregnancy and these mothers and their infants during the 2nd, 6th, and 12th wks after birth were made over 35 continuous days to investigate maternal and infant entrainment. One infant showed a free-running rest-activity circadian rhythm. In late pregnancy, the period in the autocorrelogram of the mother with the free-running infant was longer than the significant period of the mean autocorrelogram of the mothers with non-free-running infants. The finding of this study indicates the free-running rhythm of infant is not reset by maternal entrainment factors. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Objectives.To investigate whether parameters in fetal biophysical profile (BPP) testing exhibit a diurnal rhythm and to discuss the probable factors associated with these variables. Methods.Thirty healthy primigravid patients carrying pregnancies between 35 and 40 completed weeks were enrolled for the study. Fetal BPP testing was performed for each patient both in the early morning (08:00-10:00 am) and in the late evening (08:00-10:00 pm), and the scoring parameters were compared between morning and evening tests. Results.BPP scores in the evening were significantly higher than that in the morning (p < 0.05). Deepest vertical amniotic pocket measurements and fetal breathing absence in the morning mostly contributed to this variation (p < 0.001). Fetal movement counts were also significantly lower in the morning tests (p < 0.001). Conclusions.The parameters of BPP exhibit circadian variations in healthy fetuses, which may be associated with many factors such as fetomaternal hormones. It is essential for the clinician to be aware of these changes when interpreting the results, as interventions based on false-positive results may have deleterious effects on both the mother and her fetus. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Maternal food restriction during pregnancy results in adverse consequences for offspring, including obesity and cardiovascular disease. Early pregnancy is a critical period for this programming effect. Leptin is a regulator of energy homeostasis that also affects placental and fetal development. As food restriction results in decreased serum leptin levels, at least in non-pregnant animals, leptin depletion may be one mechanism by which food restriction affects development. The objective of this study was to test whether moderate food restriction affects serum leptin concentrations during the first half of pregnancy. We found that restriction to 50% of ad libitum consumption levels resulted in a significant decrease in serum leptin concentrations in both pregnant and nonpregnant female mice. There was no significant difference in serum leptin concentrations between non-pregnant females and at pregnancy day 11.5 when fed ad libitum. However, there was a difference in the source of leptin during pregnancy, with greater production in visceral fat in pregnant mice, and greater production in subcutaneous fat in non-pregnant mice. Leptin concentrations were dependent on time of day and time of sampling relative to feeding, particularly in restricted mice. There was a significant difference in serum leptin concentrations between fed and restricted mice when they were fed and sampled in afternoon, but not when they were fed and sampled in morning. We conclude that food restriction results in a significant decrease in leptin concentration during the first half of pregnancy in mice, but that detection of this relationship is subject to experimental design considerations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with sleep apnea have been reported to be associated with increased prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in some papers, which were criticized for either a small sample size or lack of a prospective control. Our study strived to explore the relationship of sleep apnea and the subsequent development of DVT using a nationwide, population-based database. METHODS: Of the 10,185 sampled patientsFrom 2000 to 2007, we identified a study cohort consisting of newly diagnosed sleep apnea cases in the National Health Insurance Research Database. A control cohort without sleep apnea, matched for age, sex, comorbidities, major operation, and fractures, was selected for comparison. The 2 cohorts were followed-up, and we observed the occurrence of DVT by registry of DVT diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 10,185 sampled patients (5680 sleep apnea patients vs. 4505 control), 40 (0.39%) cases developed DVT during a mean follow-up period of 3.56 years, including 30 (0.53%) from the sleep apnea cohort and 10 (0.22 %) from the control group. Subjects with sleep apnea experienced a 3.113-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.516-6.390; P = .002) increase in incident DVT, which was independent of age, sex, and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier analysis also revealed the tendency of sleep apnea patients toward DVT development (log-rank test, P = .001). The risk of DVT was even higher in sleep apnea cases who needed continuous positive airway pressure treatment (hazard ratio 9.575; 95% confidence interval, 3.181-28.818; P <.001). CONCLUSION: Sleep apnea may be an independent risk factor for DVT. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the body composition of offspring. SUBJECTS: Grade 4 elementary school children (n=1366; boys/girls, 724/642; 9-10 years old) were enrolled in this study. All parents answered a lifestyle questionnaire, and children underwent passive smoking tests. Urinary cotinine measurement and lifestyle screening test parameters (that is, body weight, body length, body mass index (BMI), obesity index (OI), blood tests for liver function and lipid profile and questions regarding maternal smoking and lifestyle) were evaluated in terms of their relationship with maternal smoking. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentration was measured in 80 randomly selected children to assess its relationship with oxidative stress. RESULTS: Both BMI and OI were significantly higher in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy than in those whose mothers never smoked (BMI: 17.2±2.7 vs 16.9±2.5 kg m -2, P=0.016; OI: 2.7±14.3% vs 0.4±14.0%, P=0.003). The degree of elevation was positively correlated with the duration of maternal smoking. The increases in BMI and OI resulted from increased body weight and reduced height. The confounding factors - 'breakfast with family', 'watching television at dinner', 'eating and drinking before sleep', 'watching television for &gt;2 h', 'sleep duration &lt;8 h' and 'playing sports' - were statistically significant. BMI and OI were significantly high in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy in these six confounders. On the other hand, urinary 8-OHdG concentration was negatively correlated with BMI in children who had &gt;1.3 ng ml -1 urinary cotinine, suggesting that it may be related to basal metabolism due to oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Maternal smoking is a risk factor for higher BMI and OI in 9- to 10-year-old children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy and may be independent of other confounding factors. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterized by uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs, developing at rest, that compel the person to move. Symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS occurs in 7-11% of the population in western countries, and is increasingly common in older people. Primary RLS is familial in up to two-thirds of patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions, including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, to neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay between systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. Dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment for those requiring pharmacotherapy; however, correction of underlying problems, in particular iron deficiency, is also important. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Examine statistical effects of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) symptom trajectories from 6 months to 7 years on subsequent behavior. METHODS: Parents in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children reported on children's snoring, mouth breathing, and witnessed apnea at ≥2 surveys at 6, 18, 30, 42, 57, and 69 months, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 4 (n = 9140) and 7 (n = 8098) years. Cluster analysis produced 5 "Early" (6-42 months) and "Later" (6-69 months) symptom trajectories ("clusters"). Adverse behavioral outcomes were defined by top 10th percentiles on Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total and subscales, at 4 and 7 years, in multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: The SDB clusters predicted ≈20% to 100% increased odds of problematic behavior, controlling for 15 potential confounders. Early trajectories predicted problematic behavior at 7 years equally well as at 4 years. In Later trajectories, the "Worst Case" cluster, with peak symptoms at 30 months that abated thereafter, nonetheless at 7 years predicted hyperactivity (1.85 [1.30-2.63]), and conduct (1.60 [1.18-2.16]) and peer difficulties (1.37 [1.04-1.80]), whereas a "Later Symptom"cluster predicted emotional difficulties (1.65 [1.21-2.07]) and hyperactivity (1.88 [1.42-2.49]) . The 2 clusters with peak symptoms before 18 months that resolve thereafter still predicted 40% to 50% increased odds of behavior problems at 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based, longitudinal study, early-life SDB symptoms had strong, persistent statistical effects on subsequent behavior in childhood. Findings suggest that SDB symptoms may require attention as early as the first year of life. Copyright © 2012 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004-2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - Traditionally, nocturia was considered to be one of the symptoms of prostatism. However, this symptom has unusual characteristics compared with other lower urinary tract symptoms; for example, there is only a mild benefit for nocturia from treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. In the past decade, nocturia has been investigated as a separate symptom in epidemiological studies. These types of studies have shown various correlates for nocturia other than benign prostatic hyperplasia, as well as the prevalence of this symptom. These correlates include age, race/ethnicity, medical problems (such as hypertension, diabetes and stroke) psychological aspects, tasting habits, quality of life and even mortality. The cause-and-effect associations are not always obvious between nocturia and its correlates. In the present article, the author attempts to comprehensively review the correlates for nocturia shown by epidemiological studies. © 2012 The Japanese Urological Association.

AB  - This report summarizes a conference: "Early Origins of Child Obesity: Bridging Disciplines and Phases of Development", held in Chicago on September 30-October 1, 2010. The conference was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health and the Williams Heart Foundation, to achieve the conference objective: forging a next-step research agenda related to the early origins of childhood obesity. This research agenda was to include working with an array of factors (from genetic determinants to societal ones) along a continuum from prenatal life to age 7, with an emphasis on how the developing child deals with the challenges presented by his/her environment (prenatal, parental, nutritional, etc.). The conference offered a unique opportunity to facilitate communication and planning of future work among a variety of researchers whose work separately addresses different periods in early life. Over the span of two days, speakers addressed existing, critical research topics within each of the most-studied age ranges. On the final day, workshops fostered the discussion needed to identify the highest priority research topics related to linking varied early factor domains. These are presented for use in planning future research and research funding. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In nonpregnant populations, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Few studies have examined the relationship between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). The objective of this study was to examine the association between SDB and APO. Women who had a delivery as well as an in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) were identified. Demographics, PSG results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. Absence of SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of <5, mild SDB as an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and moderate to severe SDB as an AHI of ≥ 15. The primary outcome was a composite measure of APO: pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth ≤34 weeks. We identified 143 women who had undergone a PSG and a delivery. Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk of the composite APO: AHI <5, 18.1%; AHI 5 to 14.9, 23.5%; AHI ≥ 15, 38.5% (p = 0.038). Obese women (body mass index ≥30) with moderate to severe SDB had the highest rate of APO, 41.7%. SDB, especially moderate to severe disease, may be associated with APO. However, it is unclear if SDB is a risk factor for APO independent of obesity. © 2012 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Work in this laboratory demonstrated a role for rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in critical period (CP), postnatal days (P) 17-30, synaptic plasticity in visual cortex. Studies in adolescent rats showed that REMS deprivation (REMSD) reinitiates a developmentally regulated form of synaptic plasticity that otherwise is observed only in CP animals. Subsequent work added that REMSD affects inhibitory mechanisms that are thought to be involved in terminating the CP. Neurotrophins are implicated in the synaptic plasticity that underlies CP maturation and also final closure of the CP in visual cortex. Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is dependent upon neuronal activity, and REMSD may block BDNF expression. We propose that REMS contributes to the maturation of visual cortex through regulation of BDNF expression and consequent, downstream increase in cortical inhibitory tone. In this study, osmotic minipumps delivered BDNF into visual cortex on one side of brain. The opposite hemisphere was not implanted and served as an internal control. We tested the hypothesis that BDNF is blocked by REMSD in late-adolescent rats and investigated whether replacing BDNF prevents induction of LTPWM-III by theta burst stimulation (TBS). We also assessed relative inhibitory tone in visual cortex with paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) in animals that were similarly REMSD- and BDNF-infused. After REMSD, both hemispheres were prepared in parallel for in vitro synaptic plasticity studies (LTPWM-III or PPS). In visual cortex of REMSD rats on the side receiving BDNF infusions (8 of 8 animals), TBS consistently failed to induce LTPWM-III. In contrast, LTPWM-III was obtained (5 of 5 animals) in the matched, non-infused hemisphere, as expected in rats of this age. REMSD animals that were unilaterally infused with saline produced LTPWM-III in both hemispheres. PPS studies in another group of REMSD animals that were unilaterally BDNF-infused displayed age-appropriate inhibition of the second response on the BDNF-infused side (5/5), whereas on the non-infused side facilitation was observed (3/3). Intracortical infusion of BDNF in REMSD adolescent rats appears to restore neurochemical processes necessary for termination of the CP for developmentally regulated synaptic plasticity in visual cortex. The results suggest that REMSD blocks BDNF expression and also maturation of inhibitory processes in adolescent visual cortex. These data support REMS' function in brain development. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background & Aim: Rapid changes experienced after child birth expose mothers to unpleasant experiences such as disturbances in sleep pattern. These experiences threaten health of mothers and infants. Some studies have shown that exercise can be an effective and nonpharmacologic method in improving sleep quality. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of exercise on sleep quality among postpartum mothers. Methods & Materials: This was a randomized clinical trial. Eighty primiparous women aged 18-35 years were recruited from health centers in Rafsanjan in 2009. The inclusion criteria were singleton pregnancy, lack of any acute and chronic physical and mental illnesses, having healthy and term babies, and having vaginal deliveries. Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n=40) and control (n=40) groups. Women in the intervention group received five 30-minutes sessions of Pilates weekly for eight weeks. The PSQI instrument was used to measure the related variables at baseline, forth and eighth weeks after the deliveries. Data were analyzed using the repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Significant improvement was seen in the intervention group within eight weeks follow-up; the interaction within time and group was significant (P=0.02). Comparison of mean sleep quality between the two groups has shown that the intervention was effective (P<0.001). Conclusion: The Pilates exercise was effective in improving quality of sleep in postpartum period.

AB  - The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the peripartum outcomes of yoga during pregnancy, including the postpartum period and lactation. The PubMed database was analyzed from January 1970 to January 2011. We identified five prospective observational studies (n = 575) and three randomized clinical trials (RCTs; n = 298), which were analyzed separately. The nonrandomized trials indicated a significant reduction in rates of preterm labor (p < 0.0006), intrauterine growth retardation (p <0.003), low birth weight (p < 0.01), pregnancy discomforts (p = 0.01), and perceived sleep disturbances (p = 0.03) in those who practiced yoga during pregnancy. Results of the RCTs indicated that doing yoga during pregnancy can significantly lower pain and discomfort (p < 0.05) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) and improve quality of life in physical domains (p = 0.001). All three RCTs were poorly compliant with the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials statement. While awaiting an appropriately designed RCT to determine the benefits of yoga during pregnancy, it remains a viable exercise option. Copyright © 2012 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Insomnia is a common condition which includes trouble falling, or staying, asleep. This condition can range from being mild to severe, depending on how often it occurs, and for how long. The main focus of treatment for insomnia should be directed towards finding the underlying cause. Once a cause is identified, it is important to manage and control the underlying problem, as this alone may be able to eliminate the insomnia. Treating the symptoms of insomnia,without addressing the underlying cause, is rarely successful. In the majority of cases, chronic insomnia can be resolved if its medical or psychiatric causes are identified, and treated appropriately. © Medpharm.

AB  - The transition from pregnancy to lactation is the most stressful period in the life of a cow. During this transition, homeorhetic adaptations are coordinated across almost every organ and are marked by changes in hormones and metabolism to accommodate the increased energetic demands of lactation. Recent data from our laboratory showed that changes in circadian clocks occur in multiple tissues during the transition period in rats and indicate that the circadian system coordinates changes in the physiology of the dam needed to support lactation. Circadian rhythms coordinate the timing of physiological processes and synchronize these processes with the environment of the animal. Circadian rhythms are generated by molecular circadian clocks located in the hypothalamus (the master clock) and peripherally in every organ of the body. The master clock receives environmental and physiological cues and, in turn, synchronizes internal physiology by coordinating endocrine rhythms and metabolism through peripheral clocks. The effect of the circadian clock on lactation may be inferred by the photoperiod effect on milk production, which is accompanied by coordinated changes in the endocrine system and metabolic capacity of the dam to respond to changes in day length. We have shown that bovine mammary epithelial cells possess a functional clock that can be synchronized by external stimuli, and the expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like gene, a positive limb of the core clock, is responsive to prolactin in bovine mammary explants. Others showed that 7% of genes expressed in breasts of lactating women had circadian patterns of expression, and we report that the diurnal variation of composition of bovine milk is associated with changes in expression of mammary core clock genes. Together these studies indicate that the circadian system coordinates the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation, and we believe that the capacity of the dam to produce milk and cope with metabolic stresses in early lactation is related to her ability to set circadian rhythms during the transition period. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Social factors can more or less influence the circadian rhythms. We propose in a firstpart to review the different types of influences of social factors on rhythms inVertebrates. After that, we will describe ours results on this topic on two connectedpoints in birds. At first, we search how circadian rhythm can influence social life inJapanese quail. We demonstrated that birds showing a strong endogenous rhythm aremore synchronised into a group. More recently, we found that these birds are moresocially reactive, and are more easily integrated in a new group. Then, circadian rhythminfluence social life of animals. In a second way of studies to link rhythm and social life,we are interested by social influences on rhythm development. Social influences canemanate from parents, in particular mothers during ontogeny. Studies show that thematernal rhythm of mammals during gestation and during the early life of their younginfluences the ontogeny of rhythms. In birds, we recently demonstrated that motheringfavoured the expression of endogenous rhythms of the chicks. Moreover, mothers possessa non-genomic transmission of their circadian rhythms parameters. To conclude, we willexpose perspectives of works, especially following a new way of approach using robotanimalinteraction we developed in our research unit.© 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental variables such as photoperiod, heat, stress, nutrition and other external factors have profound effects on quality and quantity of a dairy cow's milk. The way in which the environment interacts with genotype to impact milk production is unknown; however, evidence from our laboratory suggests that circadian clocks play a role. Daily and seasonal endocrine rhythms are coordinated in mammals by the master circadian clock in the hypothalamus. Peripheral clocks are distributed in every organ and coordinated by signals from the master clock. We and others have shown that there is a circadian clock in the mammary gland. Approximately 7% of the genes expressed during lactation had circadian patterns including core clock and metabolic genes. Amplitude changes occurred in the core mammary clock genes during the transition from pregnancy to lactation and were coordinated with changes in molecular clocks among multiple tissues. In vitro studies using a bovine mammary cell line showed that external stimulation synchronized mammary clocks, and expression of the core clock gene, BMAL1, was induced by lactogens. Female clock/clock mutant mice, which have disrupted circadian rhythms, have impaired mammary development and their offspring failed to thrive suggesting that the dam's milk production was not adequate enough to nourish their young. We envision that, in mammals, during the transition from pregnancy to lactation the master clock is modified by environmental and physiological cues that it receives, including photoperiod length. In turn, the master clock coordinates changes in endocrine milieu that signals peripheral tissues. In dairy cows, it is clear that changes in photoperiod during the dry period and/or during lactation influences milk production. We believe that the photoperiod effect on milk production is mediated, in part by the 'setting' of the master clock with light, which modifies peripheral circadian clocks including the mammary core clock and subsequently impacts milk yield and may impact milk composition. © Copyright The Animal Consortium 2011.

AB  - Considerable efforts have been made since the 1950s to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of metformin, a potent antihyperglycaemic agent now recommended as the first-line oral therapy for T2D (Type 2 diabetes). The main effect of this drug from the biguanide family is to acutely decrease hepatic glucose production, mostly through a mild and transient inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. In addition, the resulting decrease in hepatic energy status activates AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), a cellular metabolic sensor, providing a generally accepted mechanism for the action of metformin on hepatic gluconeogenesis. The demonstration that respiratory chain complex I, but not AMPK, is the primary target of metformin was recently strengthened by showing that the metabolic effect of the drug is preserved in liver-specific AMPK-deficient mice. Beyond its effect on glucose metabolism, metformin has been reported to restore ovarian function in PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), reduce fatty liver, and to lower microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with T2D. Its use has also recently been suggested as an adjuvant treatment for cancer or gestational diabetes and for the prevention in pre-diabetic populations. These emerging new therapeutic areas for metformin will be reviewed together with recent findings from pharmacogenetic studies linking genetic variations to drug response, a promising new step towards personalized medicine in the treatment of T2D. © The Authors Journal compilation copy; 2012 Biochemical Society.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various diseases during pregnancy and the perinatal period. Newborns are more prone to oxidative stress than individuals later in life. During pregnancy, increased oxygen demand augments the rate of production of ROS and women, even during normal pregnancies, experience elevated oxidative stress compared with non-pregnant women. ROS generation is also increased in the placenta during preeclampsia. Melatonin is a highly effective direct free-radical scavenger, indirect antioxidant, and cytoprotective agent in human pregnancy and it appears to be essential for successful pregnancy. This suggests a role for melatonin in human reproduction and in neonatal pathologies (asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, etc.). This review summarizes current knowledge concerning the role for melatonin in human pregnancy and in the newborn. Numerous studies agree that short-term melatonin therapy is highly effective in reducing complications during pregnancy and in the neonatal period. No significant toxicity or treatment-related side effects with long-term melatonin therapy in children and adults have been reported. Treatment with melatonin might result in a wide range of health benefits, including improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs. © 2012 Informa Uk,Ltd.

AB  - Photoperiod, or the daily sequence of light and dark, has dramatic effects on many physiological systems across animal species. Light patterns alter melatonin secretion profiles and, subsequently, the release profiles and circulating concentrations of several hormones that influence a variety of physiological responses. Although the impact of photoperiod on reproductive processes is perhaps the most common example, it is often the seasonal aspects of ovulation and anestrus that are considered. However, in cattle, the final phase of reproduction, that is, lactation, is significantly influenced by photoperiod. In contrast to short days (SDPP; 8 h light:16 h dark), exposure to long days (LDPP) of 16 to 18 h of light and 6 to 8 h of darkness increases milk yield 2 to 3 kg/d, regardless of the stage of lactation. There is evidence that this LDPP effect is due to increased circulating IGF-I, independent of any effect on GH concentrations. Cows that are housed under SDPP during the dry period have increased mammary growth and produce 3 to 4 kg/d more milk in the subsequent lactation compared with cows on LDPP when dry. While cows are on SDPP, circulating prolactin (PRL) diminishes but expression of PRL receptor increases in mammary, liver, and immune cells. Moreover, PRL signaling pathways within those tissues are affected by photoperiod. Further, replacement of PRL to cows on SDPP partially reverses the effects of SDPP on production in the next lactation. Thus, effects on dry cows are mediated through a PRL-dependent pathway. Before maturity, LDPP improve mammary parenchymal accumulation and lean body growth, which lead to greater yields in the first lactation. The accumulated evidence supports the concept that photoperiod manipulation can be harnessed to improve the efficiency of production across the life cycle of the dairy cow. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Ovarian folliculogenesis is characterized by drastic proliferation and differentiationof granulosa and theca cells. The uterus is closely synchronized to the ovary: increasedovarian steroids regulate the uterus as one of the principal targets to prepare embryonicimplantation following fertilization. In rodents, the endometrial stoma cells undergoproliferation and decidualization in response to ovarian steroids and embryonicimplantation at the early stage of pregnancy. Cellular functions in the ovary and uterusare accompanied by cyclic changes of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.The clock system may contribute to the progress of follicular development, luteinizationand luteolysis, and ovarian steroid-induced proliferation and differentiation of uterus cellsthrough fluctuating hormones. Recently, there is a growing body of evidence that thecircadian clock genes are expressed in reproductive tissues including the ovary anduterus. The clock genes such as Periods are differently expressed in heterogeneous celltypes of the ovary and uterus. The hormonal regulation of circadian clockworks inovarian and uterus stoma cells is mentioned in the present review. The circadianpacemaker was altered in ovarian and uterus cells during cell differentiation andapoptosis. Progesterone might play a pivotal role in the circadian oscillator of the uterusendometrial stoma cells. However, the Per2 circadian oscillation was down-regulated inuterus endometrial stoma cells during decidualization, even though serum progesteronelevel is high at this stage. Thus, alteration of the circadian pacemaker results largely fromhormonal inputs such as gonadotropins and ovarian steroids, but cell differentiation alsodisrupts the circadian pacemaker.© 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.All rights reserved.

AB  - To analyze the association between fetal brain growth and late gestational blood serum cortisol in normal pregnancy.Blood total cortisol was quantified at delivery in 432 Chinese mother/child pairs. Key inclusion criteria of the cohort were: no structural anomalies of the newborn, singleton pregnancy, no alcohol abuse, no drug abuse or history of smoking no hypertensive disorders and no impairment of glucose tolerance and no use of steroid medication during pregnancy. Differential ultrasound examination of the fetal body was done in early (gestational day 89.95±7.31), middle (gestational day 160.17±16.12) and late pregnancy (gestational day 268.89±12.42). Newborn's cortisol was not correlated with any of the ultrasound measurements during pregnancy nor with birth weight. Multivariable regression analysis, considering timing of the ultrasound examination, the child's sex, maternal BMI, maternal age, maternal body weight at delivery, the timing of cortisol measurement and maternal uterine contraction states, revealed that maternal serum total cortisol was significantly negative correlated with ultrasound parameters describing the fetal brain: late biparietal diameter (R 2=0.512, p=0.009), late head circumference (R 2=0.498, p=0.001), middle biparietal diameter (R 2=0.819, p=0.013), middle cerebellum transverse diameter R 2=0.76, p=0.014) and early biparietal diameter(R 2=0.819, p=0.013). The same analysis revealed that birth weight as well as ultrasound parameters such as abdominal circumference and femur length were not correlated to maternal cortisol levels.In conclusion, our study demonstrates that maternal cortisol secretion within physiological ranges may be inversely correlated to fetal brain growth but not to birth weight. It remains to be demonstrated whether maternal cortisol secretion negatively influencing fetal brain growth translates to adverse neurological outcomes in later life. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding sinoatrial node (SAN) development could help in developing therapies for SAN dysfunction. However, electrophysiological investigation of SAN development remains difficult because mutant mice with SAN dysfunctions are frequently embryonically lethal. Most research on SAN development is therefore limited to immunocytochemical observations without comparable functional studies. Methods and Results: We applied a multielectrode array (MEA) recording system to study SAN development in mouse hearts acutely isolated at embryonic ages (E) 8.5-12.5 days. Physiological heart rates were routinely restored, enabling accurate functional assessment of SAN development. We found that dominant pacemaking activity originated from the left inflow tract (LIFT) region at E8.5, but switched to the right SAN by E12.5. Combining MEA recordings and pharmacological agents, we show that intracellular calcium (Ca 2+)-mediated automaticity develops early and is the major mechanism of pulse generation in the LIFT of E8.5 hearts. Later in development at E12.5, sarcolemmal ion channels develop in the SAN at a time when pacemaker channels are down-regulated in the LIFT, leading to a switch in the dominant pacemaker location. Additionally, low micromolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a sodium channel blocker, minimally affect pacemaker rhythm at E8.5-E12.5, but suppress atrial activation and reveal a TTX-resistant SAN-atrioventricular node (internodal) pathway that mediates internodal conduction in E12.5 hearts. Conclusions: Using a physiological mapping method, we demonstrate that differential mechanistic development of automaticity between the left and right inflow tract regions confers the pacemaker location switch. Moreover, a TTX-resistant pathway mediates preferential internodal conduction in E12.5 mouse hearts. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Fetal sleep states emerge during the third trimester of pregnancy and involve multiple interconnected neuronal networks. We examined whether fetal sleep characteristics predict child and adolescent self-regulation in a non-clinical sample (study group, n=25; reference group, n=48). Combined recordings of three sleep variables (fetal heart rate, body movements and rapid eye movements) were made for 2. h at 36-38 weeks' gestation. Fetuses showing synchronous change of sleep variables (i.e. within 3. min) at transition from quiet into active sleep reached a higher level of effortful control, both at 8-9 and 14-15 years, than fetuses not making synchronous transitions and compared with the reference group. Results are discussed from a Developmental Origins of Behavior, Health and Disease (DOBHaD) point of view. It is concluded that studying sleep ontogeny offers the possibility to gain insight into brain maturational processes and/or environmental adaptive processes that may have long term behavioral developmental consequences. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective. To describe the background characteristics of women who gave birth to their first child at an advanced and very advanced maternal age, including their sociodemographic background, social relationships, health behavior, physical and mental health, and reproductive history. Design. Cross-sectional data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Setting. Norway. Sample. 41 236 Norwegian-speaking nulliparous women. Methods. Data were collected by the first questionnaire distributed in week 17 of pregnancy during the recruitment period 1999-2008. The distribution of descriptive variables in relation to age was investigated, by means of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Main outcome measures. Advanced (33-37 years) and very advanced (≥38 years) maternal age. Results. Women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age differed from the younger women with regard to a wide range of background characteristics, and this difference was most pronounced for the very advanced group. Problems related to physical aging were more common (infertility, physical health problems, sleep problems, depression and fatigue). Of the sociodemographic factors; high annual income and low level of education were most strongly correlated with high maternal age, followed by single status, unemployment, unsatisfactory relationship with partner and unplanned pregnancy. Conclusions. Besides having more age-related reproductive and physical health problems, women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age constituted a heterogeneous group characterized by either socioeconomic prosperity or vulnerability. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The increasing numbers of obese and morbidly obese individuals in the community are having a direct effect on forensic facilities. In addition to having to install more robust equipment for handling large bodies, the quality of autopsy examinations may be reduced by the physical difficulties that arise in trying to position bodies correctly so that normal examinations can proceed. Accelerated putrefaction is often an added complication. Metabolic disturbances resulting from obesity increase susceptibility to a range of conditions that are associated with sudden and unexpected death, and surgery may have increased complications. The rates of a number of different malignancies, including lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma and multiple myeloma, and carcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, gallbladder, thyroid, prostate, breast and endometrium, are increased. In addition, obese individuals have higher rates of diabetes mellitus, and sepsis. The unexpected collapse of an obese individual should raise the possibility of a wide range of conditions, many of which may be more difficult to demonstrate at autopsy than in an individual with a normal body mass index. Although sudden cardiac death due to cardiomegaly, pulmonary thromboembolism, or ischemic heart disease may be the most probable diagnosis in an unexpected collapse, the range of possible underlying conditions is extensive and often only determinable after full postmortem examination. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Purpose of review: Acupuncture has a growing clientele during pregnancy, delivery and the puerperium for an ever increasing list of indications. Objective evidence for its benefit is necessary to establish its roles in current practice. Recent findings: For many of the current uses, randomized studies when conducted using at least one control group have not established any clear advantages from treatment. Those areas which rely upon subjective assessment of symptoms are particularly difficult to investigate without rigorous blinding strategies, separating those who provide the acupuncture from those assessing outcome. Studies investigating the possible therapeutic benefit of acupuncture for managing intrapartum care require outcomes for nulliparae and multiparae to be analysed separately. Summary: Acupuncture therapy may offer some advantage over conventional treatment in the management of hyperemesis gravidarum and postcaesarean section pain and these areas warrant further study. Rigorous randomized studies, particularly those using objective measures, have failed to identify any obvious benefits from acupuncture for many of the other conditions studied. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - A long-standing critique of adolescent employment is that it engenders a precocious maturity of more adult-like roles and behaviors, including school disengagement, substance use, sexual activity, inadequate sleep and exercise, and work-related stress. Though negative effects of high-intensity work on adolescent adjustment have been found, little research has addressed whether such work experiences are associated with precocious family formation behaviors in adolescence, such as sexual intercourse, pregnancy, residential independence, and union formation. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that teenagers who spend long hours on the job during the school year are more likely to experience these family formation behaviors earlier than youth who work moderately or not at all. © 2011 Society for Research on Adolescence.

AB  - Although it is known that many antipsychotic drugs, at the doses prescribed for schizophrenia, are sedative and cause daytime drowsiness, the effect of potentially diminished vigilance on parenting parameters has not been studied. The aim of this paper is to advise clinicians about sedative load in mothers who are prescribed antipsychotic medication. A Medline search was conducted into the sedative effects of antipsychotics, with the following search terms: sleep; sedation; somnolence; wakefulness; antipsychotics; schizophrenia, parenting, maternal behavior, and custody. The results showed that antipsychotic drugs differ in their propensity to induce sedation and do so via their effects on a variety of neurotransmitter systems. It is important to note that mothers with schizophrenia risk losing custody of their infants if they are perceived as potentially neglectful because of excessive daytime sleepiness. Clinicians must choose antipsychotic medications carefully and monitor for sedative effects whenever the patient has important responsibilities that require the maintenance of vigilance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Acromegaly remains a therapeutic challenge for the endocrinologist. Among the available therapeutic options, octreotide long-acting repeatable (Sandostatin ® LAR ®, Novartis) plays a chief role, both as a primary therapy and as an adjuvant treatment after unsuccessful surgery. A plethora of papers and a meta-analysis have demonstrated its efficacy in: control of clinical picture; achievement of safe growth hormone and normal age-matched IGF-I levels (both factors associated with restoration of normal life expectancy) in 60-70% of patients; control of tumor volume (with real shrinkage in over half of cases); and halt or reversal of most acromegaly-associated comorbidities. Treatment is well tolerated in most patients and can be safely prolonged for many years if required. © 2012 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural abnormalities following timed prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) treatment in rats model changes observed in schizophrenia. In particular, MAM treatment on gestational day 17 (E17) preferentially disrupts limbic-cortical circuits, and is a promising animal model of schizophrenia. The hypersensitivity of this model to the NMDA receptor antagonist-induced hyperactivity has been proposed to mimic the increase in sensitivity observed in schizophrenia patients following PCP and Ketamine administration. However, how this increase in sensitivity in both patients and animals translates to differences in EEG oscillatory activity is unknown. In this study we have shown that MAM-E17 treated animals have an increased response to the hyperlocomotor and wake promoting effects of Ketamine, PCP, and MK801 but not to the competitive antagonist SDZ 220,581. These behavioural changes were accompanied by altered EEG responses to the NMDAR antagonists, most evident in the gamma and high frequency (HFO) ranges; altered sensitivity of these neuronal network oscillations in MAM-exposed rats is regionally selective, and reflects altered interneuronal function in this neurodevelopmental model.

AB  - Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) is increasingly used to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in children and pregnant women. The efficacy of IPT depends on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antimalarial drugs used. Healthy adult male volunteers whose occupation put them at high risk of malaria on the Northwest border of Thailand were randomized to receive a 3-day-treatment dose of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine monthly (DPm) or every 2 months (DPalt) or an identical placebo with or without fat (6.4g/dose) over a 9-month period. All volunteers were monitored weekly. One thousand adults were recruited. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was well tolerated. There were 114 episodes of malaria (49 Plasmodium falciparum, 63 P. vivax, and 2 P. ovale). The protective efficacy against all malaria at 36 weeks was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96% to 99%) in the DPm group and 86% (95% CI, 81% to 90%) in the DPalt group (for both, P < 0.0001 compared to the placebo group). As a result, the placebo group also had lower hematocrits during the study (P < 0.0001). Trough plasma piperaquine concentrations were the main determinant of efficacy; no malaria occurred in participants with a trough concentration above 31 ng/ml. Neither plasma piperaquine concentration nor efficacy was influenced by the coadministration of fat. DPm is safe to use and is effective in the prevention of malaria in adult males living in an area where P. vivax and multidrug-resistant P. falciparum malaria are endemic.

AB  - The cellular circadian clock and systemic cues drive rhythmicity in the transcriptome of adult peripheral tissues. However, the oscillating status of the circadian clocks in fetal tissues, and their response to maternal cues, are less clear. Most clock genes do not cycle in fetal livers from mice and rats, although tissue level rhythms rapidly emerge when fetal mouse liver explants are cultured in vitro. Thus, in the fetal mouse liver, the circadian clock does not oscillate at the cellular level (but is induced to oscillate in culture). To gain a comprehensive overview of the clock status in the fetal liver during late gestation, we performed microarray analyses on fetal liver tissues. In the fetal liver we did not observe circadian rhythms of clock gene expression or many other transcripts known to be rhythmically expressed in the adult liver. Nevertheless, JTK_CYCLE analysis identified some transcripts in the fetal liver that were rhythmically expressed, albeit at low amplitudes. Upon data filtering by coefficient of variation, the expression levels for transcripts related to pancreatic exocrine enzymes and zymogen secretion were found to undergo synchronized daily fluctuations at high amplitudes. These results suggest that maternal cues influence the fetal liver, despite the fact that we did not detect circadian rhythms of canonical clock gene expression in the fetal liver. These results raise important questions on the role of the circadian clock, or lack thereof, during ontogeny. © 2012 Li et al.

AB  - Arterial blood pressure is subject to a circadian rhythm that results in a fall of blood pressure during the night. In patients with diabetes, renal insufficiency, left-ventricular hypertrophy, sleep apnea, hypertension of pregnancy, and different forms of secondary hypertension a nocturnal fall of blood pressure is even abandoned or reverted. Diagnosis is made using 24-h blood pressure measurement, which is however used not frequently enough for a clinical assessment or adjustment of therapy. An adaption of the selection or the time of administration of antihypertensive drugs with respect to the circadian rhythm is beneficial to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular morbidity. This is particularly true for patients with an a non- or inverted dipping blood pressure pattern, in which the bedtime dosing may result in a normalization of blood pressure and restoration of a normal circadian rhythm. The present manuscript reviews the chronopharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension and grant practical recommendations for their translation into clinical practice. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG • Stuttgart New York.

AB  - Night work involving disruption of circadian rhythm was suggested as a possible cause of breast cancer. We examined the role of night work in a large population-based case-control study carried out in France between 2005 and 2008. Lifetime occupational history including work schedules of each night work period was elicited in 1,232 cases of breast cancer and 1,317 population controls. Thirteen percent of the cases and 11% of the controls had ever worked on night shifts (OR = 1.27 [95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.64]). Odds ratios were 1.35 [1.01-1.80] in women who worked on overnight shifts, 1.40 [1.01-1.92] in women who had worked at night for 4.5 or more years, and 1.43 [1.01-2.03] in those who worked less than three nights per week on average. The odds ratio was 1.95 [1.13-3.35] in women employed in night work for >4 years before their first full-term pregnancy, a period where mammary gland cells are incompletely differentiated and possibly more susceptible to circadian disruption effects. Our results support the hypothesis that night work plays a role in breast cancer, particularly in women who started working at night before first full-term pregnancy. Copyright © 2012 UICC.

AB  - Background: Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Objectives: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011. Selection criteria: We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using oral sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment. Main results: Sixty-one studies (37,250 participants) compared oral sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 50 mg and 100 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 50 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 6.1, 7.5, and 4.0 for pain-free at two hours and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. NNTs for sustained pain-free and sustained headache relief during the 24 hours postdose were 9.5 and 6.0, respectively. For sumatriptan 100 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 4.7, 6.8, 3.5, 6.5, and 5.2, respectively, for the same outcomes. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 50 mg dose, while sumatriptan 100 mg was significantly better than 50 mg for pain-free and headache relief at two hours, and for sustained pain-free during 24 hours. Treating early, during the mild pain phase, gave significantly better NNTs for pain-free at two hours and sustained pain-free during 24 hours than did treating established attacks with moderate or severe pain intensity. Relief of associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than with placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with the sumatriptan than with placebo, with a clear dose response relationship (25 mg to 100 mg). Sumatriptan was compared directly with a number of active treatments, including other triptans, paracetamol (acetaminophen), acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and ergotamine combinations. Authors' conclusions: Oral sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for migraine attacks, relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - Background: Infant crying and sleep problems (e.g. frequent night waking, difficulties settling to sleep) each affect up to 30% of infants and often co-exist. They are costly to manage and associated with adverse outcomes including postnatal depression symptoms, early weaning from breast milk, and later child behaviour problems. Preventing such problems could improve these adverse outcomes and reduce costs to families and the health care system. Anticipatory guidance-i.e. providing parents with information about normal infant sleep and cry patterns, ways to encourage self-settling in infants, and ways to develop feeding and settling routines before the onset of problems-could prevent such problems. This paper outlines the protocol for our study which aims to test an anticipatory guidance approach.Methods/Design: 750 families from four Local Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia have been randomised to receive the Baby Business program (intervention group) or usual care (control group) offered by health services. The Baby Business program provides parents with information about infant sleep and crying via a DVD and booklet (mailed soon after birth), telephone consultation (at infant age 6-8 weeks) and parent group session (at infant age 12 weeks). All English speaking parents of healthy newborn infants born at > 32 weeks gestation and referred by their maternal and child health nurse at their first post partum home visit (day 7-10 postpartum), are eligible. The primary outcome is parent report of infant night time sleep as a problem at four months of age and secondary outcomes include parent report of infant daytime sleep or crying as a problem, mean duration of infant sleep and crying/24 hours, parental depression symptoms, parent sleep quality and quantity and health service use. Data will be collected at two weeks (baseline), four months and six months of age. An economic evaluation using a cost-consequences approach will, from a societal perspective, compare costs and health outcomes between the intervention and control groups.Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial of a program which aims to prevent both infant sleeping and crying problems and associated postnatal depression symptoms. If effective, it could offer an important public health prevention approach to these common, distressing problems.Trial registration number: ISRCTN: ISRCTN63834603. © 2012 Cook et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Throughout gestation, the close relationship between mothers and their progeny ensures adequate development and a successful transition to postnatal life. By living inside the maternal compartment, the fetus is inevitably exposed to rhythms of the maternal internal milieu such as temperature; rhythms originated by maternal food intake and maternal melatonin, one of the few maternal hormones that cross the placenta unaltered. The fetus, immature by adult standards, is however perfectly fit to accomplish the dual functions of living in the uterine environment and developing the necessary tools to " mature" for the next step, i.e. to be a competent newborn. In the fetal physiological context, organ function differs from the same organ's function in the newborn and adult. This may also extend to the developing circadian system. The information reviewed here suggests that the fetal circadian system is organized differently from that of the adult. Moreover, the fetal circadian rhythm is not just present simply as the initial immature expression of a mechanism that has function in the postnatal animal only. We propose that the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and fetal organs are peripheral maternal circadian oscillators, entrained by different maternal signals. Conceptually, the arrangement produces internal temporal order during fetal life, inside the maternal compartment. Following birth, it will allow for postnatal integration of the scattered fetal circadian clocks into an adult-like circadian system commanded by the SCN. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Circadian rhythms impact on a wide range of physiological systems and this impact extends to fertility, such that disruptions to timing systems can impact upon reproductive capacity. This is highlighted most obviously in mutant mouse models whereby deletion or mutation of single genes results not only in disrupted circadian rhythmicity, but also compromised male and female reproductive function. In this review, we discuss the presence of circadian clocks in female and male reproductive tissues and the role these clocks play in the generation of oestrus cycles, ovulation, sperm generation, implantation and the maintenance of pregnancy. Given the increased incidence of shiftwork and international travel which disrupt circadian rhythmicity, and the increasing prevalence of reproductive technologies whereby early embryo development occurs without external time cues, it is important for us to consider the role of circadian rhythms in fertility. © 2011.

AB  - The identification of circadian clocks in endocrine tissues has added considerable depth and complexity to our understanding of their physiology. A growing body of research reveals circadian clock gene expression in the uterus of non-pregnant and pregnant rodents. This review will focus on the mammalian uterus and its rhythmicity, particularly as it pertains to the circadian timing of parturition. This key event in the reproductive axis shows dramatic species-specific differences in its circadian phase. It is proposed here that these differences in the phasing of mammalian parturition are likely a function of opposite uterine cell responses to humoral cues. The argument will be made that melatonin fulfills many of the criteria to serve as a circadian signal in the initiation of human parturition, including specific actions on uterine smooth muscle cells that are consistent with a role for this hormone in the circadian timing of parturition. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Infants born with intrauterine growth restriction are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in neonatal and later life. Although circadian rhythm is a prognostic marker of cardiovascular health, the concern over the circadian rhythm of these infants is rarely observed. To determine the influence of intrauterine growth retardation on the pattern of circadian rhythm, heart rate (HR) circadian rhythmicity was analyzed in 39 small for gestational age (SGA; birth weight and height below <2.0 standard deviation score [SDS]) and 117 appropriate for gestational age (AGA; >1.5 to <1.5 SDS) infants within 72 hours of birth using spectral analysis and cosinor analysis. Amplitude, midline estimating statistic of rhythm, and acrophase calculated from circadian rhythm were analyzed with clinical variables. A significant HR circadian rhythm was observed in 23.1% of the SGA and 24.8% of the AGA group without significant differences; however, SGA infants exhibited remarkable smaller amplitudes compared with AGA in all gestational age (GA) groups (p < 0.001). Amplitudes in AGA infants were positively correlated with the GA or body composition relevant variables (p < 0.001, respectively), but not SGA infants. The blunted HR circadian rhythmicity in SGA infants showed in this study might indicate the vulnerability to pathophysiological condition and could potentially refer to cardiovascular disease in later life.

AB  - Although light is the main factor that influences circadian rhythms, social interaction may also have a role on their regulation. Here, the influence of social interaction on rat circadian behavior was investigated, addressing the question of whether cohabitation would induce the appearance of a circadian rhythm in arrhythmic rats due to constant light. To this end, circadian rhythms of motor activity and body temperature of male and female LL-induced arrhythmic rats were studied before, during and after a 20-day period in which rats stayed in the same cage with a rat of the same sex but with stronger rhythm. Results showed that the manifestation of the circadian motor activity rhythm of LL-induced arrhythmic rats increased after cohabitation. In the case of the expression of the body temperature rhythm, there was a progressive daily increase in the power content of a daily 24 hour pattern throughout the cohabitation days, which remained when animals were again isolated. Thus, the presence of a rhythmic rat increases the strength of the circadian behavior of rats showing a weak circadian rhythm. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The cardiovascular structure is temporally organized in both health and disease. The link between obesity and hypertension is elevated sympathetic nervous system activity and hormonal activity which present a clear rhythmicity, with the pineal, corticosteroid and leptin systems being those most implicated. Also, genetic mutations or deletions have implicated peripheral clock genes in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, which are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. As hypertension and obesity are related, and the treatments of these disorders are well established but sometimes ineffective, this review focuses on chronobiological contributions to decrease the burden of hypertension and obesity in low- and middle-income groups of individuals. MEDLINE, Pubmed and SUMSearch sites (2001-2011) were used in the search strategy, together with the keywords: "antihypertensive drugs"; "arterial hypertension"; "circadian rhythms"; "obesity"; and "sleep quality". Eighty-six articles were found and 50 articles from these were selected. A link between the circadian clock and hypertension has recently been described in animal models, using Clock-mutant mice that display metabolic syndrome. Experimental evidence clearly implicates circadian rhythms in the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the blood pressure (BP) rhythm. Most clinical studies of BP focus on some pathological situation, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes or pregnancy with blood biomarker alterations. However, epidemiological evidence for the role of circadian rhythms in hypertension has been lacking until recently. In Brazil, in an epidemiological, cross-sectional study, changed sleep quality and an earlier phase of mid-sleep were found in those using antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, some pharmacological studies support a circadian- and dose-dependent relationship in the use of antihypertensive drugs for the 24-h control of BP. In low- and middle-income areas, cost-effectiveness of any intervention is fundamental to the implementation of any kind of public-health policy. Therefore, improvements in diagnosis, effectiveness and implementing prevention measures to control the risk of disease are all necessary, and there is evidence that chronobiology has an important role to play. Consequently, it is important to provide guidelines to monitor BP to reduce cardiovascular risk that include chronobiological aspects of the problem. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an endogenously produced indoleamine secreted by the pineal gland and the secretion is suppressed by light. Melatonin is a highly effective antioxidant, free radical scavenger, and has anti-inflammatory effect. Plenty of evidence supports the utility of melatonin in adults for cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging. In children and neonates, melatonin has been used widely, including for respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy and sepsis. In addition, melatonin can be used in childhood sleep and seizure disorders, and in neonates and children receiving surgery. This review article discusses the utility of melatonin in neonates and children. © 2012.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the association among nighttime sleep and daytime napping behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perception of fatigue in pregnant women. Design: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital and participants' home environments. Participants: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 ± 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep < 6 h. Nineteen women (50%) napped > 3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day. Conclusions: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is an out-of-office technique for the assessment of 24-h blood pressure measurements. ABPM is indicated to diagnosemany conditions, includingwhite-coat hypertension, resistant hypertension, episodic hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, hypotension secondary to excessive usage of antihypertensive medication, and masked hypertension. ABPM gives a better prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases when compared to office blood pressure measurements. Recently, several new indices have been introduced with the aim of predicting various clinical end-points in several patient populations. In this review, we aimed to determine the clinical utility of 24-h ABPM and its potential implications for the management of hypertension in patients with a high risk of cardiovascular mortality andmorbidity, as well as various novel indices that can predict clinical end-points in different patient populations. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

AB  - As a cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions, magnesium fulfils various intracellular physiological functions. Thus, imbalance in magnesium status - primarily hypomagnesaemia as it is seen more often than hypermagnesaemia - might result in unwanted neuromuscular, cardiac or nervous disorders. Measuring total serum magnesium is a feasible and affordable way to monitor changes in magnesium status, although it does not necessarily reflect total body magnesium content. The following review focuses on the natural occurrence of magnesium and its physiological function. The absorption and excretion of magnesium as well as hypo- and hypermagnesaemia will be addressed. © The Author 2012.

AB  - Corticotroph deficiency is a crucial element of anterior pituitary failure requiring careful management. Clinicians should always look for corticotroph deficiency in patients with pituitary disease and also consider the diagnosis in patients with unexplained fatigue, especially when associated with weight loss and/or hypotension. The diagnosis is based on the morning (8 a.m.) serum cortisol level, generally completed with a stimulation test, keeping in mind its poor sensitivity. Metopirone or insulin tolerance tests may be needed. Treatment is based on administration of hydrocortisone at the daily dose of about 20. mg, fractionated into two or three doses if possible. There are no reliable biological parameters for monitoring therapeutic efficacy. Treatment is adapted as a function of clinical criteria: fatigue, blood pressure, body weight, and skin trophicity. Therapeutic education is a key element for the prevention of acute adrenal failure, which can occur if the treatment is not correctly adapted during episodes of gastrointestinal disease or stress. © 2012.

AB  - More than a decade ago our groups pioneered the analysis of serum proteins of laboratory animals with up-to-date proteomic techniques. We were, and still are, convinced that conforming animal procedures to the minimally invasive approaches typical of clinical biochemistry focuses attention on the actual conditions under which any finding arrived at on animal models of disease may eventually be applied to human patients for screening/diagnosis. We are also convinced that, besides the proteins present in trace level as a result of tissue leakage during disorders affecting specific peripheral organs, changes in the concentration of some of the major serum proteins as part of an acute-phase response may be taken as biological end-points during a number of experimental procedures. When reviewing literature data about proteomic investigations on plasma or serum of mice, we realized that not much work has been done in the direction we favor. In addition, we noticed that sometimes information about serum proteome has been coarsely treated and in a few cases even misunderstood/misused. In the following, we present current findings on serum/plasma proteome of the laboratory mouse not only under control conditions and during an experimentally induced acute-phase reaction, but also in a number of models of disease, mainly related to cancer and to metabolic disorders. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The performance of 55 pregnant women on a battery of neuropsychological tests, tested once during the third trimester of pregnancy and once during the early postpartum period, was compared with that of 21 nonpregnant controls matched for age and education. Women in the pregnancy group had significantly lower scores than the controls during both the preand postpartum visits on tasks of verbal recall and processing speed. CORT levels were significantly associated, in an inverted-U function, with verbal recall scores at both the pregnancy and at postpartum periods and with spatial abilities at postpartum only. During pregnancy, PRL levels were associated in both a linear and an inverted-U function with scores on tests of paragraph recall and in a linear function with scores on tests of executive function. At postpartum, E2 and CORT were negatively associated in a linear fashion with attention scores. These findings provide new evidence that fluctuating hormone levels during late pregnancy and early postpartum may modulate selected cognitive abilities. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background: In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the relation between sleeping arrangements and infant cortisol reactivity to stressors in the first two post-natal months. Co-sleeping, as compared to solitary sleeping, is hypothesized to provide more parental external stress regulation by night, thus reducing general stress sensitivity. We therefore expected lower cortisol reactivity to stress in infants who co-slept more regularly. Methods: Participants were 163 mothers and infants from uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies. Mothers completed daily diaries on sleeping arrangements in the first 7 weeks of life. Co-sleeping was defined as sleeping in the parents' bedroom (i.e. own or parents' bed). Cortisol reactivity was measured twice: to a mild physical stressor (bathing session) at 5 weeks of age and to a mild pain stressor (vaccination) at 2 months of age. Results: Infants with a solitary sleeping arrangement in their first month of life showed a heightened cortisol response to the bathing session at 5 weeks compared to infants that co-slept regularly. This effect was not explained by breastfeeding practices, maternal caregiving behavior, or infants' night waking and sleep duration. No effects were found of co-sleeping on the cortisol response to the vaccination at 2 months. Conclusions: The results suggest that solitary sleeping in the first month of life is associated with heightened sensitivity of the HPA-axis to a mild stressor, possibly due to less nocturnal parental availability as external stress regulator. Whether this effect continues in later life, remains to be investigated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim To evaluate self-reported satisfaction and barriers to initiating real-time continuous glucose monitoring in early pregnancy among women with pregestational diabetes. Methods Fifty-four women with Type 1 diabetes and 14 women with Type 2 diabetes were offered continuous glucose monitoring for 6days at median 9 (range 6-14) gestational weeks and were asked to answer a semi-structured questionnaire on patient satisfaction. Results Median HbA 1c was 49 (range 34-86) mmol/mol) [6.6 (5.3-10.0) %] and duration of diabetes was 12 (0.5-37) years. Continuous glucose monitoring was used for 6 (0.5-7) days, with 43 (65%) women using continuous glucose monitoring for at least 5days. The women experienced 2.7 (0-12) alarms per 24h, of which approximately one third was technical alarms and one third disturbed their sleep. Sixteen women (24%) reported discomfort with continuous glucose monitoring during daytime and twelve (18%) during sleep. Many women reported improved diabetes understanding (52%) and would recommend continuous glucose monitoring to others (83%). Twenty-four patients (36%) had continuous glucose monitoring removed earlier than planned ( before the intended 6days of initial monitoring). Ten women (15%) did not wish to use continuous glucose monitoring again in pregnancy. Main causes behind early removal of continuous glucose monitoring were self-reported skin irritation, technical problems and continuous glucose monitoring inaccuracy. No differences were found in continuous glucose monitoring use, inconvenience or compliance with respect to diabetes type. Conclusions The majority of pregnant women with diabetes found real-time continuous glucose monitoring useful and the intervention was equally tolerated regardless of diabetes type. Nevertheless, continuous glucose monitoring was frequently removed earlier than planned, primarily because of skin irritation, technical problems and inaccuracy. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Aim: After in utero exposure to tricyclic antidepressants, neonatal withdrawal symptoms have been reported with an estimated incidence between 20 and 50%; however, few data are available for clomipramine. This could also be the case for neonatal pharmacokinetic clomipramine parameters and so this study was set up. Methods: Babies exposed to clomipramine in utero were included in an observational study, approved by the local ethics committee, after written informed consent. Withdrawal symptoms were scored at 12, 24 and 48h after birth using the Finnegan score. Plasma concentrations were determined using an in-house-developed, validated liquid chromatography with mass detection (LC-MSMS) method at 0, 12, 24 and 48h after birth. Results: We found that three of 11 pregnancies were complicated with pre-eclampsia. Ten neonates were observed for clomipramine withdrawal symptoms. The observed withdrawal symptoms were too short a period of sleep after feeding (6), poor feeding (3), mild to severe tremors (6), hyperactive Moro reflex (3) and respiratory rate &gt;60 breaths min -1. Serious withdrawal reactions, such as tachycardia and cyanosis, were seen. We calculated a half-life value of 42 ± 16h for clomipramine in neonates. Only a weak correlation was found between withdrawal reactions and clomipramine plasma concentration or desmethylclomipramine plasma concentration. Conclusions: In neonates, clomipramine is eliminated with a half-life value of 42h, compared with 20h in adults. In two of 10 neonates, tachycardia and cyanosis were seen as serious withdrawal symptoms after maternal use of clomipramine. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Study Objectives: Hypocretin (orexin) is a unique neuropeptide involved in the consolidation of wakefulness and sleep. Although hypocretin-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are stable after infancy, how levels change in preterm and term human infants is unknown. Design, Patients, and Setting: Hypocretin-1 levels were measured in CSF samples, obtained from 284 preterm (25-37 gestational weeks) and full-term infants in the first 4 months of life and 35 older children (ages 0.5-13 years), in a tertiary hospital. Measurements and Results: Detailed clinical and laboratory data were collected for each of the 319 participants. Based on that data, 108 neurologically intact children were selected (95 infants [43 preterm and 52 term] and 13 older children). CSF hypocretin-1 was measured by direct radioimmunoassay. Hypocretin-1 levels at the first weeks of the 3rd embryonic trimester (gestational age [GA] 28-34 weeks) were 314 ± 65 pg/mL (n = 17). The levels linearly increased during the third trimester and early infancy (r = 0.6), peaking in infants of 2-4 months ages (476 ± 72 pg/mL; n = 16) and decreasing thereafter; hypocretin levels in 2- to 4-month-old infants were significantly higher than those in children 0.5-13 years old (353 ± 78 pg/mL, n = 13; P = 0.0001). Conclusions: The present findings indicate that in human infants, CSF hypocretin-1 increases during the third embryonic trimester and is highest at 4 months of life. Thereafter, and consistent with previously published results, hypocretin levels are lower and stable until the geriatric age. This pattern may reflect the role of hypocretin in the dramatic process of sleep and wakefulness consolidation that occurs during early infancy.

AB  - Maternal use of certain drugs during pregnancy can result in transient neonatal signs consistent with withdrawal or acute toxicity or cause sustained signs consistent with a lasting drug effect. In addition, hospitalized infants who are treated with opioids or benzodiazepines to provide analgesia or sedation may be at risk for manifesting signs of withdrawal. This statement updates information about the clinical presentation of infants exposed to intrauterine drugs and the therapeutic options for treatment of withdrawal and is expanded to include evidence-based approaches to the management of the hospitalized infant who requires weaning from analgesics or sedatives.

AB  - Epulis is a relapsable lesion in gingiva without specific treatment for its unexplained pathogenesis. Nowadays, surgical excision is the most popular method of treatment. To prevent recurrence, it is necessary to resect diseased tissues thoroughly, and even to remove the involved teeth. However, this may cause functional and cosmetic deformities. Therefore, it is urgent to find a new therapy without severe side effects. Infantile hemangioma is a common benign pediatric tumor which shares many features with epulis, such as rich vascularity, high incidence of female patients, high hormone level and similar treatments. A recent study showed that propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonist, was effective as treatment for infantile hemangioma. Our preliminary work showed that mRNA and protein levels of β2-AR were higher in epulis than in adjacent tissue. Therefore, we hypothesize that intralesional injection of propranolol may be useful as epulis treatment. Further work need to be done to confirm the safety and therapeutic effect of the treatment. After that, this specific β2-AR antagonist may be the first choice for epulis treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A 40-year old prima para presented with multiple urticaria-like plaques and severe pruritus 2 weeks prior to giving birth by cesarean section. Three days after birth, the disease flared up and tense blisters appeared on hands, lower arms and feet. Based on the clinical presentation, direct immunofluorescence microscopy, complement binding test and detection of high levels of circulating anti-BP180 antibodies, the diagnosis of pemphigoid gestationis was established. Despite treatment with class IV topical corticosteroid and prednisolone p.o. up to 60 mg/day, both skin lesions and severe pruritus progressed accompanied by increasing anti-BP180 antibody serum levels. In order to continue breast feeding, the prednisolone dose could not be further increased and 10 immunoadsorptions over 4 weeks were performed. During this period, skin lesions cleared rapidly, pruritus subsided and BP180-specific serum autoantibodies decreased by 99.5% allowing the reduction of prednisolone to 7.5 mg/day. We conclude that immunoadsorption is an effective and safe adjuvant therapeutic option for severe pemphigoid gestationis. © 2011 Japanese Dermatological Association.

AB  - Objective: to establish the prevalence of perineal pain, the effects of pain on postnatal recovery, analgesia used to relieve pain and the perceived effectiveness of such analgesia at the Royal Women's Hospital, Victoria, Australia. Design, setting and participants: we conducted structured interviews of 215 women in the postnatal ward of a tertiary hospital, within 72 hours of a vaginal birth. Findings: the structured interviews revealed that 90% of women reported some perineal pain, with 37% reporting moderate or severe pain. The degree of perineal trauma predicted women's ratings of perineal pain on a visual analogue scale, with more severe trauma related to higher pain scores. Over a third of women experienced moderate or severe perineal pain, particularly when walking (33%) or sitting (39%), while 45% noted that pain interfered with their ability to sleep. Women reported moderate or severe perineal pain when they undertook activities involving feeding their infant (12%) or caring for their infant (12%). Women used a range of analgesia, including a combination of ice packs (69%), oral analgesia (75%), narcotic analgesia (4%) and anti-inflammatory suppositories (25%). The majority of women rated these forms of analgesia as effective and identified very few side effects. Key conclusions: following vaginal birth, women commonly reported pain from perineal trauma. This pain affected women's ability to mobilise and was relieved by a variety of agents. Side effects from analgesia were rare. Implications for practice: the prevalence of perineal pain and the associated impact on women's recovery from childbirth warrants midwives' proactive care in offering a range of effective pain relief options to women. © 2010.

AB  - Symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD or GERD) are estimated to occur in 30-50% of pregnancies, with the incidence approaching 80% in some populations. As with many other conditions in pregnancy, medical therapy with pharmaceutical agents is a concern, as the potential teratogenicity of medications is not well known. Although prevalence numbers are high, many patients have mild and infrequent symptoms, which often respond to lifestyle and dietary modifications. The exact mechanism and pathogenesis of GERD associated with pregnancy is likely multifactorial. Treatment strategies for patients not responding to conservative therapies include a step-up approach initially starting with antacids and alginates, and progressing to histamine H2 receptor antagonists followed by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy if indicated by symptoms. Although PPI therapy is the most effective treatment available for GERD, the data related to the safety for use during pregnancy and postpartum breastfeeding are mostly obtained from cohort analysis. Given the significant adverse impact of GERD on quality of life and functionality, the use of this class of medications should not be overly restricted based solely on the pregnancy. Based on the studies presented, exposure to PPI therapy during pregnancy seems to predispose the fetus to minimal risk and, overall, these medications should be discussed with the primary physician if symptomatically necessary in the pregnant patient. This evidence-based review will address the management and safety of PPI therapy during pregnancy and lactation, and briefly review the pathogenesis, clinical presentation and diagnosis of GERD in this population. © 2012 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Over the past two decades, research has identified extrasynaptic GABA A receptor populations that enable neurons to sense the low ambient GABA concentrations present in the extracellular space in order to generate a form of tonic inhibition not previously considered in studies of neuronal excitability. The importance of this tonic inhibition in regulating states of consciousness is highlighted by the fact that extrasynaptic GABA A receptors (GABA ARs) are believed to be key targets for anesthetics, sleep-promoting drugs, neurosteroids, and alcohol. The neurosteroid sensitivity of these extrasynaptic GABA ARs may explain their importance in stress-, ovarian cycle-, and pregnancy-related mood disorders. Moreover, disruptions in network dynamics associated with schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease may well involve alterations in the tonic GABA AR-mediated conductance. Extrasynaptic GABA ARs may therefore present a therapeutic target for treatment of these diseases, with the potential to enhance cognition and aid poststroke functional recovery. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Postpartum depression is the most common psychiatric complication of child-bearing. Despite the potentially deleterious effects of postpartum depression on the mother and her infant, the disorder is often unrecognized and untreated. Women may be reluctant to seek professional help because of the stigma of mental illness, or they may be unwilling to try medication because of concerns about safety during lactation. In this review of postpartum depression, we discuss its clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment. © 2012 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - Premenstrual Syndrome is described as a collection of predictable physical, cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms that occur cyclically during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve quickly at or within a few days of the onset of menstruation. Severe form of premenstrual syndrome is called Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. The typical symptoms of premenstrual syndrome normally involves the symptoms related to mood (mood swings, anxiety, and irritability) and physical conditions - like headache, fatigue, bloating, sleep disturbances, nausea, and breast tenderness. 90% of the women all over the world including Pakistan, experience these symptoms during their child bearing age. Several factors such as hormonal change, diet and lifestyle may cause premenstrual syndrome. PMS affects the daily life of menstruating women of any age; race; and part of world. A large population of Pakistani women is also a victim of PMS. Prescribed medications as oral contraceptives and antidepressants, some over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen, paracetamol and home remedies are taken as a treatment by the women in Pakistan. Hence Changing lifestyle, modifying diet, exercises, stress reduction and provision of services by health providers, such as counseling by pharmacist can optimize Quality of life and overall health of women suffering from PMS not only in Pakistan but also in the rest of the world.

AB  - Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) continuously replenish the blood with immune and blood cells with a finite life span, from the bone marrow (BM) reservoir of immature and maturing leukocytes. Regulation of HSC migration and development is essential for their function and blood cell production. These diverse and multiple states require a tight regulation to efficiently address host defense and repair requirements. Numerous recent studies disclose a central role for bone related cells in regulation of HSC and hematopoiesis. During ontogeny HSC home and seed the fetal BM in the last gestation period when the bone is already ossified. Ossification involves bone forming osteoblast- and bone degrading osteoclast activity and is considered essential for the formation of BM cavities and hematopoiesis. This synchronized association implies the need for active bone cells and bone turnover for HSC regulation. Osteoblastic cells and SDF-1+/nestin+ reticular adventitial and CAR cells are crucial for regulation of HSC lodgment, self-renewal and function. Bone resorbing osteoclasts regulate bone turnover and progenitor cell detachment and release from the BM. Sympathetic signals from the nervous system activated by circadian rhythms or stress conditions control both bone turnover and HSC migration and development. In this review we discuss pathways and mechanisms involved in this orchestrated regulatory network. A special focus is made on the pivotal role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis as a determinant of HSC fate. Inflammation, DNA damage, cytokine mobilization, microgravity and aging are discussed as specific physiologic and pathologic events entailing dysregulation of the tightly balanced Bone-Brain-Blood triad. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - The hypothesis of the evolutionary origin of bipolar disorder (EOBD) synthesized ideas about the biological clock and seasonal shifts in mood (Rosenthal, Wehr) with theorizing that bipolar disorder descends from a pyknic (compact, cold-adapted) group (Kretchmer). The hypothesis suggested that bipolar behaviors evolved in the northern temperate zone as highly derived adaptations to the selective pressures of severe climatic conditions during the Pleistocene. Given evidence of Neandertal contributions to the human genome, the hypothesis is extended (EOBD-R) to suggest Neandertal as the ancestral source for bipolar vulnerability genes (susceptibility alleles). The EOBD-R hypothesis explains and integrates existing observations: bipolar disorder has the epidemiology of an adaptation; it is correlated with a cold-adapted build, and its moods vary according to light and season. Since the hypothesis was first published, data consistent with it have continued to appear. Individuals with seasonal affective disorder, which is related to bipolar disorder, have been shown to manifest a biological signal of season change similar to that found in hibernating animals. The involvement of the circadian gene network in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder has been confirmed. Because selective pressures during the Pleistocene would have been greatest for women of reproductive age, they are expected to manifest winter depression more than males or younger females, which is the case. (This sex difference is also found in hibernating mammals.) Because it is hypothesized that the evolution of bipolar disorder took place in the northern temperate zone during the Pleistocene, it is not expected that individuals of African descent, lacking Neandertal genes, will manifest circular bipolar I disorder, and in fact, the incidence of bipolar disorder among black individuals is less than among whites. A definitive test of the hypothesis is proposed: It is predicted that the bipolar and Neandertal genomes will be more similar than the modern human and Neandertal genomes, and the modern human and San and Yoruba genomes will be more similar than the bipolar and San and Yoruba genomes. Failure to confirm these predictions will falsify the EOBD-R hypothesis. The EOBD-R hypothesis has important implications in the search for bipolar vulnerability genes and our understanding of ourselves and our Neandertal ancestor. At a practical level, confirmation of the EOBD-R hypothesis will boost interest and research in the prevention and management of bipolar symptoms by manipulation of ambient light. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - AIMS: To examine the gestation lengths and occurrence of daytime foaling of Standardbred mares foaling outdoors at stud farms in Southland, New Zealand (latitude 45°S). METHODS: Data were collected prospectively at two commercial Standardbred stud farms (Farms A and B), during the 2008/9 and 2009/10 breeding seasons (October to February). For each foaling, the identity of the mare, date and time of foaling, gender of foal, time the mare passed the fetal membranes, time the foal stood, and foaling problems including dystocias, were recorded. The effect of farm, season, gender of foal, month of artificial insemination (AI) or foaling, age and parity of mare on gestation length, percentage of mares foaling during daylight hours, and percentage of foalings recorded as dystocia, were examined. RESULTS: A total of 614 foaling records were obtained from 507 mares. For 594 foalings with complete records, mean gestation length was 349 (SE 0.5) days. Mean gestation length was shorter for fillies (347.8 (SE 0.6) days) than colts (350.3 (SE 0.6) days) p = 0.021) and decreased with month of AI, from October to February (p = 0.001). The time of foaling was bimodally distributed with the primary peak around 0200 hours and a secondary smaller peak around 1300 hours. The percentage of mares foaling in daylight was lower on Farm A (69/285 (24%)) than Farm B (128/313 (41%)) (p = 0.001). Colt foals were less likely to be born during the day than fillies (OR = 0.63; (95% CI = 0.44-0.88); p = 0.008), but there was no effect of age or parity of mare or month of foaling (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mean gestation length of mares in this study was longer than that previously reported from other countries. Longer gestation length decreases the time available for these mares to get back into foal in the same season. It is important that managers take this into account and ensure optimum conditions for conception; breeding at the first postpartum oestrus may be essential. There were more mares foaling in daylight hours on one stud than has previously been reported. Under these conditions mares should be monitored for foaling during daytime as well as at night. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The article presents the characteristics of the daily cycle "wake-sleep" in women with physiological pregnancy and the risk of interruption. Significant differences in the sleep structure in normal and abnormal pregnancy have been established. It has been detected that changes in nocturnal sleep in abnormal pregnancies were characterized by reduced quantity and increased duration of the sleep cycles, multiple segmentation of sleep phases, lots of awakenings, and increased motor activity during sleep, increased number of apnea compared to normal pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives: Previous studies generally agree that in Homo sapiens births without medical intervention occur mostly at night, although with a less accentuated pattern than in other primate species. The present study has three main objectives: (a) to establish the hourly pattern of births in a modern medicalized population, (b) to explore the association between the hour of birth and maternal and fetal variables and mode of delivery, and (c) to evaluate the risk for medical intervention at different hours of the day. Methods: The hourly distribution of 25,779 deliveries at the "La Paz" Madrid University Maternity Hospital (Spain) has been analyzed. Two different multivariate analyses have been used to evaluate, respectively, the relationships between maternal and fetal characteristics and the type of birth and hour of delivery. Results: The increasing of unnecessary hospital interventions seems to have transformed the nocturnal pattern of birth into a diurnal one and may be contributing to the rise of preterm and low birth weight deliveries, reducing their probability of being breastfeed, and eliminating or transforming emotional and social support. Immigrant women present a higher frequency of the nocturnal pattern of delivery than their Spanish counterparts. Conclusions: The predominant nocturnal pattern of birth seems to have disappeared in a Spanish highly medicalized population. However, the hallmark of primate nocturnal deliveries is evident when multiple births, malpresentation, Caesarean sections, and vaginal interventions are excluded. Possible consequences of diurnal birth include reduced infant-mother bonding, breast feeding, and later life reductions to health. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Synthetic glucocorticoids (GC) have been used to promote lung development in preterm infants, thereby decreasing respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, yet, concern has arisen from reports that such treatment predisposes individuals to disease in adulthood. Given the variety of preclinical studies that show metabolic and behavioral abnormalities in adulthood following fetal exposure to synthetic GC, we examined the effect of in utero exposure to the synthetic GC, dexamethasone (DEX), on hypothalamic expression of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) a central neuropeptide involved in mediating behavior and metabolic balance. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 0.4mg/kg DEX on gestational days 18-21. As adults (postnatal day (PD) 60), the offspring were fitted with temperature sensing transmitters allowing real-time monitoring of core body temperature (CBT) across the 24h light dark period. This revealed a significant decrease in CBT throughout the day in prenatal DEX-treated females on estrus and diestrus, but not in male offspring. The reduction in CBT by prenatal DEX exposure was accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of Trh transcript in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of female rats at PD 60 and this effect was also present on PD7. There was also a female-specific reduction in the number of preproTRH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the PVN, with ppTRH-ir nerve fibers decreases that were present in both male and female offspring. No changes in thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3; thyroxine, T4) were observed in adult offspring, but during development, both males and females (PD14) had lower T3 and T4 levels. These data indicate abnormal expression of TRH results from fetal DEX exposure during late gestation, possibly explaining the decreased CBT observed in the female offspring.

AB  - Objectives: Lower birth weight (BW) reoccurs across generations, but the intermediate mechanisms remain poorly understood. One potential pathway involves cortisol, which may be elevated in women born small and in turn could lead to fetal growth restriction in offspring. To test this possibility, we evaluated whether BW predicts hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function in the nonpregnant state in a cohort of young Filipino women, and whether differences in HPA function predict offspring BW. Methods: Multiple regression relating maternal BW, adult salivary cortisol profiles and recalled offspring BW (N = 488) among participants of the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. Results: Maternal BW related inversely to evening cortisol in adulthood (P < 0.04). Maternal BW and evening cortisol were both stronger predictors of male than of female BW (maternal BW: P < 0.0001 for males; P = 0.07 for females; bedtime cortisol: P = 0.003 for males; P = 0.3 for females). Waking and 30-min postwaking cortisol did not predict offspring BW. Controlling for evening cortisol did not diminish the relationship between maternal and offspring BW in males or females. Conclusions: Being born small predicted higher evening cortisol in adulthood among these young mothers. Lower maternal BW and elevated evening cortisol independently predicted giving birth to lower BW offspring, with effects greatest and only significant among males. We speculate that sex differences in sensitivity to maternal stress hormones could help explain the stronger relationships between BW and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors reported among the males in this and other populations. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by other psychosocial risk factors. Methods: Pregnant women (n=217) for whom we had depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed sleep was associated with PTB. Results: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI .92-1.71). No other relationships were significant. Conclusions: We report preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB. Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether sleep disturbances during pregnancy affect cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 160 pregnant women at various stages of gestation. Participants were interviewed about their sleep length per night, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), snoring habits, and symptoms of restless legs syndrome during the previous few weeks. Cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state was quantified by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) from short-term electrocardiogram monitoring. The relationship of HRV to diverse covariates was studied by multiple regression analysis. Results: No significant influences were observed of short sleep duration (< 7 hours per night), poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5), or restless legs syndrome on HRV measures. Participants with excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score > 9) and habitual snorers had a significantly elevated low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio and LF power in normalized units (LF norm). In multiple regression analyses, habitual snoring was strongly and positively associated with LF/HF ratio (P < 0.001) and LF norm (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Resting cardiac autonomic modulation was found to shift toward a sympathetic predominant state among pregnant women who are habitual snorers. © 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - The vast majority of females affected by hemochromatosis are asymptomatic during childbearing years. We were able to provide effective obstetric anesthesia care to a 35-year-old woman with severe hemochromatosis. She had systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, severe pulmonary hypertension, mitral insufficiency, a history of ventricular tachycardia, cirrhosis, obstructive sleep apnea, gestational diabetes, and severe scoliosis. A multidisciplinary approach was used to stabilize her heart failure and prepare her for childbirth. An arterial line and epidural analgesic were placed before induction of labor. Vaginal delivery was accomplished with passive decent of the fetus and forceps assistance. We discuss hemochromatosis and its implications for the parturient. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to prospectively examine the impact of chronic vs pregnancy-onset habitual snoring on gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Study Design: Third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a large, tertiary medical center from March 2007 through December 2010 and screened for the presence and duration of habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep-disordered breathing. Clinical diagnoses of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes were obtained. Results: Of 1719 pregnant women, 34% reported snoring, with 25% reporting pregnancy-onset snoring. After adjusting for confounders, pregnancy-onset, but not chronic, snoring was independently associated with gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-3.77; P <.001) and preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.37; P =.024) but not gestational diabetes. Conclusion: New-onset snoring during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In view of the significant morbidity and health care costs associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, simple screening of pregnant women may have clinical utility. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Objective: We examined the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), cesarean section (CS), low Apgar score (at 5 minutes after delivery), and preeclampsia in pregnant women with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Study Design: Our subjects included 791 women with OSA and 3955 randomly selected women without OSA. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes between women with and without OSA. Results: Compared with women without OSA, adjusted odds ratios for LBW, preterm birth, SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia in women with OSA were 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.282.40), 2.31 (95% CI, 1.773.01), 1.34 (95% CI, 1.091.66), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.482.04), and 1.60 (95% CI, 2.1611.26), respectively. Conclusion: Pregnant women with OSA are at increased risk for having LBW, preterm, and SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia, compared with pregnant women without OSA. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - This study assessed the links between maternal sleep and mothers' perceptions of their attachment relationship with their infant among women at risk for postpartum depression by virtue of having been depressed during pregnancy. Sixty-two mothers completed sleep diaries and questionnaires at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Regression analyses, controlling for depression severity and infant temperament, revealed significant prospective correlation between maternal shorter total sleep time at 3 months and lower scores on a mother-infant attachment questionnaire at 6 months. At 6 months, the longer time mothers were awake tending to their infants the lower were their attachment scores. The findings suggest that improving sleep of mothers who suffered from prenatal depression may have a positive effect on mothers' self-reported relationship with their infants. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Short sleep duration is associated with multiple adverse child outcomes. We examined associations of the built environment with infant sleep duration among 1226 participants in a pre-birth cohort. From residential addresses, we used a geographic information system to determine urbanicity, population density, and closeness to major roadways. The main outcome was mother's report of her infant's average daily sleep duration at 1 year of age. We ranked urbanicity and population density as quintiles, categorized distance to major roads into 8 categories, and used linear regression adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, fetal growth, and television viewing at 1 year. In this sample, mean (SD) sleep duration at age 1 year was 12.8 (1.6). h/day. In multivariable adjusted analyses, children living in the highest quintile of urbanicity slept -19.2. min/day (95% CI:-37.0, -1.50) less than those living in the lowest quintile. Neither population density nor closeness to major roadways was associated with infant sleep duration after multivariable adjustment. Our findings suggest that living in more urban environments may be associated with reduced infant sleep. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hypertrophy of the masticatory muscles may affect the temporalis, masseter, and pterygoid muscles in several different combinations. A case of bilateral temporalis muscle hypertrophy, with masseter and pterygoid involvement, in a 26-year-old white woman in the fourth month of gestation is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging and physical examination were used for diagnosis. Hypertrophy was considered to be of acquired nature. The patient was managed using alternative, noninvasive methods. After 2 months, visible reduction was observed. Clinical symptoms of muscle discomfort were also reported. In the presented case, we were able to use an alternative, noninvasive form of treatment, which provided our patient with an overall improvement in physical and psychologic aspects.

AB  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. Study Design: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P <.05 considered significant. Results: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P <.003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P <.003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1β were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) remains poor in the general population, despite evidence for association with adverse outcomes and improvement of certain outcomes with therapy. Data from the past decade have suggested an association between snoring and adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders. However, it is unclear how often SDB is screened for in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether, and how, symptoms of SDB are assessed during prenatal care. This study was designed as a survey-based observational study. Within 48 hours of delivery, English-speaking patients were surveyed regarding prenatal conversations with obstetric providers about symptoms of SDB. During a similar time period, obstetric providers completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding how often they discussed the same symptoms during prenatal visits. A total of 776 patients and 80 providers performing the majority of deliveries at the same hospital answered the survey. Nurse providers asked about sleep quality significantly more often than physician providers; however, responses to questions about snoring were similar in both groups. Resident physicians were the least likely to ask about sleep quality. Less than 3% of providers reported asking about snoring, closely matching patient responses. A total of 44% of patients surveyed were overweight and 21.7% were obese. Although 32% of patients snored, only 5% were asked about snoring during a prenatal visit. Obese women and women with a history of gestational hypertensive disorders were more likely to report being asked about snoring. Based on patient and obstetric provider recollections of discussions, the issue of SDB is poorly assessed during routine prenatal care, despite an increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the pregnant population. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used during pregnancy and lactation, with 1.8-2.8% exposed pregnancies. Given the risks of untreated maternal depression for both mother and child, adequate treatment is essential. If pharmacological treatment with SSRIs is indicated, the fetal and neonatal effects of SSRIs have to be considered, as SSRIs cross the placenta and are excreted into breast milk. The overall risk of major congenital malformations during SSRI exposure in the first trimester does not appear to be greatly increased. Depending on the variability in pharmacokinetic properties between the different SSRIs and the individual drug metabolism of mother and child, SSRI exposure during late pregnancy can lead to serotonin reuptake inhibitor-related symptoms in up to 30% of exposed infants postnatally. Symptoms are generally mild and self-limited, but need observation during at least 48 h as some infants develop severe symptoms needing intervention. Limited data are available about the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes after SSRI exposure during pregnancy and lactation, but currently, cognitive development seems normal, while behavioural abnormalities may be increased. In this article, the available clinical data are reviewed. Additionally, the authors provide a multidisciplinary guideline for the monitoring and management of neonates exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy and lactation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore correlations among constitution, stress, and discomfort symptoms during the first trimester of pregnancy. We adopted a descriptive and correlational research design and collected data from 261 pregnant women during their first trimester in southern Taiwan using structured questionnaires. Results showed that (1) stress was significantly and positively correlated with Yang-Xu, Yin-Xu, and Tan-Shi-Yu-Zhi constitutions, respectively; (2) Yin-Xu and Tan-Shi-Yu-Zhi constitutions had significant correlations with all symptoms of discomfort, while Yang-Xu had significant correlations with all symptoms of discomfort except for running nose; (3) Tan-Shi-Yu-Zhi constitution and stress were two indicators for fatigue; Tan-Shi-Yu-Zhi was the indicator for nausea; Yang-Xu and Yin-Xu were indicators for frequent urination. Our findings also indicate that stress level affects constitutional changes and that stress and constitutional change affect the incidence of discomfort. This research can help healthcare professionals observe these discomforts and provide individualized care for pregnant women, to nurture pregnant women into neutral-type constitution, minimize their levels of discomfort, and promote the health of the fetus and the mother.

AB  - This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2-66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6-47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000-2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006-2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - The aim of the study was to estimate the effect on the fetal development of high doses of prescription drugs taken as a suicide attempt during pregnancy. Pregnant women were identified among self-poisoned females in the toxicological inpatient clinic in Budapest between 1960 and 1993. Congenital abnormalities, intrauterine development based on birth weight and post-conceptional age, mental retardation, cognitive-behavioral status were compared in exposed children born to mothers who had attempted suicide by means of a drug overdose during pregnancy with their siblings, born either before or after the affected pregnancy, as sib controls. Of a total of 1 044 pregnant women, 74 used the combination of amobarbital, glutethimide and promethazine (Tardyl®, one of the most popular drugs for treatment of insomnia in Hungary) for suicide attempt. Of these 74 women, 27 delivered live-born babies. The mean dose of Tardyl® used for suicide attempts was 24 times the usually prescribed clinical dose. The rate of congenital abnormalities and intrauterine retardation was not higher in exposed children than in their sib controls. However, of the 27 exposed children, eight (29.6%) were mentally retarded (X2 1=79.7, p= Sig) while mental retardation did not occur among 46 sib controls. These exposed children were born to mothers who attempted suicide with Tardyl® between the 14th and 20th post-conceptional weeks. The components of Tardyl® used separately for a suicide attempt during pregnancy were not associated with a higher risk of mental retardation. Therefore the high doses of Tardyl® associated with the high risk for mental retardation may be due to the interaction of its three drug components. The findings of the study showed that the high doses of a drug containing three components may be associated with a significantly increased risk for mental retardation without any structural defects, whereas each of these three component drugs taken alone was not associated with this adverse effect.

AB  - Objective: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. Methods: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 ± 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. Results: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from -13 ± 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia-vehicle to -9 ± 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia-short infusion and -5 ± 1.6dB after ischemia-long infusion (n = 6, p &lt; 0.05). Peptide infusion was associated with reduced seizure activity after ischemia, less frequent status epilepticus (p &lt; 0.05), and earlier return of sleep state cycling (p &lt; 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion (but not ischemia-short infusion) was associated with improved survival of oligodendrocytes in intragyral and periventricular white matter (p &lt; 0.05) and increased brain weight (p &lt; 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion was associated with an intermediate estimate of surviving neurons in the parasagittal cortex of 2.9 ± 0.8 à- 10 6, in comparison to sham control (4.3 ± 0.9 à- 10 6) or ischemia-vehicle (1.5 ± 0.4 à- 10 6; p &lt; 0.05 vs sham control). Interpretation: These data support the hypothesis that opening of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray matter dysfunction and injury.

AB  - Objectives: To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories and associated predictors. Design: A prospective, follow-up study. Setting: A teaching medical center in central Taiwan. Participants: A convenience sample of 121 low-risk, childbearing women. Methods: Depressive and fatigue symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time 2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4). Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features, health status, and sleep quality. Results: The mean age of participants was 31.2 years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Overlapping but distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important for improving care during the early postpartum period. © 2012 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

AB  - Ideally interventions to improve pregnancy outcome in obese women should start in the preconceptional period. Lifestyle changes leading toward a negative energy balance (energy intake < energy expenditure) and consequently to weight loss are advisable as a first step. However, the effectiveness of these lifestyle interventions in non-pregnant adults to maintain the induced weight loss in the long term is low, even if these conventional actions are supported by pharmacotherapy. In relation to morbid obesity, bariatric surgery, also known as obesity surgery, offers a more effective treatment: It results in a substantial weight loss that is sustainable in the long term and in improvement of obesity-associated co-morbidities [1,2]. A surgical intervention is therefore increasingly being considered when conventional interventions have failed in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40kg/m² and for those with a BMI of over 35kg/m² with co-morbidities such as sleep apnea, diabetes, joint disease, and cardiopulmonary problems [3]. As obesity rates rise worldwide, so have the number of bariatric operations and in the number of practicing bariatric surgeons [4,5]. In 2008 approximately 220000 people with morbid obesity underwent bariatric surgery in the USA and Canada [6]. About 85% of all bariatric surgery patients are women of reproductive age [5]. Additionally, an increasing number of adolescents, predominantly female, are having bariatric surgery [7]. Consequently, health care providers will increasingly be confronted with pregnant women with a medical history of bariatric surgery. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first-degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.

AB  - Background and Objectives: How best to measure the occurrence of adverse events during a randomized clinical trial is an issue that has not been adequately examined in the research literature. Focus of this study was on the examination of the relative frequency of occurrence of adverse events directly recorded during the conduct of the trial compared to an indirect determination of adverse events derived from data collected as part of the trial. Methods: A secondary analysis of nonserious adverse events that occurred in the Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research (MOTHER) Study was undertaken. MOTHER was a randomized clinical trial of methadone versus buprenorphine in 175 opioid-dependent pregnant women. Results: The two methods of recording adverse events failed to agree on where differences in the frequency of occurrence of adverse events between the medication conditions might exist. Moreover, indirect assessment indicated all participants had experienced at least one adverse event, yet indirect coverage of adverse events was incomplete. Conclusions: Findings suggest indirect examination of occurrence of adverse events should be cautiously undertaken, because indirect assessment of adverse events makes no distinction between what might be simply typical variation in behavior rather than systematic changes in behavior attributable to study condition, and lacks coverage of the full spectrum of adverse events. Scientific Significance: Contemporaneous direct measurement of adverse events likely yield reasonably valid estimates of the rate of occurrence of the adverse events, while indirect measu-rement of adverse events may not be sufficiently reliable.

AB  - Objective: Accidental dura mater puncture is a potential complication during epidural block, and may be associated with multiple factors. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of accidental dural puncture in a university hospital, evaluating the differences in the number of complications during different working hours. Material and methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on all women who requested regional anaesthesia in the Epidural Analgesia Unit between 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2011, and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The technique employed to control labour pains was epidural analgesia. Results: A total of 12,480 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of accidental dura mater puncture was 0.4% (50 patients). Of these, 28% were due to medical residents. More accidental dura mater punctures were observed during September and in the afternoon shift. Conclusions: The prevalence of accidental dura mater puncture is similar to other patient series. In ours, tiredness or lack of sleep did not influence the incidence of complications in analgesia for labour pains in a 24 hour care unit. This may be due to the distribution of on-call shifts not exceeding more than 6 hours. © 2011 Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor.

AB  - Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Afar Region. Distribution of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (LLINs) has been one of the major interventions to combat malaria. However, ownership and utilization of these nets are not well known. A community based cross-sectional study was conducted using interviewer-administered questionnaires to study LLIN coverage. After systematic random sampling of the study population, data on utilization of LLINs and factors influencing this utilization were collected. Analysis of these data was done using SPSS software. Household possession of at least one LLIN in the surveyed households was found in 648(86.1%) households. Ownership of at least two nets was found among 419(55.6%) surveyed households. The proportion of children under 5 years of age who slept under treated nets during the night preceding the survey was 728(82.0%) and 676 (76.1%) in the surveyed households for reported and observed respectively. Likewise, the proportion of pregnant women who slept under treated nets was 166 (79.1%) and 147(70.0%) for reported and observed respectively. Among the potential determinants explored regarding utilization of LLINs, age, occupation, and radio possession were found to be significantly associated with LLIN utilization. Households that did not possess radio were 0.38 times (95%CI= 0.25-0.59) less likely to let their children under five and pregnant women sleep under LLIN. The LLINs coverage and utilization among the pastoralist community are promising. Strengthening of the primary health care unit and timely replacement of LLINs are critical for improved outcomes.

AB  - History and clinical examination A 20-year-old female economy student presents for presurgical evaluation of her pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. The patient suffered from her first seizures at the age of 11 years. She had simple partial seizures with hearing of voices for several seconds, followed by complex focal seizures with impaired consciousness, making grimaces, crying, and vocalization. These episodes lasted for 1–2 minutes and occured 4–8 times per month. Just one secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizure occurred during medication withdrawal for epilepsy monitoring. Pregnancy, birth, and infancy were without any remarks, no history of febrile convulsions, encephalitis, or meningitis. She suffers from sleep disturbances. No factors that provoke seizures were known. No seizures are known in the family. Neurological examination did not reveal any specific neurological deficits. She had no abnormalities of the skin, nails, or iris. Diagnostics During video-EEG monitoring, complex focal seizures could be recorded, which occurred during sleep. Initially, the patient had tachycardia, speaking of single words but no automatisms occurred. In two seizures, the patient subsequently had cloni of the left face, versive head movement to the left and asymmetric tonic limb posturing (figure of 4 sign) on the left side (Kotagel et al., 2000). Electrophysiological seizure patterns were found initially to be bilateral with subsequent evolution of leading activity of the right frontotemporal region after 10-20 seconds. © Hermann Stefan, Elinor Ben-Menachem, Patrick Chauvel and Renzo Guerrini 2012.

AB  - Background: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has markedly decreased the morbidity and mortality due to HIV disease. However, toxicities, comorbidity, pregnancy, and treatment failure, among others, would result in frequent initial HAART regimen change. Aim: The study was designed to assess the causes of initial highly active antiretroviral therapeutic regimen changes among patients on HAART. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted using a retrospective institution-based study, by reviewing the patient information sheet and physician diagnosis cards. Patient cards that showed a change in the initial treatment regimen were assessed and analyzed, to identify the common reason that resulted in a change from the initial treatment regimen. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. Results: A total of 340 patient cards were assessed. The majority of the patients (69.29%) were females. The most common first regimen, before the first switch, was stavudine / lamivudine / nevirapine (D4T/3TC/NVP) (54.70%) and stavudine / lamivudine / Efavirenz (D4T/3TC/EFV) (20.88%). The main reasons for modification were toxicity, comorbidity, pregnancy, and treatment failure. The main types of toxicities observed were peripheral neuropathy (36.52%), rash (17.83%), and anemia (17.39%). Conclusion: Toxicity was the main reason for the modification of initial HAART among the study population. Efavirenz-based regimens had the lowest hazard for change relatively, except in pregnancy-related cases.

AB  - Caffeine is widely consumed by people of all ages. In the last period a market of caffeine-containing products, particularly energy drinks and food supplements increased. Caffeine for years is under discussion, whether has positive whether adverse impact on health. Children are a group of special anxieties. Caffeine is a stimulant of central nervous system and therefore is probably the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world. The physiological effect of caffeine and the lack of nutrition value causes a great interest its impact on health, especially with reference to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Results of scientific research are not clear. The influence of caffeine on the human body is conditioned with the individual metabolism of caffeine which also depends on many endogenic and environmental factors. According to the current knowledge moderate caffeine intake by healthy adults at a dose level of 400 mg a day is not associated with adverse effects, but it also depends on other health determinants of a lifestyle. Excessive caffeine consumption can cause negative health consequences such as psychomotor agitation, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal complaints. Adverse effect of caffeine intoxication is classified in World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Metabolism of caffeine by pregnant woman is slowed down. Caffeine and its metabolites pass freely across the placenta into a fetus. For this reason pregnant women should limit caffeine intake. Children and adolescents should also limit daily caffeine consumption. It results from the influence of caffeine on the central nervous system in the period of rapid growth and the final stage of brain development, calcium balance and sleep duration. Average daily caffeine consumption in European countries ranging from 280-490 mg. The highest caffeine intake is in Scandinavian countries what results from the great consumption of the coffee. As far as caffeine consumption by Polish population is concerned there is very few data in this subject so far. In the nineties of the previous century it was 141 mg per day, whereas according to recent survey daily caffeine intake by women from the Warsaw region was 251 mg and 15% of examined women consumed an excessive quantity of caffeine (> or = 400 mg). Smokers consume more caffeine than nonsmokers, similarly to persons with mental illnesses. With reference to the caffeine consumption it should be underline that caffeine content in coffee and tea beverages varies greatly depending on the method of brewing whereas the content of caffeine in many brands of energy drinks can much vary. This should be taken into account in the daily caffeine intake.

AB  - Eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care is a national priority, and obesity is a prime target. During the last 30 y in the United States, the prevalence of obesity among children has dramatically increased, sparing no age group. Obesity in childhood is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes and with other long-term adverse outcomes, including both physical and psychosocial consequences. By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present, suggesting that disparities in childhood obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life. Several risk factors during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of offspring obesity, including excessive maternal gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, smoking during pregnancy, antenatal depression, and biological stress. During infancy and early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, infant feeding practices, sleep duration, child's diet, physical activity, and sedentary practices are associated with the development of obesity. Studies have found substantial racial/ethnic differences in many of these early life risk factors for childhood obesity. It is possible that racial/ethnic differences in early life risk factors for obesity might contribute to the high prevalence of obesity among minority preschool-age children and beyond. Understanding these differences may help inform the design of clinical and public health interventions and policies to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and eliminate disparities among racial/ethnic minority children. © 2012 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - Background. Long-term opioid use has increased substantially over the past decade for U.S. women. Women are more likely than men to have a chronic pain condition, to be treated with opioids, and may receive higher doses. Prescribing trends persist despite limited evidence to support the long-term benefit of this pain treatment approach. Purpose. To review the medical and psychological risks and consequences of long-term opioid therapy in women. Method. Scientific literature containing relevant keywords and content were reviewed. Results and Conclusions. Long-term opioid use exposes women to unique risks, including endocrinopathy, reduced fertility, neonatal risks, as well as greater risk for polypharmacy, cardiac risks, poisoning and unintentional overdose, among other risks. Risks for women appear to vary by age and psychosocial factors may be bidirectionally related to opioid use. Gaps in understanding and priorities for future research are highlighted. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.

AB  - Preface Clinical case studies have long been recognized as a useful adjunct to problem-based learning and continuing professional development. They emphasize the need for clinical reasoning, integrative thinking, problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and self-directed learning – all desirable generic skills for health care professionals. Epilepsy is amongst the most frequently encountered of neurological disorders. There are important emerging clinical management issues (e.g., first seizure, therapy-resistant seizures, ICU, pregnancy), but also differential diagnosis of non-epileptic seizures (syncopy, pseudo-seizure, paroxysmal dystonic syndromes, sleep disorders, psychosis, inborn errors of metabolism, etc.). This selection of epilepsy case studies will inform and challenge clinicians at all stages in their careers. Including both common and uncommon cases, Case Studies in Epilepsy reinforces the diagnostic skills and treatment decision-making processes necessary to treat epilepsy and other seizures confidently. Written by leading experts, the cases and discussions work through differential diagnoses, treatments, and social consequences in pediatric and adult patients. The editors collected real-life experiences from epileptologists of different countries. For this purpose, cases were selected to illustrate common and more rare conditions of patients.

AB  - In this review, we summarize the main known effects of coffee and caffeine on health based on the numerous studies performed over the last ten years. These recent studies report the beneficial properties of moderate doses of coffee (3-4 cups per day) on alertness, vigilance, and cognitive abilities. On the other hand, coffee can disturb sleep and generate anxiety. Its lifelong consumption slows down normal cognitive aging and reduces the risk of developing Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes and numerous cancers (cancers of the digestive tract, breast, endometrial and skin cancer in particular). Coffee has no negative impact on the cardiovascular system; it stimulates digestion and needs to be consumed in moderation during pregnancy. The data summarized in this review come from animal and human studies and in many cases they originate from meta-analyses published in the area of interest. This large wealth of data played a critical role in the change from the earlier prevalent negative view that coffee had negative effects on health to the present view that coffee consumed in moderation can be part of a balanced diet and may even be rather good for health. © 2007 John Libbey Eurotext.

At usual doses, it may cause impairment of cognitive and psychomotor performance, anticholinergic effects, agitation and postural hypotension. Besides, since this drug is frequently involved in either accidental or intentional overdoses, it seems relevant to bear in mind other possible toxic effects. We report a case of acute severe hyponatremia in the setting of a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), an apparent new adverse effect linked to doxylamine overdose. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship between doxylamine intake and SIAD development. SIAD may be considered as a potential, serious adverse reaction of doxylamine overdose. Clinicians should consider this aetiological possibility when attending patients suffering from hyponatremia.

AB  - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex multisystem genetic disorder characterized by hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. The main clinical features include neonatal hypotonia, distinctive facial features, overall developmental delay, and poor growth in infancy, followed by overeating with severe obesity, short stature, and hypogonadism later in development. This paper reviews recent updates regarding the genetic aspects of this disorder. Three mechanisms (paternal deletion, maternal disomy, and deficient imprinting) are recognized. Maternal disomy can arise because of 4 possible mechanisms: trisomy rescue (TR), gamete complementation (GC), monosomy rescue (MR), and postfertilization mitotic nondisjunction (Mit). Recently, TR/GC caused by nondisjunction at maternal meiosis 1 has been identified increasingly, as a result of advanced maternal childbearing age in Korea. We verified that the d3 allele increases the responsiveness of the growth hormone (GH) receptor to endogenous GH. This paper also provides an overview of endocrine dysfunctions in children with PWS, including GH deficiency, obesity, sexual development, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency, as well as the effects of GH treatment. GH treatment coupled with a strictly controlled diet during early childhood may help to reduce obesity, improve neurodevelopment, and increase muscle mass. A more active approach to correct these hormone deficiencies would benefit patients with PWS. © 2012 by The Korean Pediatric Society.

AB  - Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed on hypoglossal motor neurons (XII MNs) that innervate muscles of the tongue. Activation of XII MN nAChRs evokes depolarizing currents, which are important for regulating the size and stiffness of the upper airway. Although data show that chronic developmental nicotine exposure (DNE) blunts cholinergic neurotransmission in the XII motor nucleus, it is unclear how nAChRs are involved. Therefore, XII MN nAChR desensitization and recovery were examined in tissues from DNE or control pups using a medullary slice preparation and tight-seal whole cell patch-clamp recordings. nAChR-mediated inward currents were evoked by brief pressure pulses of nicotine or the α4β2 nAChR agonist RJR-2403. We found that, regardless of treatment, activatable nAChRs underwent desensitization, but, following DNE, nAChRs exhibited increased desensitization and delayed recovery. Similar results were produced using RJR-2403, showing that DNE influences primarily the α4β2 nAChR subtype. These results show that while some nAChRs preserve their responsiveness to acute nicotine following DNE, they more readily desensitize and recover more slowly from the desensitized state. These data provide new evidence that chronic DNE modulates XII MN nAChR function, and suggests an explanation for the association between DNE and the incidence of central and obstructive apneas. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Objective: To chart the emergence of precursors and early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective longitudinal cohort study of the surviving offspring of 14,541 pregnant women from southwestern England with an expected delivery date between April 1991 and December 1992. Method: Parents' contemporaneous reports of their infant's development (241 questionnaire responses collected up to 30 months of age) were examined in relation to the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder by age 11 years (n = 86) and a measure of autistic traits, derived by factor analysis. Results: Among the children later diagnosed with ASD, concerns about vision and hearing were more often reported in the first year, and differences in social, communication, and fine motor skills were evident from 6 months of age. Repetitive behaviors and differences in play, imitation, and feeding habits were reported in the second year. Differences in temperament emerged at 24 months of age and bowel habit by 30 months. All of these early signs were strongly associated with the presence of autistic traits in the rest of the population and these differences were often evident in the first year of development. Over the first 30 months of development, the best predictors of both later ASD and autistic traits included the Social Achievement and Communication scores from the Denver Developmental Screening Test, measures of communicative skills (Vocabulary and Combines Words) from the MacArthur Infant Communicative Development Inventories, and a repetitive behavior score. Conclusions: Precursors, early signs, and other developmental differences were reported in the first year of development among children from the general population who later developed autism spectrum disorder and subtler autistic traits. Other differences emerged and unfolded as development progressed. The findings confirm the long-held suspicion that early differences underscore the multifaceted nature of autism spectrum disorder and the broader autism phenotype, and highlight the centrality of impairments in social communication skills. © 2012 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - The microvascular bed is an anatomical entity which comprises myriads of small arterioles, capillaries and venules. Microvessels and surrounding tissue metabolism are tightly coupled; consequently they are equipped with many, very specific and fine-tuned mechanisms allowing permanent, precise regulation of nutrient delivery. The review thoroughly describes the structure and physiology of arterioles and capillaries as well as the specialized means to investigate them. Microcirculation has been largely neglected for decades, mainly because of lack of technical possibilities for visualization and quantitation. However the past years have completely renewed the scientific interest, due to the combination of the availability of new techniques in human research and the recognition that the microcirculation is autonomically and causally involved in diseases previously thought to be essentially a question of macrocirculation. Today we start to see that microangiopathy is not only a consequence of large vessel diseases but can be the source of many pathologies in both cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, the best example -developed here- being the cardiometabolic syndrome or prediabetes. With very few exceptions, pentoxifylline and the antidiabetic metformin, no specific treatments have been developed for treating disorders at the microcirculatory level. Metformin has unique, intrinsic actions specifically at the level of terminal arterioles, which are completely independent of its antidiabetic effect. Other drugs are shortly described which have revealed a potential interest in this field. Our review aims at showing that microcirculation is entering a new era, starting with rapidly increasing knowledge of its intimate functioning and worth specific pharmacological developments. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - It has been known for more than 60 years, and suspected for over 100, that alveolar hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction by means of mechanisms local to the lung. For the last 20 years, it has been clear that the essential sensor, transduction, and effector mechanisms responsible for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) reside in the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell. The main focus of this review is the cellular and molecular work performed to clarify these intrinsic mechanisms and to determine how they are facilitated and inhibited by the extrinsic influences of other cells. Because the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms is likely to shape expression of HPV in vivo, we relate results obtained in cells to HPV in more intact preparations, such as intact and isolated lungs and isolated pulmonary vessels. Finally, we evaluate evidence regarding the contribution of HPV to the physiological and pathophysiological processes involved in the transition from fetal to neonatal life, pulmonary gas exchange, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension. Although understanding of HPV has advanced significantly, major areas of ignorance and uncertainty await resolution. © 2012 by the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Based on the aversion has not played a major role in Traditional Chinese Medicine. One recently established indication for practicing acupuncture in neonates is the treatment of infantile colic. Laser acupuncture provides a non-invasive therapeutic approach, thus excluding the risk of infection caused by needle injuries. When applying laser acupuncture to premature babies and neonates, the degree of temperature increase to the skin has to be evaluated first in order to guarantee safe application. The subjects were formerly premature babies of the Division of Neonatology at Graz University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, who underwent tests in the sleep lab before being discharged from hospital. The laser needle used for acupuncture (Laserneedle©, Laserneedle EG GmbH, Germany) provides continuous laser light (wavelength 685 nm), and a performance of 10 mW per laser needle. Laser needle acupuncture was performed simultaneously on both hands at point Large Intestine (LI) 4 (= Hegu). The first stimulation lasted for 5 minutes. After an interval of 10 minutes, a second stimulation was carried out in the same way, this time lasting for 10 minutes. Before laser acupuncture application, as well as 1, 5, and 10 minutes after, respectively, thermographic pictures of both the left and right hand were taken by means of a thermal camera (Flir i5, Flir Systems Inc.©, Portland, USA). Subsequently, the warmest spot was identified and compared over the course of time. The study included 10 premature neonates (7 male/3 female). The measurings were carried out on the 33rd day of life (weight 2,030 g, gestational age 36 weeks +3 days of pregnancy). In comparison to the initial temperature (32.9 °C), after 5 minutes of stimulation (33.9 °C) (p = 0.025), and also after 10 minutes of stimulation (34.0 °C) (p = 0.01), there was a significant increase in the skin temperature. The highest skin temperature measured after stimulation amounted to 37.9 °C. However, compared to the local temperatures reached in trans-cutaneous blood gas measuring still used in the monitoring of premature babies and neonates, the warming of the skin after 5 and 10 minutes, respectively, induced by laser needle acupuncture using Laserneedle© (10 mW/685 nm), doesn't seem to carry any risks.

AB  - Objective: Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne, carries a black box warning related to the risk of depression, suicide, and psychosis. Retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A, regulates gene expression in the brain, and isotretinoin is its 13-cis isomer. Retinoids represent a group of compounds derived from vitamin A that perform a large variety of functions in many systems, in particular the central nervous system, and abnormal retinoid levels can have neurologic effects. Although infrequent, proper recognition and treatment of psychiatric side effects in acne patients is critical given the risk of death and disability. This article reviews the evidence for isotretinoin's relationships with depression and suicidality. Data Sources: The PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed searchable database indexes were searched for articles published in the English language from 1960 to June 2010 using the key words isotretinoin, retinoids, retinoic acid, depression, depressive disorders, and vitamin A. Evidence examined includes (1) case reports; (2) temporal association between onset of depression and exposure to the drug; (3) challengerechallenge cases; (4) class effect (other compounds in the same class, like vitamin A, having similar neuropsychiatric effects); (5) dose response; and (6) biologically plausible mechanisms. Study Selection: All articles in the literature related to isotretinoin, depression, and suicide were reviewed, as well as articles related to class effect, dose response, and biologic plausibility. Data Extraction: Information from individual articles in the literature was extracted, including number of episodes of depression, suicidality, suicide, psychosis, violence and aggression, past psychiatric history, time of onset in relation to isotretinoin usage, medication dosage, duration of treatment, and dechallenge and challenge history. Results: The literature reviewed is consistent with associations of isotretinoin administration with depression and with suicide in a subgroup of vulnerable individuals. Conclusions: The relationship between isotretinoin and depression may have implications for a greater understanding of the neurobiology of affective disorders. © Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Women are subject to depression during pregnancy in the childbearing age , which is associated with serious complications for the mother ,fetus , infant and the family. Its cause is not known. Recently, sleep disorder has been on the focus as causing depression This study was conducted to determine the relation between sleep disorder and depression during pregnancy. This prospective describe-analytical study was conducted on the population of women admitted hospital of Tamin Ejtemaee in city of Hamedan in west of Iran in 2010 The study sample included161 normal ( non depressed confirmed by the beck test ) pregnant woman who were selected by convenient non-probability methods. With a gestational age of 28-30 weeks , they were divided into two groups of sleep disorder and normal sleep by The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire.They were homogenized as for the confounders. On 38-40 weeks , sleep disorder was measured again and they completed the beck Questionnaire 11.4 % of women with normal sleep and 56.2 % of women with sleep disorder ( measured on the 28-30 weeks )were found depressed on 38-40 weeks and sleep disorder had increased the chances of depression by 9 times ( p < 0/001 )14.6 % of women with normal sleep and 56.9 % of women with sleep disorder ( measured on the 38-40 weeks )were found depressed and sleep disorder had increased the chances of depression by 7 times ( p < 0/001 ) our findings indicated that sleep quality at early third trimester and late third trimester in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the different features of body movements for females before and after parturition. Body movement signal was measured by a piezoelectric sensor board which was deployed on the abdominal position beneath a mattress during sleep to monitor pressure changes around abdominal area. Body movement epochs were detected by an innovative algorithm based on Hilbert transform. Data were collected from two healthy pregnant females during sleep for 7 weeks before parturition and 6 weeks after parturition. The pressure signal was used to determine the duration and time interval of maternal movements. Characteristics of the detected body movements before and after parturition were investigated through their proportion. The results showed that before and after parturition, the body movement which features as 01 min in interval and 06 sec in duration has significant difference statistically. It is considered that these differences are highly correlated with the prenatal activities. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome, primary or secondary, is one of the most common movement disorders. The most frequent causes of secondary restless legs syndrome are uremia, anemia, pregnancy, etc. A case is presented of a 77-year-old male with very pronounced restlessness in the legs at night and positive heredity for restless legs syndrome, resulting in continuous insomnia, poor quality of life and depression with suicidal impulses. Examinations ordered by a neurologist verified distinct sideropenic anemia. Upon consultation with a hematologist, substitution therapy with intravenous iron preparation was introduced along with clonazepam, which resulted in complete regression of restless legs syndrome, with significant improvement in sleep quality and thus in the patient's quality of life. Although occurring at a high incidence, this syndrome often remains unrecognized and untreated. Continuous education about the features of this syndrome, its timely recognition, appropriate work-up algorithm and therapeutic guidelines are extremely important to improve the quality of life of patients with restless legs syndrome.

AB  - Background: Rapid weight gain during the first three years of life predicts child and adult obesity, and also later cardiovascular and other morbidities. Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult, the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care. Methods/Design. This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded "Well Child" care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and support in addition to "Well Child" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life; the Sleep group which receives at least 3 extra parent contacts over the first 6 months of life with a focus on prevention of sleep problems and then active intervention if there is a sleep problem from 6 months to 2 years; or the Combination group which receives all extra contacts. The main outcome measures are conditional weight velocity (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months) and body mass index z-score at 24 months, with secondary outcomes including sleep and physical activity (parent report, accelerometry), duration of breastfeeding, timing of introduction of solids, diet quality, and measures of family function and wellbeing (parental depression, child mindedness, discipline practices, family quality of life and health care use). This study will contribute to a prospective meta-analysis of early life obesity prevention studies in Australasia. Discussion. Infancy is likely to be the most effective time to establish patterns of behaviour around food, activity and sleep that promote healthy child and adult weight. The POI.nz study will determine the extent to which sleep, food and activity interventions in infancy prevent the development of overweight. Trial Registration. Clinical Trials NCT00892983.

AB  - In humans many biochemical, physiological and behavioral processes occur in a rhythmic manner. Accumulating experimental and epidemiological evidence indicate that disturbances in biological rhythms could lead to unfavorable alterations in body function, thus exerting negative health impact. In industrialized countries, it is estimated that between 15 and 30% of the working population is involved in some kind of permanent night work and rotating shift work. Today, shift work is regarded as a significant occupational stressor which has marked negative effects on both health and well-being. This review surveys data on association between shift work and health problems, including sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, peptic ulcer, metabolic syndrome, breast cancer and undesirable pregnancy outcome.

AB  - Circadian clock controls several physiological processes such as cell proliferation. Extravillous trophoblast proliferation is a tightly regulated function playing a fundamental role in maternal vessel remodeling. We recently demonstrated that clock genes Per2 and Dec1 as well as the clock-controlled genes Dbp and Vegf are rhythmically expressed in human extravillous trophoblast-derived HTR-8/SVneo cells. Analyzing the time course of HTR-8/SVneo cell proliferation, a circadian variation in cell number was found. Moreover, we showed a rhythmic expression of mRNAs for Wee1 and stathmin, two genes involved in cell cycle progression. We suggest that circadian clockwork may orchestrate the functionality of the several factors involved in the control of human trophoblast functions that are fundamental for a successfully pregnancy outcome. © 2011 Japan Human Cell Society and Springer.

AB  - Precise measures of phenology are critical to understanding how animals organize their annual cycles and how individuals and populations respond to climate-induced changes in physical and ecological stressors. We show that patterns of core body temperature (T b) can be used to precisely determine the timing of key seasonal events including hibernation, mating and parturition, and immergence and emergence from the hibernacula in free-living arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii). Using temperature loggers that recorded T b every 20 min for up to 18 months, we monitored core T b from three females that subsequently gave birth in captivity and from 66 female and 57 male ground squirrels free-living in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range Alaska. In addition, dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed for four free-living male squirrels. Average T b in captive females decreased by 0. 5-1. 0°C during gestation and abruptly increased by 1-1. 5°C on the day of parturition. In free-living females, similar shifts in T b were observed in 78% (n = 9) of yearlings and 94% (n = 31) of adults; females without the shift are assumed not to have given birth. Three of four ground squirrels for which dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed did not exhibit obvious diurnal rhythms in T b until they first emerged onto the surface when T b patterns became diurnal. In free-living males undergoing reproductive maturation, this pre-emergence euthermic interval averaged 20. 4 days (n = 56). T b-loggers represent a cost-effective and logistically feasible method to precisely investigate the phenology of reproduction and hibernation in ground squirrels. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Studies on fetal undernutrition have generated the hypothesis that fetal programming corresponds to an attempt of the fetus to adapt to adverse conditions encountered in utero. These adaptations would be beneficial if these conditions prevail later in life, but they become detrimental in the case of normal or plentiful nutrition and favor the appearance of the metabolic syndrome. In this article, the discussion is limited to the developmental programming of obesity and cardiovascular disorders caused by an early mismatched nutrition, particularly intrauterine growth retardation followed by postnatal catch-up growth. Selected data in humans are reviewed before evoking some mechanisms revealed or suggested by experiments in rodents. A variety of physiologic mechanisms are implicated in obesity programming, 2 of which are detailed. In some, but not all observations, hyperphagia resulting namely from perturbed development of the hypothalamic circuitry devoted to appetite regulation may contribute to obesity. Another contribution may be the developmental changes in the population of fat cell precursors in adipose tissue. Even if the link between obesity and cardiovascular disease is well established, alteration of blood pressure regulation may appear independently of obesity. A loss of diurnal variation in heart rate and blood pressure in adulthood has resulted from maternal undernutrition followed by postnatal overnutrition. Further research should clarify the effect of mismatched early nutrition on the development of brain centers regulating energy intake, energy expenditure, and circadian rhythms. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - Animal studies can contribute to addressing the issue of possible greater health risk for children exposed to 50-60 Hz extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MFs), mostly in terms of teratological effects and cancer.Teratology has been extensively studied in animals exposed to ELF MFs but experiments have not established adverse developmental effects.Childhood leukaemia has been the only cancer consistently reported in epidemiological studies as associated with exposure to ELF MFs. This association has been the basis for the classification as " possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2002. Animal experiments have provided only limited support for these epidemiological findings. However, none but one study used an animal model for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the main form of childhood leukaemia, and exposures to ELF MFs were not carried out over the whole pregnancy period, when the first hit of ALL is assumed to occur.Moreover, there are no generally accepted biophysical mechanisms that could explain carcinogenic effects of low-level MFs. The radical pair mechanism and related cryptochromes (CRY) molecules have recently been identified in birds and other non-mammalian species, as a sensor of the geomagnetic field, involved in navigation. The hypothesis has to be tested in mammalian models. CRY, which is part of the molecular circadian clock machinery, is a ubiquitous protein likely to be involved in cancer cell growth and DNA repair.In summary, we now have some clues to test for a better characterization of the interaction between ALL and ELF MFs exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bromocriptine mesylate, a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid derivative, is a new tool in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacological activity of bromocriptine occurs mainly through activation of D2 receptors and inhibition of D1 receptors in the CNS. Rapid-release formulation of bromocriptine is used to provide morning dopamine agonism, mimicking the circadian dopamine activity in central nervous system observed in non-diabetic subjects. Bromocriptine possess several properties that are beneficial to diabetic patients. The drug not only improves glucose metabolism, but also diminishes the risk of the occurrence of serious cardiovascular complications. It was the first antidiabetic drug approved under the FDA's guidelines requiring clinical trials to demonstrate cardiovascular safety. Additionally, rapid release bromocriptine demonstrates good safety and tolerability profile, and in most instances, the observed adverse events are not serious and resolve spontaneously over time. Bromocriptine is a promising agent, however its role in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus is still to be established. Copyright © 2011 Via Medica.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a group of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or abnormal gas exchange during sleep. The most common type of SDB, especially among young obese women, is obstructive sleep apnea. SDB has clearly been linked to poor sleep and impaired daytime function, but there are also data linking SDB to other health outcomes, principally cardiovascular and metabolic disease. SDB symptoms are common in pregnancy, and pregnancy itself has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of SDB symptoms. Although a link between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be biologically plausible, data exploring this relationship are only now emerging, and large prospective studies in which the authors use objective measures of sleep are lacking. Until we know more about the epidemiology and the impact of SDB in pregnancy, screening efforts for SDB in pregnancy should be focused on identifying very symptomatic patients because treatment of these individuals often leads to improved sleep quality and daytime functioning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To improve control measures against malaria, Tanzania has increased the distribution of free and subsidized insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. However, data on knowledge, attitudes and practices of these women regarding malaria are scarce. This study was carried out to describe knowledge, attitudes and practices towards malaria, mosquito net ownership and use among women seeking antenatal care at Iringa Regional Hospital in south-western Tanzania. The study involved women attending the antenatal clinic of the hospital. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was applied to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, mosquito net ownership and use, as well as knowledge, attitudes and practices about malaria and its control. Among the 222 pregnant women included, 173 (78%, 95%CI, 72-84.2) owned a mosquito net, and 150 (68%, 95%CI, 61-75) reported to sleep always under a mosquito net. The use of mosquito nets was mentioned by 142 (64%, 95%CI, 56.2-72). Of the 46 women who did not own a mosquito net, seven (15.2%) reported cost as the main obstacle for owning one. About 53% (95%CI, 44-62) preferred to use mosquito nets they bought rather than the one provided for free. Several factors such as gravidity, fearing of getting malaria, knowledge on the cause, marital status, and ways used to prevent malaria were significantly associated with mosquito net ownership (all P<0.001). Education level and gravidity were associated with the behaviour to sleep always under mosquito nets (P<0.002). Multigravidae (2-4 pregnancies) (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-4.8) and married women (OR, 1.9, 95%CI, 1.2-5.2) were more likely to own a net, as compared to primigravidae and single women. In conclusion, reported ITNs ownership and use among pregnant women was good and they preferred to use the nets they bought themselves.

AB  - Sleep is defined as a reversible state of reduced responsiveness to environmental stimuli. It roughly occupies one third of a human life. The science of sleep has greatly evolved over the past century. From a state of passive inactivity, sleep has come to be regarded as a complex physiologic state, with characteristic brain activity. The neurobiology of sleep is complex. Transection studies have led to the description of the ascending reticular activating system as responsible for the awake state, with the main neurotransmitters involved being acetylcholine, norepinephrine, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine, histamine and orexin. Similarly, specific brain regions have been involved in the active generation of sleep. Non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is generated in the basal forebrain and anterior hypothalamus, containing the neurotransmitters gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and galanin. These areas send inhibitory signaling to the excitatory regions of the brain. Rapid eye movement sleep (REM) is generated in the caudal pons and rostral mesencephalon area. It consists of several features, divided into tonic and phasic phases. Each of these is produced by a specific group of neurons. Acetylcholine is one of the major neurotransmitters in REM sleep. Sleep has been described in the developing human fetus as early as 28 weeks of gestation. At birth, the human infant sleeps up to 16-18 hours a day and spends half of that time in REM sleep. This high fraction of sleep in the human infant has led to the hypothesis that REM is important in brain maturation.

AB  - Sleep patterns in women present different characteristics than in men. Menstrual cycle, puberty, menopause, and hormonal, emotional, and body heat changes emerging in pregnancy affect the sleep. Dynamic and physiologic changes affecting the functions of many organs and systems occur in pregnancy. Mechanical and hormonal changes occurring in pregnancy affect regular sleep routine, sleep duration, and pattern. Besides sleep duration, sleep pattern also presents changes in pregnancy. The factors causing this change can be discussed in two groups, hormonal and mechanical factors. Estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol levels changing in pregnancy are the major hormonal factors affecting the sleep. Estrogen and progesterone progressively increase in pregnancy. Estrogen has been reported to decrease rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and progesterone to increase non-REM sleep. Other sleep disorders that have been reported to occur and in some cases were triggered or worsened by pregnancy are periodic leg movements (PLM), leg cramps, restless legs syndrome (RLS), sleepwalking, night terror, and narcolepsy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Overweight (BMI > 25) and obesity (BMI > 30), in our modern world of food abundance has become epidemic and is associated with a whole range of health problems like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and an excess of cardiovascular and renal diseases. We will describe intra-uterine growth retardation due to maternal undernutrition, life-style and genetic susceptibility as causes for insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. The 'fetal' or 'early' origins of adult disease hypothesis provided evidence for the association between the perturbation of the early nutritional environment and the major risk factors (hypertension, insulin resistance , and obesity) for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome in adult life. In this review we give some epidemiological examples from the "Dutch Hunger Winter" a war induced famine between August 1944 and April 1946 in Amsterdam with less than 1,000 calories per day from government food rations. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that exposure to famine during gestation resulted in increases in impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, coronary heart diseases, atherogenic lipid profile, hypertension, microalbuminuria, schizophrenia, antisocial personality and affective disorders. Maternal undernutrition during gestation has important effects on health in later life, but it is hypothesized that the timing of the nutritional insult determines which organ system is affected. Maternal undernutrition can express itself in the second or third generation. Obesity due to diet and a sedentary lifestyle may result in excess adipose tissue which actively participates in the integration of whole-body energy and fuel metabolism by the secretion of many hormones like leptin, adiponectin and resistin. Life style features like a) disturbance in the autonomous nervous system (biological clock), b) gender, c) socioeconomic status, d) race and e) stress all may be contributing factors in the origin of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Genetic factors influence the different components of the Metabolic Syndrome. Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disorder. The "thrifty gene theory" states that it can be inherited from our ancestors living in an environment with unstable food supplies and famine. For them it could increase their probability of survival if they could maximize their storage of food surpluses. With the term "thrifty genes" one can think about underlying hormonal pathways and metabolic routes like growth hormone and insulin. Inflammation, a second characteristic of insulin resistance, can be caused by Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a transcription factor involved in regulating genes in adipogenesis and, by implication, insulin action. Diet, exercise and preventing stress are the first-line strategies in the management of type 2 diabetes. Exciting results for medical glycaemic control are found in (thiazolidinediones (TZD eg. Pioglitazone). They are agonist for the PPARγ and also have an effect on the recently discovered hormone resistin which probably can link obesity to diabetes-2. However, recently a meta-analysis study and two clinical trials gave for thiazolidinedione-therapy with Rosiglitazone (Avandia) strongly evidence for increased cardiovascular risk and possible cardiotoxicity. Unless no new data are available of ungoing trials it is recommended to chose for other therapies to treat type 2 diabetes. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up during July and August 2004. Results: The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women. In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company, compared to those in the first and second trimesters. Conclusion: The lifestyle factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible system is needed for working women that adapts to the physical changes that occur during pregnancy. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the "de novo mutation" hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP. Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort. Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99-1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA. Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the "de novo mutation" hypothesis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sleep takes up one third of the human life and has always been a subject of fascination for human beings. In the past century, significant progress has been made in the study of sleep. Sleep is defined as a reversible state of decreased responsiveness to the environment. It has been historically thought to be a passive state of inactivity; however, electrical recordings of brain waves have shown that the brain remains very active during sleep, but that this activity is distinctively different from the wake state. Sleep is divided into two main states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The latter is thought to be the state where the most vivid dreams occur. Different brain regions and groups of neurons in the brain are responsible for the generation of each of these two states. Human fetuses have been shown to display sleep brain waves as early as 28 weeks of gestation. The question of "why do we sleep?" has been occupying scientists for some time and a clear answer has yet to be accepted by all. Many hypotheses exist. The evolutionary adaptation hypothesis claims that sleep evolved to protect the organism by making it quiescent during times where activity would be dangerous (exposure to predators or injury), while also saving energy during those times. More recent evidence suggests that, during sleep, the brain regenerates energy that has been depleted by wakefulness. Other studies also suggest that sleep enhances learning and memory formation.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Energy costs of pregnancy approximate 320 MJ in well-nourished women, but whether or not these costs may be partly covered by modifications in activity behavior is incompletely known. In healthy Swedish women: (1) to evaluate the potential of the Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity (IDEEA) to assess energy expenditure during free-living conditions, (2) to assess activity pattern, walking pace and energy metabolism in pregnant women and non-pregnant controls, and (3) to assess the effect on energy expenditure caused by changes in physical activity induced by pregnancy. Subjects/Methods: Activity pattern was assessed using the IDEEA in 18 women in gestational week 32 and in 21 non-pregnant women. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) was assessed using IDEEA, as well as using the doubly labelled water method and indirect calorimetry. Results: AEE using the IDEEA was correlated with reference estimates in both groups (r=0.4-0.5; P<0.05). Reference AEE was 0.9 MJ/24 h lower in pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Pregnant women spent 92 min/24 h more on sitting, lying, reclining and sleeping (P=0.020), 73 min/24 h less on standing (P=0.037) and 21 min/24 h less on walking and using stairs (P=0.049), and walked at a slower pace (1.1±0.1 m/s versus 1.2±0.1 m/s; P=0.014) than did non-pregnant controls. The selection of less demanding activities and slower walking pace decreased energy costs by 720 kJ/24 h and 80 kJ/24 h, respectively.Conclusion:Healthy moderately active Swedish women compensated for the increased energy costs of pregnancy by 0.9 MJ/24 h. The compensation was mainly achieved by selecting less demanding activities. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the characteristics of respiratory events in preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea at or beyond 35 weeks postmenstrual age and to compare these findings with a group of preterm infants ready for discharge, without clinically concerning apnoea. Methods: Infants born at <32 weeks of gestation and who underwent nap polysomnography at or beyond 35 weeks corrected age prior to discharge were included. Cases were preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea, and control infants were preterm infants asymptomatic for apnoea. Infants with upper airway obstruction, congenital malformations or apnoea associated with sepsis were excluded. Studies were retrospectively reviewed for length, type and frequency of apnoea. The relationship between sleep state and changes in oxygen saturation was compared between groups. Peri-natal and demographic data were also compared. Results: Data were complete for 16 case and 18 control infants. Gestational age was similar at birth and at time of study, but cases had a lower birth weight (p=0.04) and higher weight at study (p=0.04). There were no group differences in the mean duration, type or numbers of apnoea. The duration of the longest apnoea was greater in case infants (17.4 s vs. 12.3 s, p=0.02). Lowest oxygen saturation (p<0.05) and average minimum oxygen saturation (p<0.05) were lower in case infants. Conclusions: Preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea have similar amounts and types of apnoea but lower oxygen saturation after apnoea compared with controls. The use of oxygen saturation monitoring is more useful than respiratory monitoring alone in recognising these events. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause several cognitive and behavioral difficulties. Few studies have investigated the associations with infant temperament or sleeping patterns. Our aim was to study potential associations between early prenatal binge exposure and infant temperament and sleeping pattern. Methods: In a population based longitudinal study, representative of pregnant women in Oslo, questionnaires were answered at 17 and 30. weeks of pregnancy and 6. months after term. Two factors, difficult temperament and sleeping problems, were identified using Principal Component Analysis and dichotomized at the least optimal 14-15%. Logistic regression analyses identified predictive factors. Results: Maternal binge drinking (≥. 5 drinks per occasion) once a week during pregnancy week 0-6 significantly predicted both difficult temperament (Odds Ratio OR 3.3**; 95% Confidence interval CI 1.4-7.9) and sleeping problems (OR 5.3**; 95% CI 2.1-13.7) in the infant, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Including binge drinking more often than once a week, further increased the OR of sleeping problems (6.0***; 2.7-13.7). Prenatal maternal depressive symptoms also predicted both outcomes. Reduced birth weight predicted difficult temperament. Maternal satisfaction with life reduced the probability of sleeping problems. Maternal smoking, and work stress, during pregnancy had no predictive power. The results were not explained by binge drinking later during pregnancy or higher consumption per occasion. Conclusions: Binge drinking once a week during pregnancy week 0-6 had stronger predictive power of difficult temperament and sleeping problems during infancy, than other covariates. The findings support advising women to avoid binge drinking when planning pregnancy. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The most common causes are endocrine - particularly primary aldosteronism, renal (renal parenchymal and renovascular) hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension in pregnancy. Patients with secondary hypertension often have very high blood pressure. With regard to the possibility of permanent cure / improved control of hypertension is appropriate for patient with suspected secondary form of hypertension to be examined in a specialized center.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of maternal changes during pregnancy in diet, exercise, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight parameters at birth and 6 months. In overweight/obese (OW/OB; n = 132) mothers, greater % kcal from sweets early in pregnancy was the strongest, independent predictor of higher weight for age (WFA) (beta = 0. 19; P = 0. 004), higher odds of macrosomia (OR = 1.1 (1.01.2); P = 0. 004) andWFA 90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.11.3); P = 0. 002) and higher WFA at 6 months (beta = 0. 30; P = 0. 002). In normal weight (n = 153) mothers, higher intake of soft drinks was the strongest predictor of higher offspring WFA at birth (beta = 0.16; P = 0. 04) but not at 6 months. Prenatal physical activity, depressive symptoms, and sleep-related variables did not significantly predict offspring weight outcomes. Mothers eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in OW/OB mothers, may have a lasting effect on child weight. Copyright © 2011 Suzanne Phelan et al.

AB  - Perinatal depression is an increasingly common comorbidity of pregnancy and is associated with adverse birth outcomes. Newer classes of antidepressants have been developed with a variety of mechanisms and improved side effect profiles. There is increasing use of these medications in reproductive-aged women. Medical providers have to balance the need to prevent relapse of maternal depressive symptoms with the need to minimize fetal exposure to medications. We review the literature on 10 of the most commonly used antidepressant medications: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, duloxetine, bupropion, and mirtazapine. The pharmacokinetic properties of the medications are detailed, as well as practical considerations for their use in pregnant and lactating women. Guidance on counseling and management of pregnancies complicated by perinatal depression is discussed. TARGET AUDIENCE:: Obstetricians & Gynecologists and Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES:: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to differentiate the current classes of medications utilized commonly for perinatal depression, evaluate the reported adverse effects of antidepressant medications on the patient and developing fetus and choose the appropriate antidepressant medications for a depressed patient who is breast-feeding.

There were 20,8% patients with idiopathic epilepsy, 33,3% with symptomatic epilepsy and 45,8% with cryptogenic epilepsy. The analysis of provoking factors was conducted in the groups of patients stratified by the number of relapses. The following factors were considered: iatrogenia, disturbances of routine (sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption, stress etc), lack of compliance, changes in the treatment regime, delivery in women, puberty, cranial-brain trauma. The data of their frequency in each group are presented.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to use objective methods to assess the association between maternal smoking and body composition in offspring. Methods: A total of 2508 grade 4 school children were enrolled; all underwent lifestyle disease and passive smoking screening. Children were classified into four groups according to their urinary cotinine level and maternal smoking status during or before pregnancy. Items measured on lifestyle disease screening were compared among the four groups. Results: Only degree of obesity (DO) and body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy. The prevalence of both DO >20% and DO >30%, and BMI >22% and BMI >25% was highest in children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy. These children had a tendency toward shorter height and increased weight although it was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between maternal smoking status and lipid profile among groups. Confounders such as food, exercise and sleep were able to be eliminated Conclusion: Maternal smoking during pregnancy may be an independent risk factor of changing body composition in offspring, that is, shorter height and increased weight. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Auditory perception and learning take place during the third trimester of gestation. Fetuses and newborns who lack typical auditory experience can go on to develop typical socioemotional attachment and language, given a supportive environment. For hospitalized preterm infants in developmentally sensitive neonatal intensive care units, detrimental effects of deviant early auditory experience may be remediated by later experience, but much is unknown about the causes of language deficits of prematurity. Prenatal auditory stimulation programs that incorporate audio speakers against the maternal belly should be discouraged because of possible overstimulation effects on the developing auditory system and sleep/wake state organization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Childhood obesity is a profoundly complex problem and serves as an example of a biospsychosocial issue. Scientific inquiry has provided incredible insight into the complex etiology of weight gain but must be viewed as an interaction between a human's propensity to conserve calories for survival in a world with an abundance of it.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease remains the primary cause of death worldwide. In the US, deaths due to cardiovascular disease for women exceed those of men. While cultural and psychosocial factors such as education, economic status, marital status and access to healthcare contribute to sex differences in adverse outcomes, physiological and molecular bases of differences between women and men that contribute to development of cardiovascular disease and response to therapy remain underexplored. Methods: This article describes concepts, methods and procedures to assist in the design of animal and tissue/cell based studies of sex differences in cardiovascular structure, function and models of disease. Results: To address knowledge gaps, study designs must incorporate appropriate experimental material including species/strain characteristics, sex and hormonal status. Determining whether a sex difference exists in a trait must take into account the reproductive status and history of the animal including those used for tissue (cell) harvest, such as the presence of gonadal steroids at the time of testing, during development or number of pregnancies. When selecting the type of experimental animal, additional consideration should be given to diet requirements (soy or plant based influencing consumption of phytoestrogen), lifespan, frequency of estrous cycle in females, and ability to investigate developmental or environmental components of disease modulation. Stress imposed by disruption of sleep/wake cycles, patterns of social interaction (or degree of social isolation), or handling may influence adrenal hormones that interact with pathways activated by the sex steroid hormones. Care must be given to selection of hormonal treatment and route of administration. Conclusions: Accounting for sex in the design and interpretation of studies including pharmacological effects of drugs is essential to increase the foundation of basic knowledge upon which to build translational approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat cardiovascular diseases in humans. © 2011 Miller et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The prehistoric art discovered in Eurasian caves, created from 37,000 to 12,000 years ago, has fascinated and perplexed historians and scientists. These caves were uninhabited, devoted to art, the first art galleries. A psychoanalytic interpretation of these extraordinary works, this paper addresses the motives of the Paleolithic artists, the meanings of their art, and the relationship of the art and the artists to the cave. While nonanalytic formulations are considered, from a psychoanalytic perspective, the interpretation of the cave is symbolic of the womb, the birth canal, and the primal cavity of self-object relationship. Art was created in identification with pregnancy and birth; art endured as reassurance against permanent darkness and death. Entering and leaving the cave could also represent coitus but, a on a deeper level, attachment and separation. The cave had magical and developmental significance, a transitional space between internal and external, fantasy and reality, death and rebirth. The creation of art and music, and the invention of intentional, controlled fire, marked the arrival of Homo sapiens, differentiated from all preceding and parallel primates. The painted cave might also have represented a cephalic container with illuminated imagery suggestive of dreaming sleep. © 2011 The International Federation of Psychoanalytic Societies.

AB  - We describe four children with an apparently unique form of easily treatable early onset epilepsy. All had an unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery. One child presented with neonatal seizures. None of them had neonatal jaundice. They presented with developmental impairment, cortical visual agnosia or squint, and clusters of epileptic spasms [3] beginning in infancy. Electroencephalogram showed features of modified (atypical) hypsarrhythmia. Neuroimaging in infancy showed unilateral or bilateral signal changes in the globus pallidus. All infants were treated with high dose vigabatrin (VGB). The seizure disorder responded well to treatment and VGB was discontinued. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging brain scan showed complete resolution of the signal changes in the globus pallidi. All remained seizure free but continued to show severe intellectual disability. We suggest that VGB treatment was associated with "reversible" signal changes in the globus pallidi in these children. © 2011-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Obesity can impact on reproductive functions by causing hormonal imbalance and ovulatory dysfunction. Furthermore, obesity is associated with a range of adverse health consequences. There is a tight coupling between the reproductive system and energy balance. Obesity results from chronic imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, and therefore changes in energy expenditure impact on the reproductive system. Physical activity, through its effect on energy expenditure, plays an imperative role in maintaining energy balance and thus improving health. It is therefore recommended that weight loss is the best and the cheapest therapy for infertile obese women.

AB  - Jedidiah was born at 26 weeks' gestation. His teenage mother and grandmother were full of hope. Now, after several complications, his prognosis has changed dramatically and the goals of care must be revisited. Marisol has lived with cancer for 3 of her 9 years and she has had three relapses. Still, she is at a major research center. Her family is told that the "only thing left to do is a phase 1 trial." David has managed cystic fibrosis for 18 years. He is short of breath, unable to sleep, and afraid of dying. His team encourages him, "Keep your chin up, Buddy, you are at the top of the transplant list!" Hakim has lived with mucopolysaccharidosis for 16 years. The illness spared his brain, but made him a "progressive cardiorespiratory cripple." He and his family now face the choice of whether to use mechanical ventilation full-time. Hakim is tired and willing to accept a trade for maximal comfort in the face of a possibly foreshortened life span. However, his parents will not acknowledge that Hakim has an opinion about the goals of care. Good communication is the foundation of trusting relationships among the patient, family, and health care provider. Under ideal circumstances, there is free exchange of information and room for emotions that can be difficult to discuss, such as fears and anxieties on the part of the patient and family or disclosure of a terminal diagnosis on the part of the clinician. Effective, empathic communication is particularly critical in the setting of a child's potentially life-threatening or terminal condition, when the stakes are high and the potential for long-lasting harm is great. Facilitating mutual trust within the clinical relationship is the essential cornerstone of palliative care and has been shown to be the anchor allowing families to maintain hope, regardless of the child's ultimate outcome (Mack et al., 2007). Communication in the pediatric setting has unique challenges, including the need to assess the child's developing and ever-changing desire and capacity to learn clinically important information. This chapter provides practical information and tools to assist patients, families, and health care providers in communicating in a manner that facilitates the development of trust, conveyance of compassion, and conduct of ethical decision making. This chapter illustrates the need to • understand and consider the elements of communication; • recognize the impact of the role of the person within the family dynamic, the trajectory of illness, and cultural, societal, and legal issues on the conduct of communication in pediatric palliative care; • be deliberate in teaching the skill of communication to facilitate excellence in the delivery of pediatric palliative care, using "breaking bad news" as an exemplar; • understand the importance of effective communication with all family members, including the patient and extended family; • have respectful communication within the care team. © 2011 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.

AB  - In this chapter we discuss the following key points: • Children who have diagnoses of genetic diseases have variable life spans, from hours to years. • Children who have these conditions, as well as their families, will benefit from concurrent life-sustaining, supportive, and palliative care initiated from the point of diagnosis forward. She is just part of what makes us a family. She is so much more than what we thought she could ever be, based on what we know about leukodystrophy. . . . Within the first 2 weeks after Katy was born, we knew things were not right. She did not startle at loud noises-ever. We called our pediatrician's office, and they told us not to worry because it was too early to jump to any conclusions. We attempted to startle her ourselves. I think we did this more out of a need to prove to ourselves that nothing was the matter. We decided that the problem had to be related to her hearing. We began trying to get her pediatrician to send her to an audiologist. We were told at this point, after several visits to the doctor, that she was a big baby and sometimes they developed more slowly and we shouldn't worry yet. We noticed that Katy did not move around as much as she did when she was born and she seemed to be sleeping an awful lot. Finally, at about 6 months, the pediatrician decided that Katy might have a hearing problem. An audiologist tested Katy and said that there was no problem with her hearing. We went back to the pediatrician when Katy was 7 months old. When they measured her head, the circumference was offthe growth chart. They sent us to a neurologist at the children's clinic. An MRI was done and diagnosed Katy with leukodystrophy. Our lives were like a story out of Reader's Digest. It was like being in a dream. I was watching my life unfold, but it didn't seem real to me at this point. We cried a lot. We prayed a lot. Coordinating regular checkups, sick patient visits, and therapies can be a logistical nightmare for a child with a rare condition. Emergency room visits are the worst. We try to avoid them at all costs because Katy has been subjected to unnecessary invasive testing in the ER when an attending refused to contact her primary physician at our request. We have since learned not to be so passive. Katy can spike a fever and in 3 hours it will be gone, leaving us wondering what is going on with her. On the other hand, a cold can develop into pneumonia overnight. We tend to overlook the obvious. When Katy was 3 years old, she was very ill. She kept spiking fevers and just could not seem to get better. She was admitted to the hospital because she was dehydrated and running a fever. On about the second day, they decided she had some sort of lung virus she had caught in the hospital. She was given breathing treatments several times a day. After about the fourth day, I knew she was not getting any better. I told Katy's pediatrician I thought I could take her home and give her breathing treatments myself. They sent me home with a nebulizer. I watched her at home and, as long as I gave her Tylenol and Motrin every 4 hours, she could sleep some, but she was not well. I called her geneticist and told him that Katy was not getting better and that she was going to end up in the ER again if we didn't do something. He told me to bring her in, so I did, and he looked in her ears and discovered a raging ear infection. What happened here is that everyone got so caught up in Katy's labored breathing (which is normal for her) that they forgot that she might just have a typical childhood illness that could be easily treated. We did not think she would be able to respond much to the environment around her. We thought she would be homebound and unable to go on family outings. We have learned from her to take one day at a time. We have had way many more good days than bad days, and God has given us the grace and mercy necessary to make it through every single one of them. Some of our distant family members can only look at Katy and our family and pity her and pity us. They have no concept of what life with her is like. They think we just sit around and cry or stay depressed all the time. They cannot see how Katy could be anything but a burden. We feel sorry for them, because they have missed it. We are not actively pursuing another pregnancy. In fact, we are using preventative measures to keep from becoming pregnant again. However, birth control is not foolproof, and if we become pregnant again, we would not abort that child even if we knew he or she had leukodystrophy. Children are a gift from God, and each life is important and valuable. I cannot imagine my life without Katy. She has become such an important part of our family and has been the catalyst that has caused each of us to become a better person. We don't take many things for granted. We have become aggressive when it comes to choosing what is right for Katy. We have become more adaptable. We just look at the day and what we have to do and get creative in how we might accomplish what needs to be done. We have learned what is really important and have thus adjusted our priorities. Katy is our second born. She is lovely and fun. She gives pleasure to our family and brings much joy to us. Katy's parents have survived earth-shattering news that their second-born daughter has Canavan leukodystrophy, a rare inherited disorder in which spongy degeneration of the central nervous system leads to progressive mental deterioration. She has increased muscle tone, poor head control, megalocephaly, and blindness. Her parents and sister have ridden the roller coaster of her degenerative illness with its inexorable decline in abilities. In spite of, or because of, her condition, her family is different and, in her parents' estimation, stronger and better. They clearly display many of the strategies Bluebond-Langner (1996) documented that parents adopt over the course of the illness: • They have routinized treatment-related tasks, including gastrostomy feedings, nebulizer treatments, and trips to the doctor. • They have redefined what is "normal" for their family. • They have reassessed their priorities in life. • They have reconceptualized the future. They unconditionally love their daughter and revel in the irreplaceable child she is. Children with life-threatening genetic conditions, as well as their families, present distinctive challenges to the palliative care team. Frequently, these children have rare conditions that are unfamiliar to the family and health care providers. How do these families cope with caring for a child who has a rare condition? What approach should clinicians take when working with such a family? For many of these conditions, there is no cure; palliative care is the only option. Inherited conditions may lead to families dealing with overwhelming issues of guilt. Considerations of future childbearing may generate intense angst. How can the health care professional support the family in dealing with parental guilt for "passing down" an incurable genetic condition to present and perhaps future children? Parents and other family members deal with profound existential questions and may question why their God would allow an innocent baby to die before being born or why their God would permit a child to be born with a condition for which there is no cure. The diagnosis of a life-threatening genetic condition may be made "out of the blue" with an amniocentesis, ultrasound, or birth of an affected baby. On the other hand, some children possess genetic conditions that will be diagnosed long after the parents first suspect that there is a problem, and some conditions will not be diagnosed until a second child is born with the same disorder. What methods are effective in assisting families to cope with the uncertainties of the child's condition, treatment, and future? Because pal liative care is the only option for some children, parents may turn to unproven therapies, such as special vitamin mixtures. Given the rarity of many of these conditions, families may seek out information and support from the Internet. How can families' Internet searches be guided to provide good-quality results? Walking side by side with these families as they navigate the cataclysmic and often unknown journey of the child's illness requires knowledgeable, compassionate, and dedicated health care professionals. © 2011 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.

AB  - The timing and continuity of sleep in healthy individuals is regulated by the synchronous function of the sleep homeostasis and the endogenous circadian rhythms. Multiple factors affect these two processes and the way they interact. Sleep disorders may manifest differently in men and women and these differences are particularly notable during pregnancy, lactation, and menopause. Insomnia may occur relatively commonly during pregnancy and in the postpartum, and may be the result of either a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), movement disorders such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), or sometimes depression, especially in the postpartum period. Obstructive sleep apnea may contribute to a higher risk of hypertension during pregnancy and doubles the risk for preeclampsia and preterm birth. Snoring, a frequent symptom of OSA, increases in frequency during pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome is more common in pregnant women, is more frequent in the third trimester of pregnancy, and tends to improve dramatically after delivery. Factors associated with increased RLS in pregnancy may be related to iron and folate metabolism. Risk for OSA increases after menopause and presentation with insomnia can delay the diagnosis of OSA. Various treatment options for sleep disorders in women are discussed. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

AB  - Approximately one million women with epilepsy in the United States are in their active reproductive years. Many women with epilepsy require treatment during pregnancy, and many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are potential teratogens. Unfortunately, many pregnancies are often not identified until after organ formation has occurred. However, most women with epilepsy will have a normal pregnancy and a favorable outcome. Effective control of maternal seizures with the least risk to the fetus is ideal, but maternal and fetal risks are still likely increased over the general population. In 2009, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the American Epilepsy Society (AES) published Practice Parameter Updates on the pregnant woman with epilepsy.123 These guidelines reviewed medications, teratogenicity, obstetric outcomes, vitamins, breastfeeding, and other management issues in the pregnant woman with epilepsy. Through a case-based approach, these guidelines will be reviewed, and approaches to diagnosis and management of the pregnant woman with epilepsy will be discussed. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

AB  - Gestational lead exposure (GLE) produces supernormal scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) in children, monkeys and rats, and a novel retinal phenotype characterized by an increased number of rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells in adult mice and rats. Since the loss of dopaminergic amacrine cells (DA ACs) in GLE monkeys and rats contributes to supernormal ERGs, the retinal DA system was analyzed in mice following GLE. C57BL/6 female mice were exposed to low (27. ppm), moderate (55. ppm) or high (109. ppm) lead throughout gestation and until postnatal day 10 (PN10). Blood [Pb] in control, low-, moderate- and high-dose GLE was ≤ 1, ≤ 10, ~ 25 and ~ 40 μg/dL, respectively, on PN10 and by PN30 all were ≤ 1 μg/dL. At PN60, confocal-stereology studies used vertical sections and wholemounts to characterize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and the number of DA and other ACs. GLE dose-dependently and selectively decreased the number of TH-immunoreactive (IR) DA ACs and their synaptic plexus without affecting GABAergic, glycinergic or cholinergic ACs. Immunoblots and confocal revealed dose-dependent decreases in retinal TH protein expression and content, although monoamine oxidase-A protein and gene expression were unchanged. High-pressure liquid chromatography showed that GLE dose-dependently decreased retinal DA content, its metabolites and DA utilization/release. The mechanism of DA selective vulnerability is unknown. However, a GLE-induced loss/dysfunction of DA ACs during development could increase the number of rods and bipolar cells since DA helps regulate neuronal proliferation, whereas during adulthood it could produce ERG supernormality as well as altered circadian rhythms, dark/light adaptation and spatial contrast sensitivity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Varying work schedules are suspected of increasing risks to pregnant women and to fetal wellbeing. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm disruption might impair fetal growth or lead to complications of pregnancy. Two independent meta-analyses (from 2000 to 2007) reported a small adverse effect of shift work on the risk of preterm delivery (PTD). However, these reviews were based on few high-quality studies. Objectives To provide an updated review of the associations of shift work with PTD, low birthweight (LBW), small-for- gestational-age (SGA) infants and pre-eclampsia. Search strategy and selection criteria We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE using combinations of keywords and MeSH terms. Data collection and analysis For each relevant paper we abstracted standard details, used to summarise design features and rate methodological quality. We calculated pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) in random-effect meta-analyses. Main results We retrieved 23 relevant studies. The pooled estimate of RR for PTD was 1.16 (95% CI 1.00-1.33, 16 studies), but when five reports of poorer methodological quality were excluded, the estimated RR decreased to 1.03 (95% CI 0.93-1.14). We also observed increased RRs for LBW (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93-1.74) and for SGA (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22), which varied little by study quality. Little evidence was found on pre-eclampsia. Conclusions These findings suggest that overall, any risk of PTD, LBW, or SGA arising from shift work in pregnancy is small. © 2011 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2011 RCOG.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance is a significant health issue in pregnant women. Although previous studies contribute to an understanding of the multifactorial nature of pregnancy-related sleep disturbance, objective measures of sleep were not included, and so data may be subject to recall and potential participant self-report bias. OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors associated with poor sleep quality in women during their third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This prospective study included 30 nulliparous women who wore a wrist actigraph to objectively monitor sleep for 7 consecutive days and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Fifteen women (50%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score of >5, indicating poor sleep quality. Mean actigraphic sleep efficiency was only 80.05% ± 6.27%. There were significant differences (p < .01) in sleep offset time and total nocturnal sleep time between weekdays and weekends. Later sleep onset time was associated with poorer sleep, including longer sleep latency, and reduced total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency. Discussion: Nulliparous women experience both objective and subjective sleep disturbances, and their sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends during their third trimester of pregnancy. Results suggest that maternal sleep pattern may be improved by maintaining a regular and earlier bedtime so women have more opportunity to obtain sufficient nocturnal sleep and improved sleep quality.

AB  - Study Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health priority and the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for PTB. Design: Observational Measurements and Results: Participants included 166 pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 ± 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with other established risk factors, such as stress.

AB  - Objective: Our study aims to identify changes in sleep during pregnancy and the factors causing these changes. We also assessed women's satisfaction from their support, advice and methods provided, and the results. Means et methods: We conducted a retrospective study, declarative from an anonymous questionnaire. The study was conducted on two sites (consultation service Maternity University Hospital of Tours and a cabinet of midwives). Three hundred questionnaires were distributed, the final sample was 165. Quantitative variables were grouped into classes and expressed by averages. Categorical variables were collected as percentages and compared using the χ 2 test (Chi 2). The level of significance (P) set at 0.05. Results: Many sleep disorders can be found during pregnancy, particular period of life of a woman, with an increased frequency compared to the general population. The first quarter is rather marked by an increase in sleep time. The second quarter is a period with addiction in general, sleep better. The last trimester of pregnancy shows an increase in the number of women increased disorder, with decreased sleep time and poorer sleep quality. Impaired sleep in late pregnancy is explained mostly by the discomfort caused by so-called minor ailments " of pregnancy." Most of these difficulties can be prevented or corrected by simple measures of sleep hygiene and reassuring listening. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - To explore relationships among sleep disturbances, glucose tolerance, and pregnancy outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Four validated sleep questionnaires were administered to 169 pregnant women at the time of 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during the second trimester. Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in 108 women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). RESULTS - Of the participants, 41% had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] >8); 64% had poor sleep quality; 25% snored frequently; 29% had increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); 52% experienced short sleep (SS); 19% had both increased SDB risk and SS (SDB/SS); and 14% had daytime dysfunction. Reported sleep duration inversely correlated with glucose values from 50-g OGTT (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). Each hour of reduced sleep time was associated with a 4%increase in glucose levels. Increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was found in subjects with increased SDB risk (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.2-7.4]), SS (2.4 [1.0-5.9]), SDB/SS (3.4 [1.3-8.7]), and frequent snoring (3.4 [1.3-8.8], after adjustment for BMI). Among NGT subjects, preterm delivery was more frequent in those with increased ESS (P = 0.02), poor sleep quality (P = 0.02), and SS (P = 0.03). Neonatal intensive care unit admissions were associated with increased ESS (P = 0.03), SDB/SS (P = 0.03), and daytime dysfunction (P < 0.01) in mothers. CONCLUSIONS - Pregnant women experience significant sleep disturbances that are associated with increased risk of GDM and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women with increased SDB risk, frequent snoring, and sleep duration of <7 h/night have increased risk of developing GDM. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - There are conflicting data on the course of bipolar disorder during pregnancy but childbirth is generally considered a time of high risk for the onset or exacerbation of mood and psychotic episodes in women with bipolar disorder. Despite the increasing use of psychotropic drugs in women with psychiatric disorders, there is a paucity of information in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder during and after pregnancy. Optimal drug treatment requires an understanding of the illness course prior to, during, and after pregnancy; bipolar disorder type and dominant polarity, psychiatric comorbidity, physical health status, prior response to psychotropic drugs, effectiveness of medications in the acute and preventative treatment of mood episodes, side effect profile including teratogenicity, and finally family history of psychiatric illness. For women who discontinue psychotropic drugs abruptly upon finding out about the pregnancy, the withdrawal symptoms of medications should be distinguished from the symptoms of the disorder. Compatibility of drugs with breastfeeding is another important consideration. Antidepressants should be avoided as much as possible due to their association with manic switches, rapid cycling, and suicidality. An important aspect of pharmacotherapy in women with a personal or family history of bipolar I disorder or postpartum psychosis should be the management of insomnia that can either be an early symptom of, or a trigger for postpartum manic/mixed or psychotic episodes. Whereas polypharmacy may be unavoidable, every effort should be made to keep the overall number of medications and dosages to a minimum. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background & Aims: In preterm infants, exfoliated gastric epithelial cells can be retrieved from aspirates sampled through the naso-gastric feeding tube. Our aims were to determine (1) whether the recovery of exfoliated cells is feasible at any time from birth through the removal of the nasogastric tube, (2) whether they can be grown in culture in vitro, and (3) whether the physiological state of exfoliated cells expressing H+/K+ -ATPases reflects that of their counterparts remaining in situ at the surface of the gastric epithelium in neonatal rat pups. Methods: In infants, gastric fluid aspirates were collected weekly after birth or every 3 hours over 24-h periods, and related to clinical parameters (Biocollection PROG/09/18). In rat pups submitted to a single fasting/refeeding cycle, we explored circadian exfoliation with the cellular counter-parts in the gland. All samples were analyzed by confocal imaging and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Results: Epithelial cells were identified by microscopy using membrane-bound anti-H+/K+ ATPases antibody, assessed for nucleus integrity, and the expression of selected proteins (autophagy, circadian clock). On 34 infants, the H+/K+ -ATPase-positive cells were consistently found quiescent, regardless of gestational age and feeding schedule from day-5 of life to the day of removal of the naso-gastric tube. By logistic regression analysis, we did find a positive correlation between the intensity of exfoliation (cellular loss per sample) and the postnatal age (p<0.001). The H+/K+ ATPase-positive cells established in culture retained the expression of a biomarker of progenitor status (Pouf5F1-Oct4). In rat pups, the expression pattern of Survivin in H+/K+ ATPase-positive exfoliated cells paralleled that observed in cells remaining at the surface of the gastric gland. Conclusions: Tracking parietal cells can improve clinical monitoring and understanding of the autophagic death via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/survivin pathway. © 2011 Kaeffer et al.

AB  - Recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) of human 16p11.2 have been associated with a variety of developmental/neurocognitive syndromes. In particular, deletion of 16p11.2 is found in patients with autism, developmental delay, and obesity. Patients with deletions or duplications have a wide range of clinical features, and siblings carrying the same deletion often have diverse symptoms. To study the consequence of 16p11.2 CNVs in a systematic manner, we used chromosome engineering to generate mice harboring deletion of the chromosomal region corresponding to 16p11.2, as well as mice harboring the reciprocal duplication. These 16p11.2 CNV models have dosage-dependent changes in gene expression, viability, brain architecture, and behavior. For each phenotype, the consequence of the deletion is more severe than that of the duplication. Of particular note is that half of the 16p11.2 deletion mice die postnatally; those that survive to adulthood are healthy and fertile, but have alterations in the hypothalamus and exhibit a "behavior trap" phenotype - a specific behavior characteristic of rodents with lateral hypothalamic and nigrostriatal lesions. These findings indicate that 16p11.2 CNVs cause brain and behavioral anomalies, providing insight into human neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Background: The aim was to describe the feeding- and stooling patterns of infants with colic and evaluate the influence of minimal acupuncture.Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled, blind clinical study was conducted at a private acupuncture clinic in Sweden. 90 otherwise healthy 2-8 weeks old infants, born after gestational week 36, fulfilling the criteria for infantile colic and not medicated with dicyclomine, were included. 81 infants went through a structured program consisting of six visits to the clinic, twice weekly. Infants randomized to receive acupuncture were given minimal, standardized acupuncture for two seconds in LI4. Frequency and size of stooling, as well as duration of, and intervals between, feeding sessions were reported by parents in a diary. Parental assessment of sleep and comments on stooling and side effects were collected in a questionnaire.Results: At baseline when the mean age was five weeks, infants in both groups were fed a median of eight times/day, 148 min/day, with considerable variations. No differences were found between groups in the frequency and duration of feeding during the intervention weeks. Furthermore there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the frequency of stooling, neither at baseline, at which point the infants of both groups had bowel movements 4.2 times/day, nor during the intervention weeks. There was an expected decrease in frequency of stooling in both groups, reaching 2.1 (p = 0,001) in the acupuncture group and 3.1 (p < 0,001) in the control group. The groups differed regarding large bowel movements which decreased linearly in the control group (p = 0,011) but not in the acupuncture group (p = 0,787). More parents in the acupuncture group than in the control group (28% and 15% respectively, p = 0.006) experienced the infant's sleep to be "better" or "much better." No other significant differences were found. However, parents described a normalized stooling and experienced an improvement in colic in their infants more frequently in the acupuncture group than in the control group.Conclusions: Infants with colic in the present study had a higher frequency of stooling than reported internationally in healthy infants. Minimal acupuncture had no major effect on feeding, stooling and sleep, although a minor effect of minimal acupuncture on stooling and sleep cannot be ruled out.

AB  - Background: Treatment of schizophrenia frequently includes prolonged benzodiazepine administration despite a lack of evidence of its use. It is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines because of the development of dependence. We aim to assess if melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of prolonged benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life.Methods/Design: Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel superiority trial. We plan to include 80 consenting outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 18-55 years of age, treated with antipsychotic drug(s) and at least one benzodiazepine derivative for the last three months before inclusion. Exclusion criteria: currently under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, aggressive or violent behavior, known mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, dementia, epilepsy, terminal illness, severe co morbidity, inability to understand Danish, allergy to melatonin, lactose, starch, gelatin, or talc, hepatic impairment, pregnancy or nursing, or lack of informed consent. After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin®) 2 mg daily or matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose. The primary outcome measure is benzodiazepine dose at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include sleep, psychophysiological, and neurocognitive measures. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, adverse events, social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up.Discussion: The results from this trial will examine whether melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy of patients compared to the background population. The results will also provide new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine treatment with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials NCT01431092. © 2011 Baandrup et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Progesterone is a C-21 steroid hormone, plays a major role in the occurrence, maintenance and termination of pregnancy. Objective: To study the diurnal variations in the levels of progesterone at the start and end of the day during late pregnancy in women having different life set ups. Study Design: Experimental and Observational Study. Place of Study: This study was conducted at the Department of Gynae and Obs., Khyber Medical College, Peshawar. Materials and Methods: Blood samples of 50 women between 26-40 weeks of gestation were collected at two different intervals with a gap of 12 hours. Progesterone level was estimated by Serozyme EIA method. Results: The concentration of progesterone was found low in the early morning and high in the late evening in our population. Besides, the magnitude of fluctuations in the samples of two different intervals declined with progress of age and weeks of gestation. Conclusion: Our findings support the recommendation of restricting progesterone measurements to morning hours at all ages particularly during late pregnancy which is important information for clinicians at the time of interpretation of results.

AB  - Fetal behavioral patterns have been considered as indicators of fetal brain development. Numerous studies employing conventional 2D ultrasound have shown that normally developing fetuses and fetuses at risk exhibit different patterns of behavior. With the appearance and development of 4D ultrasound, fetal behavioral movements, and the full range of facial expressions can be observed. After standardization of valid reference ranges of movements appropriate for the gestational age, the Zagreb group published a new scoring system for fetal neurobehavior based on prenatal assessment by 4D sonography, the Kurjak Antenatal Neurological Test. The aims and objectives of this article were to describe the latest 4D sonographic studies on fetal behavior and to present results of behavioral assessment by KANET in high-risk pregnancies. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of farming management on the total locomotor activity (TLA) behaviour in dairy cattle. We recorded 24 h/day TLA in five not pregnant Holstein Friesian cows during parts of the lactation and dry periods, by means of an activity monitoring system (Actiwatch mini®) for seven days in each period. During mild lactation (period 1) animals were milked and fed twice a day. During the dry (period 2) they were kept to graze all day. In both periods hay and water were available ad libitum. Differences between the photophase and the scotophase were evaluated with a Student t-test. One-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine a statistical significant effect of time. A trigonometric statistical model was used to describe the main rhythmic parameters: mean level, amplitude, acrophase and robustness of rhythm.Our results showed a circadian rhythm of daily TLA in both periods, with different percentages of robustness, and acrophase in the middle of the photophase. The different patterns of activity in the two periods were attributed to the management practise during milking period. These results could be taken in consideration during farming management for the evaluation of such systems used in livestock, with respect to production and welfare. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is one of the most common inherited autosomal recessive disorders, caused by deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in steroid synthesis. The clinical picture of the most prevalent form, i.e. 21-hydroxylase deficiency, is characterized by cortisol and mostly aldosterone deficiency and androgen excess (leading to congenital virilization in girls). Treatment consists of glucocorticoids, aimed at substitution of cortisol deficiency and, decrease of androgen excess. Usually supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids are required to effectively suppress adrenal androgens. Furthermore, with the currently available glucocorticoid preparations, it is not possible to simulate a normal circadian rhythm in CAH patients. Therefore, it is a difficult task for (pediatric) endocrinologists to find the best balance between under- and overtreatment thereby avoiding important long term complications. In this review we will discuss the current pharmacologic treatment options. We give age dependent dose recommendations and describe the limitations of current treatment strategies. We discuss effects on fertility, bone density and cardiovascular risks. Recommendations about the use of glucocorticoids in case of fever or stress situations are given. The principles of treatment of non classic (mild) CAH are discussed in a separate section. Also prenatal therapy, to prevent congenital virilization of a female CAH newborn, is discussed. Furthermore, an overview of alternative pharmacological treatment options in the future is given. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The relation between sex hormones and migraine has been examined in a series of studies, leading to the definitions of pure menstrual migraine and menstruallyrelated migraine. The relation between sex hormones and other types of primary headache has been studied less extensively, but there is at least some evidence that hormones in general, and menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause in particular, also impact these disorders.

AB  - Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is a common cause of neonatal brain damage with lifelong morbidities in which current therapies are limited. In this study, we investigated the effect of neuropeptide NAP (NAPVSIPQ) on early cerebral oxidative stress, long-term neurological function and brain injury after neonatal HI. Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to an HI model by applying a unilateral carotid artery occlusion and systemic hypoxia. The animals were randomly assigned to groups receiving an intraperitoneal injection of NAP (3. μg/g) or vehicle immediately (0 h) and 24 h after HI. Brain DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione (GSH) content were determined 24 h after the last NAP injection. Cognitive impairment was assessed on postnatal day 60 using the spatial version of the Morris water maze learning task. Next, the animals were euthanized to assess the cerebral hemispheric volume using the Cavalieri principle associated with the counting point method. We observed that NAP prevented the acute HI-induced DNA and lipid membrane damage and also recovered the GSH levels in the injured hemisphere of the HI rat pups. Further, NAP was able to prevent impairments in learning and long-term spatial memory and to significantly reduce brain damage up to 7 weeks following the neonatal HI injury. Our findings demonstrate that NAP confers potent neuroprotection from acute brain oxidative stress, long-term cognitive impairment and brain lesions induced by neonatal HI through, at least in part, the modulation of the glutathione-mediated antioxidant system. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: to explore the strategies used by Jordanian women to manage heartburn during pregnancy. Design: an exploratory descriptive study. Participants and setting: 235 Jordanian women from the three regions of Jordan, aged between 18 and 54 years, who were pregnant at the time of the study or had previously had at least one full-term pregnancy. Findings: a number of strategies were used by Jordanian women in the sample for the alleviation of heartburn of pregnancy, including non-pharmacological strategies such as diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatments such as antacids, and the use of home remedies such as drinking cold milk, 'baking powder' in liquid form or herbs, eating cucumber, lintel seeds, or dry tea leaves. Women aged 40 years and older, who had lower income, and were not employed were more likely to use home remedies to manage heartburn in pregnancy than the other groups. Overall, women rated their chosen strategy as useful. Key conclusions and implications for practice: heartburn can be very uncomfortable and can affect food intake and appetite, daily routine and even sleep. Heartburn during pregnancy is at risk for being poorly managed given that birth is the cure. As a health-care provider, it is important to prepare women and their families to manage heartburn during pregnancy effectively. Midwives should encourage women to seek help from care providers when they need it, and continue to assess heartburn and the strategies used to manage symptoms during pregnancy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder. Untreated OSA has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, sudden cardiac death, respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes. Less is discussed about the ocular complications of OSA. Ophthalmic complications of obstructive sleep apnoea can include floppy eyelid syndrome, glaucoma, central serous chorioretinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion. Nonarteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and idiopathic intracranial hypertension may be neuro-ophthalmic complications of OSA. Further research is required to evaluate whether treatment of OSA can improve or reverse these disorders. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Background: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). Method: 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries. Results: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less. Limitations: An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints. Conclusion: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: There is a gap in the knowledge of longterm outcome of mild to moderate prematures compared to the extreme prematures or very low birth weight infants. Aim: Determine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in (pre-)school age children born at 32 to 36. weeks' gestation. Study design: A descriptive cohort study in a non-Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatment and social economic status (SES) were analyzed. Study tools were the TNO-AZL Preschool Quality of Life (TAPQoL) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Subjects: 362 children born between 32 and 36. weeks' gestation who had a follow-up evaluation at 2?5. years of age. Outcome measure: Health-related quality of life and the occurrence of emotional and behavioral problems. Results: Main characteristics (mean ± SD) were: gestation 34.7 ± 1. weeks and birth weight 2360 ± 444. g. Most families were two-parent middle-class households with parents employed at their educational level. Questionnaire response rate was 62.7%. The 12-item TAPQoL showed significantly lower scores for stomach and liveliness, while scores for behavior, communication and sleep were significantly higher compared to the general population. The TAPQoL subscale score for lung problems was significantly lower for children who had received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CBCL scores were within the validated normal range although the study-population scored higher on emotionally reactive, somatic complaints and attention problems compared to their full-term peers. Conclusion: Children born at 32 to 36. weeks' gestational age do not experience an overall lower HR-QoL at 2 to 5. years of age. CPAP results in lower HRQoL scores for lung problems. The overall occurrence of behavioral and emotional problems does not differ from the general term-born pediatric population. Several subitems need further attention. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background: The objectives of the present study were to explore whether maternal psychosocial factors, mental health and work stress around delivery, are related to the behavior of 2-year-old children. Methods: In a prospective cohort study design, pregnant women attending the National Taiwan University Hospital for delivery and post-partum care from April 2004 to January 2005 were recruited and their children were observed at 24 months. A total of 186 mother-term-born child dyads completed the measurement. The five-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5) self-report data of maternal psychosocial factors were selected from the Taiwanese version of the short form 36 (SF-36). The Child Behavior Checklist for age 1-5 (CBCL/1-5) was completed by the parents when the child was 2 years old. Results: The mean score of mental health around delivery was 68.11. The proportion of mothers with work stress seldom and always was 61.8% and 24.7%, respectively. The mean of the total CBCL score, and internalizing, externalizing behavior and sleep problems scores was 45.95, 11.89, 15.59 and 4.23, respectively. After adjusting for the potential confounders, maternal work stress around delivery was found to have a significant effect on the total CBCL and externalizing, attention and aggressive, behavioral problems of 2-year old children. Maternal mental health around delivery, however, did not show significant effects on child behavior. Conclusions: Work stress around delivery seems to aggravate children's externalizing behavior problems at 2 years old. It is therefore important to improve the psychosocial health and reduce the stress of pregnant women. © 2011 Japan Pediatric Society.

AB  - It is described how an unhealthy lifestyle, via causation of chronic systemic low grade inflammation leads to insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome and eventually its associated diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, pregnancy complications and fertility problems. Homo sapiens' sensitivity for the development of insulin resistance traces back to our rapid brain growth in the past 2.5 million years. Our brain ranks high in the energetic hierarchy. When threatened by a glucose deficit, such as during pregnancy and infection, we respond with an inflammatory reaction that causes insulin resistance and is followed by, amongst others, a functional reallocation of energy-rich nutrients and a change in the serum lipoprotein composition. During inflammation the latter aims at the redistribution of lipids, modulation of the immune response and active inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport for damage repair. With the advent of the agricultural revolution and with increasing paste since the industrial revolution, we have introduced numerous false inflammatory triggers in our lifestyle that took us into a state of chronic systemic low grade inflammation. Eventually, this condition leads to the above mentioned typically Western diseases via an evolutionary conserved interaction between our immune system and metabolism. The triggers can roughly be subdivided into an abnormal dietary composition, abnormal microbial flora, insufficient physical activity, stress, insufficient sleep and environmental pollution. The current decrease of the number of life years without chronic disease is rather due to 'nurture' than 'nature', since less than 5% of our chronic diseases are directly attributable to heritable genetic factors. Resolution of the conflict between environment and our ancient genome is the only effective manner to arrive at 'healthy aging' and for this we should return to the balance of the Paleolithic era, as translated to the culture of the 21 st century. Clinical chemists are pre-eminently capable to play an important role in the increasing attention for 'lifestyle', because lifestyle factors can at least in part be mapped by analyses of markers in blood and urine.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's curse, is characterized by idiopathic failure of autonomic breathing and is often associated with neurocristopathies such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). CCHS is caused by mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene, often manifest as polyalanine repeat expansions. Herein, we report the cases of two unrelated Korean patients with Ondine-Hirschsprung disease. The patient's clinical manifestations were apnea and cyanosis requiring immediate endotracheal intubation, recurrent hypoventilation with hypercapnia, hypoxia after ventilator removal, and abdominal distension since birth. Intestinal biopsies were performed and the absence of ganglion cells in the colon was consistent with HSCR. We performed direct sequencing analysis in the PHOX2B and RET genes and fluorescence polymerase chain reaction in order to determine the polyalanine tract expansion in exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. Expansion mutations were detected in both patients; one had 20/24 repeats and the other had 20/27 repeats. The 20/24 genotype has not been previously described in severe CCHS phenotypes and associated HSCR. We believe that the information in this report will improve our understanding of the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneities of CCHS and HSCR. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Arterial hypertension is a common worldwide disease with a prevalence of approximately 26%. Secondary cause is known in 5-10% of patients with hypertension. We should think of secondary hypertension in all patients with resistant hypertension, in patients with sudden deterioration in the control of hypertension and in patients with laboratory and clinical signs of diseases associated with secondary hypertension. It is important to distinguish between secondary hypertension and pseudo-resistance (noncompliance to treatment, white coat syndrome). Secondary causes of hypertension can be divided into endocrine (primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, hypercortisolism, hyperparathyreoidism), renal - renovascular and renal parenchymal hypertension, and other causes as sleep apnoe syndrome, hypertension in pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta and intracranial tumors.

AB  - The number of vertebrae is defined strictly for a given species and depends on the number of somites, which are the earliest metameric structures that form in development. Somites are formed by sequential segmentation. The periodicity of somite segmentation is orchestrated by the synchronous oscillation of gene expression in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), termed the "somite segmentation clock," in which Notch signaling plays a crucial role. Here we show that the clock period is sensitive to Notch activity, which is fine-tuned by its feedback regulator, Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein (Nrarp), and that Nrarp is essential for forming the proper number and morphology of axial skeleton components. Null-mutant mice for Nrarp have fewer vertebrae and have defective morphologies. Notch activity is enhanced in the PSM of the Nrarp -/- embryo, where the ∼2-h segmentation period is extended by 5 min, thereby forming fewer somites and their resultant vertebrae. Reduced Notch activity partially rescues the Nrarp -/- phenotype in the number of somites, but not in morphology. Therefore we propose that the period of the somite segmentation clock is sensitive to Notch activity and that Nrarp plays essential roles in the morphology of vertebrae and ribs. © 2011 Kim et al.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the temperature-humidity index (THI) and the conception rate of lactating dairy cows in southwestern Japan, one of the hottest areas of the country. We also investigated the relationship between measurement of the vaginal temperature of lactating dairy cows as their core body temperature at one-hour intervals for 25 consecutive days in hot (August-September, n=6) and cool (January-February, n=5) periods and their THI. Furthermore, we discussed the above relationship using these vaginal temperatures, the conception rates and the THI. As a result, when the conception rates from day 2 to 0 before AI were classified into day 2, 1 and 0 groups by the six maximum THI values in each group (mTHI; <61, 61-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, >80), only the conception rate for the mTHI over 80 at 1 day before AI group was significantly lower (P<0.05) than the other groups. The conception rate for days 15 to 17, but not days 19 to 22 and 30 to 35, after AI in the cows that experienced average mTHI over 80 (amTHI>80) was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the cows that did not experience amTHI>80. There was a significant positive correlation (P<0.01) between the mTHI and the mean daily vaginal temperature, but not during the cool period. When the mTHI reached 69, the vaginal temperature started to increase. As for the relationship between the conception rates and vaginal temperatures for all mTHI classes, in the mTHI>80 at 1 day before AI group, the vaginal temperature increased by 0.6 C from 38.7 C, resulting in a reduction of 11.6% in the conception rate from 40.5%. In conclusion, these results suggest that one of the causes of the fall in conception rate of lactating dairy cows during the summer season in southwestern Japan may be an increase in their core body temperature with a higher mTHI than the critical mTHI of 69 at 1 day before AI. © 2011 by the Society for Reproduction and Development.

AB  - Background: Cough is one of the most common respiratory symptoms and is well characterized in specialized cough clinics with high success rates of diagnosis and treatment. However, there is a paucity of data regarding cough in primary care settings. The present study aimed at investigating clinical epidemiology of cough through a national study of two questionnaire surveys sent to primary care physicians in China.Methods: Approximately 18,000 subjects recruited were having daytime or night symptoms of cough and diagnoses of respiratory disease from February 2005 to April 2006 as Survey 1 and from June 2007 to December 2007 as Survey 2. Patients suffering from respiratory malignancy, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, severe hypohepatia or renal dysfunction, pregnancy, possible pregnancy or lactation, neutropenia were not eligible. Information regarding demography, history of allergies, symptomatic profile, treatment and curative effects for cough was elicited.Results: 8216 questionnaires were collected in Survey 1 and 9711 in Survey 2. The mean values of ages were 25.7 and 22.3 years old, respectively. Symptoms included expectoration (74% and 76%), wheeze (59% and 74%), breathlessness (22% and 26%), chest pain (9% and 13%) and fever (15% and 18%). About 15% and 23% patients had hypersusceptibility, of whom 6% to 17% had a family history. More than 50% of the cases had histories of allergic rhinitis, asthma, conjunctivitis or atopic dermatitis. Asthma, COPD, and bronchitis were dominant etiologies of cough. Procaterol or the combination of antibiotics and steroids were used as the treatment.Conclusion: Causes and outcomes of cough differed with ages and time in this particular national study, while successful and precise diagnosis and management of cough in primary care settings need to be further improved in China. © 2011 Hong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The New York City terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001 (9/11), killed nearly 2800 people and thousands more had subsequent health problems. In this Review of health effects in the short and medium terms, strong evidence is provided for associations between experiencing or witnessing events related to 9/11 and post-traumatic stress disorder and respiratory illness, with a correlation between prolonged, intense exposure and increased overall illness and disability. Rescue and recovery workers, especially those who arrived early at the World Trade Center site or worked for longer periods, were more likely to develop respiratory illness than were other exposed groups. Risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder included proximity to the site on 9/11, living or working in lower Manhattan, rescue or recovery work at the World Trade Center site, event-related loss of spouse, and low social support. Investigators note associations between 9/11 exposures and additional disorders, such as depression and substance use; however, for some health problems association with exposures related to 9/11 is unclear. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Clock genes drive circadian rhythms in a range of physiological processes both centrally and in peripheral tissues such as the liver. The aims of this study were to determine whether the two functionally-distinct zones of the rat placenta (junctional and labyrinth) differentially express clock genes and, if so, whether these exhibit circadian patterns. Rats were sampled from d 21 of pregnancy (term = d 23) and from diestrus I of the estrous cycle. Adult liver (all animals), fetal liver, and placental zones (pregnant animals) were collected at 0800, 1400, 2000, and 0200 h. Both zones of the rat placenta expressed all seven canonical clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, and Cry2), but there were marked zonal differences and, unlike in maternal liver, circadian variation in placentawaslimited. Similarly, placental expression of Vegf varied withzonebut not time of day. Pregnancy also led to marked changes in hepatic clock gene expression, with peak levels of Per1, Cry1, and Cry2 all reduced, Per3 increased, and circadian variation in Clock expression lost. All clock genes were expressed in fetal liver, but there was less circadian variation than in maternal liver. Similarly, fetal corticosterone levels remained stable across the day, whereas maternal corticosterone showed clear circadian variation. In conclusion, our data show that the rat placenta expresses all canonical clock genes in a highly zone-specific manner but with relatively little circadian variation. Moreover, pregnancy alters the expression and circadian variation of clock genes in maternal liver, possibly contributing to maternal physiological adaptations.

AB  - The use of serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) is increasing among Danish pregnant women. This systematic review addresses the potential adverse effects on the foetus and child of maternal SRI medication. The literature indicates a slightly increased risk of cardiovascular malformations and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the new-born, while evidence regarding the risk of preterm labour, low birth weight, low Apgar score, prolonged QT interval and miscarriage is less clear. An estimated 20-30% of infants will have neonatal symptoms following intrauterine SRI exposure. The symptoms may be caused by SRI withdrawal, toxicity or their overlap, but symptom aetiology basically remains controversial. The infants may exhibit neurological, gastrointestinal, autonomic, endocrine or respiratory symptoms. Although the symptoms are self-limited, the families may be seriously affected. In general, studies do not address this important aspect. Evidence concerning long-term effects is surprisingly sparse and many studies have important methodological limitations. However, present evidence does not convincingly indicate detrimental long-term effects. Until sufficient safety studies have been carried out, SRI must be used with caution in pregnancy and every treatment of the pregnant woman should be thoroughly considered.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy and are currently regarded as one of the most important factors determining pregnancy outcome. Detailed research of sleep features during pregnancy is obviously essential. In the present review recent data concerning changes in sleep structure and regulation in pregnant women and rats - main subjects of experimental sleep research, are given, including surmised mechanisms underlying such changes. The importance of women's sleep integrity preservation during pregnancy for the viability and normal development of the fetus is emphasized and possible ways of pathological influence of sleep disorders during this period are discussed.

AB  - Background: During pregnancy, women are at particular risk for sleep deprivation and snoring because of the physiologic and hormonal changes of pregnancy. There is limited evidence for the association between sleep patterns in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. We examined the association of sleep duration and snoring in late pregnancy with the risk of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. Methods: We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort "Rhea" study in Crete, Greece 2007-2009. The analysis included 1091 women with singleton pregnancies, providing complete data on sleeping habits at the third trimester of gestation and birth outcomes. Fetal growth restriction was based on a customized model, and multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to adjust for confounders. Results: Women with severe snoring were at high risk for low birth weight (relative risk = 2.6 [95% confidence interval = 1.2-5.4]), and fetal-growth-restricted neonates (2.0 [1.0 -3.9]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI). Women with sleep deprivation (≤5 hours sleep) were at high risk for preterm births (1.7 [1.1-2.8]), with the highest risk observed for medically indicated preterm births (2.4 [1.0-6.4]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, parity, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy BMI. Conclusions: These findings suggest that women with severe snoring in late pregnancy have a higher risk for fetal-growth-restricted neonates; and women with sleep deprivation have a higher risk for preterm births. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) utilized by pregnant women influence fetal neurobehavioral development. In this observational study we investigated developmental milestones of fetal behavior during the pregnancy of women with psychiatric disorders who took SSRIs throughout gestation (medicated group; n96) or who had discontinued medication early in gestation or before conception (unmedicated group; n37). Healthy unexposed fetuses of women without mental disorders comprised the control group (n130). Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior were made three times in pregnancy (T1-T3). Effects of SSRIs were studied over a wide range of dosages (low, standard, or high) and for different drug types. Fetuses exposed to standard or high SSRI dosages compared with control, unmedicated, or low-medicated fetuses showed significantly increased motor activity at the beginning (T1) and end of the second trimester (T2). They particularly exhibited disrupted emergence of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM; quiet) sleep during the third trimester, characterized by continual bodily activity and, thus, poor inhibitory motor control during this sleep state near term (T3). The SSRI effects on the fetus were dose related, but independent of SSRI type. The results demonstrate changes in fetal neurobehavioral development associated with standard and high SSRI dosages that are observable throughout gestation. A first-choice SSRI type was not apparent. Bodily activity at high rate during non-REM sleep in SSRI-exposed fetuses is an abnormal phenomenon, but its significance for postnatal development is unclear. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

AB  - "Parasomnia" is a broad term denoting a wide variety of abnormal behaviours during sleep. It is best understood by classifying these into the type of sleep from which they arise, particularly whether they occur at the transition between sleep and wakefulness or from non-rapid eye movement or rapid eye movement sleep. The events may lead to injuries both to the subject and to the bed partner. It is important to analyse the trigger factors for the activities and to assess the contribution of other factors, such as sleep deprivation and drugs. Investigations particularly polysomnography are generally required if there is an atypical presentation, if other sleep disorders may be contributing or if there is a failure to respond to initial treatment. Most parasomnias require a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. Primarily neuropsychiatric disorders including the restless legs syndrome, epilepsy and dissociative disorders may present as parasomnias, and require specific treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe selected demographics; maternal health behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy; and infant health outcomes among homeless women in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analyses are based on Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data from 31 participating states from 2000 to 2007 that were linked to birth certificate data, which contain demographic and medical information collected through the state's vital records system. Responses were then weighted to be representative of all women who gave birth in each state during that year. Assessment of these data takes into account the complex sampling designs employed by the states. RESULTS: Four percent of women reported homelessness within 12 months before pregnancy, with the highest percentage in Illinois, followed by Oregon and Washington. Homeless women were younger, unmarried, uninsured, less educated, less likely to initiate and sustain breastfeeding, and had less prenatal care and well-visits. They were also more likely to be black, Hispanic, smoke cigarettes, be underweight or have class III obesity, and not take preconception multivitamins. Infants had lower birth weights, a longer hospital stay, and were more likely to receive neonatal intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we provide additional insight into homelessness in the perinatal period and provide information on ways to direct interventions aimed at improving the health of homeless mothers and infants. Additional research is needed to determine factors that influence pregnancy weight gain and infant feeding practices among homeless women and how this affects infant health.

AB  - Altitude illness is a spectrum of conditions that affect the majority of travelers to high elevations (>8200 ft [2500 m]). The rapid decrease in arterial oxygen saturation with increasing altitude is the physiologic basis for this group of disorders. Many travelers to high altitudes will experience symptoms of acute mountain sickness including headache, fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness. Prolonged exposure can result in more serious pulmonary, central nervous system, and circulatory disorders. Core treatments for most altitude-related illnesses include descent, rest, medications, and supportive care. Children and travelers with chronic diseases are more susceptible to altitude illness compared with the general population. Pregnant women residing at high altitudes are at increased risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and low-birth-weight infants. Early recognition and treatment of altitude illness can prevent life-threatening situations. Primary care physicians should counsel patients traveling to high altitudes about altitude illness and discuss medications available for mountain sickness prophylaxis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to examine pathways from prenatal cigarette exposure to physiological regulation at 2. months of age. Specifically, we explored the possibility that any association between prenatal cigarette exposure and infant physiological regulation was moderated by fetal growth, prenatal or postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. We evaluated whether exposed infants who were also exposed to ETS after birth, were small for gestational age (SGA) or had mothers with higher depressive symptoms during pregnancy had the highest levels of physiological dysregulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was obtained from 234 (166 exposed and 68 nonexposed) infants during sleep. As expected, cigarette-exposed infants had significantly lower RSA than nonexposed infants. This association was not moderated by prenatal or postnatal ETS exposure, or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. However, small for gestational age status did moderate this association such that nonexposed infants who were not small for gestational age had a significantly higher RSA than nonexposed small for gestational age infants and exposed infants. These findings provide additional evidence that prenatal cigarette exposure is directly associated with dysregulation during infancy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim and objective: This study was intended to avaluate the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with neuropathic pain and concomitant medication. Material and methods: Investigator-initiated, prospective multicenter study, open-label, uncontrolled conducted in 10 pain units from Catalonia hospitals. Pregabalin was consecutively prescribed at the physicians' discretion to avoid selective bias. Inclusion criteria were: outpatient, age >18 years, admission diagnosis as "neuropathic pain" and informed consent. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or cognitive disorders. Protocol scheduled five study visits: at baseline, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months of treatment. Titration of pregabalin doses was pre-specified. We recorded: age, sex, type of neuropathic pain (pure or mixed), VAS (baseline, 15 days, 1 month, 2 and 3 months), MOS sleep scale (baseline and third month), concomitant drug treatment and adverse effects episodes. Patients were divided into three groups: pregabalin + NSAID + tricyclic antidepressants (NSAID+TCA), pregabalin + NSAID + anxiolytics (NSAID+ANX), pregabalin + NSAID + opioids (NSAID+OPI). A parametric Student's t test and non-parametric Wilcoxon test for paired data of quantitative variables were performed. Results: 578 patients were recruited and 472 (81.66%) completed the study. 98.8% of patients were treated with politherapy. Pain relief: mean reduction by -3.6 (± 1.9) (p < 0.0001) points. By type of pain: mixed pain -3.7 (± 1.7) (p < 0.0001); pure neuropathic pain -3.4 (± 2.2) (p < 0.0001). By adjuvant medication, the NSAID + TCA group -3.1 (± 1.9) (p = 0.0002); NSAID + ANX -3.4 (± 2.0) (p < 0.0001); NSAID + OPI -3.7 (± 1.9) (p < 0.0001). Sleep improvement: mean reduction by -1.9 (± 6.4) (p < 0.0001) points. By type of pain: mixed pain -3.1 (± 7.0) (p < 0.0001); pure neuropathic pain -1.1 (± 4.2) (p < 0.0001). By adjuvant medication, NSAID+OPI -2.1 (± 6.0) (p < 0.0001); NSAID + TCA and NSAID + ANX groups both - 1.0 not statistically significant (p = 0.1250 and p = 0.4063 respectively). 90 patients (15.6%) discontinued the study due to adverse effects. Conclusions: Treatment with pregabalin induces a fast and significant relief of neuropathic pain, improves sleep and shows a low drug interaction profile. © 2011 Sociedad Española del Dolor.

AB  - Background: This project aimed to provide an organized, sequential, and evidence-supported approach to the pharmacotherapy of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following the format of previous efforts of the Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program. Method: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to determine the best pharmacological choices for PTSD patients and to update the last published version (1999) of the algorithm. We focused on optimal pharmacological interventions to address the prominent symptoms of PTSD, with additional attention to the impact that common comorbidities have on treatment choices. Results: We found that SSRIs and SNRIs are not as effective as previously thought, and that awareness of their long-term side effects has increased. New evidence suggests that addressing fragmented sleep and nightmares can improve symptoms (in addition to insomnia) that are frequently seen with PTSD (e.g., hyperarousal, reexperiencing). Prazosin and trazodone are emphasized at this initial step; if significant PTSD symptoms remain, an antidepressant may be tried. For PTSD-related psychosis, an antipsychotic may be added. In resistant cases, two or three antidepressants may be used in sequence. Following that, or with partial improvement and residual symptomatology, augmentation may be tried; the best options are antipsychotics, clonidine, topiramate, and lamotrigine. Conclusion: This heuristic may be helpful in producing faster symptom resolution, fewer side effects, and increased compliance. © 2011 President and Fellows of Harvard College.

AB  - This consensus statement was developed by Special Interest Group - Urticaria (IADVL). Urticaria, a heterogeneous group of diseases, often cannot be recognized by its morphology. Due to non-specific and non-affordable diagnosis, management of urticaria, especially chronic urticaria, is very challenging. This guideline includes definition, causes, classification and management of urticaria. Urticaria has a profound impact on the quality of life and causes immense distress to patients, necessitating effective treatment. One approach to manage urticaria is identification and elimination of the underlying cause(s) and/or eliciting trigger(s), while the second one is treatment aimed at providing symptomatic relief. This guideline recommends use of second-generation non-sedating H1 antihistamines as the first-line treatment. The dose can be increased up to four times to meet the expected results. In case patients still do not respond, appropriate treatment options can be selected depending on the cost.

AB  - Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic or a second-generation antipsychotic. It has been used in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, depressive episodes of bipolar disorder, acute manic episodes connected with bipolar disorder and as a therapy for maintaining bipolar disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, Tourette syndrome, alcoholism and it is prescribed as a sedative in patients with anxious disorder and troubles with sleeping. Some studies have shown that the use of antipsychotics in alcoholics decreases alcohol intake and craving and alleviates psychiatric symptoms in addicts and patients who, besides alcoholism, suffer also from other psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. It has been proven that Quetiapine is successful in the treatment of type B alcoholism, then in alcoholics suffering from anxiety, sleep disorder and who have symptoms of depression. This paper shows past cognitions of the use of Quetiapine in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

AB  - Agomelatine is an antidepressant drug that is a synthetic analogue of the hormone melatonin. It stimulates the activity of melatonin MT 1 and MT 2 receptors and inhibits the activity of serotonin 5HT 2C receptor subtypes.The objective of this article is to critically review and evaluate the benefits and risks of agomelatine for the treatment of major depression. The published literature through April 2011 for articles relating to agomelatine, together with unpublished data on agomelatine available from the European Medicines Agency, the US FDA, US ClinicalTrials.gov and the Novartis Clinical Trial Results Database are reviewed.The antidepressant efficacy of agomelatine has been systematically assessed in ten short-term, placebo-controlled studies and three longer-term, placebo-controlled, relapse prevention studies. Five short-term trials demonstrated clinically modest, but statistically significant, benefits over placebo, although two of these studies reported opposite effects for 25mg versus 50mg doses. The other five short-term trials did not find agomelatine more effective than placebo, but in two of these studies the active control drug was more effective than placebo.A meta-analysis of six European trials demonstrated a small, statistically significant, marginally clinically relevant difference in efficacy favouring agomelatine over placebo. The only placebo-controlled study in elderly patients did not demonstrate a significant benefit for agomelatine. Agomelatine was shown to be more effective than placebo in one of three relapse prevention studies.Agomelatine was generally well tolerated compared with placebo. Its adverse effect profile is different to that of other antidepressant drugs, but its overall tolerability in studies with other antidepressants as active control drugs did not appear to be substantially better than the controls. Agomelatine is contraindicated in patients with impaired liver function and in patients taking drugs that potently inhibit cytochrome P450 1A2 metabolic enzymes. Because elevated liver enzymes are common, and there is a rare risk of more serious liver reactions, routine laboratory monitoring of liver function is recommended periodically throughout treatment. Based on this comprehensive review, agomelatine does not have clinically significant advantages compared with other antidepressant drugs, and it has certain limitations and disadvantages. Because of the unique pharmacology of agomelatine and its reported tolerability profile, it should only be considered as an alternative drug for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate other antidepressant drugs. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - The peripheral astrocyte process (PAP) preferentially associates with the synapse. The PAP, which is not found around every synapse, extends to or withdraws from it in an activity-dependent manner. Although the pre- and postsynaptic elements have been described in great molecular detail, relatively little is known about the PAP because of its difficult access for electrophysiology or light microscopy, as they are smaller than microscopic resolution. We investigated possible stimuli and mechanisms of PAP plasticity. Immunocytochemistry on rat brain sections demonstrates that the actin-binding protein ezrin and the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 3 and 5 are compartmentalized to the PAP but not to the GFAP-containing stem process. Further experiments applying ezrin siRNA or dominant-negative ezrin in primary astrocytes indicate that filopodia formation and motility require ezrin in the membrane/cytoskeleton bound (i.e., T567-phosphorylated) form. Glial processes around synapses in situ consistently display this ezrin form. Possible motility stimuli of perisynaptic glial processes were studied in culture, based on their similarity with filopodia. Glutamate and glutamate analogues reveal that rapid (5 min), glutamate-induced filopodia motility is mediated by mGluRs 3 and 5. Ultrastructurally, these mGluR subtypes were also localized in astrocytes in the rat hippocampus, preferentially in their fine PAPs. In vivo, changes in glutamatergic circadian activity in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus are accompanied by changes of ezrin immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, in line with transmitter-induced perisynaptic glial motility. The data suggest that (i) ezrin is required for the structural plasticity of PAPs and (ii) mGluRs can stimulate PAP plasticity.

AB  - Lead (Pb) exposure alters the temporal organization of several physiological and behavioural processes in which the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus plays a fundamental role. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic early Pb exposure (CePbe) on the morphology, cellular density and relative optical density (OD) in the cells of the SCN of male rats. Female Wistar rats were exposed during gestation and lactation to a Pb solution containing 320ppm of Pb acetate through drinking water. After weaning, the pups were maintained with the same drinking water until sacrificed at 90days of age. Pb levels in the blood, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased in the experimental group. Chronic early Pb exposure induced a significant increase in the minor and major axes and somatic area of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and vasopressin (VP)-immunoreactive neurons. The density of VIP-, VP- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells showed a significant decrease in the experimental group. OD analysis showed a significant increase in VIP neurons of the experimental group. The results showed that CePbe induced alterations in the cells of the SCN, as evidenced by modifications in soma morphology, cellular density and OD in circadian pacemaker cells. These findings provide a morphological and cellular basis for deficits in circadian rhythms documented in Pb-exposed animals. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The influence of circadian timekeeping systems on behavior and physiology can change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in extra-SCN oscillators and in local rhythms might coincide with the emergence of new patterns of temporal organization among various behavioral and physiological rhythms. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS and PER2 in 3 brain regions of pregnant and diestrous rats. We found that, in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BnST-ov), the peak of the PER2 rhythm occurred approximately 12 hours out of phase in pregnant and diestrous females. In contrast, the phase of the rhythm in FOS was the same, but pregnant rats expressed more FOS in the BnST-ov than diestrous ones. In the central amygdala (CEA) of diestrous females, PER2 expression was arrhythmic, but Fos expression was elevated at night. No rhythms were seen in this region of pregnant females, nor were any rhythms seen in the basolateral amygdala of either group. Overall, the patterns in the BnST-ov and the CEA were consistent with the hypothesis that differential changes in daily rhythms within some extra-SCN brain regions might mediate the changes in the temporal organization of several behavioral and endocrine functions that occur during the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - The adrenal cortex synthesizes many steroids, but the mineralocorticoid aldosterone and the glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosteroid have been viewed as the principal steroids responsible for regulation of renal electrolyte excretion. A study by Elabida et al. challenges that paradigm and suggests that progesterone, classically viewed as a sex steroid, also participates in renal electrolyte balance. © 2011 International Society of Nephrology.

AB  - Nuclear receptor signalling is essential for physiological processes such as metabolism, development, and reproduction. Alterations in the endocrine state that naturally occur during pregnancy result in maternal adaptations to support the feto-placental unit. A series of studies have shown that nuclear receptor signalling is involved in maternal adaptations of bile acid, cholesterol, and lipid homeostasis pathways to ensure maintenance of the nutritional demands of the fetus. We discuss regulation of hepatic nuclear receptors and their target genes in pregnancy and their impact on the development of disorders such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and oestrogen-induced hepatotoxicity.

AB  - Aims & Objective: To find out the circadian pattern of blood pressure in normotensive pregnant women and in women with preeclampsia. Method: A cross-sectional prospective observational case control study. Blood pressure was sampled in thirty-five normotensive pregnant women (control) and thirty five preeclamptic women (study group) by using non-invasive automatic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring machine for 72 h. Results: Blood pressure (BP) was not constant over 24 h period and it oscillated from time to time in control group. BP was maximum during early part of afternoon. However, in preeclampsia besides quantitative increase in BP, circadian BP oscillations were less pronounced and in around 50% subjects BP was maximum during evening and night hours. Conclusion: Both systolic and diastolic BP showed definite reproducible circadian pattern in both preeclamptic and normotensive pregnant women. This pattern both quantitatively and qualitatively was different in preeclamptic women. Standardized 24 h BP monitoring allows quantitative and qualitative evaluation of hypertensive status and is important for timing and dosing of antihypertensive medications. © 2011 Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI).

AB  - Purpose of Review: Cushing's syndrome results from prolonged and inappropriately high exposure of tissues to glucocorticoids. Biochemical tests are always needed to confirm the clinical suspicion: these include measurement of excess total endogenous cortisol secretion assessed by 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC), loss of the normal feedback of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis assessed by suppressibility after dexamethasone testing, and disturbance of the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion assessed by midnight serum or salivary cortisol. This review focuses on recent data emerging on the value of UFC as a screening test for Cushing's syndrome. Recent Findings: Considerable evidence has emerged regarding the utility of UFC in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome because of its long-term use in clinical practice. Despite the fact that UFC assesses the active (free) component of cortisol, the methodological difficulties in 24-h urine collection and in assay precision have rendered this screening technique increasingly unpopular. Furthermore, the increased prevalence of mild, preclinical or cyclic Cushing's syndrome along with the fact that cortisol is not uniformly secreted during the day do not support its use as a screening test, although strikingly high levels can be useful. Summary: Since the sensitivity and specificity of UFC are less than ideal when compared with other diagnostic modalities, we suggest the use of other more novel tests as first-step diagnostic tests to screen for hypercortisolaemia. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - In this study, the relationship between sleep quality and type and duration of labour has been evaluated. A total of 88 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire three times during their last 3 weeks of pregnancy at their prenatal visits and once postpartum. A mean score of >5 was considered as poor-quality sleep. Duration of labour, type of delivery and weight of the newborn at delivery was considered. Of the study population, 56.2% were categorised as the good-quality sleep group and 43.8% as the poor-quality sleep group. The reported sleeping time per day was 8.47 ± 1.86 hours for the good-quality sleep group and 6.45 ± 2.07 hours for the poor-quality sleep group. The poor-quality sleep women were 20% more likely to undergo caesarean section and had a longer labour duration. Gestational age at delivery and mean gravidity was respectively 38.53 ± 1.17 weeks and 1.91 ± 1.03 in the good-quality sleep group and 38.36 ± 1.59 weeks and 1.86 ± 1.07 in the poor-quality sleep group. Thus, it was found that women with sleep problems experience longer labour duration and are more likely to undergo a caesarean section. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with blunted stress responsivity within the extrauterine environment. This study investigated the association between PCE and diurnal salivary cortisol levels in preadolescent children characterized by high biological and/or social risk (n = 725). Saliva samples were collected at their home. Analyses revealed no group differences in basal evening or morning cortisol levels; however, children with higher degrees of PCE exhibited blunted overnight increases in cortisol, controlling for additional risk factors. Race and caregiver depression were also associated with diurnal cortisol patterns. Although repeated PCE may contribute to alterations in the normal or expected stress response later in life, sociodemographic and environmental factors are likewise important in understanding hormone physiology, especially as more time elapses from the PCE. Anticipating the potential long-term medical, developmental, or behavioral effects of an altered ability to mount a normal protective cortisol stress response is essential in optimizing the outcomes of children with PCE.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained. Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values ≤ .05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values ≤ .05). Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms. Depression and Anxiety, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography, we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: In this single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward. Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as a respiratory disturbance index ≥ 5) in the gestational hypertension and healthy groups. Results: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). Interpretation: Women with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB than do healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be determined.

AB  - Late preterm infants, born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation, have significantly higher morbidity than neonates born at full term, which may be partly related to reduced sensitivity of the arterial baroreflex. The present study assessed baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in near-term fetal sheep at 123 ± 1 days gestation. At this age, although fetuses are not fully mature in some respects (term is 147 days), sleep-state cycling is established [between high-voltage, low-frequency (HV) and low-voltage, high-frequency (LV) sleep], and neural myelination is similar to the term human infant. Fetal sheep were instrumented to record blood pressure (BP), HR (n= 15) and RSNA (n= 5). Blood pressure was manipulated using vasoactive drugs, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. In both HV and LV sleep, phenylephrine was associated with increased arterial BP and decreased HR. In HV sleep, phenylephrine was associated with a fall in RSNA, from 124 ± 14 to 58 ± 11% (P< 0.05), but no significant change in RSNA in LV sleep. In contrast, the fall in BP after sodium nitroprusside was associated with a significant increase in HR during LV but not HV sleep, and there was no significant effect of hypotension on RSNA. These data demonstrate that in near-term fetal sheep baroreflex activity is only partly active and is highly modulated by sleep state. Critically, there was no RSNA response to marked hypotension; this finding has implications for the ability of the late preterm fetus to adapt to low BP. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Aim: There is uncertainty about the best method of withdrawing supplemental oxygen in babies with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD). Some authors advocate withdrawal of oxygen in the day, but continuing supplementation during sleep, based on early work suggesting that oxygen saturations are lower during sleep, which did not accord with our clinical impression. We re-examined the hypothesis that babies have lower saturations while asleep. Methods: We studied infants with CNLD during the day, while awake and asleep. We recorded video with simultaneous real-time capture of oxygen saturation (SpO 2), heart rate and plethysmographic waveform from pulse oximetry. Behavioural state was scored using observation and video and classified as awake (feeding, active or quiet) or sleep. Results: Thirteen infants had analysable data, although one had strikingly lower SpO 2 values while awake and was excluded from analysis. The infants had a median gestation of 26 weeks and were studied at a median (range) postmenstrual age of 66 (37-130) weeks, for 229 (89-330) min. Mean SpO 2 was 97.6% during sleep and 97.0% awake (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Babies with CNLD have lower oxygen saturation while awake. There is no physiological justification for increasing oxygen during sleep, or withdrawing selectively during the daytime, although larger studies are needed to confirm this finding. © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta Pædiatrica.

AB  - Non-technical summary: Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are commonly given to women at risk of preterm labour. While they significantly improve survival of the prematurely born infant, their effects on preterm brain activity is surprisingly unclear. We found that, in sheep, a conventional clinical course of maternal dexamethasone treatment was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity of the fetal EEG. This activity reflected a striking shift to less-frequent but higher amplitude EEG waveforms, and unexpectedly, EEG waveforms whose duration and pattern were highly consistent with seizure activity. After resolution of hyperactivity, the EEG showed changes consistent with maturation of sleep architecture, and reassuringly there was no histological evidence of brain injury 5 days after first exposure. The long-term implications are uncertain, but these effects may contribute to improved neonatal outcomes. Maternal treatment with synthetic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DEX) significantly reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality, but its effects on the fetal brain remain unclear. In this study we evaluated the effects of DEX on EEG activity in preterm fetal sheep. Ewes at 103 days gestation received two intramuscular injections of DEX (12 mg, n= 8) or saline vehicle (n= 7) 24 h apart. Fetal EEG activity was recorded from 6 h before until 120 h after the first injection (DEX-1). DEX-1 was associated with a marked transient rise in total EEG power, maximal at 12 h (P < 0.001), with a relative increase in delta and reduced theta, alpha and beta activity, resolving by 24 h. Continuous EEG records showed a shift to larger but less frequent transient waveforms (P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, evolving epileptiform activity, consistent with electrographic and clinical seizures, developed from 178 ± 44 min after DEX-1. Similar but smaller changes were seen after the second injection. Following the injections, total power returned to control values, but the proportion of alpha activity progressively increased vs. controls (P < 0.001), with reduced interburst interval duration and number (P < 0.001). No histological neural injury or microglial activation was seen. In summary, exposure to maternal dexamethasone was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity on fetal cortical EEG recordings, followed by sustained changes consistent with maturation of fetal sleep architecture. We postulate that these effects may contribute to improved neonatal outcomes. © 2011 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2011 The Physiological Society.

AB  - Pregnancy is the time during which physiological and psychological preparation for motherhood takes place. It has long been considered a blessed time, free of psychiatric disorders. However, there is now strong evidence that major depressive disorder may occur not only after birth but even during the prepartum. Most often, mental illness during this period is underestimated, not assessed, therefore not diagnosed, and consequently goes untreated. Reviewing the literature on the negative impact of both maternal and infant health in case of perinatal depression, we underline that recognizing and treating prenatal depression will lead to preventive and curative treatments for mothers, enhance infant health, and therefore positively influence mother-infant relationships.

AB  - The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) Prozac® (fluoxetine) is widely prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety-related disorders. While extensive research has established that fluoxetine is safe for adults, safety is not guaranteed for (unborn) children and adolescents. Some clinical studies have reported adverse outcomes, such as premature birth, neonatal cardiovascular abnormalities, and pulmonary hypertension in children whose mothers used SSRIs during pregnancy. In addition, several reports show that adolescent fluoxetine treatment increases risk for suicidal behavior. Despite these studies, fluoxetine is not contraindicated in the treatment of depressed pregnant women and adolescents. Longitudinal research in humans is limited because of ethical reasons and time constraints, and to overcome these limitations, rodents are used to increase insight in the age-dependent effects of fluoxetine exposure. It has been established that neonatal and adolescent fluoxetine exposure leads to paradoxical anxiety- and depression-like features in later life of rats and mice, although in some studies adolescent fluoxetine exposure was without effects. These age-dependent outcomes of fluoxetine may be explained by serotonin's neurotrophic effects, which may vary according to the developmental stage of the brain due to epigenetic modifications. Here we review the existing evidence for the age-dependent effects of fluoxetine in humans and rodents, address the gaps in our current knowledge and propose directions for future research. Given the overlap between human and rodent findings, rodents provide heuristic value in further research on the age-dependent effects of SSRIs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of vigilance and regulation of motor activity but their hyperactivity may contribute to anxiety disorders. Using a rat model, we tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE. Male rat pups received 2.625. g/kg of alcohol (AE group) intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD12-14, they received daily injections of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20. mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V) during the lights-off period. On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test. On PD17, their motor activity was monitored in a novel environment. The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest HR latency were higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE-V than in S-V rats (p=0.0009-0.03). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE-SB and either S-SB or S-V rats. Motor activity in AE-V rats was significantly higher than in S-V (p=0.003), S-SB (p=0.007) or AE-SB (p=0.02) rats, with no difference between S-SB and AE-SB group. Our findings suggest that excessive activity of ORX neurons contributes to motor hyperactivity and impaired HR acquisition following perinatal AE and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the early 90s a striking rise in deformational plagiocephaly (DP) has been reported, and a causal link between the "back to sleep" position recommended to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Recent data suggested that supine position is a risk factor only when combined with other environmental factors. Objective: To evaluate the impact of early intervention in the newborn environment on the prevalence of DP at 4. months of life. Methods: A multicentric, prospective, controlled study in healthy term neonates. Within 72. h of birth, all parents received the usual recommendations for positioning their infants to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. In the Intervention group, recommendations were also given to encourage spontaneous and unhindered physical movement. At 1, 2 and 4. months, we looked for plagiocephaly and collected information on the infants' environment. Results: The environment of the Intervention group (n = 88) was significantly more favorable to unhindered movement than in the control group (n = 51) (lower immobility score, p < 0.01). The prevalence of DP was significantly lower in the Intervention group than in the control group (13% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). For each supplementary hour of immobility during the third and fourth months of life, the risk of DP at four months doubled (OR:2.1[1.4-3.2]). Conclusion: Early postnatal intervention on the maternity ward reduces the prevalence of DP. The recent rise in the incidence of DP could be related to a lack of stimulation and encouragement to physical movement rather than to supine positioning proposed for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by excellent response to treatment, if diagnosed correctly. Lifestyle advice is an integral part of the treatment of JME; it should include recommendations on avoidance of common triggers such as sleep deprivation and alcohol excess and emphasis on the importance of compliance with medication. The drug of first choice in the treatment of JME is sodium valproate, which has a response rate of up to 80%. Valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age because of significantly increased risks of fetal malformations and neurodevelopmental delay. Levetiracetam or lamotrigine are alternative first-line options if valproate is contraindicated. With limited data from trials to support either of these drugs, the choice should take into account comorbidity factors and patient priorities. Because of its low side effect profile, excellent tolerability, and lack of interactions with other drugs, levetiracetam is our preferred alternative first-line agent. Lamotrigine is another first-line option but may exacerbate myoclonus. The failure of valproate or failure of two first-line antiepileptic drugs suggests that combination therapy is indicated. Drug interactions and the patient's gender, age, and comorbidities need to be considered. Levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and valproate are suitable adjuncts, with a synergistic effect reported from the combination of valproate and lamotrigine. Clonazepam is a useful adjunct for myoclonus and can be used in combination with lamotrigine to avoid lamotrigine's myoclonic effects. In women of childbearing potential, valproate should be considered if levetiracetam and lamotrigine have failed to control seizures at this stage. Topiramate is a cost-effective alternative monotherapy, but because of its poor tolerability, we recommend it as add-on treatment only. Zonisamide should remain a second-line adjunct in the treatment of JME, owing to the lack of supportive data. Phenobarbital is the most cost-effective drug and can be used to control the seizures of JME when antiepileptic drugs are limited or too costly. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin can exacerbate absences and myoclonus and are therefore contraindicated, although they can improve control of tonic-clonic seizures when these are refractory to other medication. Gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are contraindicated and can worsen seizures. (Tiagabine and vigabatrin have been reported to induce absence status epilepticus.) Surgical alternatives in refractory cases are rarely contemplated but may include vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy. Deep brain stimulation is an experimental technique that may prove useful in managing refractory cases of JME. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Context. Mining operations conducted at high altitudes provide health challenges for workers as well as for medical personnel. Objective. To review the literature regarding adverse health effects and toxic exposures that may be associated with mining operations conducted at altitude and to discuss pre-placement screening, acclimatization issues, and on-site surveillance strategies. Methods. We used the Ovid (http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) search engine to conduct a MEDLINE search for "coal mining" or "mining" and "altitude sickness" or "altitude" and a second MEDLINE search for "occupational diseases" and "altitude sickness" or "altitude." The search identified 97 articles of which 76 were relevant. In addition, the references of these 76 articles were manually reviewed for relevant articles. Cardiovascular effects. High altitude is associated with increased sympathetic tone that may result in elevated blood pressure, particularly in workers with pre-existing hypertension. Workers with a history of coronary artery disease experience ischemia at lower work rates at high altitude, while those with a history of congestive heart failure have decreased exercise tolerance at high altitude as compared to healthy controls and are at higher risk of suffering an exacerbation of their heart failure. Pulmonary effects. High altitude is associated with various adverse pulmonary effects, including high-altitude pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, subacute mountain sickness, and chronic mountain sickness. Mining at altitude has been reported to accelerate silicosis and other pneumoconioses. Miners with pre-existing pneumoconioses may experience an exacerbation of their condition at altitude. Persons traveling to high altitude have a higher incidence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration while sleeping than do persons native to high altitude. Obesity increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension, acute mountain sickness, and sleep-disordered breathing. Neurological effects. The most common adverse neurological effect of high altitude is acute mountain sickness, while the most severe adverse neurological effect is high-altitude cerebral edema. Poor sleep quality and sleep-disordered breathing may contribute to daytime sleepiness and impaired cognitive performance that could potentially result in workplace injuries, particularly in miners who are already at increased risk of suffering unintentional workplace injuries. Ophthalmological effects. Adverse ophthalmological effects include increased exposure to ultraviolet light and xerophthalmia, which may be further exacerbated by occupational dust exposure. Renal effects. High altitude is associated with a protective effect in patients with renal disease, although it is unknown how this would affect miners with a history of chronic renal disease from exposure to silica and other renal toxicants. Hematological effects. Advanced age increases the risk of erythrocytosis and chronic mountain sickness in miners. Thrombotic and thromboembolic events are also more common at high altitude. Musculoskeletal effects. Miners are at increased risk for low back pain due to occupational factors, and the easy fatigue at altitude has been reported to further predispose workers to this disorder. Toxic exposures. Diesel emissions at altitude contain more carbon monoxide due to increased incomplete combustion of fuel. In addition, a given partial pressure of carbon monoxide at altitude will result in a larger percentage of carboxyhemoglobin at altitude. Miners with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be at higher risk for morbidity from exposure to diesel exhaust at altitude. Conclusions. Both mining and work at altitude have independently been associated with a number of adverse health effects, although the combined effect of mining activities and high altitude has not been adequately studied. Careful selection of workers, appropriate acclimatization, and limited on-site surveillance can help control most health risks. Further research is necessary to more completely understand the risks of mining at altitude and delineate what characteristics of potential employees put them at risk for altitude-related morbidity or mortality. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - We have studied the maturation of electrocortical (ECoG) activity in fetal sheep and the impact of chronic hypoxemia using a growth restriction model with placental embolizations. Twenty chronically catheterized fetal sheep (control, n = 9; hypoxemic, n = 11) were monitored at 116-119, 121-126 and 128-134 days gestational age (term = 145 days), with ECoG activity scored using automated analysis of amplitude and frequency components to distinguish low-voltage/high frequency (LV/HF) and high-voltage/low frequency (HV/LF) state epochs, along with indeterminate voltage/frequency (IV/F) and transition period activities. We have shown that multiple aspects of ECoG state activity in the ovine fetus undergo maturational change as electrophysiologic measures of brain development. With chronic fetal hypoxemia, some maturational changes continue to occur, i.e. ECoG activity amplitude and 95% SEF, indicating the resiliency of these parameters to adverse conditioning. However, some maturational changes were altered, i.e. LV/HF and HV/LF incidence and duration, and likely regulated and adaptive with a decrease in the brain's nonessential energy needs, while some were altered, i.e. IV/F incidence and duration, and state transition times, and likely indicating a degree of aberrant development in associated control circuitries. This may then have consequences for disturbed sleep-wake patterns during later life and for adverse neurologic sequelae known to be increased in humans born with growth restriction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Study Objectives: To evaluate the success rate of adding continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (EFM) during full night polysomnography (PSG), in women with both gestational hypertension (GH) with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. Method: As part of a larger study evaluating for the presence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in women with GH compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies, continuous EFM was added to usual polysomnography. Results: Forty-eight EFM studies (26 with GH and 22 with uncomplicated pregnancies) were evaluated. EFM studies were categorized by the percentage of time that inter-prétable tracings were obtained: < 25% of the time; 25-50% of the time; or > 50% of the time. We deemed > 50% of the time to be ideal, but under the test conditions 25-50% of the time to be acceptable. For women with GH, 71% of women had ideal or accept-able overnight EFM tracings compared to 82% for women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Of those women who were diagnosed with SDB, 77% had an acceptable or ideal EFM tracing. Conclusions: Adding EFM to conventional polysomnography is feasible and safe. It may prove an important adjunct as interest in sleep disorders of pregnancy continues to expand.

AB  - Malaria is one of the most prevalent and devastating infectious diseases of our time. Yet, unfortunately, apart from artemisinin combination therapies there are relatively few effective treatments for Plasmodium falciparum and only one treatment for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax. Novel classes of antimalarial medicines are urgently needed given the long-term inevitability of resistance to current therapies and the need for drugs that are well tolerated by all. This review summarises the antimalarials developed and registered thus far, as well as describing some of the new small molecule therapy approaches being developed as a contribution towards the malaria eradication agenda. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is now a pandemic and shows no signs of abatement. In this Seminar we review the pathophysiology of this disorder, with particular attention to epidemiology, genetics, epigenetics, and molecular cell biology. Evidence is emerging that a substantial part of diabetes susceptibility is acquired early in life, probably owing to fetal or neonatal programming via epigenetic phenomena. Maternal and early childhood health might, therefore, be crucial to the development of effective prevention strategies. Diabetes develops because of inadequate islet β-cell and adipose-tissue responses to chronic fuel excess, which results in so-called nutrient spillover, insulin resistance, and metabolic stress. The latter damages multiple organs. Insulin resistance, while forcing β cells to work harder, might also have an important defensive role against nutrient-related toxic effects in tissues such as the heart. Reversal of overnutrition, healing of the β cells, and lessening of adipose tissue defects should be treatment priorities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Relationship between respiratory morbidity and influenza virus has been well-documented in infants, whatever their age. However, in spite of severe cardiac and respiratory events of central origin, autonomic dysfunction potentially induced by this virus is poorly understood. We thus explored the autonomic nervous system (ANS) profile of infected infants during the 2009 pandemic influenza disease. Method: A group of 10 consecutive infants (5 &lt; 1. year and 5 &gt; 1. year) presenting with nvH1N1 infection was evaluated with heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous baroreflex (SBR) through a recording during a 15-minute period of quiet sleep as well as 24. h holter monitoring. The same recordings were performed in 10 control subjects, paired for gestational and postnatal age. HRV sympathetic and parasympathetic (VLF, LF and HF) indices were obtained using spectral-domain analysis, and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (SBR) using simultaneous non-invasive continuous measure of arterial pressure and heart rate. Results: The group of infants less than 1year had similar value as control group. Conversely, the group of infants more than 1year showed significant lower spectral total power values (Ptot: 3347 vs. 5926ms 2/Hz, p&lt;0.1) and significant lower VLF, LF and HF indices (all p&lt;0.05) than the control group. Conclusion: nvH1N1 infection in child could be associated with severe central autonomic dysfunction. Due to potential severe consequences, a systematic evaluation of autonomic regulation should be performed in order to avoid dramatic events. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Functional impairment of the adult brain can result from deficits in the ontogeny of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Gene defects underlying autism spectrum disorders, Rett's syndrome or some forms of epilepsy, but also a diverse set of syndromes accompanying perinatal trauma, hormonal imbalances, intake of sleep-inducing or mood-improving drugs or, quite common, alcohol intake during pregnancy can alter GABA signaling early in life.The search for therapeutically relevant endogenous molecules or exogenous compounds able to alleviate the consequences of dysfunction of GABAergic transmission in the embryonic or postnatal brain requires a clear understanding of its site- and state-dependent development. At the level of single synapses, it is necessary to discriminate between presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations, and to define parameters that can be regarded as both suitable and accessible for the quantification of developmental changes. Here we focus on the performance of GABAergic synapses in two brain structures, the hippocampus and the superior colliculus, describe some novel aspects of neurotrophin effects during the development of GABAergic synaptic transmission and examine the applicability of the following rules: (1) synaptic transmission starts with GABA, (2) nascent/immature GABAergic synapses operate in a ballistic mode (multivesicular release), (3) immature synaptic terminals release vesicles with higher probability than mature synapses, (4) immature GABAergic synapses are prone to paired pulse and tetanic depression, (5) synapse maturation is characterized by an increasing dominance of synchronous over asynchronous release, (6) in immature neurons GABA acts as a depolarizing transmitter, (7) synapse maturation implies inhibitory postsynaptic current shortening due to an increase in alpha1 subunit expression, (8) extrasynaptic (tonic) conductances can inhibit the development of synaptic (phasic) GABA actions.

AB  - Objective:Several lines of evidence indicate that nutrient restriction during perinatal development sensitizes the offspring to the development of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in adulthood via the programming of hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. Given the link between the circadian clock and energy metabolism, and the resetting action of food on the circadian clock, in this study, we have investigated whether perinatal undernutrition affects the circadian expression rhythms of genes regulating food intake in the hypothalamus and energy metabolism in the liver.Design:Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ad libitum either a control (20% protein) or a low-protein (8% protein) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, pups received a standard diet and at 17 and 35 days of age, their daily patterns of gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR experiments.Results:17-day-old pups exposed to perinatal undernutrition exhibited significant alterations in the circadian expression profile of the transcripts encoding diverse genes regulating food intake, the metabolic enzymes fatty acid synthase and glucokinase as well as the clock genes BMAL1 and Period1. These effects persisted after weaning, were associated with hyperphagia and mirrored the results of the behavioral analysis of feeding. Thus, perinatally undernourished rats exhibited an increased hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic peptides agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y. Conversely, the mRNA levels of the anorexigenic peptides pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine and amphetamine-related transcripts were decreased.Conclusion:These observations indicate that the circadian clock undergoes nutritional programming. The programming of the circadian clock may contribute to the alterations in feeding and energy metabolism associated with malnutrition in early life, which might promote the development of metabolic disorders in adulthood. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - To support the well-being of the parent-infant relationship, the neuromolecular mechanisms of parental behaviors should be clarified. From neuroanatomical analyses in laboratory rats, the medial preoptic area (MPOA) has been shown to be of critical importance in parental retrieving behavior. More recently, various gene-targeted mouse strains have been found to be defective in different aspects of parental behaviors, contributing to the identification of molecules and signaling pathways required for the behavior. Therefore, the neuromolecular basis of "mother love" is now a fully approachable research field in modern molecular neuroscience. In this review, we will provide a summary of the required brain areas and gene for parental behavior in laboratory mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus). Basic protocols and technical considerations on studying the mechanism of parental behavior using genetically-engineered mouse strains will also be presented. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Approximately one-quarter of circulating cobalamin (vitamin B-12) binds to transcobalamin (holoTC) and is thereby available for the cells of the body. For this reason, holoTC is also referred to as active vitamin B-12. HoloTC was suggested as an optimal marker of early vitamin B-12 deficiency >20 y ago. This suggestion led to the development of suitable assays for measurement of the compound and clinical studies that aimed to show the benefit of measurement of holoTC rather than of vitamin B-12. Today holoTC can be analyzed by 3 methods: direct measurement of the complex between transcobalamin and vitamin B-12, measurement of vitamin B-12 attached to transcobalamin, or measurement of the amount of transcobalamin saturated with vitamin B-12. These 3 methods give similar results, but direct measurement of holoTC complex is preferable in the clinical setting from a practical point of view. HoloTC measurement has proven useful for the identification of the few patients who suffer from transcobalamin deficiency. In addition, holoTC is part of the CobaSorb test and therefore useful for assessment of vitamin B-12 absorption. Clinical studies that compare the ability of holoTC and vitamin B-12 to identify individuals with vitamin B-12 deficiency (elevated concentration of methylmalonic acid) suggest that holoTC performs better than total vitamin B-12. To date, holoTC has not been used for population-based assessments of vitamin B-12 status, but we suggest that holoTC is a better marker than total vitamin B-12 for such studies. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - Aim: To determine the possible risk factors for inadequate gestational weight gain. Methods: A population-based cohort study was carried out in Sri Lanka from May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or before 16 weeks' gestation and followed up until delivery; the sample size was 710. Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were gathered on average at the 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. Maternal weight was measured at the first antenatal clinic visit and at delivery. Inadequate weight gain was defined as weight gain below the Institute of Medicine recommendations in 2009. Multiple logistic regression was applied and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: The risk factors for inadequate weight gain were low per-capita monthly income (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03, 2.58), multiparity (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.34, 2.87), sleeping <8 h/day during the second, third, or both second and third trimesters (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05, 2.46), standing and walking ≥5 h/day during the second trimester (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.15), and the newborn being of the male sex (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.16), controlling for the effect of body mass index and gestational age. Conclusions: Risk factors for inadequate gestational weight gain were low income, being multiparous, sleep deprivation, physical activity in terms of standing and walking, and the male sex of baby. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the association of short sleep duration among women in the first year postpartum with inflammation at 3 years postpartum. We studied 479 women in Project Viva, a prospective cohort. At 6 months and 1 year postpartum, women reported the number of hours they slept in a 24-hour period, from which we calculated a weighted average of daily sleep. We used multivariable median regression analyses to predict the independent effects of short sleep duration (≤5 vs >5 h/d) on markers of inflammation, for example, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein at 3 years postpartum. Women's mean (SD) hours of daily sleep in the first year postpartum was 6.7 (0.96) hours. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, excessive gestational weight gain, and gestational age at delivery, we found that postpartum sleep ≤5 h/d was associated with elevated IL-6 (β, 0.25 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.43) compared with >5 h/d. Although postpartum sleep ≤5 h/d appeared to also be associated with elevated C-reactive protein (β 0.15 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, -0.08 to 0.52), these results did not reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration in the first year postpartum is associated with elevated levels of the proinflammatory marker, IL-6, at 3 years postpartum. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insomnia, defined as difficulty in falling asleep and/or staying asleep, short sleep duration, or poor quality sleep, is a common sleep disorder affecting 30-40% of adult population. We have conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test if anesthesia is therapeutically beneficial in patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. We have assessed the efficacy and safety of propofol-induced sleep in these patients. This study comprised of 103 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia (including 59 non-pregnant, non-lactating women; 28-60 years) and the participants were randomized to receive either physiological saline (placebo) (n = 39) or 3. 0 g/l propofol (n = 64) in a 2-h continuous intravenous infusion for five consecutive nights. The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire was used for the subjective assessment of sleep, and polysomnography was used for the objective measurement of sleep architecture and patterns. The assessments were done prior to and at the end of the 5-day treatment and 6 months after treatment period. The adverse effects of the treatment were also recorded. A 2-h continuous intravenous infusion of 3. 0 g/l propofol for five consecutive nights improved the subjective and objective assessments of sleep in 64 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. This improvement occurred immediately after the therapy and persisted for 6 months. No serious adverse events were noticed during the period of drug administration or 6 months after the treatment. Propofol therapy is an efficacious and safe choice for restoring normal sleep in patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This prospective study examined the relationship between maternal prenatal representations of the infant and later infant-mother attachment, including contextual factors related to concordance and discordance among dyads over time. Participants were 173 pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 40 who were interviewed during their last trimester of pregnancy and 2 and 13 months after birth. Maternal representations were assessed by the Working Model of the Child Interview during pregnancy (WMCI; C.H. Zeanah, D. Benoit, L. Hirshberg, M.L. Barton, &amp; C. Regan, 1994), and infant-mother attachment was assessed through the Strange Situation procedure (M.D.S. Ainsworth, M. Blehar, E. Waters, &amp; S. Wall, 1978) when infants were 13 months old. There was substantial discordance between maternal and infant classifications, although a significant concordance rate was found when classifications were collapsed into balanced/secure and nonbalanced/insecure groups based on prenatal representations and postnatal infant attachment groups (60%; χ2 = 6.90, p &lt; .01; κ .20). As expected, discordance between maternal representations and infant-mother attachment was meaningfully related to contextual risk factors, maternal depression, and infant behaviors. © 2011 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - Approximately 15% of patients with endometrial cancer are premenopausal. Previous studies largely support the conservative treatment of endometrial cancer in women desiring future fertility. From these studies, 75% to 80% of patients demonstrate a complete response to progestin therapy and the average recurrence rate is 30% to 35%. Conservative therapy should be reserved for women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade I tumors. Before conservative management, patients should be informed of the elevated risk (11%-29%) of concurrent ovarian cancer in cases of premenopausal endometrial cancer, and screening and ongoing surveillance during the treatment period is mandatory. A suggestion of myometrial invasion or metastatic disease is a contraindication to conservative management. Individuals meeting criteria for Lynch syndrome testing should be referred to genetic counseling. Fertility treatment should be individualized, and close surveillance is required during treatment. Staging hysterectomy is recommended after the completion of the childbearing period. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After participating in this activity, physicians should be better able to select appropriate candidates with endometrial cancer for fertility-sparing treatment. Educate patients with endometrial cancer regarding the risks and benefits of standard of care therapy and conservative therapy and screen appropriate patients for lynch syndrome. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Pemphigus is a chronic epidermal immunobullous disease with potentially fatal outcome. The journey of literature on pemphigus in India has come a long way in last five decades. Pemphigus in Indian patients has unique genetic, clinical, and epidemiological differences from those in the Western countries. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment for pemphigus. Dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse therapy has revolutionized the management of pemphigus in India and abroad for nearly 3 decades now. Corticosteroid-based treatment, along with adjuvants, has significantly brought down the high mortality rates that had been observed in precorticosteroid era. Present day research is largely based on elucidating the pathogenesis beyond the antidesmoglein antibodies, and newer diagnostic and treatment approaches. In this article, we review various aspects of literature on pemphigus in India, on Indians abroad, or literature from other countries that are considered relevant to the topic.

AB  - Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the UK, yet about 80% of strokes are preventable. Factors that are known to increase the risk of stroke include age, gender, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes and cigarette smoking. Broadly, a stroke can be classified as either ischaemic (caused by a thrombus) or haemorrhagic (caused by the rupture of blood vessels). Stroke is a medical emergency and the sooner that it is diagnosed and treated the better the outcome.

AB  - The newborn infant is prone to motor phenomena of various physiological mechanisms and pathological significance whereas they can share close clinical patterns. A detailed clinical analysis, that should be supported by a video EEG recording, is necessary. That may help to distinguish myoclonus, jitteriness or seizures. Some rare phenomenom such as hyperekplexia or myotonia have also to be known. The pregnancy and birth history, the clinical examination and the search for association of various motor phenomena give essential clues for the diagnosis. Misdiagnosing non epileptic phenomona as seizures has to be avoided as it leads to unnecessary anticonvulsivant therapy with potential harmful effects. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Purpose: Although African American women are more likely than white women to undergo hysterectomy, there are few data describing their symptoms before and after surgery. This report compares reported symptoms in white and African American women before and 1-year after having a hysterectomy with at least one ovary retained. Methods: Using data from a prospective cohort study, we compared self-reported symptoms at baseline and 1-year follow-up among 382 women undergoing hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy (197 African American and 185 white) and 448 controls (199 African American and 249 white). Symptoms were assessed using an 11-item scale with questions on somatic, psychologic, and urogenital symptoms. Results: Women undergoing hysterectomy had more severe symptom scores before surgery than controls, but no significant racial differences were found. At follow-up, total scores for women with hysterectomies were comparable to those of control women, but some differences were observed within individual domains. Urogenital scores were worse for women with hysterectomies for both African American and white women. African American women with hysterectomies had better scores in the psychologic domain than either controls or white women with hysterectomies. Conclusions: African American women, despite having such characteristics as larger uterine weight and lower hemoglobin that might suggest they would have more severe symptoms, had scores that were no worse than white women both before and after hysterectomy.

AB  - Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance among pregnant women. Human epidemiological and animal studies have found that prenatal cannabis exposure influences brain development and can have long-lasting impacts on cognitive functions. Exploration of the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicines and synthetic cannabinoid compounds has given us much insight into the physiological roles of endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) and their receptors. In this article, we examine human longitudinal cohort studies that document the long-term influence of prenatal exposure to cannabis, followed by an overview of the molecular composition of the endocannabinoid system and the temporal and spatial changes in their expression during brain development. How endocannabinoid signaling modulates fundamental developmental processes such as cell proliferation, neurogenesis, migration and axonal pathfinding are also summarized. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - The caudal serotonergic (5-HT) system is a critical component of a medullary " hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hyperthermia. We define anatomically the caudal 5-HT system in the human medulla as 5-HT neuronal cell bodies located in the raphé (raphé obscurus, raphé magnus, and raphé pallidus), extra-raphé (gigantocellularis, paragigantocellularis lateralis, intermediate reticular zone, lateral reticular nucleus, and nucleus subtrigeminalis), and ventral surface (arcuate nucleus). These 5-HT neurons are adjacent to all of the respiratory- and autonomic-related nuclei in the medulla where they are positioned to modulate directly the responses of these effector nuclei. In the following review, we highlight the topography and development of the caudal 5-HT system in the human fetus and infant, and its inter-relationships with nicotinic, GABAergic, and cytokine receptors. We also summarize pediatric disorders in early life which we term " developmental serotonopathies" of the caudal (as well as rostral) 5-HT domain and which are associated with homeostatic imbalances. The delineation of the development and organization of the human caudal 5-HT system provides the critical foundation for the neuropathologic elucidation of its disorders directly in the human brain. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether snoring, sleep position, and other sleep practices in pregnant women are associated with risk of late stillbirth. Design: Prospective population based case-control study. Setting Auckland, New Zealand Participants: Cases: 155 women with a singleton late stillbirth (≥28 weeks' gestation) without congenital abnormality born between July 2006 and June 2009 and booked to deliver in Auckland. Controls: 310 women with single ongoing pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the stillbirth occurred. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors. Main outcome measure: Maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep position at the time of going to sleep and on waking (left side, right side, back, and other). Results: The prevalence of late stillbirth in this study was 3.09/1000 births. No relation was found between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the previous night (before stillbirth or interview) were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who slept on their left side (adjusted odds ratio for back sleeping 2.54 (95% CI 1.04 to 6.18), and for right side sleeping 1.74 (0.98 to 3.01)). The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their left was 1.96/1000 and was 3.93/1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their left. Women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who got up more frequently (adjusted odds ratio 2.28 (1.40 to 3.71)). Women who regularly slept during the day in the previous month were also more likely to experience a late stillbirth than those who did not (2.04 (1.26 to 3.27)). Conclusions: This is the first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for stillbirth, and these findings require urgent confirmation in further studies.

AB  - Circadian activity patterns of three giant pandas were monitored using GPS collars equipped with dual-axis activity sensors during the spring umbrella bamboo growing season in Wolong Nature Reserve. We summarized activity rate (% of time active) and level (horizontal direction/ vertical direction ranging from 0 to 255) across different times of day and across individuals and compared activity level to both solar radiation and air temperature. The results showed that the mean activity rate of the pandas was 68.05%. Activity rate (70.86%) and level of the pregnant panda (23.82±0.30/ 17.63±0.22) was higher than the other two (70.55%, 14.71±0.17/ 13.52±0.15 and 62.76%, 17.74±0.23/ 13.61± 0.18). There were three activity peaks at 6:00-7:00, 18:00-21:00 and 23:00-3:00, and a marked rest period at 9:00-12:00. Activity rate (68.32%) and level during the day (19.59±0.20/ 15.45±0.15) was higher than in the night (67.67%, 17.63±0.19/ 14.21±0.15). The effect of solar radiation was significantly negatively and linearly related to the daily activity level of the study pandas (r = -0.822, P<0.001), however, the air temperature was not linearly related to circadian activity level.

AB  - In Finland every fourth young adult (25 to 34 years of age) has experience with the use of cannabis and in younger people (15 to 24 years) about 10% have used it during the previous year. The majority (about 90%) neither becomes addicted nor develops significant psychiatric symptoms, but in some individuals regular cannabis-use can cause a variety of problems (health, emotional, behavioural, social, legal). If problems have not yet developed or are still minor, patient's cannabis-use may be addressed by brief intervention in a primary care setting. Also, treatment of uncomplicated cannabis withdrawal as well as of minor symptoms from smoking (bronchitis, sleep disturbances), can be treated in community health centres. Children and adolescents, pregnant individuals or those with psychiatric symptoms should be treated by services with expertise in addiction medicine.

AB  - Introduction: Majority of women is worried about labor pain during pregnancy and it leads to their interest in cesarean section. Today, different medical and non-medical treatments are used to decrease labor pain. This research was conducted to investigate the effect of different positions on the intensity of labor pain in women who were in active phase of labor. Methods: This clinical trial was done on 400 women who were selected by purposive sampling method and were in the active phase of labor. First a questionnaire was filled for them based on demographic characteristic and then they were requested to sit down and sleep in supine position intermittently every15 minutes. Severity of pain in abdomen and back was determined by pain scale and recorded data was analyzed by SPSS 11 software and student t-test and Chi-square test. Results: In most of women back pain and abdominal pain was lower in sitting position and by changing position from sitting to supine, intensity of pain sensation increased. Significant relation was observed between back pain and abdominal pain in active phase (p=0.000). Conclusion: Sitting position can decrease pain sensation in back and abdomen and therefore, change in severity of pain from severe to moderate and moderate to mild in active phase of labor.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether reduced sleep is associated with differences in body composition and the risk of becoming overweight in young children. Design: Longitudinal study with repeated annual measurements. Setting: Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants: 244 children recruited from a birth cohort and followed from age 3 to 7. Main outcome measures: Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (kg), and fat free mass (kg) measured with bioelectrical impedance; dual energy x ray absorptiometry; physical activity and sleep duration measured with accelerometry; dietary intake (fruit and vegetables, non-core foods), television viewing, and family factors (maternal BMI and education, birth weight, smoking during pregnancy) measured with questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for multiple confounders, each additional hour of sleep at ages 3-5 was associated with a reduction in BMI of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.96) and a reduced risk of being overweight (BMI ≥85th centile) of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) at age 7. Further adjustment for BMI at age 3 strengthened these relations. These differences in BMI were explained by differences in fat mass index (-0.43, -0.82 to -0.03) more than by differences in fat free mass index (-0.21, -0.41 to -0.00). Conclusions: Young children who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk of becoming overweight, even after adjustment for initial weight status and multiple confounding factors. This weight gain is a result of increased fat deposition in both sexes rather than additional accumulation of fat free mass.

AB  - In veterinary medicine, the characterization of a drug's pharmacokinetic properties is generally based upon data that are derived from studies that employ small groups of young healthy animals, often of a single breed. In Part I of the series, we focused on the potential influence of disease processes, stress, pregnancy and lactation on drug pharmacokinetics. In this Part II of the series, we consider other covariates, such as gender, heritable traits, age, body composition, and circadian rhythms. The impact of these factors with respect to predicting the relationship between dose and drug exposure characteristics within an animal population is illustrated through the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Ultimately, an appreciation of these potential influences will improve the prediction of situations when dose adjustments may be appropriate. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Being born in the winter and spring significantly increases one's risk for developing schizophrenia. This birth seasonality may account for as many as 10% of all cases of schizophrenia. Maternal third trimester infections or vitamin D deficiencies are hypothesized to be the most likely cause and can account for many of the important features of schizophrenia, although each hypothesis has limitations. Alternatively, around the winter solstice, reduced maternal sunlight exposure during the second trimester of pregnancy may result in a reduced amplitude maternal circadian pacemaker, reduced maternal nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations, elevated maternal nocturnal core body and incubator temperatures, and elevated fetal core body and brain temperatures. Indeed, studies in humans have shown that the core body temperatures of human fetuses near birth may vary by >2.5°C. Reduced melatonin concentrations and elevated temperatures have been shown to have detrimental effects on immature hippocampal neurons in animals. In addition, plasma melatonin concentrations and core body temperatures are critical determinants of the dopaminergic programming of the striatal component of the human central thermostat, which appears to be functioning by the second trimester of gestation and responsive to whatever chronobiological signals its mother correctly or incorrectly transduces from the prevailing meteorological conditions. Both hippocampal and striatal thermostat dysfunction may result in reduced striatal extracellular dopamine concentrations and a tendency towards increased phasic dopamine release-the characteristic biochemical lesion in schizophrenia. Thus, the maternal-fetal chronobiological dysfunction hypothesis could account for the birth seasonality in schizophrenia and warrants further investigation. © 2011.

AB  - In the public mind, pregnancy, childbirth and newborn care is one of the most wonderful living experiences. However, epidemiological studies have shown that the risks of psychiatric disorders in the perinatal period are multiplying. Pregnancy entails with dramatic physical, mental and social role changing. The birth is a big, irreversible life event, and it should also be nominated as "rite of passage". This process represents a normative crisis during life, which needs new coping mechanisms to be developed. The stress and anxiety during the development of the fetus causes negative consequences in the short and long-term and it causes dangerous complications for the mother, too. During postpartum period, the incidence of major depression is approximately 15-20% that most frequently occurs within 6 months after birth but until the child is 2 years old it can develop any time. Serious risks of the postpartum depression are suicide and infanticide. In addition, it also represents serious teratogenic effects of cognitive and psychomotor development of children. It makes harder to recognize that the symptoms are largely the same as in any other stage of depression occurring during lifetime, but some of the symptoms compliant of normal pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition, the majorities of women recognize heavily the problem and visit a doctor, because based of social expectations they should feel happiness. After the disclosure of risk factors and securing preventive conditions, preparing to be a mother is effective in prevention of development of perinatal depression. The effective therapy is primarily based on the coaching approach, and requires multi-directional approach.

AB  - We offer a neurobiologic theory based on animal work that helps account for the conspicuous male predominance in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In young male animals, testosterone (TST) binds to androgen receptors (AR) in brainstem neurons responsible for enhancing brain arousal. As a consequence, arousal-related neurotransmitters bombard the amygdala hypersensitized by TST acting though AR. Arousal-related inputs are known to prime amygdaloid mechanisms for fear and anxiety, with resultant social avoidance. We hypothesize that similar mechanisms contribute to autism's male predominance and to its defining impaired social skills. The theory rests on two key interacting factors: the molecular effects of TST in genetically vulnerable boys in combination with environmental stresses they experienced in utero, neonatally, or during the first years. We postulate that higher TST levels and, therefore, higher amounts of arousal-related inputs to the amygdala sensitize these genetically vulnerable male infants to very early stresses. In sharp contrast to boys, girls not only do not have high levels of TST-facilitated arousal-causing inputs to the amygdala but they also enjoy the protection afforded by estrogenic hormones, oxytocin, and the oxytocin receptor. This theory suggests that novel technologies applied to the molecular endocrinology of TST's actions through AR will offer new avenues of enquiry into ASD. Since the high male preponderance in autism is important yet understudied, we offer our theory, which is based on detailed neurobehavioral research with animals, to stimulate basic and clinical research in animals and humans and hopefully help develop novel more effective medical treatments for autism. © 2011 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a syndrome that results from prenatal alcohol exposure and is defined by significant neurobehavioral impairments. Sleep disruption has been recognized as a clinically important symptom of FASD that has multiple negative effects on the child's health, ability to function adaptively, as well as on family and caregivers. However, few studies have addressed and characterized the sleep problems in this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize sleep in FASD and describe the impact of sensory processing difficulties on sleep patterns in children with FASD. METHODS: Children with FASD were compared with age-matched typically developing children between 3 and 6 years of age. Sleep was assessed using actigraphy, a sleep log, and the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. The Sensory Profile™, completed by caregivers, was used to evaluate the child's sensory processing abilities. Overall differences in sensory processing were correlated with actigraphic parameters measured in alcohol exposed and control groups. RESULTS: Data show that children with FASD have significantly more sleep disturbances than typically developing children, including increased bedtime resistance, shortened sleep duration, increased sleep anxiety, and increased night awakenings and parasomnias. Actigraphy reveals a significant difference between groups for sleep onset latency. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that sensory processing deficits are widespread in children with FASD and that these deficits are associated with multiple sleep problems. Children with FASD should be screened for sleep-related disorders and would benefit from occupational therapy for sensory-based treatment aimed at sleep regulation and consolidation. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Relationship between major risk factors of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sleep disorders in the infants is the subject of review and discussion. Improper micro-environmental characteristics (especially poor environmental organisation and lack of developmental stimulation), pre-term delivery and/or infant low birth weight, prone sleep position, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and infant- parent(s) bed-sharing are among well-established risk factors of SIDS. These factors may also be associated with sleep disorders in infants, principally with bedtime problems, abnormal night awakenings, and arrhythmic sleep. As an attempt to fix sleep problems, some inexperienced parents may try infant-rearing practices that may only aggravate sleep troubles and lead to further increased risk of SIDS, thus giving start to a vicious circle. Health care providers need to be aware of such situations as an opportunity to provide parents with guidance with respect for individual infant and family characteristics. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a relatively rare, life-threatening, and lifelong multisystem disorder characterized by autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which mostly manifests as failure to maintain ventilatory homeostasis during sleep. Infants with CCHS have inadequate sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep and in some cases during wakefulness, leading to persistent apnea. This article reports a case of CCHS in a 38-week-gestation infant who presented on day of life 2 with persistent apnea. Diagnosis of primary pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, neurologic disease, or injury was excluded before the diagnosis of CCHS was made. The diagnosis was confirmed by a PHOX2B sequence analysis. A tracheotomy was performed and the infant was discharged home on a home ventilator with outpatient follow-up. The clinical presentation of CCHS, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies, is reviewed. Copyright © 2011 National Association of Neonatal Nurses.

AB  - Smoking in pregnancy can cause serious adverse antenatal and postnatal morbidities, and a significant number of women continue to smoke in pregnancy despite these consequences. Early intervention in the form counseling from their physicians, pregnancy-specific self-help materials, counseling sessions with a health educator, and/or continued follow-up can result in better pregnancy outcomes and possibly long-term cessation. If a woman cannot quit despite these measures, pharmacotherapy can be considered. Currently, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), transdermal patches, and bupropion are used in pregnancy, but data on the safety and efficacy are largely lacking. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyse for the first time the validity of a slightly modified version of the Portuguese Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS), to be used as a screening instrument for antenatal depression. Specifically, the aims were to analyse its psychometric properties, to determine PDSS cutoff points and associated conditional probabilities to screen for depression according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria and to compare its screening performance with that of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Five hundred and three pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy completed both questionnaires and were interviewed faceto- face with the Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. The Portuguese version of the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness was used to obtain DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses of depression, our gold standards for caseness. PDSS reliability and validity were very good and comparable to those obtained in the postpartum validation studies developed in Portugal and in other countries, showing satisfactory sensitivity and specificity combinations (≅80%). Compared with BDI-II, it has the advantage of being more specific for the motherhood context. Although developed for postpartum depression, PDSS is accurate to screen for antenatal depression, and it could be very useful for clinical and epidemiologic purposes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to explore postpartum stress and breast symptoms in postpar-tum breastfeeding of parturient mothers as well as to identify the factors influencing the breast symptoms in breastfeeding women after cesarean section delivery. A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A total of 162 breastfeeding women after cesarean section delivery were recruited from five hospitals in Taiwan. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The five highest postpartum stress comes from the flabby flesh of maternal belly, the baby getting sick suddenly, interrupted sleep, insufficient breast milk, and discomfort due to breast engorgement. The most two common breast symptoms in breastfeeding encountered by subjects in this study were breast engorgement and breast hardening, whereas the least common one was nipple bloody discharge. Cesarean section women with early suckling on the operating table had more breast symptoms in postpartum breastfeeding; and the higher the postpartum stress of them, the more the breast symptoms. Breastfeeding in a comfortable condition is a key factor of precipitating breast milk secretion, so early suckling on the operating table may result in discomfort and stress of the woman and interfere with the secretion or production of breast milk. Additionally, it is a crucial factor of the success in breastfeeding that the nursing personnel can provide women help in maintaining breast milk production and secretion, taking care of a baby, and reminding women's families (especially their husbands) of giving their assistance, encouragement and praises to relieve women's postpartum stress. © 2011 Korean Society of Nursing Science.

In Australia, the focus of care has shifted from acute illness and palliative care to chronic disease management. Many people with HIV receive much of their medical care from general practitioners. It is therefore important to know which problems can be managed in general practice and when these patients should be referred. © Commonwealth of Australia.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep-related movement disorder with a significant genetic contribution as evidenced by heritability of 50% to 60%. The view of the underlying genetic architecture evolved from that of a mendelian disease with an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance to that of a complex multifactorial disorder with both genetic and nongenetic factors contributing to the susceptibility. Family based linkage studies and population-based association studies have identified genomic loci containing causally related genes and variants. However, the actual etiologic variants and their role in RLS pathophysiology still remain to be determined. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Music therapy has been recommended as an adjuvant therapy for both preterm infants and mothers during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and has been shown to have beneficial effects. To study the usefulness of combining live harp music therapy and kangaroo care (KC) on short-term physiological and behavioral parameters of preterm infants and their mothers in the NICU setting. Included in this study were stable infants born between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation, with normal hearing. Mother-infant dyads were randomly assigned to KC and live harp music therapy or to KC alone. Using repeated measures, neonatal and maternal heart rate, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate were recorded along with neonatal behavioral state and maternal anxiety state. Maternal age, ethnicity, education, and love of music were documented. Fifty-two mother-infant dyads were tested. Compared with KC alone, KC and live harp music therapy had a significantly beneficial effect on maternal anxiety score (46.8 ± 10 vs. 27.7 ± 7.1, respectively, P < 0.01). Infants' physiological responses and behavior did not differ significantly. No correlation was found between mothers' age, ethnicity, years of education and affinity for music, and anxiety scores (P = 0.2 to 0.5 for all four variables). KC combined with live harp music therapy is more beneficial in reducing maternal anxiety than KC alone. This combined therapy had no apparent effect on the tested infants' physiological responses or behavioral state.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, rapid increasing in the world population is the most essential impediment of socioeconomic development in the country that shows the importance of attention to reproductive controlling and family planning. Vasectomy is a simple and effective method of contraception. No-scalpel vasectomy has been done since 2001 in Isfahan province. Due to lack of information about vasectomy, this study was conducted to assess the complication, satisfaction and failure rate of vasectomy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The samples were 188 men that had been done vasectomy in Ebnesina, mollahadi sabzevari, Navvab safavi and khaneh Isfahan health centers of Isfahan city in 2005. Vasectomy was done according to standard protocol by trainer doctor. In each center, samples (47 men) were selected by systematic random sampling. The questionnaires were completed by face to face or telephone interview and available data of completed forms at the time of vasectomy. Demographic characteristics and developed complication after vasectomy were asked. The questions of questionnaire were designed according to reported complication in the literature review. Data were analyzed by SPSS 15 software and descriptive statistics. Finding: The mean age of men was 37.82 ± 5.54 years. The most common reported complication was pain (6.9%). Other reported complications were: sexual dysfunction (2.1%), urinary problem (2.1%), allergic reaction to local anesthesia (1.6%), testis infection (0.5%) and renal stone (0.5%). Sleep disturbance and being repentant were reported in 2.1% and 0.5%, respectively. Vasectomy failure rate was zero and satisfaction rate was 94.7%. Conclusion: With attention to this point that reported complication was low and vasectomy failure rate was zero, it seems that technique of vasectomy has good quality. On the other hand, for decreasing the dissatisfaction rate due to occurring unwanted pregnancy and being repentant due to tendency to have child after vasectomy, good counseling before doing vasectomy is necessary.

AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has been in clinical use for more than three decades. Its value has, however, been questioned recently for several reasons, e.g., the occurrence of newer AEDs, for which the use of TDM has to be evaluated, but also because of financial strains on health systems. The current review aims at assessing the use of TDM in newer AEDs, i.e., those that entered the market since the beginning of the 1990s. As some have been licensed only recently and others are only in very limited use, either because of orphan drug status or because of limited efficacy or potentially severe adverse events, only limited data exist for some of the newer AEDs. General considerations are made in the review, and each new AED is discussed, and, in some cases preliminary, assessment of the use of TDM is given. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

AB  - Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is common in community and clinical settings. The associated individual and societal burden is substantial, but many of those who could benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. This paper reviews the pharmacological treatment of GAD, based on findings of randomized placebo-controlled studies. Particular attention is paid to response rates to acute treatment, treatment tolerability, prediction of response, duration of treatment, and further management of patients who do not respond to initial treatment approaches. On the basis of their proven efficacy and reasonable tolerability in randomized placebo-controlled trials, recent evidence-based guidelines for pharmacological management have recommended initial treatment with either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, although there is also good evidence for the efficacy of pregabalin and quetiapine. It is difficult to predict reliably which patients will respond well to pharmacological treatment, but response to antidepressants is unlikely if there is no evidence of an onset of effect within 4 wk. The small number of placebo-controlled relapse-prevention studies causes uncertainty about the optimal duration of treatment after a satisfactory initial response, but continuing treatment for at least 12 months is recommended. There have been few investigations of the further management of patients who have not responded to first-line treatment, but switching to another evidence-based treatment, or augmentation approaches may be beneficial. © 2011 CINP.

AB  - Objective: To compare the outpatient in gynecology department with health screening women in aspects of general condition, bearing, livelihood, economics and family, and to analyze the factors that relate to premature ovarian failure (POF) and diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Method: To survey 178 outpatients of gynecology department and health screening women visited from January to December of 2007, and to investigate the possible related factors through a questionnaire including the condition of basic information (e.g. age, marital status, occupation and education), menstruation, pregnancy and delivery, contraception, health, livelihood, economics, psychology, society, family and so on. The data were analyzed with SPSS 13.0 software. Results A total of 45 POF patients, 83 DOR patients and 50 healthy women were included. The results of questionnaire showed that the physiological factor was the main reason for the occurrence of POF and DOR; the menstrual disorders, autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), malignancy cancer, pelvic surgery, smoking and drug abuse, and lack of sleep were closely related to POF and DOR; the social and psychological factors were other main reasons to cause POF and DOR. Conclusion The onset of both POF and DOR is caused by many factors, such as physical, social and psychological factors. The effective prevention and treatment for these diseases should be conducted positively in accordance with these three aspects. © 2011 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

AB  - Neonatal maternal separation (NMS) is a form of stress that has persistent, sex-specific effects on respiratory control development. In adult male (but not female) rats, NMS increases the hypoxic ventilatory response and augments respiratory instability during sleep; however, the effects of NMS on respiratory control prior to puberty are unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that NMS augments respiratory instability and the O 2 chemosensitivity in 12days old rats. Pups subjected to NMS were placed in an incubator 3h/day from P3 to P12. Controls were undisturbed. Breathing and apnea index were measured in normoxia with plethysmography. The ventilatory chemoreflex was assessed by measuring the increase in breathing frequency upon brief exposure to a hypoxic challenge (FIO 2=0.09; 5min). In normoxia, NMS augments the coefficient of variation (CV; an index of respiratory instability) of respiratory frequency and the number of apneas; this effect was more pronounced in male pups. We conclude that disruption of respiratory regulation by NMS is already apparent at P12. Based on results showing that plasma corticosterone levels of NMS pups were still elevated one day after the last NMS episode and the lack of effect of NMS on the O 2 chemoreflex index, we propose that disruption of hypothalamic regulation contributes to respiratory instability in NMS pups. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Stem cells are uniquely able to self-renew, to undergo multilineage differentiation, and to persist throughout life in a number of tissues. Stem cells are regulated by a combination of shared and tissue-specific mechanisms and are distinguished from restricted progenitors by differences in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that other aspects of cellular physiology, including mitosis, signal transduction, and metabolic regulation, also differ between stem cells and their progeny. These differences may allow stem cells to be regulated independently of differentiated cells in response to circadian rhythms, changes in metabolism, diet, exercise, mating, aging, infection, and disease. This allows stem cells to sustain homeostasis or to remodel relevant tissues in response to physiological change. Stem cells are therefore not only regulated by short-range signals that maintain homeostasis within their tissue of origin, but also by long-range signals that integrate stem cell function with systemic physiology. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: To achieve a child mortality reduction according to millennium development goal 4, it is necessary to considerably reduce neonatal mortality. We report stillbirth and early neonatal mortality risks as well as determinants of perinatal mortality in Eastern Uganda. Methods: A community-based prospective cohort study was conducted between 2006 and 2008. A total of 835 pregnant women were followed up for pregnancy outcome and survival of their children until 7 days after delivery. Mother's residence, age, parity, bed net use and whether delivery took place at home were included in multivariable regression analyses to identify risk factors for perinatal death. Results: The stillbirth risk was 19 per 1,000 pregnancies and the early neonatal death risk 22 per 1,000 live births. Overall, the perinatal mortality risk was 41 [95%CI: 27, 54] per 1,000 pregnancies. Of the deaths, 47% followed complicated deliveries and 24% preterm births. Perinatal mortality was 63/1,000 pregnancies among teenage mothers, 76/1,000 pregnancies among nulliparous women and 61/1,000 pregnancies among women delivering at home who, after controlling for potential confounders, had a 3.7 (95%CI: 1.8, 7.4) times higher perinatal mortality than women who gave birth in a health facility. This association was considerably stronger among nulliparous women [RR 8.0 (95%CI: 2.9, 21.6)] than among women with a previous live birth [RR 1.8 (95%CI: 0.7, 4.5)]. All perinatal deaths occurred among women who did not sleep under a mosquito net. Women living in urban slums had a higher risk of losing their babies than those in rural areas [RR: 2.7 (95%CI: 1.4, 5.3)]. Conclusion: Our findings strengthen arguments for ensuring that pregnant women have access to and use adequate delivery facilities and bed nets. © 2011 Nankabirwa et al.

AB  - The influence of both prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE; 6. mg/kg/day) and sex on heart rate (HR) regulation during sleep versus wakefulness was evaluated in 13, 16 and 26 day old rat pups. Pups were chronically instrumented at least 24. h before testing. On postnatal day 13 (P13), PNE males spent significantly more time in NREM sleep and demonstrated a greater drop in HR when transitioning from quiet wake to sleep compared to age and sex matched controls (-14 ± 5. bpm versus -1 ± 3. bpm, respectively). Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis indicated that this state-dependent drop in HR was primarily associated with a greater reduction in sympathovagal balance (LF/HF ratio) in PNE males compared to controls. No parallel changes in indices of parasympathetic drive (HF power) were identified. In contrast, no significant effect of PNE on HR during sleep versus wakefulness was identified in P13 females. However, independent of state, a significant decrease in HF power was identified in P13 PNE females compared to controls. At P16, state-dependent differences in HR or HRV between PNE and sex-matched control pups were resolved. Additionally, at P26 no significant effect of PNE on state-dependent changes in HR or HRV was identified in either sex. Analysis of the hypothalamic peptide orexin identified that PNE induced approximately a 50% reduction in hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA and total mRNA was lowest in PNE males. These findings suggest that PNE induces sex dependent changes in sleep related autonomic regulation of HR during early postnatal development and these changes may be related to epigenetic alterations in the orexin system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene and review of the clinical history. SIDS is one of the leading causes of infant mortality and occurs from the first month, until the first year of life for newborns and infants. The aim of this review was to identify and examine risk factors responsible for causing the sudden infant death and to propose certain measures in order to protect newborns and infants from sudden death. The potential factors that contribute to the occurrence of SIDS include inadequate prenatal care, low birth weight (<2499gr), premature infants, intrauterine growth delay, short interval between pregnancies and maternal substance use (tobacco, alcohol, opiates). Moreover, factors related to infant's sleep environment such as the prone or side sleeping position and thick coverlet increase the risk of sudden death in infants. Also, the combination of risk factors such as that of prone sleeping position and soft bed mattress are linked to a 20-fold increased risk of death. Finally, polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), viral respiratory infections, long Q-T (responsible for the presence of fatal arrhythmia) are related to the SIDS. Literature review indicates that each individual risk factor contributes to the appearance of SIDS and the establishment of certain protective measures for parents and health professionals has reduced its prevalence. But the precise identification of the SIDS causes and how these contribute to the occurrence of sudden death in neonates and infants, remains a challenge for health professionals.

AB  - The adrenal gland in the adult is a peripheral circadian clock involved in the coordination of energy intake and expenditure, required for adaptation to the external environment. During fetal life, a peripheral circadian clock is present in the nonhuman primate adrenal gland. Whether this extends to the fetal adrenal gland like the rat is unknown. Here we explored in vivo and in vitro whether the rat fetal adrenal is a peripheral circadian clock entrained by melatonin. We measured the 24-h changes in adrenal content of corticosterone and in the expression of clock genes Per-2 and Bmal-1 and of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), Mt1 melatonin receptor, and early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) expression. In culture, we explored whether oscillatory expression of these genes persisted during 48 h and the effect of a 4-h melatonin pulse on their expression. In vivo, the rat fetal adrenal gland showed circadian expression of Bmal-1 and Per-2 in antiphase (acrophases at 2200 and 1300 h, respectively) as well as of Mt1 and Egr-1. This was accompanied by circadian rhythms of corticosterone content and of StAR expression both peaking at 0600 h. The 24-h oscillatory expression of Bmal-1, Per-2, StAR, Mt1, and Egr-1 persisted during 48 h in culture; however, the antiphase between Per-2 and Bmal-1 was lost. The pulse of melatonin shifted the acrophases of all the genes studied and restored the antiphase between Per-2 and Bmal-1. Thus, in the rat, the fetal adrenal is a strong peripheral clock potentially amenable to regulation by maternal melatonin. Copyright © 2011 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Background: Stable circadian rhythm is important for both maternal and fetal health. This retrospective analysis of women in a semiconductor factory evaluated the effect of shift work exposure on childbearing and birth weight. Methods: Records of 440 female employees (initial mean age: 28.4 years) including 111 mothers who had 158 live births during the period of observation (1997-2007) were reviewed. The data analyzed included maternal age, general health condition, highest educational level, life-style and occupational factors, as well as newborn gender, birth weight, birth order and gestational age. Results: The childbearing rates of female workers on three different work schedules (consistent daytime work (CDW), intermittent (i-) or persistent (p-) rotating shift works (RSW)) were 32.1%, 20.0% and 25.4%, respectively (P=0.047). After controlling for potential confounding factors, childbearing rates among women with CDW exceeded those of shift workers (odds ratio (OR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-3.0). The birth weights of newborns from mothers on the three work schedules (CDW, i-RSW and p-RSW) were significantly different (3271.7±395.4, 3251.3±460.9, and 2998.5±381.2 g, respectively (P<0.01). Newborns within the lightest birth weight quintile were significantly more likely to be born to mothers with exposure to p-RSW (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.1-16.8). Conclusions: Rotating shift work exposure was significantly associated with decreased childbearing and lighter birth weight in women working in this semiconductor manufacturing factory. Work schedules should be carefully planned for female employees who are pregnant or preparing for pregnancy. Prenatal evaluations for mothers with persistent day-night rotating shift work exposures are especially necessary. © 2011 Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Female infertility is a common problem and the GP should be able to elucidate potential causes by efficient history taking and performing initial investigations as appropriate. Key lifestyle issues such as obesity should be addressed and the patient informed about the impact of such issues on fertility and pregnancy. GPs have the privilege of regular patient review and rapport and can use their position to remind women, once every so often, of their biological clock. It is prudent for the GP to refer an infertile couple to an infertility specialist early to maximise the couple's chance of conception.

AB  - Besides being models for a variety of human diseases, hamsters have been object of numerous behavioral studies about stress and agonistic behavior. Such studies usually involve hormone change monitoring. The aim of the present study was to confirm the suitability of a commercial kit for human serum testosterone analysis to quantify testosterone metabolites in the feces (MFT) of male and female Syrian hamsters. Ten males were submitted to a GnRH challenge test to stimulate testicular activity and increase circulating testosterone levels. Five females received a testosterone injection and five other females were given a saline injection. Fecal samples collected before and after the procedures, and fecal samples collected from 20 pregnant females through gestation were analyzed for MFT with a commercial radioimmunoassay. The detection of a MFT peak 12 h after GnRH administration followed by a decrease under baseline showed that, in males, changes in the levels of MFT are related to respective changes of testosterone concentrations in the blood. Again in males a circadian cycle of MFT similar to the circadian rhythm described in literature for blood concentrations was detected. The administration of exogenous testosterone caused in females a dramatic peak of MFT. However, the concentrations measured through gestation did not reflect the pattern of endogenous testosterone blood levels as described in the literature. Therefore, the use of a radioimmunoassay for human blood testosterone was validated in male Syrian hamster, but a more specific assay would be necessary for female hamsters.

AB  - To investigate the effects of short-term sleep deprivation on the sleep pattern during pregnancy, cortical and hippocampal EEG and locomotor activity were recorded within 24-hours in a "disk-over-water" paradigm in 18 Wistar rats. Rats were adapted to experimental situation and were able to move across the rotating disk without falling in water. Then a polysomnogram was recorded for 3 sequential days in the control group 1 (n = 12) without disk rotation. On the next day non-pregnant rats (experimental group 1, n = 6) were subjected to the sleep deprivation procedure with a pre-set program of disk rotation from 11:00 to 14:00 during 3 sequential days. Other 6 rats (experimental group 2) were subjected to sleep deprivation on the 5-7th day of pregnancy. EEG and locomotor activity were also constantly recorded during the sleep deprivation procedure. In control group 2 (n = 6, without sleep deprivation), a polysomnogram was recorded on the 5-7th day of pregnancy. As compared to non-pregnant rats, sleep intensity of pregnant rats increased during the first hours after the deprivation, and a considerable rebound of REM sleep took place. Sleep pattern during the off-light 12 hours remained unchanged. The results suggest that homeostatic compensation of sleep deprivation effects in rats on the first week of pregnancy is more efficient than in control non-pregnant animals.

AB  - Aims: To document the effect of position on oxygen saturation and changes in oxygen requirement in convalescent preterm infants. Methods: Twelve infants born ≥24 and ≤32 weeks gestation, extubated and without congenital anomaly were studied using nap polysomnography in prone and supine, twice weekly until discharge. Mean oxygen saturation (SpO2), minimum SpO2, mean minimum SpO2 and time with SpO2 &lt; 90% were measured in active sleep. Results: Eight male and four female infants [median gestation 28 (24-31) weeks and median birthweight 1059 (715-1840) g] had 39 studies. For 21 of 39 studies, the infant was on respiratory support. Four infants had chronic lung disease (CLD). SpO2 varied with postmenstrual age (PMA) (p = 0.003) but not with position (p = 0.36), and PMA did not influence the effect of position on SpO2 (p = 0.19). SpO 2 was lower for those with CLD (p &lt; 0.0001) and those on respiratory support (p &lt; 0.001), but there was no effect of position (p = 0.97 and p = 0.67, respectively). From 36 weeks PMA, a change to supine did not increase oxygen requirement. Conclusion: In preterm infants, PMA and residual respiratory disease have greater effects on oxygenation than position. A supine sleep position is not disadvantageous for preterm infants at discharge. © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta PA; Pædiatrica © 2011 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

AB  - Sleep problems across development are common, from infancy through adolescence. Further, the consequences of disrupted or insufficient sleep are numerous, impacting growth, learning, development, and mood. However, youth do not live in isolation, but rather are a part of a family system that is dynamic and interactive. One consequence of sleep problems in youth that has only recently received increasing attention is how sleep disorders or sleep disruptions in youth affect parent sleep and daytime functioning. This chapter reviews the existing literature in this area. It begins with a review of the relationship between sleep in children and their parents using a developmental framework from pregnancy through adolescence. It then considers the complex relationship between a child's illness or developmental disorder, the child's sleep, and both parental sleep and daytime functioning. Throughout, the chapter highlights how the treatment of sleep problems in children is essential, resulting in the improvement of not only the child's sleep but also parental sleep and daytime functioning. © Oxford University Press, 2014.

AB  - Objective and background: Snoring is common among pregnant women and early reports suggest that it may bear a risk to the fetus. Increased fetal erythropoiesis manifested by elevated circulating nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) has been found in complicated pregnancies involving fetal hypoxia. Both erythropoietin (EPO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediate elevation of circulating nRBCs. The intermittent hypoxia and systemic inflammation elicited by sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) could affect fetal erythropoiesis during pregnancy. We hypothesized that maternal snoring will result in increased levels of fetal circulating nRBCs via increased concentrations of EPO, IL-6, or both. Methods: Women of singleton uncomplicated full-term pregnancies were recruited during labor and completed a designated questionnaire. Umbilical cord blood was collected immediately after birth and analyzed for nRBCs, plasma EPO and plasma IL-6 concentrations. Newborn data were retrieved from medical records. Results: One hundred and twenty-two women were recruited. Thirty-nine percent of women reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Cord blood levels of circulating nRBCs, EPO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in habitual snorers compared with non-snorers (p=0.03, 0.005 and 0.01; respectively). No differences in maternal characteristics or newborn crude outcomes were found. Conclusions: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is associated with enhanced fetal erythropoiesis manifested by increased cord blood levels of nRBCs, EPO and IL-6. This provides preliminary evidence that maternal snoring is associated with subtle alterations in markers of fetal well being. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence. Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N = 56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores ? 15 and clinician interview. Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p &lt; .05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (χ2 = 0.98, p = .32). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pregnancy is characterized by profound metabolic and physiological alterations involving virtually every organ system. Among apparently healthy women, the metabolic challenges, or "stress test" of pregnancy may contribute to adverse perinatal and neonatal outcomes, and may also unmask susceptibility for maternal chronic disorders. Available clinical and epidemiologic data are supportive of the hypothesis that common medical complications of pregnancy including gestational diabetes mellitus, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may represent, at least for some women, their underlying risk for developing related chronic medical conditions as they age. This chapter first provides a brief overview of maternal metabolic, physiological, and anatomical changes during pregnancy. These are followed by a review of selected maternal pre-gestational chronic medical conditions and those arising during pregnancy. The chapter closes with a discussion of the influence of other factors, including intimate partner violence, on maternal physical and mental well-being. © 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

AB  - This case report describes occupational therapy (OT) intervention in an outpatient setting and outcomes for a child diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) from 4 to 28 months of age. There is little information on therapy intervention and outcomes of children who have survived. The patient is a white male, born at 35 weeks gestation with a diagnosis of left CDH that required a patch repair. He also had a Nissen fundoplication, gastrostomy tube and spent the first 100 days of his life in the hospital. He received outpatient OT for 2 years. The process of service provision is described using the "Occupational therapy practice framework: Domain and process, 2nd edition"(American Occupational Therapy Association, 2008, American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 62(6), 625-683). The focus of intervention, description of the intervention process, and timeline for achievement of skills is provided. Outcomes and assessment tools used included the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-Second Edition. © 2011 by Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Nearly 30% of women experience an anxiety disorder at some time during their lives, and there is increasing evidence that anxiety disorders are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Despite increased media coverage regarding anxiety disorders, women are reluctant to discuss signs and symptoms of anxiety with family or health care providers. Additionally, despite ongoing research and improved educational curricula, primary care and women's health care providers find diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders challenging. This article reviews the diagnostic features and pharmacologic treatment options for the most common anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The impact of anxiety disorders on pregnancy and guidelines for management are presented. © 2011 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) is a valuable tool for the continuous evaluation of functional brain maturation in infants. The amplitudes of the upper and lower margins of aEEGs are postulated to change with maturation and correlate with postmenstrual age (PMA). In this study we aimed to establish reliable reference values of aEEG amplitudes, which provide quantitative guidelines for assessing brain maturation as indicated by aEEG results in neonates and young infants. METHODS: aEEGs from healthy infants (n = 274) with PMAs that ranged from 30 to 55 weeks were divided into 10 groups according to their PMAs. Two 5-minute segments were selected from each aEEG and were used to automatically calculate the upper and lower margins and bandwidths of the aEEG tracings. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was achieved with an overall correlation of 0.99. The upper and lower margins of the aEEGs in both active and quiet sleep clearly rose in infants after the neonatal period. The bandwidth defined as the graphic distance decreased almost monotonically throughout the PMA range from 30 to 55 weeks. The lower margin of the aEEG was positively correlated with PMA, with a larger rank correlation coefficient during quiet sleep (r = 0.89) than during active sleep (r = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Reference values of aEEG amplitudes were obtained for infants with a wide range of PMAs and constituted the basis for the quantitative assessment of aEEG changes with maturation in neonates and young infants. The normative amplitudes of aEEG margins, especially of the lower margin in quiet sleep, are recommended as a source of reference data for the identification of potentially abnormal aEEG results.

AB  - Despite association with lung growth and long-term respiratory morbidity, there is a lack of normative lung function data for unsedated infants conforming to latest European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society standards. Lung function was measured using an ultrasonic flow meter in 342 unsedated, healthy, term-born infants at a mean±SD age of 5.1±0.8 weeks during natural sleep according to the latest standards. Tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL) and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) measurements were obtained from 100 regular breaths. We aimed for three acceptable measurements for multiple-breath washout and 5-10 acceptable interruption resistance (Rint) measurements. Acceptable measurements were obtained in ≤285 infants with high variability. Mean values were 7.48 mL·kg-1 (95% limits of agreement 4.95-10.0 mL·kg-1) for tidal volume, 14.3 ppb (2.6-26.1 ppb) for eNO, 23.9 mL·kg-1 (16.0-31.8 mL·kg-1) for functional residual capacity, 6.75 (5.63-7.87) for lung clearance index and 3.78 kPa·s·L-1 (1.14-6.42 kPa·s·L-1) for Rint. In males, TBFVL outcomes were associated with anthropometric parameters and in females, with maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal asthma and Caesarean section. This large normative data set in unsedated infants offers reference values for future research and particularly for studies where sedation may put infants at risk. Furthermore, it highlights the impact of maternal and environmental risk factors on neonatal lung function. Copyright©ERS 2011.

AB  - In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2-3 months, 4-5 months, and 6-8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant (P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006-2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002-2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bedsharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to investigate if insomnia in late pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology/postpartum depression (PPD). 581 women in their last trimester of pregnancy answered questions/questionnaires about lifetime history of insomnia, current sleep perception, current mood and depressive symptomatology. They were interviewed with the Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. After delivery 382 (65.7%) mothers participated again in the study. Insomnia in pregnancy was not a risk factor for PPD (DSM-IV or ICD-10) but was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Negative Affect (NA) was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Women with higher NA were 4.6 (CI95%. = 1.69-12.74) and 5.3 times (CI95%. = 2.26-12.58) more likely of experiencing PPD (DSM-IV/ICD-10, respectively) than women with lower NA. Lifetime Depression was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology and ICD-10/PPD (OR. = 2.6; CI95%. = 1.16-4.38). Positive Affect (PA) showed to be a protective factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology and DSM-IV/PPD (OR. = 1.5; CI95%. = 1.20-2.33). Controlling NA, PA and Lifetime Depression, insomnia lost its predictive role, suggesting these variables might work as mediators. Associations between insomnia, NA, PA and Lifetime Depression should be assessed in pregnancy. This might help to preventively target NA, enhance PA and reduce the likelihood of experiencing postpartum depressive symptomatology. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder with a prevalence in Europe ranging from 5% to 10%. The disease is characterized by an imperative urge to move the legs associated with an unpleasant sensation in the lower limbs, typically occurring at rest in the evening and during the night. RLS can lead to disturbances of sleep and an impaired quality of life. It is diagnosed clinically by means of four internationally recognized criteria that summarize the main characteristics of the disorder. The disease exists in forms classified as idiopathic and secondary. Iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy are well established secondary causes of RLS. Several neurological disorders are also associated with RLS. Iron and dopamine play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. RLS is a complex genetic disorder, although no disease-causing gene has yet been identified. Dopaminergic therapy is currently the most effective treatment for this disease.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) are neurological disorders characterized by abnormal legs movement in sleep. They cause an impaired quality of sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness in theirs developed forms. RLS has two forms, idiopathic and secondary related to other medical conditions such as iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Periodic limb movements occur in 80 % patients with RLS, they are characterized by stereotypic, periodic legs movement during sleep. The diagnosis is based on polysomnography or actigraphy. The dopaminergic therapy is the most efficient treatment of these diseases.

AB  - Shift work during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for preterm birth and low birth weight. However, the impact upon the long term health of the children is currently unknown. In this study, we used an animal model to determine the consequences of maternal shift work exposure on the health of the adult offspring. Pregnant rats were exposed to chronic phase shifts (CPS) in their photoperiod every 3-4 days throughout gestation and the first week after birth. Adult offspring were assessed for a range of metabolic, endocrine, circadian and neurobehavioural parameters. At 3 months of age, male pups exposed to the CPS schedule in utero had increased adiposity (+29%) and hyperleptinaemia (+99% at 0700h). By 12 months of age, both male and female rats displayed hyperleptinaemia (+26% and +41% respectively) and hyperinsulinaemia (+110% and +83% respectively). 12 month old female CPS rats displayed poor glucose tolerance (+18%) and increased insulin secretion (+29%) in response to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. In CPS males the glucose response was unaltered, but the insulin response was reduced by 35%. The glucose response to an insulin tolerance test was decreased by 21% in CPS females but unaltered in males. Disruption of circadian rhythmicity during gestation resulted in gender dependent metabolic consequences for the adult offspring. These results highlight the need for a thorough analysis of shift work exposure in utero on the health of the adult offspring in humans. © 2011 Varcoe et al.

AB  - Background: A review of the barriers to mosquito net use in malaria-endemic countries has yet to be presented in the published literature despite considerable research interest in this area. This paper partly addresses this gap by reviewing one component of the evidence base; namely, published research pertaining to self-reported reasons for not using a mosquito net among net 'owning' individuals. It was anticipated that the review findings would potentially inform an intervention or range of interventions best suited to promoting greater net use amongst this group. Method. Studies were sought via a search of the Medline database. The key inclusion criteria were: that study participants could be identified as owning a mosquito net or having a mosquito net available for use; that these participants on one or more occasions were identified or self-reported as not using the mosquito net; and that reasons for not using the mosquito net were reported. Studies meeting these criteria were included irrespective of mosquito net type. Results: A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Discomfort, primarily due to heat, and perceived (low) mosquito density were the most widely identified reason for non-use. Social factors, such as sleeping elsewhere, or not sleeping at all, were also reported across studies as were technical factors related to mosquito net use (i.e. not being able to hang a mosquito net or finding it inconvenient to hang) and the temporary unavailability of a normally available mosquito net (primarily due to someone else using it). However, confidence in the reported findings was substantially undermined by a range of methodological limitations and a dearth of dedicated research investigation. Conclusions: The findings of this review should be considered highly tentative until such time as greater quantities of dedicated, well-designed and reported studies are available in the published literature. The current evidence-base is not sufficient in scope or quality to reliably inform mosquito net promoting interventions or campaigns targeted at individuals who own, but do not (reliably) use, mosquito nets. © 2011 Pulford et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - We employed accepted, validated symptom-based screening measures to discern attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to adverse pregnancy outcomes, taking into account potential maternal confounders. Commonly employed OSA screening measures (Berlin and Epworth scales) were performed in the second and third trimesters; maternal and neonatal outcome data were thereafter obtained. The relationship between OSA and outcomes of interest were explored in stratified and multivariate models controlling for potential confounders. The overall prevalence of OSA was 25.4%. Given a nonlinear increase by body mass index (BMI) strata (8.9%, 46%; p<0.0001), stratified multivariate analysis was subsequently performed. Among nonobese (BMI <30) gravidae, frequency of preeclampsia was significantly higher among women with OSA (adjusted odds ratio=6.58, 95% confidence interval=1.04, 38.51; p=0.035). Among the obese (BMI 30) gravidae, infant birth weight ratio (or birth weight by gestational age) was higher with OSA+screening than OSA(1.099 versus 1.035; p=0.04), and this association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (p=0.05). OSA prevalence increases significantly among obese gravidae, raising concerns for the overall validity of commonly employed screening measures in pregnancy. Nevertheless, OSA status continues to exert an independent influence, as obese and nonobese gravidae are at increased risk for a limited number of adverse perinatal outcomes in multivariate models.

AB  - Background: While children and young adults had the highest attack rates due to 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza A (2009 H1N1), studies of hospitalized cases noted high fatality in older adults. We analyzed California public health surveillance data to better characterize the populations at risk for dying due to 2009 H1N1. Methods and Findings: A case was an adult ≥20 years who died with influenza-like symptoms and laboratory results indicative of 2009 H1N1. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records using a standardized case report form. From April 3, 2009 - August 10, 2010, 541 fatal cases ≥20 years with 2009 H1N1 were reported. Influenza fatality rates per 100,000 population were highest in persons 50-59 years (3.5; annualized rate = 2.6) and 60-69 years (2.3; annualized rate = 1.7) compared to younger and older age groups (0.4-1.9; annualized rates = 0.3-1.4). Of 486 cases hospitalized prior to death, 441 (91%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. ICU admission rates per 100,000 population were highest in adults 50-59 years (8.6). ICU case-fatality ratios among adults ranged from 24-42%, with the highest ratios in persons 70-79 years. A total of 425 (80%) cases had co-morbid conditions associated with severe seasonal influenza. The prevalence of most co-morbid conditions increased with increasing age, but obesity, pregnancy and obstructive sleep apnea decreased with age. Rapid testing was positive in 97 (35%) of 276 tested. Of 482 cases with available data, 384 (80%) received antiviral treatment, including 49 (15%) of 328 within 48 hours of symptom onset. Conclusions: Adults aged 50-59 years had the highest fatality due to 2009 H1N1; older adults may have been spared due to pre-existing immunity. However, once infected and hospitalized in intensive care, case-fatality ratios were high for all adults, especially in those over 60 years. Vaccination of adults older than 50 years should be encouraged. © 2011 Louie et al.

AB  - Background: Pregnant women exposed to traffic pollution have an increased risk of negative birth outcomes. We aimed to investigate the size of this risk using a prospective cohort of 970 mothers and newborns in Logan, Queensland. Methods. We examined two measures of traffic: distance to nearest road and number of roads around the home. To examine the effect of distance we used the number of roads around the home in radii from 50 to 500 metres. We examined three road types: freeways, highways and main roads. Results: There were no associations with distance to road. A greater number of freeways and main roads around the home were associated with a shorter gestation time. There were no negative impacts on birth weight, birth length or head circumference after adjusting for gestation. The negative effects on gestation were largely due to main roads within 400 metres of the home. For every 10 extra main roads within 400 metres of the home, gestation time was reduced by 1.1% (95% CI: -1.7, -0.5; p-value = 0.001). Conclusions: Our results add weight to the association between exposure to traffic and reduced gestation time. This effect may be due to the chemical toxins in traffic pollutants, or because of disturbed sleep due to traffic noise. © 2011 Barnett et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Rheumatology clinic patients frequently experience sleep disturbances and poor sleep. Increased frequencies of primary sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome, have been reported in rheumatic disease patient populations. Disturbed sleep with fragmentation is commonly observed and has been associated with pain, depression and increased inflammatory disease activity. In recent years, there has been increased investigation into relationships between sleep regulation and inflammatory mediators. The role of TNF-α in sleep physiology and pathology has been intensively studied. The generally positive effect of biologic agents such as anti-TNF-α therapy on sleep in rheumatology patients has been observed in polysomnographic studies and in larger clinical trials. In this article we review the primary sleep disorders with reference to the rheumatology patient, provide an overview of sleep regulation with specific attention to inflammatory cytokine influences and discuss the approach to sleep problems for the rheumatology clinic patient. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - To assess some risk factors and their involvement in female breast tumours etiology. The study was performed on a sample of 67 patients registered with breast tumours, at family phisicians' offices from Iasi, Romania. Some risk factors were defined such as: nuliparity (20.8%) and first pregnancy after age 30 (34.3%); fibrous mastopathy in personal history (73.1% of cases with breast cancer) and breast cancer in siblings of first (8.9%) and second grade (11.9%). Relative to lifestyle, sedentary life was remarked in 59.2% of patients; modification of circadian rhythm in 28.3%, and excesive caffeine consumption in 80.9% of cases. Further prevention and educational programs on breast tumoural risk factors are needed in Romania, even at female teenage, performed by family physician.

AB  - Objective. To determine whether a single urine specimen could effectively replace the 24 hour (24-h) urine collection in screening for microalbuminuria and proteinuria in pregnant women with pregestational diabetes. Materials and Methods. A total of 42 pregnant women with pregestational diabetes mellitus were involved in the eventual analysis. Demographic and clinical variables were collected and analyzed. Urinary Protein (P) to Creatinine (Cr) ratio and microalbumin (MA) to Cr ratios were measured for the spot sample, and the total P, total MA, and serum Cr were measured for the 24-h urine sample. Analysis was done using linear regression and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Results. Mean maternal age was 30.8 years, and the mean gestational age at collection was 19.8 weeks. A strong correlation exists between the spot MA to Cr value and 24-h MA, with an r = 0.81 (P < 0.0001). The association between the spot P to Cr ratio and 24-h urinary P was not as strong, r = 0.58 (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. A strong association between spot MA to Cr ratio and 24-h urinary microalbuminuria may suggest a predictive role for random urine assessment of MA in pregnant pregestational diabetic patients. However, based on our data, the spot P to Cr ratio may be inadequate for assessing proteinuria in pregestational diabetic pregnancies. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - A genetic certificate is a DNA database reflecting the specific features of a personal genome. The review considers the concept of individual genetic certificates and their significance for prolongation of active longevity and for paving the way to the longest possible lifespan. The involvement of the biological clock and weak link genes in aging processes in human beings is outlined. The significance of genetic tests for allelic polymorphisms and marker genes associated with common multifactorial disorders is stressed. Special attention is paid to the Genome Wide Association Studies technology implemented for analysis of genetic profiles and candidate genes associated with common diseases. Relevant scientific problems are discussed, as well as the public interest in creation of personalized DNA databanks (genetic certificates) for pregnant women, children, athletes, etc. The relationship of the genetic certificate concept to the current international Personal Genome Project is highlighted. The prospects of the introduction of genetic certificates into medical practice are discussed in the context of gerontological problems. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2011.

AB  - The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism-serum TSH levels above and T 4 levels within the laboratory reference ranges-depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are organic surfactants widely used in various industrial and consumer applications. Due to their chemical properties, these perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have also become persistent contaminants. The risk of possible intrauterine and lactational exposure to these chemicals poses a significant health concern for potential developmental effects. In the present study we have found that dietary exposure of mice to 0.3 mg/kg of PFOS or PFOA throughout pregnancy results in different distribution pattern in the offspring brain and liver. In particular, exposure to PFOS led to four times higher accumulation of the chemical in the brains of newborn mice than PFOA. We have used a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate motor function, circadian activity, and emotion-related behavior in the exposed offspring. Exposure to PFOS resulted in decreased locomotion in a novel environment and reduced muscle strength only in male offspring. Prenatal exposure to PFOA was associated with changes in exploratory behavior in male and female offspring, as well as with increased global activity in males in their home cage. The neurobehavioral outcome of prenatal exposure to PFCs in mice is characterized by mild alterations in motor function and it appears to be sex-related. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - NAP (davunetide) is an eight amino acid peptide (NAPVSIPQ) that has been shown to provide potent neuroprotection, in vitro and in vivo. In human clinical trials, NAP has been shown to increase memory scores in patients suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer's disease and to enhance functional daily behaviors in schizophrenia patients. NAP is derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) a molecule that is essential for brain formation, interacting with the chromatin associated protein alpha and the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF and regulating >400 genes during embryonic development. Partial loss in ADNP results in cognitive deficits and pathology of the microtubule associated protein tau (tauopathy) that is ameliorated in part by NAP replacement therapy. Recent studies increased the scope of NAP neuroprotection and provided further insights into the NAP mechanisms of action. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the presence of tau on axonal microtubules renders them notably less sensitive to the microtubule-severing protein katanin, and NAP was shown to protect microtubules from katanin disruption in the face of reduced tau expression. Parallel studies showed that NAP reduced the number of apoptotic neurons through activation of PI-3K/Akt pathway in the cortical plate or both PI-3K/Akt and MAPK/MEK1 kinases in the white matter. The interaction of these disparate yet complementary pathways is the subject of future studies towards human brain neuroprotection in the clinical scenario. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Objective: to examine the effectiveness of using foot reflexology to improve sleep quality in postpartum women. Design and setting: randomised controlled trial, conducted at two postpartum centres in northern Taiwan. Participants: 65 postpartum women reporting poor quality of sleep were recruited from July 2007 to December 2007. Interventions: participants were assigned randomly to either an intervention or a control group. Participants in both groups received the same care except for reflexology therapy. The intervention group received a single 30-minute foot reflexology session at the same time each evening for five consecutive days. Sessions were administered by a certified nurse reflexologist. Measures and findings: the outcome measure was the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and this was performed at baseline and post test. Mean PQSI scores for both groups declined over time between baseline and post test. Using a generalised estimation equation to control several confounding variables, the changes in mean PSQI were found to be significantly lower in the intervention group (β=-2.24, standard error=0.38, p<0.001) than in the control group. Conclusion: an intervention involving foot reflexology in the postnatal period significantly improved the quality of sleep. Implications for practice: midwives should evaluate maternal sleep quality and design early intervention programmes to improve quality of sleep in order to increase maternal biopsychosocial well-being. Midwives interested in complementary therapies should be encouraged to obtain training in reflexology and to apply it in clinical settings if it is allowed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during the perinatal period. Changes in sleep and sleep quality are typical throughout pregnancy and early postpartum. However, little is known about relationships between insomnia symptoms and psychiatric symptoms in perinatal women. The objective of the present study is to characterize the burden of insomnia symptoms in perinatal women seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment and to examine relationships between insomnia and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: Data from 257 pregnant or postpartum women who sought outpatient psychiatric treatment at a university hospital-affiliated clinic were extracted from an existing clinical management database. Data included validated self-report measures assessing insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), and generalized anxiety (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ]). Results: Fifty-two percent of women reported symptoms of insomnia, 75% reported symptoms of depression, and 61% reported symptoms of generalized anxiety. After controlling for PSWQ, the partial correlation between EPDS and ISI was 0.15 and 0.37 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. After controlling for EPDS, the partial correlation between PSWQ and ISI was 0.20 and 0.12 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. Women with clinically significant ISI scores had significantly higher odds for reporting symptoms consistent with depression (odds ratio [OR] 7.7) and generalized anxiety (OR 2.55) compared to women with lower ISI scores. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affected a significant proportion of the perinatal women in this sample. These symptoms are linked to symptoms of depression and anxiety in treatment-seeking pregnant and postpartum women. Perinatal women seen in psychiatric treatment settings should be routinely screened for sleep problems. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background: The etiology of excessive infant crying is largely unknown. We hypothesize that excessive infant crying may have an early nutritional origin during fetal development. Aims: This study is the first to explore whether (1) maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy are associated with excessive infant crying, and (2) whether and how maternal psychological well-being during pregnancy affects these associations. Study design: Women were approached around the 12th pregnancy week to complete a questionnaire (n = 8266) and to donate a blood sample (n = 4389); vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations were determined in serum. Infant crying behavior was measured through a postpartum questionnaire (± 3 months; n = 5218). Subjects: Pregnant women living in Amsterdam and their newborn child. Outcome measures: Excessive infant crying, defined as crying ≥3 h/day on average in the past week. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for 2921 (vitamin B-12) and 2622 (folate) women.Vitamin B-12 concentration (categorized into quintiles) was associated with excessive infant crying after adjustment for maternal age, parity, ethnicity, education, maternal smoking and psychological problems (OR[95%CI]: Q1 = 3.31[1.48-7.41]; Q2 = 2.50[1.08-5.77]; Q3 = 2.59[1.12-6.00]; Q4 = 2.77[1.20-6.40]; Q5 = reference). Stratified analysis suggested a stronger association among women with high levels of psychological problems during pregnancy. Folate concentration was not associated with excessive infant crying. Conclusions: First evidence is provided for an early nutritional origin in excessive infant crying. A low maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy could, in theory, affect infant crying behavior through two potential mechanisms: the methionine-homocysteine metabolism and/or the maturation of the sleep-wake rhythm. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Depression in women during their childbearing years is common. Routine depression screening coupled with multidisciplinary collaborative care models integrating case management is paramount. Risk factors for perinatal depression include previous history of depression, interpersonal conflict and limited social support. Antenatal depression may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, such as pre-eclampsia, insufficient weight gain, decreased compliance with prenatal care and premature labor, and continue into postpartum depression, which in turn pose a risk for mother-infant bonding and subsequent child socioemotional development. Currently available literature suggests that overall, the risks of antidepressant use in pregnancy/lactation are small relative to the risks due to maternal untreated illness itself; however, for decision-making, careful individualized risk-benefit analysis and informed consent from the affected patient are crucial. Current guidelines suggest nonpharmacological treatments as first-line interventions for mild-to-moderate perinatal illness, while reserving pharmacological treatment for moderate-to-severe illness. Antidepressants, psychotherapies, alternative or complimentary approaches, and involving family in the supportive care of perinatal women are all effective strategies. More research is needed to determine the long-term and developmental effects in children exposed to antidepressants or untreated illness during pregnancy and lactation. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - The fetal brain remains inaccessible to neurophysiological studies. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is being assessed to fill this gap. We performed 40 fetal MEG (fMEG) recordings with gestational ages (GA) ranging from 30 to 37. weeks. The data from each recording were divided into 15 second epochs which in turn were classified as continuous (CO), discontinuous (DC), or artifact. The fetal behavioral state, quiet or active sleep, was determined using previously defined criteria based on fetal movements and heart rate variability. We studied the correlation between the fetal state, the GA and the percentage of CO and DC epochs. We also analyzed the spectral edge frequency (SEF) and studied its relation with state and GA. We found that the odds of a DC epoch decreased by 6% per week as the GA increased (P= 0.0036). This decrease was mainly generated by changes during quiet sleep, which showed 52% DC epochs before a 35. week GA versus 38% after 35. weeks (P= 0.0006). Active sleep did not show a significant change in DC epochs with GA. When both states were compared for MEG patterns within each GA group (before and after 35. weeks), the early group was found to have more DC epochs in quiet sleep (54%) compared to active sleep (42%) (P= 0.036). No significant difference in DC epochs between the two states was noted in the late GA group. Analysis of SEF showed a significant difference (P= 0.0014) before and after a 35. week GA, with higher SEF noted at late GA. However, when both quiet and active sleep states were compared within each GA group, the SEF did not show a significant difference. We conclude that fMEG shows reproducible variations in gross features and frequency content, depending on GA and behavioral state. Fetal MEG is a promising tool to investigate fetal brain physiology and maturation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is involved in the generation and maintenance of waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, forming part of the reticular activating system. The PPN receives glutamatergic afferents from other mesopontine nuclei, and glutamatergic input is believed to be involved in the generation of arousal states. We tested the hypothesis that, from postnatal days 9 to 17 in the rat, there are developmental changes in the glutamate receptor subtypes that contribute to the responses of PPN neurons. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted using brainstem slices from 9- to 17-day-old rats. All cells (types I, II, and III; randomly selected or thalamic-projecting) responded to bath application of the glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and kainic acid (KA). A developmental decrease in the contribution of the NMDA receptor and developmental increase in the contribution of the KA receptor was observed following electrical stimulation-induced glutamate input. These changes were also observed following bath application in different cell types (randomly selected vs. thalamic-projecting). KA bath application produced an increase in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and a decrease in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), suggesting that presynaptic KA autoreceptors may decrease the probability of synaptic glutamate input. In contrast, NMDA application produced no changes in the PPR or mEPSCs. Changes in glutamatergic excitability of PPN cell types could underlie the developmental decrease in REM sleep. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Migraine is a disorder with variable natural history. In some sufferers, migraine evolves over time into a state of headaches on more days than not. This process of migraine chronification is poorly understood, but risk factors have been clearly identified. Herein, we first discuss the role of heritability and of genetic risk factors on migraine chronification. We follow with a discussion of the role of comorbid conditions and environmental exposures. We suggest that clinicians consider risk factor modification as part of migraine management, aspiring to not just relieve current pain and disability, but to avoid migraine progression. Reducing attack frequency, avoiding medication overuse, appropriately using preventive drugs and behavioral therapies, and encouraging weight loss should be part of migraine therapy to improve current pain and disability and also to avoid future pain and disability by preventing chronification. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - Duplications of the Xq28 chromosome region resulting in functional disomy are associated with a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by infantile hypotonia, severe developmental delay, progressive neurological impairment, absent speech, and proneness to infections. Increased expression of the dosage-sensitive MECP2 gene is considered responsible for the severe neurological impairments observed in affected individuals. Although cytogenetically visible duplications of Xq28 are well documented in the published literature, recent advances using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) led to the detection of an increasing number of microduplications spanning MECP2. In rare cases, duplication results from intrachromosomal rearrangement between the X and Y chromosomes. We report six cases with sex chromosome rearrangements involving duplication of MECP2. Cases 1-4 are unbalanced rearrangements between X and Y, resulting in MECP2 duplication. The additional Xq material was translocated to Yp in three cases (cases 1-3), and to the heterochromatic region of Yq12 in one case (case 4). Cases 5 and 6 were identified by array CGH to have a loss in copy number at Xp and a gain in copy number at Xq28 involving the MECP2 gene. In both cases, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed a recombinant X chromosome containing the duplicated material from Xq28 on Xp, resulting from a maternal pericentric inversion. These cases add to a growing number of MECP2 duplications that have been detected by array CGH, while demonstrating the value of confirmatory chromosome and FISH studies for the localization of the duplicated material and the identification of complex rearrangements. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - Depression and pathological anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent neurological diseases in the world and can be precipitated and exacerbated by stress. Prenatal stress alters both behavioral and endocrine responses to stressful stimuli in later life. We have previously observed increased basal acoustic startle response (ASR) in Wistar rats exposed to stress or dexamethasone (DEX) in utero when tested during the light phase of the circadian rhythm, and decreased prepulse inhibition (PPI) in similar animals tested during the dark phase of the cycle. We speculated that this observation of increased basal startle might be influenced by diurnal phase. In the present study, adult female Sprague Dawley rats, stressed prenatally with DEX (200 μg/kg, gestational days 14-21) and postnatally by blood sampling under restraint, were tested for the ASR during both circadian phases (light and dark). Basal startle was increased in animals tested both during the light and the dark phases of the cycle. We hereby replicated our earlier findings in a new strain and laboratory, thus strengthening the validity of our model regarding prenatal stress effects on ASR in female offspring. Our results indicate that observation of increased basal ASR is not solely dependent on diurnal phase. We found no difference in hippocampal glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid receptor expression between groups. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Postpartum weight retention affects many women and increases the risk of becoming overweight. The research objective was to study modifiable factors contributing to weight change at one year postpartum. Methods. In this prospective cohort, postpartum behavior, such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, and intake of total energy, total fat and saturated fatty acids of 118 Dutch women were assessed in 2003/2004 by self-report at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months postpartum. Mean postpartum scores were computed for the behavioral measures. In linear regression models it was determined which factors were associated with average weight change from before pregnancy to one year postpartum. Furthermore, factors associated with substantial postpartum weight retention ( 5 kg) were also studied in logistic regression models. Results: At one year postpartum, the average weight of participants had increased by 0.9 kg (SD 4.4). Moreover, 20% of the women retained 5 kg. Women who perceived themselves more physically active than others were almost ten times less likely to retain 5 kg than women who perceived themselves equally active (OR = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.02 - 0.66). Exceeding the guideline for saturated fatty acid intake (OR = 3.40, 95%CI: 1.04 - 11.11), total gestational weight gain (OR = 1.14/kg, 95%CI: 1.01 - 1.27), and not having completed post high school education (OR = 5.13, 95%CI: 1.66 - 15.90) increased the odds of retaining 5 kg. Conclusions: Since one in five women had substantial weight retention postpartum, effective interventions for the prevention of weight retention are much needed. Future studies should evaluate whether interventions focusing on the identified modifiable postpartum factors are successful in reducing weight retention after childbirth. © 2011 Althuizen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey contrast and motion information to visual brain centers. Approximately 2% of RGCs are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs), express melanopsin and are necessary for light to modulate specific physiological processes in mice. The ipRGCs directly target the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to photoentrain circadian rhythms, and the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) to mediate the pupillary light response. How and when this ipRGC circuitry develops is unknown.Results: Here, we show that some ipRGCs follow a delayed developmental time course relative to other image-forming RGCs. Specifically, ipRGC neurogenesis extends beyond that of other RGCs, and ipRGCs begin innervating the SCN at postnatal ages, unlike most RGCs, which innervate their image-forming targets embryonically. Moreover, the appearance of ipRGC axons in the OPN coincides precisely with the onset of the pupillary light response.Conclusions: Some ipRGCs differ not only functionally but also developmentally from RGCs that mediate pattern-forming vision. © 2011 McNeill et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Fetal and neonatal studies show that they can remember frequently recurring sounds. However, existing data can only show retention intervals up to several days after birth. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that auditory memories can last at least six weeks. Experimental fetuses were given precisely controlled exposure to a descending piano melody twice daily during the 35th, 36th, and 37th weeks of gestation. Six weeks later we assessed the cardiac responses of 25 exposed infants and 25 naive control infants, while in quiet sleep, to the descending melody and to an ascending control piano melody. The melodies had precisely inverse contours, but similar spectra, identical duration, tempo and rhythm, thus, almost identical amplitude envelopes. All infants displayed a significant heart rate change. In exposed infants, the descending melody evoked a cardiac deceleration that was twice larger than the decelerations elicited by the ascending melody and by both melodies in control infants. Conclusions/Significance: Thus, 3-weeks of prenatal exposure to a specific melodic contour affects infants 'auditory processing' or perception, i.e., impacts the autonomic nervous system at least six weeks later, when infants are 1-month old. Our results extend the retention interval over which a prenatally acquired memory of a specific sound stream can be observed from 3-4 days to six weeks. The long-term memory for the descending melody is interpreted in terms of enduring neurophysiological tuning and its significance for the developmental psychobiology of attention and perception, including early speech perception, is discussed. © 2011 Granier-Deferre et al.

AB  - Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are more common in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women. It is likely that physiology of pregnancy predisposes to the development or worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, but some physiologic changes may also be protective against the development of this disease. Clinical presentation may be less predictive of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy than in the non-pregnant population; nonetheless, snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Treatment strategies are similar to the nonpregnant population, however, pregnancy-specific scenarios may arise and these subtleties are addressed in this review. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Obesity is a worldwide health problem and its prevalence is reaching epidemic proportions. As obesity does not spare women of childbearing age, obstetric anesthesiologists will increasingly be exposed to the challenges of anesthesia in this population. The purpose of this article is to give the reader a thorough understanding of the anesthetic implications of obesity relating to cesarean deliveries. Obesity is associated with hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea and other comorbidities. It increases the risk of cesarean delivery, postpartum wound infections and deep venous thromboembolism. Obese parturients are prone to anesthetic complications such as aspiration of gastric contents, difficult monitoring, positioning, airway management and challenging neuraxial techniques. A thorough precesarean delivery preparation should include an evaluation by an anesthesiologist for women with a BMI over 40 kg/m2 and institution of an antacid prophylaxis protocol, thromboprophylaxis and antibiotic prophylaxis. Regional anesthesia should ideally be used in all obese parturients unless contraindicated. The goals of postpartum care include efficacious analgesia, physiotherapy and early mobilization. Monitoring and vigilance in an intensive care unit or step-down units should be considered for morbidly obese women. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - The study aimed to identify risk factors of sleep disturbances in 2-month-old infants. It comprised 198 infants (86 boys, 112 girls) who were singletons born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2007. The mothers were asked to complete questionnaires addressing major infant, maternal, and demographic characteristics. Preexisting medical records were scrutinized. The mothers were requested to describe infant sleep troubles. The baby was defined as having sleep disturbances, if he or she had five or more episodes per week characterized by settling difficulties at bedtime (could not fall asleep within 20 minutes after being put to bed) or frequent night awakenings (woke up more than twice during the night). Of 198 infants, 96 (48.5%) reportedly had sleep disturbances. In the univariate analysis, the factors associated with increased risk of sleep disturbances were (odds ratio, OR; (95% CI)) first birth order 3.55 (1.90-6.69), previous abortions 2.08 (1.14-3.83), maternal vaginal bleedings during pregnancy 2.58 (1.07-6.29), maternal allergies 2.44 (1.17-5.14), and maternal smoking during pregnancy 2.45 (1.27-4.77). Stepwise backward logistic regression analysis identified combinations of the factors that best predicted the risk of infant sleep disturbances: first birth order, previous abortions, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. After inclusion into the multiple logistic regression equation, these factors provided moderate prediction (pseudo R2=0.15). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed, and the area under the ROC curve was equal to 0.6636 (95% CI=0.5905-0.7406), p(area=0.5) &lt;0.05. Findings from the maternal history may help to predict sleep disturbances in young infants. © 2011 Springer.

AB  - Converging evidence indicates that pregnant women report experiencing problems with memory, but the results of studies using objective measures are ambiguous. The present study investigated potential reason(s) for the discrepancy between findings of subjective and objective memory deficits, as well as potential source(s) of pregnant women's problems with memory. Sixty-one pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women completed a series of memory tests which included field and laboratory measures of prospective memory. Three standardized questionnaires were used to assess subjective aspects of memory. The influence of Cortisol, depressed mood, anxiety, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on pregnancy-related deficits was also examined. The findings revealed objective pregnancy-related deficits on two of the field measures of prospective memory. Pregnancy-related subjective deficits were also detected on all of the questionnaires. In contrast, no objective pregnancy-related deficits were found on the laboratory measures of memory. Increased physical symptoms accounted for one of the objective deficits in memory, while depressed mood and physical symptoms accounted for two of the subjective memory deficits. Collectively, these findings suggest that pregnant women experience everyday life problems with memory that are not readily detected in the laboratory environment. The predominant use of laboratory tests may explain the myriad of previous failures to detect objective deficits in pregnant women's memory. © 2011 Canadian Psychological Association.

AB  - Objective. To identify predictors as free-text markers for mental ill-health from an electronic perinatal record (EMR) system and the association with emergency cesarean section (CS) in nulliparous women. Material and methods. This was a population-based study using an EMR system, set in the catchment area of Malmö University Hospital in Sweden. Of 10 662 nulliparous women presenting with a singleton cephalic baby for vaginal delivery between 2001 and 2006, 6 467 women with complete EMRs were selected. A free-text search of markers for mental ill-health was carried out, and results were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Eleven markers for mental ill-health were tested with Cohen's kappa for agreement and used as exposure variables. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for emergency CS, and adjusted for maternal age, diabetes, epidural anesthesia and gestational weeks <37 and >41 by a multivariate logistic regression model with vaginal delivery as the reference. Results. Three markers identified from the EMR system reached statistically significant associations with an increased risk for emergency CS in nulliparous women: stress, adjusted OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.34-2.06); sleep, adjusted OR 1.57 (95% CI 1.14-2.16); and worry, adjusted OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.10-1.79). Conclusion. Free-text words in medical records that indicated stress, sleep disturbances or worry predicted increased adjusted OR for emergency CS in first-time mothers. Recognizing pregnant women's reporting of their mental health status could have a predictive bearing on delivery outcomes. © 2011 The Authorsa Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica© 2011 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - Objective: Animal studies have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal maternal stress on the offspring. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the effect of prenatal depression on newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables. Method: We screened 205 pregnant women from April 2004 to November 2006 for depressive symptoms. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group (n = 34) was based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group (n = 79) by routine screening at 2 and 6 months. Newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, respectively. Results: Despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (eg, at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery), prenatal depression highly correlated with anxiety and stress scores. Male newborns of mothers with prenatal depression had lower scores than controls on the motor skills and regulation of states NBAS clusters (P = .03 and P = .026, respectively). At 1 year, infants of prenatally depressed mothers presented higher scores on generalized anxiety (P = .002), particularly in males (P = .009); activity/impulsivity (P = .042); and sleep problems (P = .023) than controls. Conclusions: As in animal studies, depression during pregnancy may affect infant development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress, and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to under standing the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders. © Copyright 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Rationale: Exposure of the immature mammalian brain to stress factors, including stress levels of glucocorticoids, either prenatally or postnatally, is regarded as a major regulatory factor in short- and long-term brain function and, in human, as a major aetiological factor in neuropsychiatric disorders. Experimental human studies are not feasible and animal studies are required to demonstrate causality and elucidate mechanisms. A number of studies have been conducted and reviewed in rodents but there are relatively few studies in primates. Objectives: Here we present an overview of our published studies and some original data on the effects of: (1) prenatal stress on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) re/activity and hippocampus neuroanatomy in juvenile-adolescent rhesus macaques; (2) prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) on HPA activity, behaviour and prefrontal cortex neuroanatomy in infant-adolescent common marmosets; (3) postnatal daily parental separation stress on HPA re/activity, behaviour, sleep and hippocampus and prefrontal cortex neuroanatomy in infant-adolescent common marmoset. Results: Prenatal stress increased basal cortisol levels and reduced neurogenesis in macaque. Prenatal DEX was without effect on HPA activity and reduced social play and skilled motor behaviour in marmoset. Postnatal social stress increased basal cortisol levels, reduced social play, increased awakening and reduced hippocampal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor expression in marmoset. Conclusions: Perinatal stress-related environmental events exert short- and long-term effects on HPA function, behaviour and brain status in rhesus macaque and common marmoset. The mechanisms mediating the enduring effects remain to be elucidated, with candidates including increased basal HPA function and epigenetic programming. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - Adult neurogenesis occurs in two privileged microenvironments, the hippocampal subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) along the lateral ventricle. This review focuses on accumulating evidence suggesting that the activity of specific brain regions or bodily states influences SVZ cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin have been shown to have long-range effects through neuronal projections into the SVZ. Local γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have demonstrated effects on SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, but an extra-niche source of these neurotransmitters remains to be explored and options will be discussed. There is also accumulating evidence that diseases and bodily states such as Alzheimer's disease, seizures, sleep and pregnancy influence SVZ cell proliferation. With such complex behavior and environmentally-driven factors that control subregion-specific activity, it will become necessary to account for overlapping roles of multiple neurotransmitter systems on neurogenesis when developing cell therapies or drug treatments. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To describe the epidemiological profile, risk factors and best strategies for diagnosing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in a developing country. Methods: Population-based, case-control study with children born between January 1st, 2001, and December 31st, 2003, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, who were allocated into three groups: SIDS cases (33), explained death controls (192), and living controls (192). Children in the latter two groups were age- and sex-paired with SIDS cases. Families in which an infant had died at home within the first year of life were identified, and the information available on death certificates and autopsy reports was compared to confirm the diagnosis of SIDS. Explained death controls consisted of infants who had died at city hospitals, and living controls were selected in the same neighborhood as SIDS cases. All parents were interviewed to obtain information on children's health and sleep habits. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors in the study population. Results: The incidence of SIDS in the population assessed was 0.55/1,000 live births. The analysis revealed the following risk factors: ethnicity (characterized by self-reported black skin color), prematurity, low birth weight, adolescent mother, smoking during pregnancy, and family income of less than one minimum wage. Ninety-four percent of SIDS cases were misdiagnosed in the death certificate. Conclusions: Although SIDS was misdiagnosed in official death certificates, the epidemiological profile is similar to the literature, as well as risk factors, which could be reduced with preventive campaigns. Investigating SIDS in developing countries requires special strategies to avoid misdiagnosis. Copyright © 2011 by Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

AB  - We describe a patient with multiple congenital anomalies including tracheobronchomalacia, CT-proven metopic craniosynostosis, glandular hypospadias and severe ventral chordee, torticollis, esotropia, strabismus, fifth finger clinodactyly, hallux valgus, and global developmental delay. Using high resolution chromosomal microarray analysis, we identified a de novo deletion of 555kb on chromosome 16p13.3, 444kb telomeric to the CREBBP gene and 623kb centromeric of PKD1. Review of the literature revealed numerous reports of individuals with deletions involving adjacent regions including CREBBP, but only one overlapping with this isolated region of 16p13.3. Haploinsufficiency for one or more of the 25 candidate genes in the deleted genomic region may be responsible for these clinical features. No copy number variants (CNVs) span the entire region, but several small CNVs within the 555kb genomic region reduce the likelihood for effects due to haploinsufficiency to 18 genes. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Decomposition of multivariate time series data into independent source components forms an important part of preprocessing and analysis of time-resolved data in neuroscience. We briefly review the available tools for this purpose, such as Factor Analysis (FA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), then we show how linear state space modelling, a methodology from statistical time series analysis, can be employed for the same purpose. State space modelling, a generalization of classical ARMA modelling, is well suited for exploiting the dynamical information encoded in the temporal ordering of time series data, while this information remains inaccessible to FA and most ICA algorithms. As a result, much more detailed decompositions become possible, and both components with sharp power spectrum, such as alpha components, sinusoidal artifacts, or sleep spindles, and with broad power spectrum, such as FMRI scanner artifacts or epileptic spiking components, can be separated, even in the absence of prior information. In addition, three generalizations are discussed, the first relaxing the independence assumption, the second introducing non-stationarity of the covariance of the noise driving the dynamics, and the third allowing for non-Gaussianity of the data through a non-linear observation function. Three application examples are presented, one electrocardigram time series and two electroencephalogram (EEG) time series. The two EEG examples, both from epilepsy patients, demonstrate the separation and removal of various artifacts, including hum noise and FMRI scanner artifacts, and the identification of sleep spindles, epileptic foci, and spiking components. Decompositions obtained by two ICA algorithms are shown for comparison. © 2010 Society for Mathematical Biology.

AB  - The perception of speech and music requires processing of variations in spectra and amplitude over different time intervals. Near-term fetuses can discriminate acoustic features, such as frequencies and spectra, but whether they can process complex auditory streams, such as speech sequences and more specifically their temporal variations, fast or relatively slow acoustic variations, is unclear. We recorded the cardiac activity of 82 near-term fetuses (38weeks GA) in quiet sleep during a silent control condition and four 15 s streams presented at 90dB SPL Leq: two piano melodies with opposite contours, a natural Icelandic sentence and a chimera of the sentence - all its spectral information was replaced with broadband noise, leaving its specific temporal variations in amplitude intact without any phonological information. All stimuli elicited a heart rate deceleration. The response patterns to the melodies were the same and differed significantly from those observed with the Icelandic sentence and its chimera, which did not differ. The melodies elicited a monophasic heart rate deceleration, indicating a stimulus orienting reflex while the Icelandic and its chimera evoked a sustained lower magnitude response, indicating a sustained attentional response or more focused information processing. A conservative interpretation of the data is that near-term fetuses can perceive sound streams and the rapid temporal variations in amplitude that are specific to speech sounds with no spectral variations at all. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Cantú syndrome, a rare disorder of congenital hypertrichosis, characteristic facial anomalies, cardiomegaly, and osteochondrodysplasia was first described in 1982 by Cantú. Twenty-three cases of Cantú syndrome have been reported to date. The pathogenesis of this rare autosomal dominant condition is unknown. We describe 10 patients with Cantú syndrome (9 new cases and the long-term follow-up of a 10th case reported by Robertson in 1999) comparing the phenotype with that of the previously reported cases. We describe how the distinctive facial appearance evolves with time and report several new findings including recurrent infections with low immunoglobulin levels and gastric bleeding in some of our patients. The cardiac manifestations include patent ductus arteriosus, septal hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusions. They may follow a benign course, but of the 10 cases we report, 4 patients required surgical closure of the patent ductus arteriosus and 1 patient a pericardectomy. Long-term follow-up of these patients has shown reassuring neuro-developmental outcome and the emergence of a behavior phenotype including obsessive traits and anxiety. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Subjects: The study sample, recruited in 2002, was composed of 649 first-time pregnant women and their children, drawn from public teaching hospitals in the Adelaide, Australia, areaapproximately 80% of all those approached to participate. The recruited women had a mean age of 25.4 ± 5.4 years. The authors stated that most of the women were recruited within the fifth to seventh month of pregnancy. Key Exposure/Study Factor: The key study factor was the administration of a program of anticipatory guidance to first-time mothers. Subjects were randomized into either an intervention test group (anticipatory guidance) or a nonintervention control group. Groups had approximately equal numbers. The study was completely unblinded. Subjects knew their group assignment before giving consent. 1 The same investigator recruited the subjects, administered the interventions, and served as dental examiner. The test group received written guidance given at (1) the time of enrollment (during pregnancy), (2) child age 6 months, and (3) child age 12 months. The article states that the first information set emphasized oral hygiene and nutrition during pregnancy, the importance of the primary teeth, pacifiers, and childs sleeping patterns. The second and third information sets were said to cover tooth eruption, oral hygiene, and nutrition. With each of these 3 sets of information, the test group also received a mouth rinse (not further defined) for the mother to use during pregnancy, a toothbrush for the mother, and a finger toothbrush for the child. The test group was further randomly divided into 2 approximately equal size subgroups. One of these subgroups received an additional intervention in the form of a structured telephone consultation at child age 6 to 12 months. This telephone consultation was described as focusing on the childs oral hygiene and dietary habits via a series of 18 question-prompts that were based on the written guidance material. The article states that varying additional consultation occurred depending on what specific issues arose during the first telephone consultation. Allwomen (both test and control groups) were given a questionnaire at time of recruitment (baseline) and at the time of their childs dental exam, planned for 18 months. The baseline questionnaire contained 90 items that assessed the womans health habits, their perception of their oral health, overall health, and their psychological well-being. The follow-up questionnaire, given at the time of the childs oral examination, assessed feeding practices, oral hygiene, sleep patterns, teething, and the childs general health. The test group was given an additional 21-item questionnaire that asked for the mothers assessment of the intervention material. Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome measure was severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) at a mean age of 20.1 months for the intervention group, and at 20.4 months for the control group (no ranges or standard deviations reported by group). S-ECC was defined, using National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) criteria, 2,3 as the presence of one or more carious lesions on the labial surfaces of the maxillary incisor teeth. Noncavitated lesions were included in this definition. Main Results: The principal finding was that 1.7% of the children in the intervention test group were diagnosed with S-ECC, as compared with 9.6% of the children in the nonintervention control group (P &gt; .01). There was no clinically or statistically significant difference in S-ECC outcome between the 2 test subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression analysisadjusted for age of child at examination; mothers age, education, and employment; number of parents; and whether Australian bornestimated that children in the control group were nearly 7 times as likely to have S-ECC as compared with the test children (odds ratio [OR] = 6.8, P &gt;.001). The relative odds of developing S-ECC increased by 30% for each month of age at time of examination (OR = 1.3, P &gt; .01). Being a single parent as compared with a 2-parent family also increased S-ECC risk (OR = 3.3, P &gt; .05). Ninety percent of the mothers in the test group indicated that they thought the program was either "good" or "very good." Conclusions: The authors conclude that their intervention program of anticipatory guidance was successful in reducing the incidence of S-ECC in very young children. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although humans are genetically very similar to the evolutionarily related nonhuman hominids (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans), comparative studies suggest a surprising number of uniquely human differences in the incidence and/or severity of biomedical conditions. Some differences are due to anatomical changes that occurred during human evolution. However, many cannot be explained either by these changes or by known environmental factors. Because chimpanzees were long considered models for human disease, it is important to be aware of these differences, which appear to have been deemphasized relative to similarities. We focus on the pathophysiology and pathobiology of biomedical conditions that appear unique to humans, including several speculative possibilities that require further study. We pay particular attention to the possible contributions of uniquely human changes in the biology of cell-surface sialic acids and the proteins that recognize them. We also discuss the metabolic incorporation of a diet-derived nonhuman sialic acid, which generates a novel xeno-autoantigen reaction, and chronic inflammation known as xenosialitis.

AB  - Inadequate sleep and sleep disorders have important adverse consequences on multiple systems. This review covers three areas: (a) Genetic determinants of sleep disorders. Common gene variants with small effects have been identified for both restless legs syndrome and narcolepsy with cataplexy. Rare variants with large effects have been found in familial phase advance syndrome and in subjects with short sleep durations. (b) Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is an oxidative stress disorder. Prospective cohort studies show an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with untreated severe OSA. (c) The impact of sleep disorders on obesity and diabetes. Inadequate sleep results in changes in insulin resistance and in hormone levels leading to increases in appetite. Hence, inadequate sleep is associated with development of obesity. OSA is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance; treatment of OSA can improve insulin sensitivity. © 2011 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Late in utero exposure to antidepressants has been suspected of compromising neonatal adaptation. Objectives: To analyze published information on the risk of neonatal withdrawal phenomena associated with antidepressant use during late pregnancy. Methods: Computerized searches on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ENBASE, and Cochrane Library (up to October 2010) were performed for selecting literature information published in English and investigating the safety of antidepressants when used during late pregnancy (50 articles). Results: Antidepressant treatment during late pregnancy may significantly increase the rate of neonatal discontinuation symptoms of various degree of severity. Conclusions: Further, prospective, large cohort studies are needed to clarify whether such symptoms can be prevented by suspending antidepressant treatment within the final month before parturition. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Background: The treatment of breastfeeding mothers with depression raises several dilemmas, including the possible risk of drug exposure through breast milk for the infant. This article provides background information and presents practical advice and recommendations for the clinician dealing with the treatment of depression and related disorders in the postpartum period. Methods: An electronic search for relevant articles was performed. As the use of tricyclic antidepressants has considerably decreased during the last decade and no new information on breastfeeding has emerged for the tricyclics in this period, this review exclusively focuses on the newer, non-tricyclic compounds. Results: Most newer antidepressants produce very low or undetectable plasma concentrations in nursing infants. The highest infant plasma levels have been reported for fluoxetine, citalopram and venlafaxine. Suspected adverse effects have been reported in a few infants, particularly for fluoxetine and citalopram. Conclusions: Infant exposure of antidepressants through breast milk is generally low to very low. We consider that when antidepressant treatment is indicated in women with postpartum depression, they should not be advised to discontinue breastfeeding. Paroxetine and sertraline are most likely suitable first-line agents. Although some concern has been expressed for fluoxetine, citalopram and venlafaxine, we nevertheless consider that if the mother has been treated with one of these drugs during pregnancy, breast-feeding could also be allowed during continued treatment with these drugs in the postpartum period. However, an individual risk-benefit assessment should always be performed. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are modulated in a variety of peripheral tissues, including in the uterus where endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) undergo proliferation and differentiation (decidualization) during gestation. Here the authors focused on circadian rhythms in UESCs during implantation and decidualization in rodents. As revealed by analyses of cultured UESCs from pregnant Per2 promoterdLuc transgenic rats, Per2 oscillation of ∼24h was observed in response to dexamethasone. Per2 oscillation was enhanced in UESCs during implantation, whereas they were attenuated during decidualization. In vivo studies showed that PER2 protein in the uteri displayed a peak at zeitberger time 4 (ZT 4) (day 4.50 of gestation) and a trough at ZT 12 (day 4.83), indicating its circadian rhythmicity. Conversely, no significant circadian rhythm of the PER2 protein was observed during decidualization. Fluorescent immunohistochemical studies also supported circadian rhythmicity of the PER2 protein in its intracellular distribution. In accordance with Per2 mRNA expression, a circadian rhythm of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) gene expression, having several E-box or E-boxlike sites at the upstream of the transcription start site, was observed during implantation, showing a peak at ZT 0 and a trough at ZT 12. In contrast, Vegf mRNA expression displayed no circadian rhythm during decidualization. Collectively, the present results prove that Per2 oscillation is down-regulated in UESCs during decidualization. It is strongly suggested that cellular differentiation in UESCs interferes with circadian clockwork. Copyright © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - This study evaluated closed-loop insulin delivery with a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm during early (12-16 weeks) and late gestation (28-32 weeks) in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Ten women with type 1 diabetes (age 31 years, diabetes duration 19 years, BMI 24.1 kg/m2, booking A1C 6.9%) were studied over 24 h during early (14.8 weeks) and late pregnancy (28.0 weeks). A nurse adjusted the basal insulin infusion rate from continuous glucose measurements (CGM), fed into the MPC algorithm every 15 min. Mean glucose and time spent in target (63-140 mg/dL), hyperglycemic (>140 to ≥180 mg/dL), and hypoglycemic (<63 to ≤50 mg/dL) were calculated using plasma and sensor glucose measurements. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare glucose control during early and late gestation. RESULTS - During closed-loop insulin delivery, median (interquartile range) plasma glucose levels were 117 (100.8-154.8) mg/dL in early and 126 (109.8-140.4)mg/dL in late gestation (P = 0.72). The overnight mean (interquartile range) plasma glucose time in target was 84% (50-100%) in early and 100% (94-100%) in late pregnancy (P = 0.09). Overnight mean (interquartile range) time spent hyperglycemic (>140 mg/dL) was 7%(0-40%) in early and 0%(0-6%) in late pregnancy (P = 0.25) and hypoglycemic (<63 mg/dL) was 0% (0-3%) and 0% (0-0%), respectively (P = 0.18). Postprandial glucose control, glucose variability, insulin infusion rates, and CGM sensor accuracy were no different in early or late pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS - MPC algorithm performance was maintained throughout pregnancy, suggesting that overnight closed-loop insulin delivery could be used safely during pregnancy. More work is needed to achieve optimal postprandial glucose control. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a cross-cultural form of major depressive disorder that affects some 13% of women and can have serious health consequences for both the mother and her child. Easy-to-use, reliable, self-administered screening tools are available. PPD may have a variety of etiologies, which include changing plasma levels of estrogen and progesterone, postpartum hypothyroidism, sleep deprivation, or difficult life circumstances. Standard treatments for PPD include psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, treatment of a thyroid condition or insomnia, or even regular exercise or massage may also be beneficial. PPD is underdiagnosed, therefore more screening is needed. Obstetricians and pediatricians have a unique opportunity to test women for PPD, but general practitioners may encounter patients with undiagnosed PPD, too. These physicians could positively impact the lives of depressed mothers and their children by identifying them, then treating or providing referrals for care as appropriate.

AB  - Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) has two main properties, the presence of co-ordinated bursts of activity, indicative of many nerve fibres firing at a similar time, and entrainment of the bursts to the cardiac cycle, due to inhibitory input from baroreceptors to a network of cell groups within the CNS. Although this patterning is used as a 'gold standard' for the identification of successful nerve recordings, the maturation of these basic features of SNA from fetal life to adulthood has not been investigated. Using a telemetry-based nerve amplifier, renal SNA (RSNA) was recorded in preterm (99 ± 1 days gestation; term 147 days) and near-term fetal sheep (119 ± 0 days gestation), without anaesthesia or paralysis, and contrasted with RSNA recorded in adult sheep. All three age groups showed a classic bursting pattern of RSNA and co-ordination of bursts with the cardiac cycle. However, the delay between diastole and the next peak in RSNA was longest in preterm fetuses (319 ± 1 ms), compared with near-term fetuses (250 ± 13 ms), and shortest in the adult sheep (174 ± 38 ms). This was independent of the maturational decrease in heart rate. The near-term fetuses showed a marked but sleep-state-dependent increase in resting RSNA compared with preterm fetuses. Although entrainment with the pressure pulse suggests that the intricate circuitry within the CNS is developed in the preterm fetus, the decrease in the length of the delay suggests continuing maturation of this key feature of RSNA in the last third of gestation and after birth. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - The effect of in utero exposure to a maternal high-fat diet on the peripheral circadian system of the fetus is unknown. Using mRNA copy number analysis, we report that the components of the peripheral circadian machinery are transcribed in the nonhuman primate fetal liver in an intact phase-antiphase fashion and that Npas2, a paralog of the Clock transcription factor, serves as the rate-limiting transcript by virtue of its relative low abundance (10- to 1000-fold lower). We show that exposure to a maternal high-fat diet in utero significantly alters the expression of fetal hepatic Npas2 (up to 7.1-fold, P<0.001) compared with that in control diet-exposed animals and is reversible in fetal offspring from obese dams reversed to a control diet (1.3-fold, P>0.05). Although the Npas2 promoter remains largely unmethylated, differential Npas2 promoter occupancy of acetylation of fetal histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ac) occurs in response to maternal high-fat diet exposure compared with control diet-exposed animals. Furthermore, we find that disruption of Npas2 is consistent with high-fat diet exposure in juvenile animals, regardless of in utero diet exposure. In summary, the data suggest that peripheral Npas2 expression is uniquely vulnerable to diet exposure. © FASEB.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to profile sleep patterns during pregnancy according to body mass index (BMI) and to correlate labour outcomes with both BMI and hours sleep. Data were collected from 200 postpartum women detailing sleep characteristics before and during pregnancy. A validated sleep questionnaire was employed, which comprised of questions about sleep apnoea, snoring, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. Descriptive analyses were used. With advancing gestation, the mean (SD) number of hours sleep per night declined: pre-pregnancy 8.1 (SD 1.4); 1st trimester 8.3 (SD 1.8); 2nd trimester 7.7 (SD 1.7) and 3rd trimester 6.7 (SD 2.2). In the 18.5 24.9 BMI group, there was a marked difference in hours sleep per night from pre-pregnancy to 1st (8.6 h, p=0.007), 2nd (7.9 h, p=0.023) and 3rd (6.4 h, p=0.000) trimesters in primiparous women. In the 25 29.9 BMI group, there was a difference from pre-pregnancy to 3rd trimester (p=0.000). These changes were not reflected in a clinically significant difference in birth weight or mode of delivery. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Background Previous studies of the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) on blood pressure have yielded inconsistent results. Objectives To examine the impact of HT on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. Methods A total of 67 postmenopausal Korean women (age 57.1±5.7 years) received 2 months of HT consisting of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE, 0.625 mg/day) with or without micronized progesterone (100 mg/day). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at baseline and after HT. Subjects were divided into those with normal blood pressure (n=25) and those with high blood pressure (n=42), based on their baseline daytime blood pressure. Results Parity and body mass index were higher in the group with high blood pressure than in the group with normal blood pressure. For both systolic and diastolic blood pressures throughout the day, significant negative correlations were observed between basal blood pressure and blood pressure difference after HT. During the daytime period, HT increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the subjects with normal blood pressure and decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures in those with high blood pressure. When micronized progesterone was added to the CEE treatment, the increase in daytime blood pressure in the group with normal blood pressure was abolished, and the decrease in systolic blood pressure throughout the day in the group with high blood pressure was potentiated. Conclusions HT had either blood pressure-elevating or blood pressure-lowering effects in postmenopausal Korean women, depending on basal blood pressure. CEE increased the daytime blood pressure in women with normal blood pressure, but reduced it in women with high blood pressure. Micronized progesterone may provide beneficial effects on blood pressure when combined with CEE. © 2011 International Menopause Society.

AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports of sleep disturbance during pregnancy are abundant; however, objective measurement of sleep changes has so far produced conflicting results. Aims: To objectively measure sleep architecture and investigate subjective sleep quality in the first and third trimester of pregnancy, when compared to the nonpregnant state. Methods: Twenty-seven women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 21 women in the first trimester of pregnancy and 24 nonpregnant control women underwent overnight polysomnography and completed questionnaires regarding sleep quality and mood. Results: Women in the third trimester of pregnancy had poorer sleep efficiency, more awakenings, less stage 4 sleep, more stage 1 sleep and fewer minutes in rapid eye movement sleep when compared to the control group. Cortical arousals were seen more often during pregnancy, particularly in response to respiratory events and limb movements. Sleep during the first trimester was affected to a lesser extent, with more wake time after sleep onset and less stage 4 sleep when compared to the controls. Conclusions: Sleep during pregnancy is compromised by higher amounts of wake and cortical arousals leading to sleep fragmentation, with greater amounts of light sleep and less deep sleep. Mood state did not have an effect on sleep. Given the impact of sleep on well-being, this study increases our understanding of the characteristics of sleep during pregnancy, to help recognise when severe sleep disruption may warrant referral to a specialist for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. © 2010 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

AB  - Background. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring and asthma are known comorbid conditions in men and non-pregnant women. This comorbidity has not been evaluated among pregnant women. We assessed the habitual snoring-asthma relationship among pregnant women. Methods. A cohort of women (N = 1335) were interviewed during pregnancy, and we ascertained participants' asthma status and collected information about habitual snoring, before and during pregnancy. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. Compared with non-asthmatics, the adjusted OR among asthmatics for snoring before pregnancy was 2.13 (95% CI 1.10-4.12). The odds of snoring during early pregnancy was 1.79-fold (OR = 1.79; 95% C; 1.07-3.01). Associations were more pronounced among overweight (≥25 kg/m2) asthmatics (OR = 5.39; 95% CI 2.27-12.75). Conclusions. We report a cross-sectional association of habitual snoring and asthma among pregnant women. If confirmed, pregnant asthmatics may benefit from more vigilant screening and management of OSA or habitual snoring during pregnancy. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Hormonal and physical changes during pregnancy are associated with some sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) such as snoring and sleep apnea, and SRBD are associated with recurrent episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation and increased sympathic activity. We aimed to search the incidence of self-reported snoring and witnessed apnea in the third trimester of pregnancy and to analyze their influence on fetal outcome and gestational hypertension (GH). Methods: Two hundred pregnant women (group 1) during their stay for labor and 200 age-matched control women (group 2) were included in the study. All patients were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire that covers demographic features. We measured neck circumference and performed Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) to determine excessive daytime sleepiness in all patients. Results: The mean age was 27.4 ± 6.7 and 26.3 ± 5.8 for group 1 and 2, respectively. Habitual snoring was detected only in group 1 in 5 patients; 36 pregnant women and 7 control patients reported occasional snoring. Both habitual and occasional snoring was significantly observed to be increased in pregnancy. Witnessed sleep apnea was been observed only in 1 patient in group 1. The mean neck circumference was 37.4 ± 3.2, 35.1 ± 2.1 cm and ESS was 6.7 ± 3.01, 5.1 ± 2.1 for group 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between snoring and GH. There was no significant relationship between all investigated parameters and fetal outcome. We found that excessive weight gain during pregnancy is significantly associated with snoring. Conclusion: We concluded that, although pregnant women, especially who gain excessive weight during their pregnancy, significantly snore more than nonpregnant women, this did not affect fetal outcome. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n = 118 and 122) were randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample 1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with few resources. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 34:7-19, 2011.

AB  - Atypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This review of recent research on prenatal depression suggests that it is a strong predictor of postpartum depression and is more common than postpartum depression. Prenatal depression has been associated with excessive activity and growth delays in the fetus as well as prematurity, low birthweight, disorganized sleep and less responsiveness to stimulation in the neonate. Infants of depressed mothers have difficult temperament, and later in development attentional, emotional and behavioral problems have been noted during childhood and adolescence, as well as chronic illnesses in adulthood. Several variables have confounded the effects of prenatal depression including comorbid anxiety and anger as well as stressful life events. Potential mediating variables are low prenatal maternal dopamine and serotonin levels and elevated cortisol and norepinephrine. The associated intrauterine artery resistance may limit blood flow, oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Some studies also suggest the heritability of developmental problems for the children of prenatally depressed mothers, including ADHD and antisocial behavior. Multivariate, longitudinal research is needed to disentangle these confounding and mediating variables. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the course of pregnancy and on fetal development. There are few studies investigating the outcome of stress reduction interventions on maternal well-being and obstetric outcome. Aims: This study aims (1) to obtain fetal behavioral states (quiet/active sleep, quiet/active wakefulness), (2) to investigate the effects of maternal relaxation on fetal behavior as well as on uterine activity, and (3) to investigate maternal physiological and endocrine parameters as potential underlying mechanisms for maternal-fetal relaxation-transferral. Study design: The behavior of 33 fetuses was analyzed during laboratory relaxation/quiet rest (control group, CG) and controlled for baseline fetal behavior. Potential associations between relaxation/quiet rest and fetal behavior (fetal heart rate (FHR), FHR variation, FHR acceleration, and body movements) and uterine activity were studied, using a computerized cardiotocogram (CTG) system. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and norepinephrine were measured. Results: Intervention (progressive muscle relaxation, PMR, and guided imagery, GI) showed changes in fetal behavior. The intervention groups had higher long-term variation during and after relaxation compared to the CG (p=.039). CG fetuses had more FHR acceleration, especially during and after quiet rest (p=.027). Women in the PMR group had significantly more uterine activity than women in the GI group (p=.011) and than CG women. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones were not associated with fetal behavior. Conclusions: This study indicates that the fetus might participate in maternal relaxation and suggests that GI is superior to PMR. This could especially be true for women who tend to direct their attention to body sensations such as abdominal activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To illustrate the benefits and utility of the child death review (CDR) reporting system when examining risk factors associated with infant death occurring within two subgroups of sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID)-unintentional suffocation and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)-in a large urban county in Wisconsin. Design Retrospective CDR data were analysed, 2007-2008, for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Patients or subjects Unintentional suffocation and SIDS infant deaths under 1 year of age in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, 2007-2008, with a CDR record indicating a death in a sleep environment. Main outcome measure Study examined demographic characteristics, bed-sharing, incident sleep location, position of child when put to sleep, position of child when found, child's usual sleep place, crib in home, and other objects found in sleep environment. Results Unintentional suffocation (n1=11) and SIDS (n1=40) classified deaths with CDR data made up 18% (51/283) of all infant deaths in Milwaukee County from 2007 to 2008. The majority of infants who died of unintentional suffocation (n1=9, 81.8%) or SIDS (n1=26, 65.0%) were black and under the age of 3 months. Bedsharing was involved in most of the unintentional suffocation deaths (n1=10, 90.9%) and the SIDS deaths (n1=28, 70.0%). All unintentional suffocation deaths (n1=11, 100%) and the majority of SIDS deaths (n1=31, 77.5%) took place in a non-crib sleeping environment. Conclusions The study demonstrates how CDR provides enhanced documentation of risk factors to help steer prevention efforts regarding SUID deaths in a community and reaffirms infants in an unsafe sleep environment have an increased risk of death.

AB  - Objective: The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Participants: The Task Force consisted of Endocrine Society-appointed experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society, The European Society of Endocrinology, and The Pituitary Society reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Conclusions: Practice guidelines are presented for diagnosis and treatment of patients with elevated prolactin levels. These include evidence-based approaches to assessing the cause of hyperprolactinemia, treating drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, and managing prolactinomas in nonpregnant and pregnant subjects. Indications and side effects of therapeutic agents for treating prolactinomas are also presented. Copyright © 2011 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - People's childbearing intentions change over the course of their reproductive lives. these changes have been conceptualized as occurring in response to the realization that an individual is unlikely to achieve his or her intended fertility, because of constraints such as the "biological clock" or lack of a partner. in this article we fnd that changes to child-bearing plans are infuenced by a much wider range of factors than this. People change their plans in response to the wishes of their partners, in response to social norms, as the result of repartnering, and as the result of learning about the costs and benefts of parenthood; there are also differences between the factors that infuence men's and women's decisionmaking. in a departure from existing studies in this area, we use a fexible analytical framework that enables us to analyze increases in planned fertility separately from decreases. this allows us to uncover several complexities of the decisionmaking process that would otherwise be hidden, and leads us to conclude that the determinants of increases in planned fertility are not simply equal and opposite to the determinants of decreases. © 2011 The Population Council, Inc.

AB  - Background The role of men in the childbearing decision process and the factors that influence mens childbearing intentions have been relatively unexplored in the literature. This study aimed to describe the factors that strongly influence the childbearing intentions of men and to describe differences in these factors according to mens age group. Methods A telephone survey (response rate 84) was conducted with 495 men between the ages of 20 and 45 living in an urban setting who, at the time of contact, did not have biological children. Men were asked about what factors strongly influence their intention to have children. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to determine if these factors were significantly associated with age.Results:Of those sampled, 86 of men reported that at some point in the future they planned to become a parent. The factors that men considered to be most influential in their childbearing intentions were: the need to be financially secure, their partners interest/desire to have children, their partners suitability to be a parent and their personal interest/desire to have children. Men who were 3545 years old had lower odds of stating that financial security (crude OR: 0.32, 95 CI: 0.180.54) and partners interest in having children (crude OR: 0.57, 95 CI: 0.330.99) were very influential, but had higher odds of stating that their biological clock (crude OR: 4.37, 95 CI: 1.7810.76) was very influential in their childbearing intentions than men in the 2024 year age group.Conclusions:The factors that influence mens intentions about when to become a parent may change with age. Understanding what influences men to have children, and what they understand about reproductive health is important for education, program and policy development. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - All adult mammals examined thus far exhibit sleep bout durations that follow an exponential distribution and wake bout durations that follow a power-law distribution. In altricial rodents such as rats and mice, exponential distributions of sleep bouts are found soon after birth, but the power-law distribution of wake bouts does not emerge until the third postnatal week. Also, both sleep and bouts consolidate across the early postnatal period. It is not known whether similar developmental processes occur in precocial species during the prenatal period. Here we characterize sleep-wake development in a precocial species, the domestic sheep (Ovis aries), from 114 to 148 days gestational age (DGA). Sleep and wake bout durations exhibited exponential distributions throughout the fetal period with some evidence of an emerging exponential-to-power-law transition for wake bouts toward the end of gestation. Both sleep and wake bouts consolidated in an orderly fashion across development and there was little evidence of circadian variation, even in the oldest subjects. These results indicate that similar patterns of sleep-wake organization are found prenatally in a precocial species as are found postnatally in altricial species. Data from more species are needed to fully realize the benefits of a developmental comparative approach for understanding the forces that have shaped the ontogeny and phylogeny of mammalian sleep. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Early life factors can shape the development of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Maternal prenatal stress might constitute such an early environmental factor. As little is known about the relation between maternal prenatal stress and cortisol reactivity in human offspring, we performed a longitudinal study including four assessments of infant cortisol reactivity to stressful events in a non-clinical population. General and pregnancy-related feelings of stress and anxiety, as well as circadian cortisol levels, were measured in 173 mothers in the last trimester of pregnancy. Infant cortisol reactivity was measured at 5 weeks to a bathing session, at 8 weeks to a vaccination, at 5 months to a stressful motherinfant interaction (still face procedure), and at 12 months to a maternal separation (strange situation procedure). Maternal prenatal fear of bearing a handicapped child was a consistent predictor of infant cortisol reactivity. Although the effects were mild, higher fear was significantly related to higher salivary cortisol reactivity to the bathing session and to decreased cortisol reactivity to vaccination and maternal separation. Thus, pregnancy-specific anxieties predict infant cortisol reactivity in the first year of life, but the direction of the effect depends on infant age and/or the nature of the stressor. While this specific anxiety was a better predictor than stress experience or maternal cortisol concentrations, the underlying mechanisms of these associations remain unclear. Future studies should try to incorporate multiple measures of HPA-axis reactivity during development when studying the long-term consequences of maternal prenatal stress. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy is associated with alteration in sleep patterns and quality. We wished to investigate whether pregnant women have a higher likelihood of a positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women ages 18-45 years (n = 4074) presenting for delivery, and non-pregnant women ages 18-45 years (n = 490) presenting for outpatient surgery provided demographic information and completed the Berlin Questionnaire evaluating self-reported snoring and daytime sleepiness. For the pregnant patients, the infant's birth weight and Apgar scores were also recorded. Results: Of the 1439 patients with a positive Berlin Questionnaire, 96 were in the non-pregnant control population versus 1343 in the pregnant population (20% vs. 33%, respectively, P < 0.001; odds ratio 2.0 [95% CI: 1.6-2.5]). There was a positive correlation between infant weight and a positive Berlin Questionnaire. The incidence of preeclampsia was greater (odds ratio 3.9) in the pregnant patients with a positive Berlin Questionnaire as compared with the parturients with a negative Berlin Questionnaire (odds ratio 1.1). Conclusion: Parturients are more likely to have a positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women. This may indicate an increased likelihood of sleep disordered breathing. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The 1950s Golden Age of marriage and the family, with a standard model of family life, was followed by the revolutionary arrival of the pill, provoking the separation of sexuality from reproduction. With the rise of the women's movement (1970s and 1980s), the pill gained further momentum. The promise seemed to be that women had the full freedom of choice. But what impact did the pill really have? Did it fulfil its promise and bring reproductive freedom for women? Gender roles became less rigidly defined, the educational level of women rose, and motherhood was postponed. Expectations began to rise and women started to wait for the right moment to have children. But that magic moment did not come for everyone, while for others a pregnancy failed to come. Women who before had taken much efforts to avoid getting pregnant now despaired at not getting pregnant. They went for assisted reproductive technologies, including prenatal and genetic diagnostics. It means fluctuating between hope and fear, and maybe being confronted with questions like what to do if the test shows a deficiency. In short, the pill contributed to reduce the chances of conception. Two future scenarios are developed, and their pros and cons discussed. Firstly, on the political option, connected to why women feel the wish, need or pressure to postpone. Countries react with various political policies to help families (women in particular) to better cope with labour market and family commitments. Secondly, on the technological option, connected to how to find better ways of postponing. Will egg freezing for example by-pass the biological clock and bring a separation of the labour market career first, followed later on by the family career? Whatever the future, there definitely are physical, emotional, social and economic limits to postponement behaviour. So, priority must be given to the political option. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - To investigate the possible role of inflammation factors in the pathogenesis of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with concurrent obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in pregnant women. Twenty-five pregnant women with IGT and concurrent OSAHS and 35 pregnant women with IGT but not OSAHS were monitored for all night polysomnography (PSG), and the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and the lowest pulse oxygen saturation (LSpO2) were recorded. The body mass index, glycated serum protein (GSP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured in these women. IL-6 and TNF-α levels increased significantly in women with IGT and OSAHS as compared with those in women without OSAHS. AHI showed significant positive correlations to GSP, IL-6 and TNF-α, whereas LSpO2 was inversely correlated to GSP, IL-6 and TNF-α. IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly correlated to GSP, with correlation coefficients of 0.510 and 0.476, respectively. The inflammatory factors may play important roles in IGT complicated by OSAHS in pregnant women, and as a potential risk factor, OSAHS may contribute to the occurrence of progression of IGT.

AB  - Objective: To describe a case of bilateral ruptured heterotopic pregnancies presenting as persistent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a quadruplet pregnancy. Design: Case report. Setting: University hospital and clinic. Patient(s): An infertile patient who conceived using gonadotropin therapy. Intervention(s): Culdocentesis with resultant aspiration of sanguinous fluid prompted laparoscopic exploration and bilateral salpingectomies. Main Outcome Measure(s): Not applicable. Result(s): Gross hemoperitoneum and ruptured bilateral heterotopic sextuplet pregnancy. Conclusion(s): Patients who conceive after gonadotropin therapy should be closely monitored during treatment and in early pregnancy to recognize and minimize morbidity and complications. After superovulation, the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy, either single or multiple, does not rule out the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, and this should always be considered as a possibility in the setting of acute anemia. © 2011 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Objectives The goals of this study were to assess: (a) the involvement of fathers and mothers in overall and nighttime infant caregiving; (b) the links between paternal involvement in infant care and infant sleep patterns during the first 6 months. Methods Fifty-six couples recruited during their first pregnancy, participated in the study. After delivery (1 and 6 months), both parents completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. Infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Results Mothers were significantly more involved than fathers in daytime and nighttime caregiving. A higher involvement of fathers in overall infant care predicted and was associated with fewer infant night-wakings and with shorter total sleep time after controlling for breastfeeding. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental sleep research. Future studies should explore mechanisms underlying the relations between paternal involvement and infant sleep. © 2010 The Author.

AB  - We aimed to analyse the in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) outcomes of the patients with sleep disturbances who were administered melatonin. A total of 60 patients with sleep disturbances were divided into two groups. The study group (group A, n=30) had underwent the IVF-ET with melatonin administration and the control group (group B, n=30) without melatonin. Sleeping status after melatonin administration and the IVF outcomes were compared between the two groups. Sleeping status change was not significant (p>0.05). The mean number of the retrieved oocytes, the mean MII oocyte counts, the G1 embryo ratio were significantly higher in the melatonin administered group (group A) than that the non-administered group (group B); p=0.0001; p=0.0001; p<0.05 respectively. IVF patients with sleep disorders may benefit from melatonin administration in improving the oocyte and the embryo quality, but the sleeping problem itself may not be fixed.

AB  - The purpose of this pilot study is to asses the effects of multiple pregnancies on the maturation of the developing brain using the polysomnographic EEG recordings. Data from prospectively recorded 10 twin sets, born prematurely (mean 36 gestational week; range 33 - 38 GW) in the Split University Hospital Center, were analysed. We compared sleep architecture parameters in the twins at 37th and 44th postmenstrual age (PMA) with parameters that were expected at that PMA. The same parameters were compared within each twin pair using the Man Whitne test. At first measurement indeterminate sleep (IS) proportion was greater in the first twin than in the second one. The IS sleep proportion was 1.6 fold greater in the first twin (p=0.028), and 1,8 fold less percentage of quite sleep (QS) than the second twin (p=0.054). The length of sleep stages among the twins was similar at the second measurement. Measures of sleep architecture were not significantly different within the twins in second recording. The results of this study obtained on a relatively small number of twins (longer IS and shorter QS in the first twin at the 38th week recordings), showed that the maturational differences among twins exist in utero and shortly after birth, and then disappear until the end of the first month of the postnatal life.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the different features of body movements for females before and after parturition. Body movement signal was measured by a piezoelectric sensor board which was deployed on the abdominal position beneath a mattress during sleep to monitor pressure changes around abdominal area. Body movement epochs were detected by an innovative algorithm based on Hilbert transform. Data were collected from two healthy pregnant females during sleep for 7 weeks before parturition and 6 weeks after parturition. The pressure signal was used to determine the duration and time interval of maternal movements. Characteristics of the detected body movements before and after parturition were investigated through their proportion. The results showed that before and after parturition, the body movement which features as 0~1 min in interval and 0~6 sec in duration has significant difference statistically. It is considered that these differences are highly correlated with the prenatal activities.

AB  - Background: Labor results in the release of sensitizing substances such as progesterone, prostaglandins, cytokines and cortisol, some of which have been observed to participate in sleep regulation. We hypothesized that these substances could affect sleep regulation and therefore the amount of volatile agent required to provide general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Methods: A total of 50 patients were enrolled, of whom 25 had uterine activity less than 30 Montevideo units (Prelabor group) and 25 had uterine activity greater than 80 Montevideo units (Labor group). Anesthesia was maintained with 50% oxygen in nitrous oxide with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to sustain a constant Bispectral Index (BIS) value of 40-55. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels were evaluated immediately before cesarean delivery. Results: End-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane in the Prelabor group were higher than in the Labor group with similar Bispectral Index values. No significant differences were found in prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels between the two groups. Conclusion: Anesthetic requirements for sevoflurane, as measured by Bispectral Index, decrease in laboring versus non-laboring parturients undergoing cesarean delivery. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol do not appear to be responsible for this observation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Allopregnanolone and related steroids are potent γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-A receptor agonistic allosteric modulators that suppress central nervous system (CNS) activity; in some species, these neurosteroids regulate normal CNS activity before birth. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of suppressing allopregnanolone production on behavioral responses to transient asphyxia in late gestation fetal sheep using the 5α-reductase (R)-2 inhibitor, finasteride. Specificity of the effects of finasteride was assessed by co-infusion of alfaxalone, a synthetic analog of allopregnanolone. Fetal catheters and electrodes for measurement of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) and nuchal electromyogram were implanted at 125 days of gestation, and an inflatable occluder was placed to allow umbilical cord occlusion (UCO). At of gestation, fetuses received carotid arterial infusion of vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin; 40% w/vol), finasteride (40 mg/kg/h), alfaxalone (5 mg/kg/h), or finasteridealfaxalone. A further three groups of fetuses were subjected to 5 min UCO at 30 min after the start of each infusion regime. Finasteride treatment alone increased the incidence of arousal-like activity; this was reduced by co-infusion of alfaxalone. After UCO, finasteride treatment caused a prolongation of sub-low voltage (LV) ECoG activity and increase in aberrant ECoG spike activity when compared to vehicle-treated UCO fetuses. After UCO, alfaxalone treatment reduced the incidence of sub-LV, reduced the number of aberrant EEG spikes, and restored ECoG activity to the pattern observed after UCO in vehicle-treated fetuses. These results confirm that neurosteroids significantly modulate normal CNS activity in the late gestation fetus, modify, and limit the effects of asphyxia on the brain. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - CASE: Gerardo is an 8-year-old Latino boy who saw his primary care pediatrician with a second asthma exacerbation this year. His frustration with his illness was immediately apparent when he said, "I hate having to go to the nurse's office to take my albuterol!" His mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused to take his prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother hesitated and then admitted that she discontinued the controller medication because she is afraid to "poison his body with so many chemicals." She consistently gave her son the inhaled steroid for 12 months, until care by the allergy specialist was unexpectedly transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the new doctor is "cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician."Gerardo is a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the United States to Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of asthma, although his mother fears that she may have contributed to Gerardo's condition. She explained that during pregnancy, she worked cleaning houses where she was exposed to many toxic household cleaners. She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes during pregnancy, she induced her son's asthma.Gerardo presented with his first episode of reactive airway disease at 9 months of age. His mother vividly recalled his high temperature, rapid breathing, and their ambulance ride to the hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since. Allergy testing revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a nonallergenic pillow and bed cover.Gerardo's mother explained that 3 days before his current exacerbation, he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on a hot day. Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother reported that he was soaked in water and stated, "He knows that he will get sick with asthma if he gets wet!" She recalled that 3 years ago at a friend's birthday party, Gerardo abstained from running through the sprinklers with the other children without instruction from his parents. Since that event, she has trusted Gerardo to care for his "weak lungs." She is frustrated now with his regression in self-care. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - History Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological condition characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs, occurring at rest, especially at bedtime. The paresthesias are accompanied by an irresistible urge to move the limbs, which results in a temporary relief of the symptoms. RLS can be associated with fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), although these are not diagnostic criteria. In most patients with RLS, periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are observed. These are stereotyped, periodic, jerking movements typically consisting of flexion of the ankle, knee, and hip. Periodic limb movements of sleep are sometimes accompanied by a cortical arousal resulting in sleep fragmentation and subsequent excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is controversial. The International Restless Legs Study Group formally defined criteria for restless leg syndrome in 1995, and revised criteria for diagnosis in 2002. Restless legs syndrome can occur as an idiopathic and often hereditary condition (primary RLS), or in association with a variety of other conditions (secondary RLS). This latter form of RLS is associated with uremia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, radiculopathy, cobalamin deficiency, folate deficiency, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Dopamine agonists are now considered the treatment of choice for primary RLS and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). This article reviews the clinical features, natural history, laboratory investigations, genetics, pathology, and management of both disorders. © Cambridge University Press 2011.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition contributing to oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to ascertain if there is any connection between OSA and novel oxidative stress-related markers. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), soluble receptors for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were measured. Further biochemical markers were evaluated. Material/Methods: Fifty-one men suspected for OSA indicated for night polygraphy were included. Apnea/hypop-nea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), mean blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) and time of blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation below 90% (SpO2 <90%) were measured. Morning venous blood samples were taken. Results: For body mass index (BMI) we found strong positive correlation with levels of Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fbrinogen, and negative correlation with sRAGE. Concerning ventilation parameters, we found positive correlation of ODI and SpO2 <90% with markers MMP-9 and hsCRP. sRAGE level correlated with AHI and ODI negatively. SpO2 correlated negatively with Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fbrinogen. There was no correlation between ventilation parameters and markers MMP-2, PAPP-A and Zn. Compared to severity of OSA, there was signifcant difference in levels of hsCRP and Cu between patients with AHI ≤5 and AHI ≥30 independent of BMI. Conclusions: MMP-9, hsCRP, sRAGE and Cu seem to be strong predictors of oxidative stress in OSA patients. The strong correlation between oxidative stress-related markers and OSA is elucidated by connection of these to BMI, which is probably a primary condition of oxidative stress, but OSA is an additive condition. © Med Sci Monit.

AB  - The incidence of obesity is increasing at an alarming rate. There is compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of preeclampsia about three-fold, and in developed countries is the leading attributable risk for the disorder. In this presentation we explore this relationship and propose targets for future studies guided by the much more extensively studied relationship of obesity to cardiovascular disease. We further address the hypothesis that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, may be one convergence point for the mechanism by which obesity increases the risk of preeclampsia. We conclude with consideration of the clinical implications of this information. © 2010 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that appears to affect at least 5% of the population. Women appear to be affected twice as commonly as men. The prevalence increases with age, as does disease severity. For many individuals with RLS there is significant sleep disruption and a general decrease in quality of life. RLS appears to be increased in subjects with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, and among those on hemodialysis. Cerebrospinal fluid, magnetic resonance imaging, and autopsy studies support the concept that RLS is associated with low brain iron levels, even in those who have no clear peripheral iron storage problems. Treatment studies, on the other hand, support a role for the dopaminergic system, as levodopa and dopamine agonists are considered the most effective agents for relieving RLS symptoms. Other treatments of value in RLS include opiates, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and some anticonvulsants such as gabapentin. Because low brain iron appears to be a causal factor in RLS, treatment studies with oral or intravenous iron have been tried, with varying success. Finally, recent family studies and gene-wide association studies have identified several candidate genes; this may help to focus future research endeavors into the pathophysiology of RLS. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how the past experiences of mothers and their potentially traumatic events during pregnancy may have infuenced the processes of psychobiological self-regulation and cognitive development in a child born preterm. Eighty children who had a gestational age of < 32 weeks were examined at the 9th month of the corrected age. The mothers and children were divided in two groups: multipara mothers and their children and the primipara mothers and their children. These children were examined on the basis of sleep disorders, nutritional problems and mental development. Perinatal data from clinical observations and data from standardized developmental tests (BSID, II ed.) were used to describe the differences. The children of primipara mothers who had unexpected preterm delivery presented major incidences of sleep disorders while the children of primipara mothers, who programmed preterm delivery, presented a major incidences of nutrition problems. The predictability of preterm delivery has a major infuence on the capacity of newborns for self-regulation in the case of primipara mothers. © 2011, Versita. All rights reserved.

Bony characteristics such as vertebral anomalies, lordosis and lumbar scoliosis, limited mouth opening and cervical spine instability make the administration of anesthesia to these patients truly a challenge. Here we demonstrate that low dose meperidine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in an achondroplastic parturient for ceserean section, was administered successfully after careful evaluation, consideration of risks, and awareness of potential complications. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Data from our research are reviewed showing limited attentiveness and responsivity to animate stimuli in newborns of depressed mothers. These include face-voice stimuli of mothers and strangers, newborn cry sounds and instrumental and vocal music. Newborns of depressed mothers are also noted to be less attentive and responsive when presented with inanimate stimuli, including different texture nipples, different temperature nipples and different weight tubes. Potential underlying mechanisms are suggested by research showing negative effects of prenatal depression, elevated prenatal cortisol and lower prenatal dopamine and serotonin on the newborns of depressed mothers. Additional risk factors are explored, including sleep disturbances and other prenatal stressors. Early interventions, including pregnancy massage, massage therapy for infants and demonstration of the Brazelton Assessment, have been noted to enhance the neonates' attentiveness and responsivity to animate and inanimate stimuli. Limitations of these studies are discussed, including the sample being limited to lower SES women who have many other problems that potentially affect newborns. More controlled studies are needed to assess potential mediating factors for the inferior performance of these newborns on perceptual tasks such as limited attentiveness and/or greater arousal as well as longitudinal follow-up studies to determine whether these limited perceptual abilities continue into infancy. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Design: Descriptive, exploratory, nonexperimental study. Setting: Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area, from June 2008 to January 2009. Participants: Pharmacists and nonpharmacists (e.g., cashiers, sales clerks, pharmacy technicians) working in retail locations selling herbal dietary supplements (e.g., grocery stores, health food stores, pharmacies). Intervention: Investigators posing as patients sought herbal weight loss supplement product recommendations and counseling on potential safety, drug interaction, and adverse effect issues from pharmacists or nonpharmacists. Main outcome measures: Level of knowledge regarding safety and efficacy of herbal dietary supplements for weight loss. Results: 52 sites were visited, and 27 unique product recommendations were given. In general, counseling provided to investigators/patients by pharmacists versus nonpharmacists varied significantly (P < 0.05) except when participants were asked about expected weight loss (P = 0.39) or use of herbal supplements during pregnancy (P = 0.07) and breast-feeding (P = 0.48). Pharmacists were more reluctant to recommend herbal products for weight loss than nonpharmacists and tended to question the safety and/or efficacy of these products or refer the patient to an alternate health care provider. Conclusion: The counseling that investigators/patients received regarding herbal products for weight loss in various retail settings from both pharmacists and non-pharmacists varied greatly. Efforts are needed from the medical and herbal communities to ensure that patients are adequately informed about herbal products at the point of purchase.

AB  - Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in neonatal period may cause neurological impairment, epilepsy, and lead to stroke. It is caused primarily by coagulopathy of numerous reasons, occasionally perinatal asphyxia, traumatic delivery and hyper homocysteinemia. Dandy-Walker malformation is characterized by agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. Dandy-Walker malformation, variant, and mega cisterna magna represent a spectrum of developmental anomalies. Insults to developing cerebellar hemispheres and the fourth ventricle are believed to be the cause of malformation. Our patient was born from non complicated pregnancy, non complicated non traumatic vaginal delivery at term, excellent Apgar scores, without peculiarities in clinical status. She was brest-fed by the 42nd hour of life when she had rightsided seizures during sleep that repeated for five times in next 24 hours. Brain Ultrasound (US) revealed clot in left lateral ventricle, slight dilatation of left ventricle, both sided periventricular echodensity, ischemia, slight enlargement of forth ventricle and a bit smaller cerebellum. There was no visible flow through left transverse, superior sagittal and straight sinus. Magnetic Resonance (MRI) confirmed the finding and showed thrombosis of left and right transverse venous sinuses and confluence of sinuses. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed left sided focal changes. The newborn was treated with phenobarbiton for 8 days and had no convulsions during that period. All coagulation parameters, homocistein, lipoproteins (a) and D-dimers were normal. There were no mutations on FV R506Q, PT 20210A, MTHFR 677C/T. No antiphospholipides were found. Heart US showed no structural anomalies. No other patology or risk factors were present at the time. Before discharge, US showed hydrocephalus. Flow in affected sinuses was visible with color Doppler. MRI showed recanalization of affected sinuses, also hydrocephalus and presentation of Dandy Walker. On EEG there was borderline finding. Due to progression of hydrocephalus ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed. In age of 1 year EEG was slower for age but without focus. Neurological development was normal for age. The question is whether this child had intrauterine insult and inception of Dandy Walker with further postnatal progress of thrombosis and evolution to full picture of Dandy Walker with hydrocephalus OR thrombosis that led to development of hydrocephalus and Dandy Walker malformation in this child were accidental coexistance.

AB  - The study aimed to document self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, and triggers of epileptic seizures and techniques to control seizures for people with epilepsy, and to establish patterns in these self-reported experiences of epilepsy in relation to age, gender and seizure type. Of the 338 people with epilepsy who had registered interest in participating in social research, 225 returned a self-report questionnaire (66% response rate) that contained information regarding demographic characteristics, living with epilepsy, and self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, triggers of seizures and techniques to control seizures. Of 225 respondents, 195 (86.6%) experienced at least one initial symptom prior to a seizure and 202 (89.8%) experienced at least one seizure trigger. Gender analysis of triggers revealed that females differed from males regarding seizures triggered by low blood sugar, dieting, fasting, touch and female specific triggers (menstruation, pregnancy and ovulation). Respondents reported tiredness as the most frequent trigger (65.3%), followed by stress (64%) and sleep deprivation (55.1%). Many respondents (63.6%) reported that they could predict seizure occurrence, with 91 (40.4%) also indicating that family members could predict seizure occurrence. A total of 157 (69.8%) respondents had tried at least one of 12 possible seizure avoidance techniques, with resting and medication the most frequently reported. Finding that respondents were able to recognise warning signs, initial symptoms and triggers of seizures, and some were able to stop seizures provides scope for developing interventions, such as promoting avoidance of high risk triggers, which supplement existing treatments of epilepsy. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To provide an update on various features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Design: Perspective. Methods: Selected articles on the epidemiology, clinical and imaging features, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension were reviewed and interpreted in the context of the authors' clinical and research experience. Results: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension primarily is a disease of obese women of childbearing age, but it can affect patients of any weight, sex, and age. Although a relatively rare disorder, idiopathic intracranial hypertension's associated costs in the United States entail hundreds of millions of dollars. Even after treatment, headaches frequently are persistent and may require the continued involvement of a neurologist. Quality-of-life reductions and depression are common among idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients. However, visual dysfunction, especially visual field abnormalities, represents the major morbidity of this disorder, and serial automated perimetry remains the primary method of patient monitoring. Patients who are men, black, very obese, or anemic are at higher risk of visual loss. Vitamin A metabolism, adipose tissue as an actively secreting endocrine tissue, and cerebral venous abnormalities are areas of active study regarding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Treatment studies show that lumbar puncture is a valuable treatment (in addition to its crucial diagnostic role), and that weight management is critical. However, open questions remain regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, and cerebral venous stenting. Conclusions: Many questions remain unanswered about idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Ongoing studies, especially an ongoing National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial of acetazolamide, should provide more insight into this important, yet poorly understood, syndrome of isolated intracranial hypertension. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aromatherapy is a form of alternative medicine that uses volatile plant materials, known as essential oils, and other aromatic compounds for the purpose of altering a person's mind, mood, cognitive function or health. Since some essential oils such as tea tree have demonstrated anti-microbial effects, it has been suggested that they may be useful for the treatment of infectious diseases. Evidence for the efficacy of aromatherapy in treating medical conditions remains poor, with a particular lack of studies employing rigorous methodology; however some evidence exists that essential oils may have therapeutic potential. Aromatherapy is the practice of using the natural oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots or other parts of a plant to enhance psychological and physical well-being. The inhaled aroma from these "essential" oils is widely believed to stimulate brain function. Essential oils can also be absorbed through the skin, where they travel through the bloodstream and can promote whole-body healing. A form of alternative medicine, aromatherapy is gaining momentum. It is used for a variety of applications, including pain relief, mood enhancement and increased cognitive function. There are a wide number of essential oils available, each with its own healing properties. © 2010 IJDDR, Yatri R. Shah Patel et al.

AB  - Objective: A single course of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) is associated with a reduction in respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal death. Multiple Courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids Study (MACS), a study involving 1858 women, was a multicentre randomized placebo-controlled trial of multiple courses of ACS, given every 14 days until 33+6 weeks or birth, whichever came first. The primary outcome of the study, a composite of neonatal mortality and morbidity, was similar for the multiple ACS and placebo groups (12.9% vs. 12.5%), but infants exposed to multiple courses of ACS weighed less, were shorter, and had smaller head circumferences. Thus for women who remain at increased risk of preterm birth, multiple courses of ACS (every 14 days) are not recommended. Chronic use of corticosteroids is associated with numerous side effects including weight gain and depression The aim of this postpartum assessment was to ascertain if multiple courses of ACS were associated with maternal side effects. Methods: Three months postpartum, women who participated in MACS were asked to complete a structured questionnaire that asked about maternal side effects of corticosteroid use during MACS and included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Women were also asked to evaluate their study participation. Results: Of the 1858 women randomized, 1712 (92.1%) completed the postpartum questionnaire. There were no significant differences in the risk of maternal side effects between the two groups. Large numbers of women met the criteria for postpartum depression (14.1% in the ACS vs. 16.0% in the placebo group). Most women (94.1%) responded that they would participate in the trial again. Conclusion: In pregnancy, corticosteroids are given to women for fetal lung maturation and for the treatment of various maternal diseases. In this international multicentre randomized controlled trial, multiple courses of ACS (every 14 days) were not associated with maternal side effects, and the majority of women responded that they would participate in such a study again. © 2011 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of depression; investigate its association with risk factors including comorbidities and drug and health care use; and describe treatment patterns of depression in primary care using The Health Improvement Network database. Method: In this cohort study, subjects with a first recorded diagnosis of depression (Read code) between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2004 (n=47,170) were identified from a source population of 1,287,829 subjects aged 10-79 years. A comparison group was sampled from the same population and frequency matched to the depression cohort by age, sex, and calendar year (n=50,000). Depression diagnoses were validated using physician-completed questionnaires. Odds ratios and 95% CIs for the relationship of depression with a range of factors were estimated using unconditional logistic regression in a nested case-control analysis. Results: The prevalence of depression was 11.23% (95% CI, 11.18-11.28). This prevalence decreased with increasing age and was higher in women than in men. The incidence was 13.89 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI, 13.82-14.08). Depression was associated with frequent use of health services, smoking, pregnancy in the previous year, anxiety, stress, sleep disorders, digestive and respiratory disorders, and pain. In the trimester following diagnosis, 82% of cases were treated-98% with antidepressants and 81.5% with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Conclusions: We found a high prevalence and incidence of depression diagnoses in primary care in the United Kingdom. Following diagnosis, the majority of individuals were prescribed SSRIs. A diagnosis of depression is associated with a number of prior comorbidities, which could mask the depression. This fact should be taken into account when screening individuals in primary care. © 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Background. Malaria chemoprophylaxis prevents the occurrence of the symptoms of malaria. Travellers to high-risk Plasmodium falciparum endemic areas need an effective chemoprophylaxis. Methods. A literature search to update the status of mefloquine as a malaria chemoprophylaxis. Results. Except for clearly defined regions with multi-drug resistance, mefloquine is effective against the blood stages of all human malaria species, including the recently recognized fifth species, Plasmodium knowlesi. New data were found in the literature on the tolerability of mefloquine and the use of this medication by groups at high risk of malaria. Discussion. Use of mefloquine for pregnant women in the second and third trimester is sanctioned by the WHO and some authorities (CDC) allow the use of mefloquine even in the first trimester. Inadvertent pregnancy while using mefloquine is not considered grounds for pregnancy termination. Mefloquine chemoprophylaxis is allowed during breast-feeding. Studies show that mefloquine is a good option for other high-risk groups, such as long-term travellers, VFR travellers and families with small children. Despite a negative media perception, large pharmaco-epidemiological studies have shown that serious adverse events are rare. A recent US evaluation of serious events (hospitalization data) found no association between mefloquine prescriptions and serious adverse events across a wide range of outcomes including mental disorders and diseases of the nervous system. As part of an in-depth analysis of mefloquine tolerability, a potential trend for increased propensity for neuropsychiatric adverse events in women was identified in a number of published clinical studies. This trend is corroborated by several cohort studies that identified female sex and low body weight as risk factors. Conclusion. The choice of anti-malarial drug should be an evidence-based decision that considers the profile of the individual traveller and the risk of malaria. Mefloquine is an important, first-line anti-malarial drug but it is crucial for prescribers to screen medical histories and inform mefloquine users of potential adverse events. Careful prescribing and observance of contraindications are essential. For some indications, there is currently no replacement for mefloquine available or in the pipeline. © 2010 Schlagenhauf et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Circadian rhythms and clock gene expression are involved in successful reproductive cycles, mating, and pregnancy. Alterations or disruptions of biological rhythms, as commonly occurs in shift work, jet lag, sleep deprivation, or clock gene knock out models, are linked to significant disruptions in reproductive function. These impairments include altered hormonal secretion patterns, reduced conception rates, increased miscarriage rates and an increased risk of breast cancer. Female health may be particularly susceptible to the impact of desynchronizing work schedules as perturbed hormonal rhythms can further influence the expression patterns of clock genes. Estrogen modifies clock gene expression in the uterus, ovaries, and suprachiasmatic nucleus, the site of the primary circadian clock mechanism. Further work investigating clock genes, light exposure, ovarian hormones, and reproductive function will be critical for indentifying how these factors interact to impact health and susceptibility to disease. © 2010 Megan M.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the time of onset of contractions in twin pregnancies that result in delivery, so as to investigate whether there is a diurnal influence. A UK maternity department database was used to identify twin deliveries over a 5-year period, and the time of onset of labour was retrieved from these records. Two hundred and eleven women with spontaneous onset of labour in twin pregnancies were studied. A significant diurnal rhythm in the timing of contractions was noted, with 45% of deliveries occurring in labour that commenced between midnight and 08.00hours. This periodicity is similar for twin pregnancies that end in preterm (24-36weeks of gestation; χ 2=17.2; P&lt;0.01) or term deliveries (37-40weeks of gestation; χ 2=13; P&lt;0.05). The periodicity of onset of labour in multiple pregnancies demonstrates a similar rhythm to singleton pregnancies, where labour most commonly begins between midnight and 08.00hours. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

AB  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change as female mammals transition from one reproductive state to another. The mechanisms responsible for this plasticity are poorly understood. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contains the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals, and a large portion of its efferent projections terminate in the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPZ), which also plays important roles in rhythm regulation. To determine whether these regions might mediate changes in overt rhythms during early pregnancy, we first compared rhythms in Fos and Per2 protein expression in the SCN and vSPZ of diestrous and early pregnant rats maintained in a 12:12-h light/dark (LD) cycle. No differences in the Fos rhythm were seen in the SCN core, but in the SCN shell, elevated Fos expression was maintained throughout the light phase in pregnant, but not diestrous, rats. In the vSPZ, the Fos rhythm was bimodal in diestrous rats, but this rhythm was lost in pregnant rats. Peak Per2 expression was phase-advanced by 4 h in the SCN of pregnant rats, and some differences in Per2 expression were found in the vSPZ as well. To determine whether differences in Fos expression were due to altered responsivity to light, we next characterized light-induced Fos expression in the SCN and vSPZ of pregnant and diestrous rats in the mid-subjective day and night. We found that the SCN core of the two groups responded in the same way at each time of day, whereas the rhythm of Fos responsivity in the SCN shell and vSPZ differed between diestrous and pregnant rats. These results indicate that the SCN and vSPZ are functionally re-organized during early pregnancy, particularly in how they respond to the photic environment. These changes may contribute to changes in overt behavioral and physiological rhythms that occur at this time. © 2010 IBRO.

AB  - In many modern societies, the proportion of women who delay childbearing beyond the age of 35 years has increased greatly in recent decades. They are falsely reassured by popular beliefs that advances in new reproductive technologies can compensate for the age-realted decline in fertility, but science cannot beat the biological clock. Age is the single most important determinant of male and female fertility, either natural or treated. The consequences of advancing maternal age are not only for the risk of natural and assisted conception, but also for the outcome of pregnancy. Female fertility has a 'best-before date' of 35, and for men, it is probably before age 45-50. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - A sample of 423 Sarda ewe lambs from three different farms was used to evaluate the effect of one or two melatonin implants on the time of first conception. On each farm, 141 animals were divided into three groups. On June 30 these animals received either no treatment (Group C), 18 mg melatonin (Group M1, one implant), or 18 + 18 mg melatonin (Group M2, two implants). Thirty-five days after treatment, rams were introduced in the ewe lambs flock and subsequently removed after 40 days. Lambing dates were recorded between 150 and 190 days from the first day of male introduction. Genotyping and sequencing of the MT1 exon 2 were carried out to analyze the structure and the possible influence of the MT1 receptor gene on reproductive response to melatonin treatment. Melatonin-treated animals had a higher rate of pregnancy (P < 0.05) and lambed earlier (P < 0.05) compared with untreated animals. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in exon II of MT1 gene at positions C606T and G612A leading to genotypes C/C, C/T or T/T and +/+, +/- and -/-, respectively. Melatonin-treated animals of +/+ genotype showed a higher number of pregnancies (P < 0.05) and lambed earlier (P < 0.05) compared to untreated animals of the same genotype. Melatonin treatment did not affect reproductive activity in any other genotype analyzed. No correlation between genotype and the time of first conception was found in untreated animals. Concluding data revealed the positive effect of melatonin treatment on the time of first conception in ewe lambs and highlighted that +/+ genotype is able to influence reproductive response to melatonin treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although extracellular calcium ionic concentration ([Ca] o) is known to increase during late gestation and to drop after parturition, little is known about the influence of [Ca] o on fetal brain function. We have investigated the influence of [Ca] o, calcium-sensing receptors/nonselective cation currents (CaSR/NSCC), and GABAergic inhibitions on maturation of brainstem-spinal motor activities: the primary low-frequency embryonic rhythm [LF; silent since embryonic day (E)16] and the fetal respiratory rhythm (RR; emerging at E14-E15). Using in vitro isolated brainstem-spinal cord preparations of mice at different fetal and postnatal (P) stages (E16-P1), we demonstrate that reducing fetal [Ca] o from 1.2 mM to 0.7 mM at E16-E18 or blocking GABA A receptors at E16-P0 reactivates LF and reveals LF-related disturbance of RR at E16-E18. This LF is stopped by adding gadolinium or spermidine (CaSR/NSCC agonists) at E18-P0 or GABA A receptor agonists at E16-E18. In contrast, [Ca] o-induced slowing of RR at E16-E18 is not reproduced by gadolinium and spermidine. We conclude that perinatal CaSR/NSCC and GABA A inhibition allow quiescence of the LF, thereby improving functional maturation of the RR. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Aim: Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone involved in pregnancy and lactation. It is mainly secreted by the corpus luteum and placenta, but is expressed in a number of other tissues, including heart and brain. Within the brain, relaxin is expressed in the olfactory and limbic systems, the cortex and the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). Its cognate receptor, relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), is also widely expressed in the brain, including the hypothalamic ARC and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), areas important in appetite regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether relaxin influences food intake through central hypothalamic circuits. Methods: The human form of relaxin, human relaxin-2 (H2) was administered centrally and peripherally to male Wistar rats and food intake measured. Behaviour was also assessed. Results: Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of H2 significantly decreased 1-h food intake in the early dark phase [2.95 ± 0.45 g (saline) vs. 0.95 ± 0.18 g (180 pmol H2), p < 0.001]. ICV administration of H2 decreased feeding behaviour and increased grooming and headdown behaviour. Intraparaventricular injections of H2 significantly decreased 1-h food intake in the early dark phase [3.13 ± 0.35 g (saline) vs. 1.35 ± 0.33 g (18 pmol H2), p < 0.01, 1.61 ± 0.31 g (180 pmol H2), p < 0.05 and 1.23 ± 0.32 g (540 pmol H2), p < 0.001]. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of H2 significantly decreased 1-h food intake in the early dark phase [4.63 ± 0.46 g (vehicle) vs. 3.08 ± 0.15 g (66 nmol H2), p < 0.01, 3.00 ± 0.17 g (200 nmol H2), p < 0.01 and 2.26 ± 0.36 g (660 nmol H2), p < 0.001]. Conclusions: Central and peripheral administration of H2 reduces the food intake in rats. This effect may be mediated via the PVN and/or other brain regions. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Equidae are born in the spring. This is due to the fact that mares go through a period of anovulation from October to the end of April. For breeders, bringing forward the first ovulation presents an enormous advantage, as it increases the number of usable cycles in the mare and increases the actual age of the offspring at the time of sports performance or slaughter. In mares under our latitudes, the first ovulation can be moved to its earliest by using 14.5 h of daily light for 35 days, beginning around the winter solstice. This treatment is robust, as repeated accidents do not affect its outcome. The administration of melatonin to pony mares during winter ovarian inactivity, either daily in the evening or with a subcutaneous implant, suppresses the photostimulating effect of long days (LD). On the other hand, the use of this implant around the summer solstice brings forward the first ovulation, as in photostimulatedmares, thereby confirming the existence of an annual endogenous rhythm. These implants inserted under the same conditions in non-pregnant mares do not induced ovarian inactivity. Therefore, the role of melatonin seems limited to the timing of winter inactivity. In thin but healthy mares subjected to the natural photoperiod, winter inactivity is systematic and long lasting. This inhibition, induced by the feed restriction, masks the effect of the photostimulation. On the other hand, 60% of fat mares have cycles all year long, and in the remaining 40%, the period of inactivity is very short, missing only one or two cycles. Increasing the feed in thin mares in autumn or winter seems to have no effect on the date of the first annual ovulation. Nutrition is the main cause of ovarian inactivity in winter, but it does not play a role in the resumption of activity in the spring. The mechanism inhibiting the cycles in autumn results from an interaction between short days and a negative energy balance. This nutrition-photoperiod interaction seems to be applicable to numerous species in temperate areas.

AB  - The modern living standard has imposed upon society a situation of chronic sleep deprivation. This chronic loss of sleep affects women more than it does men. As a result, the postponement of pregnancy has become a common choice due to the priority given to social and domestic activities. For women, pregnancy represents a condition of intense physical and physiological changes that subject the pregnant woman to a number of potentially stressful situations, ultimately interfering with their quality of sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation, along with the changes imposed on women through pregnancy, can lead to several harmful consequences for the pregnant woman and the child, and can potentially undermine the mother-infant relationship. This article discusses circumstances under which sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality during pregnancy could result in damage to the mother-infant relationship, specifically through maternal fatigue, postpartum depression and changes in pregnancy-related hormonal secretions and activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and their child's sleep 4-7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores ≥20 reported more sleep problems in their child, and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The field of sleep medicine has grown exponentially worldwide. Sleep apnea is linked to the obesity epidemic, which, in some regions of the United States, affects more than one-third of the population. Sleep alterations increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular pathology through a diversity of direct and indirect mechanisms. Recent investigations have found a clinical correlation between sleep disorders and diabetes. Obese pregnant women are at high risk for development of sleep apnea and preeclampsia. New studies have uncovered that restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements may increase the risk of hypertension and vascular disease. Sudden death in sleep may be preventable if conditions that lead to sudden death are investigated. New neuroimaging techniques during sleep in patients with insomnia have uncovered metabolic overactivity in areas of the brain related to maintenance of wakefulness. Sleep neuroimaging promises to have research and clinical diagnostic applications. © 2010 MedReviews®, LLC.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of snoring in Thai, pregnant women. Material and Method: This study was carried out from April 2008 through August 2008 at the antenatal clinic, HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center, Nakorn Nayok province. Two hundred and thirty-eight pregnant women were enrolled. All subjects answered the Berlin questionnaire; this include information on age, weight, height, gravid health status, gestational age, witnessed incidences of snoring, and symptoms associated with sleep apnea. The description of snoring as frequency, volume, complaints from other people and bouts of sleep apnea were recorded and analyzed. Results: The prevalence of snoring in pregnancy was 35.29%. The snoring volume, recorded as slightly louder than breathing, in this group was 91.67%. One-fourth of the cases presented with snoring approximately 3-4 times a week with complaints of snoring bothering other people. The incidence of sleep apnea was found in 5.95% of this group. Conclusion: The prevalence of snoring was found in approximately one-third of the pregnant women screened.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Brazilian women, with individual diagnostic clinical interviews during the trimesters of pregnancy, and to determine the severity. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study. We interviewed 524 pregnant women (18-45. years old) who came to the prenatal outpatient clinic to consult an obstetrician. We used a RLS clinical-diagnostic interview and the International RLS Study Group rating scale (IRLS). Results: The prevalence of RLS during pregnancy was 13.5% in our sample, among which 90.1% of the cases started with their symptoms during pregnancy. More than half of the patients (53.5%) presented severe or very severe symptoms and the largest proportion of them (15.2%) were in their third trimester. We did not observe any demographic differences among the trimesters for RLS prevalence and RLS severity. Conclusion: RLS during pregnancy is more frequent than in the general population, such that more than half of the pregnant women with RLS present it severely or very severely. It occurs especially in the third trimester. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Studies of sleep in women, whether in health or disease, are affected by the distinct hormonal changes that occur throughout a woman's life cycle, including puberty, menses, pregnancy, and menopause. Differences exist not only between the sexes but within cohorts of women as they transition through these biologically determined milestones. Additionally, socioeconomic status, workplace, and familial roles influence observed gender differences. In the NSF 2007 poll, 30% of pregnant women and 42% of post-partum women reported rarely or never getting a good night's sleep, compared to 15% among all women; 25% of perimenopausal women and 30% of postmenopausal women reported getting a good night's sleep only a few nights a month or less. Not surprisingly, given their social and/or familial responsibilities, working mothers (72%) and single working women (68%) were more likely to experience sleep problems like insomnia. These sleep disturbances are not without consequences; in the NSF survey, women who experienced daytime sleepiness were more likely to report high stress (80%), drive drowsy at least once per month (27%), spend less time with friends and family (39%), be too tired for sex (33%), and be late for work (20%). Recently, studies recognize that men and women experience sleep and sleep disorders differently. They differ in the prevalence of certain sleep disorders and may have varying presentations and responses to therapies. This chapter serves to both review the existing literature on gender differences in sleep and highlight the considerable gaps in knowledge. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assessed whether elevated severities of maternal depression and disturbed maternal sleep would be associated with maternal perceptions of higher Negative Affectivity of her infant. Sixty-nine mothers participated in this study. The study was part of a larger randomized controlled study testing the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for depression during pregnancy. The present study focused on data collected at 6 months postpartum in a naturalistic follow-up design, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), maternal sleep diaries (completed daily for 1 week), and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R).Regression analyses revealed that (a) maternal depression severity was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Distress and Falling Reactivity scales and (b) poor maternal sleep was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Sadness scale.Our findings support previous findings of significant links between maternal emotional distress and perceived Negative Affectivity of her infant's temperament and provide a novel insight linking maternal poor sleep with perceived sadness of the infant. © 2010.

AB  - Insomnia is both a symptom and a clinical entity in itself. There are three well-defined insomnia conditions that are often referred to as primary insomnias. In addition, there are a number of medical, psychiatric, and social factors that can lead to comorbid insomnia. While formulating a differential diagnosis one must think of the mental and medical conditions the person with insomnia has, in addition to medications they may be taking, social environment, habits, exposure to toxins, and other sleep disorders. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2003, 2010.

AB  - This review covers research on the negative effects of prenatal depression and cortisol on fetal growth, prematurity and low birthweight. Although prenatal depression and cortisol were typically measured at around 20 weeks gestation, other research suggests the stability of depression and cortisol levels across pregnancy. Women with Dysthymia as compared to Major Depression Disorder had higher cortisol levels, and their newborns had lower gestational age and birthweight. The cortisol effects in these studies were unfortunately confounded by low serotonin and low dopamine levels which in themselves could contribute to non-optimal pregnancy outcomes. The negative effects of depression and cortisol were also potentially confounded by comorbid anxiety, by demographic factors including younger age, less education and lower SES of the mothers and by the absence of a partner or a partner who was unhappy about the pregnancy or a partner who was depressed. Substance use (especially caffeine use) was still another risk factor. All of these problems including prenatal depression, elevated cortisol, prematurity and low birthweight and even postpartum depression have been reduced by prenatal massage therapy provided by the women's partners. Massage therapy combined with group interpersonal psychotherapy was also effective for reducing depression and cortisol levels. Several limitations of these studies were noted and suggestions for future research included exploring other predictor variables like progesterone/estriol ratios, immune factors and genetic determinants. Further research is needed both on the potential use of cortisol as a screening measure and the use of other therapies that might reduce prenatal depression and cortisol in the women and prematurity and low birthweight in their infants. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The objective of this review was to evaluate the available medical literature concerning the electroencephalogram (EEG) during hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. All articles found during a MEDLINE and Embase database search on the subject of EEG differences associated with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy were screened for eligibility. In all, 22 articles which describe the EEG during preeclampsia (PE)/eclampsia were retrieved. Abnormal EEG findings were observed in the majority of the preeclamptic/eclamptic patients, consisting of slow waves most frequently localized in the occipital lobe, as well as spike discharges. The EEG abnormalities in PE/eclampsia were reversible in the majority of the cases. We conclude that these described abnormalities may be interpreted as a warning sign of deterioration of brain function in PE/eclampsia. However, some caution regarding this conclusion is advised because most of the retrieved articles were published in the 1950s and 1960s, and were not consistent with current clinical guidelines or medical terminology. Further research is needed to establish the clinical value of implementing EEGs in the assessment of the preeclamptic/eclamptic patient. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Neurologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After completion of this educational activity, the obstetrician, gynecologist and neurologist should be better able to evaluate whether the EEG is normal for pregnancy; distinguish EEG abnormalities in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, and assess the value of EEG abnormalities in preeclampsia (PE)/eclampsia for the detection of early signs of ischemia.

AB  - Objective: This study compared mothers' report of symptoms of discontinuation syndrome in infants exposed to antidepressants both in utero and during lactation to infants who were exposed only during lactation. Study Design: This is a convenience sample of 930 women breastfeeding women who answered an online questionnaire about antidepressant use while pregnant and breastfeeding. All 930 women had taken antidepressants while breastfeeding, and 527 had also taken antidepressants during pregnancy. There were no participants in the present study who had taken antidepressants only during pregnancy. The questionnaire was posted on the first author's Medications and Breastfeeding Forum. There was no advertising of this study, nor were efforts made to recruit women into this study beyond posting a notice on the website. The questionnaire included a list of symptoms that mothers may have observed in their infants during the newborn period, as well as demographic questions, and questions about antidepressant use during pregnancy and lactation. Results: The majority of women reported that their infants never experienced the symptoms of discontinuation syndrome. Twenty-five percent reported infant irritability. A smaller percentage reported inconsolable crying (17%), low body temperature (14%), and significant problems with eating and sleeping (15%). Logistic regression revealed that mothers who took antidepressants while pregnant and then during breastfeeding were two to eight times more likely to report symptoms of discontinuation syndrome than women who took them only while breastfeeding. Discontinuation symptoms were more likely to occur in infants whose mothers took medications with shorter half-lives. Conclusions: Discontinuation syndrome does occur in a small percentage of infants exposed to antidepressants in utero. Mothers reported a higher frequency of discontinuation syndrome after in utero exposure followed by breastfeeding than when infants were exposed to antidepressants only during lactation. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The possible association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and childhood asthma has been a subject of interest based on the theory that acetaminophen metabolism may deplete glutathione in the developing lung, leading to oxidative damage and inflammation. Epidemiology studies from eight centers have reported conflicting results. In some cases, end points of these studies have included wheezing in very young children, which is a poor predictor of asthma. Other study problems have included the common use of acetaminophen as the analgesic and antipyretic of choice during pregnancy. Because acetaminophen use may be a marker for infectious or inflammatory disorders, the results of the epidemiology studies may be influenced by confounding by indication. A placebo-controlled randomized trial of acetaminophen use during pregnancy would be helpful in resolving the question of whether acetaminophen use causes childhood asthma. At present, the evidence is inconclusive that any such association is causal. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: We compared the clinical efficacy and safety between a new injectable cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor, parecoxib, and an old nonselective, ketorolac combined with morphine in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for management of post-cesarean delivery pain. Methods: In this randomized, open-label study, 66 parturients undergoing cesarean section were divided into two groups: In Group P the patients received an initial intravenous bolus of 40 mg parecoxib as a loading dose post-operatively and then two bolus doses of 20 mg parecoxib were subsequently given at intervals of 24 h. Morphine was basically used in PCA manner during the 3-day study course; and in Group K patients received an intravenous loading bolus of 30 mg ketorolac post-operatively and then 90 mg ketorolac combined with morphine in PCA fashion throughout the study course. Efficacy was evaluated by Verbal ranking scale (0-10) for pain intensity, Ramsay sedation score (1-6), profile of mood state (0-3) and quality of sleep (0-3), and patient satisfaction (0-4) with the analgesia. Efficacy evaluations and adverse effects were recorded every 24 h and at 72 h after initial loading boluses. The duration of hospital stay and total dose of morphine used throughout the study were also recorded. Results: There were no significant differences of sedation scale, mood state, quality of sleep and satisfaction between two groups, except patients of Group P had a lower pain scores than those of the Group K at 24 h (3.1, range 0-5 vs. 4.3, range 0-8, p = 0.005) and 72 h (1.1, range 0-3 vs. 1.9, range 0-4, p = 0.005). Moreover, there were also no significant differences in the duration of hospital stay, but there was a lower total morphine requirement (22% reduction) in Group P in comparison with Group K (43.5 ± 19.2 vs. 55.5 ± 21.5, p = 0.02). Regarding adverse effects, there were no statistical differences between two groups. Conclusions: We noted that parecoxib with PCA morphine can be used for post-cesarean delivery analgesia with the same efficacy as ketorolac for an opioid-sparing effect.

AB  - This paper is looking at the effect of maternal smoking on 10 year intrauterine growth restricted compared to normal children. Lomb periodogram and Poincaré plots were used for this assessment. It is found that during waking, the LF/HF ratio showed IUGR children whose mothers did or did not smoke during pregnancy have elevated levels (2.66, 2.89) respectively, compared to the normal groups (2.23, 2.18). During sleep, the LF/HF ratio was (0.69, 0.79) for IUGR children, and (0.52, 0.52) for normal children. The Poincaré analysis of long-term variability suggested that IUGR children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy have less long term HRV during sleep (SD2=148.53ms) than their healthy counterparts whose mothers smoked (SD2=182.87ms), p=0.02, and significantly lower short-term variability value was found for IUGR asthmatic children whose mothers smoked.

AB  - Efficacy and tolerability of a new antiepileptic drug pregabalin (lyrica) as an add-on drug in patients with focal refractory epilepsy was analyzed. The most commonly used dosage was 450 mg/d. For the 6-month treatment of 19 patients, aged 18-30 years, a positive effect of the combined therapy was observed in 68,4%, the remission was achieved in 31,6% and the significant improvement in 36,8%. Drug was discontinued due to the lack of efficacy and intolerance in 31,6%. Drowsiness was the most frequent adverse event and hemorrhagic vasculitis was registered in one patient. Two cases of effective use of the drug during pregnancy with the birth of healthy children are reported. A case of the high efficacy of pregabalin in migraine-epilepsy is described. High efficacy and good tolerability as well as favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics and distinct anxyolytic effect give indications for use of pregabalin in clinical practice.

AB  - Several essential principles should be considered in determining appropriate treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS), such as potential secondary causes of RLS, timing and frequency of RLS symptoms, and impact of activity level. Different classes of medication have been used in the treatment of RLS, including both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic agents. Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are a polysomnographic finding of stereotyped repetitive movements of the legs during sleep, which are present in more than 80% of RLS patients. Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is defined as the presence of PLMS in patients with otherwise unexplained hypersomnia or insomnia. The diagnosis of PLMS can only be made after other sleep disorders have been excluded. Pharmacologic therapy of primary RLS, secondary RLS, and PLMD are discussed in this article. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Narcolepsy, an uncommon neurologic disorder, afflicts approximately 1 in 2000 individuals in the United States. Although management has improved significantly, especially with use of modafinil and sodium oxybate, impairment of function and quality of life persists in a considerable number of patients. Current therapeutic approaches are based on symptomatic relief and are often associated with undesirable side effects. This article describes the monoaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems and describes narcolepsy medications that work through these systems. The recently discovered orexin/hypocretin system is also described. The authors conclude that potential hypocretin-based therapy seems to hold promise for the future. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cyclosporine is highly effective in the treatment of a multitude of dermatoses. Concern over its side effect profile has limited its use in dermatology. Adverse effects are, for the most part, dose dependent and related to duration of therapy. Using the recommended monitoring protocols results in a significant decrease in the incidence of cyclosporine-related toxicities. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine, potential drug interactions, adverse effects, and recommendations for monitoring in patients treated with cyclosporine. The use of cyclosporine in pregnancy and in the pediatric population is also addressed. Learning objectives: After completing this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the monitoring guidelines of cyclosporine, its contraindications, its possible drug interactions, its adverse effect profile, and its use in pregnancy and the childhood and adolescent populations. © 2010 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

AB  - Among patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depression is one of the most commonly occurring comorbid conditions. A dual diagnosis of depression and diabetes has been linked to poor adherence and decreased daily diabetes self-care and often leads to suboptimal metabolic control and increased diabetes-related complications. Pediatric diabetes clinicians are in a unique position to identify behavior changes over time and provide early identification and preventive intervention for children and adolescents at risk for depression. This article provides an overview of the differential diagnosis process that pediatric clinicians face and practical advice for providers when evaluating and addressing depressive symptoms during routine diabetes clinic visits.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate if the ordinary use of a vaginal suppository containing miconazole results in systemic absorption that is sufficient to affect the activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, which are major drug- and steroid-metabolising enzymes. Methods: In 20 healthy non-pregnant women aged 18-45 years, the serum concentration of miconazole was determined following the use of a vaginal suppository containing 1,200 mg miconazole. Enzyme activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were determined as metabolic ratios of caffeine (CMR = (AFMU + 1MU + 1MX)/17DMU) and quinidine (QMR = 3-hydroxy-quinidine/quinidine) respectively before and 34 h after insertion of the suppository. Miconazole was analysed by LC-MS/MS, while caffeine and metabolites were analysed by HPLC-UV and quinidine and hydroxy-quinidine were analysed by HPLC fluorescence. Results: All 20 women had measurable concentrations of miconazole in serum (mean ± SD: 12.9 ± 5.6 μg/L; range: 3.5-24.6 μg/L). Although not statistically significant, an association between the serum concentrations of miconazole and the inhibition of CYP1A2 activity was indicated. No relation was observed between the CYP3A4 activity and the miconazole serum concentration. Conclusions: Miconazole is absorbed via the vaginal mucosa to the systemic circulation in measurable concentrations. Our data indicate a concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, but the effect is negligible compared with the variation in the activity of CYP1A2 and is regarded to be of no clinical significance to the women. However, further studies on the ability of miconazole to be transferred across the placenta or to interfere with the placental function are warranted to secure safe use during pregnancy. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Each of these quotes written a century apart identifies an intervention that will redress the pain of childbirth. The absolute faith in a technological innovation is a central theme in American medicine. In the case of maternity care practice, information technology has played a less obvious role than in other fields of medicine, however, it was a critical component of the campaign of obstetricians to gain control of maternity care practice in the twentieth century. As the twentyfirst century begins, however, the development of multiple specialized sources of information on pregnancy and childbirth is providing mothers with the foundation to challenge that hard-won control. The story begins a century ago. As the twentieth century began, the challenge faced by male doctors in the emerging specialty of obstetrics was a simple one-how could physicians develop a respected medical specialty when the same work they proposed to do was being carried out by female midwives, many with limited training. Equally frustrating to physicians, the outcomes of midwife-attended births were usually better than the results of physician-attended births, since midwives were generally far more experienced birth attendants.3 Most European countries solved this problem by restructuring practice and developing screening protocols to identify lower risk births which would be attended by midwives while obstetricians became specialists in managing high-risk cases.4 In the United States (and Canada and South Africa) the goal was different-to eliminate midwifery with obstetricians taking control of low- as well as high-risk births. The key to achieving this goal was information technology (IT), not as a unified concept but in terms of controlling the use of information and technology to further obstetrics. Information was conveyed by contemporary media (primarily advice books and women's and popular magazines) to redefine birth as a dangerous event.5 Technology was critical to the claim that only those in control of the latest, most sophisticated systems could protect mothers and infants from the deadly outcomes associated with birth. Of additional importance to many women, innovations such as Twilight Sleep were being touted as rendering childbirth painless.6 Twilight Sleep, at that time a mixture of scopolamine and morphine, was not an anesthetic but an amnesiac causing a woman to have little or no memory of her childbirth experience. Developed in Germany in the early twentieth century it soon became popular in the United States.7 Since Twilight Sleep could only be administered by a physician in a hospital, its use significantly shifted not only the domain of birth away from the female-controlled home to the male-dominated hospital, but, since midwives were denied hospital privileges, altered who could attend births in the United States. Equally important, this new technology became tied to an information campaign that focused on doctors as the most reliable source of information on pregnancy and childbirth. In essence, the nascent profession of obstetrics took advantage of the opportunity provided by new media (books and magazines) to lay the foundation for control of the flow of information concerning pregnancy and birth. The burgeoning women's movements at the time were critical to this effort, leading to the formation of Twilight Sleep Societies advocating for more widespread use of the new drugs. These campaigns emphasized the frailty of "refined" women and the need to protect them from the scourge of pain in childbirth.8 The results of these efforts powerfully supported the redefinition of birth from being a natural event to one that was so fraught with danger that only a trained doctor in a hospital with the latest technology could prevent disastrous outcomes. In this case, a technological innovation combined with an information campaign to reshape maternal perspectives on childbirth, foster the elevation of the hospital as the center of scientific and technological intervention, and promote the obstetrician as the safest option for birthing mothers. This trend continued throughout the twentieth century as birth became increasingly organized to address the needs of institutions, providers, and the new technologies that enhanced obstetricians' control of the process.9. © 2010 by The Rutgers University Press.

AB  - Objective: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome type A) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme sulfamidase. Information on the natural course of MPS IIIA is scarce, but is much needed in view of emerging therapies. Methods Clinical history and molecular defects of all 110 MPS IIIA patients identified by enzymatic studies in the Netherlands were collected and included in this study. Results First clinical signs, mainly consisting of delayed speech development and behavioral problems, were noted between the ages of 1 and 6 years. Other symptoms included sleeping and hearing problems, recurrent upper airway infections, diarrhea, and epilepsy. The clinical course varied remarkably and could be correlated with the molecular defects. The frequent pathogenic mutations p.R245H, p.Q380R, p.S66W, and c.1080delC were associated with the classical severe phenotype. Patients compound heterozygous for the p.S298P mutation in combination with 1 of the mutations associated with the classical severe phenotype had a significantly longer preservation of psychomotor functions and a longer survival. Two patients homozygous for the p.S298P mutation, and 4 patients from 3 families heterozygous for 3 missense variants not reported previously (p.T421R, p.P180L, and p.L12Q), showed a remarkably attenuated phenotype. Interpretation We report the natural history and mutational analysis in a large unbiased cohort of MPS IIIA patients. We demonstrate that the clinical spectrum of MPS IIIA is much broader than previously reported. A significant genotype-phenotype correlation was established in this cohort.

AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB, Sanfilippo syndrome type B) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyl-α-D-glucosaminidase (NAGLU). Information on the natural course of MPS IIIB is scarce but much needed in view of emerging therapies. To improve knowledge on the natural course, data on all 52 MPS IIIB patients ever identified by enzymatic studies in the Netherlands were gathered. Clinical data on 44 patients could be retrieved. Only a small number (n=9; 21%) presented with a classical MPS III phenotype; all other patients showed a much more attenuated course of the disease characterized by a significantly slower regression of intellectual and motor abilities. The majority of patients lived well into adulthood. First signs of the disease, usually mild developmental delay, were observed at a median age of 4 years. Subsequently, patients showed a slowing and eventually a stagnation of development. Patients with the attenuated phenotype had a stable intellectual disability for many years. Molecular analysis was performed in 24 index patients. The missense changes p.R643C, p.S612G, p.E634K, and p.L497V were exclusively found in patients with the attenuated phenotype. MPS IIIB comprises a remarkably wide spectrum of disease severity, and an unselected cohort including all Dutch patients showed a large proportion (79%) with an attenuated phenotype. MPS IIIB must be considered in patients with a developmental delay, even in the absence of a progressive decline in intellectual abilities. A key feature, necessitating metabolic studies, is the coexistence of behavioral problems. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Tabule, wife of Kipruto arap Soi, a Lumbwa woman from Kenya, pleaded guilty in 1947 to killing her husband by strangling him with a rope in his sleep. They had been married for eight years, had three children, and Tabule was pregnant with her fourth child. However, as the district officer (DO) of Kericho reported, she had suffered "severe persecution from her husband. He had repeatedly beaten her, and was known to be like a wild animal when drunk." Tabule's experience of domestic abuse roused the colonial state's sympathy, and her death sentence was commuted to five months' imprisonment.1 Domestic violence was one of the most commonly attributed reasons for murder in colonial courts in both Kenya and Nyasaland from 1920 to 1956, both in cases such as Tabule's when someone resorted to lethal violence to escape abuse and in cases where abuse escalated into murder. As Katherine Luongo shows in "Domestic Dramas and Occult Acts," colonial legal settings had few tropes available for talking about domestic violence: witchcraft was one, but murder was another arena in which acts of domestic abuse were brought to light.2 In colonial Africa, murder trials were an arena where notions of "violence" and socially acceptable behavior clashed and were contested, where private lives became the subject of public discourses. This chapter analyzes domestic violence in Kenya and Nyasaland though the medium of High Court and Supreme Court murder trials, focusing both on the colonial judge's perceptions of the accused as perpetrators of domestic violence, and on the accused person's representations of his or her own "criminality." The attitudes of native assessors and local communities toward the domestic violence reported are also revealed. Trial transcripts, judgments, and commutation reports here highlight the discourses surrounding domestic violence and how crimes resulting from such violence were sentenced by colonial courts, showing how this varied over time, location, and circumstance. © 2010 by Ohio University Press All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: Māori have high SIDS rates and relevant information is needed to craft appropriate prevention strategies. The aim of the study was to determine what Māori mothers know about SIDS prevention, and to determine their SIDS-related child care practices. Methods: Māori mothers who gave birth in the Counties Manukau District Health Board area were surveyed about their SIDS related knowledge, and infant care practices and their reasons for using and their concerns about these practices. Results were compared with a similar 2005 survey of a largely European sample. Results: Knowledge of Māori mothers about SIDS prevention was much lower than for European mothers. More Māori infants slept prone and Māori mothers stopped breastfeeding significantly earlier. Although co-sleeping rates were similar, bedsharing increased to 65% for some part of the night. In addition, more than half of the Māori mothers had smoked in pregnancy and 21% of them were sharing a bed with their infant. Potentially unsafe soft objects such as rolled blankets or pillows were used by a third of mothers to help maintain the sleep position. Conclusions: Māori mothers have a poorer knowledge of SIDS prevention practices. The high rate of maternal smoking, the early cessation of breastfeeding, and co-sleeping where there was smoking in pregnancy were also areas of concern. Appropriate health promotion measures need to be developed for the high-risk Māori community. ©NZMA.

AB  - This article includes a brief overview of McNamara's (2004) evolutionary model of dreaming. The strengths and weaknesses of this model are then evaluated in terms of its consonance with measurable neurological and biological properties of dreaming, its fit within the tenets of evolutionary theories of dreams, and its alignment with evolutionary concepts of cooperation and spirituality. McNamara's model focuses primarily on dreaming that occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; therefore this article also focuses on REM dreaming.

AB  - Background: Inhibins are important regulators of the female reproductive system. Recently, two new inhibin subunits betaC and betaE have been described, although it is unclear if they are synthesized in normal human endometrium.Methods: Samples of human endometrium were obtained from 82 premenopausal, non-pregnant patients undergoing gynecological surgery for benign diseases. Endometrium samples were classified according to anamnestic and histological dating into proliferative (day 1-14, n = 46), early secretory (day 15-22, n = 18) and late secretory phase (day 23-28, n = 18). Immunohistochemical analyses were performed with specific antibodies against inhibin alpha (n = 81) as well as inhibin betaA (n = 82), betaB (n = 82), betaC (n = 74) and betaE (n = 76) subunits. RT-PCR was performed for all inhibin subunits. Correlation was assessed with the Spearman factor to assess the relationship of inhibin-subunits expression within the different endometrial samples.Results: The novel inhibin betaC and betaE subunits were found in normal human endometrium by immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. Inhibin alpha, betaA, betaB and betaE subunits showed a circadian expression pattern, being more abundant during the late secretory phase than during the proliferative phase. Additionally, a significant correlation between inhibin alpha and all inhibin beta subunits was observed.Conclusions: The differential expression pattern of the betaC- and betaE-subunits in normal human endometrial tissue suggests that they function in endometrial maturation and blastocyst implantation. However, the precise role of these novel inhibin/activin subunits in human endometrium is unclear and warrants further investigation. © 2010 Mylonas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Nutrient deficiency during perinatal development is associated with an increased risk to develop obesity, diabetes and hypertension in the adulthood. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental programming of the metabolic syndrome remain largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Given the essential role of the hypothalamus in the integration of nutritional, endocrine and neuronal cues, here we have analyzed the profile of the hypothalamus transcriptome in 180 days-old rats born to dams fed either a control (200 g/kg) or a low-protein (80 g/kg) diet through pregnancy and lactation. From a total of 26 209 examined genes, 688 were up-regulated and 309 down-regulated (P<0.003) by early protein restriction. Further bioinformatic analysis of the data revealed that perinatal protein restriction permanently alters the expression of two gene clusters regulating common cellular processes. The first one includes several gate keeper genes regulating insulin signaling and nutrient sensing. The second cluster encompasses a functional network of nuclear receptors and co-regulators of transcription involved in the detection and use of lipid nutrients as fuel which, in addition, link temporal and nutritional cues to metabolism through their tight interaction with the circadian clock. Conclusions/Significance: Collectively, these results indicate that the programming of the hypothalamic circuits regulating energy homeostasis is a key step in the development of obesity associated with malnutrition in early life and provide a valuable resource for further investigating the role of the hypothalamus in the programming of the metabolic syndrome. © 2010 Orozco-Solís et al.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the relationships between postnatal passive respiratory compliance (Crs) and development of respiratory disorders during the first 6 month of life in preterm and full-term infants after respiratory insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether other relevant neonatal factors, like degree of prematurity, birth weigh, ventilatory conditions, sepsis, and respiratory disease severity affected this relationship. MAtERIAL AND METHODS: The passive respiratory compliance was measured by the single occlusion technique in 73 preterm infants after respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 19 full-term infants after congenital pneumonia and 33 healthy full-term infants. Respiratory function measurements were performed by single occlusion technique, during natural sleep, after acute phase of illness, before discharge from neonatal department. RESULTS: Crs was significantly lower in premature newborns < 36 weeks gestation after RDS (p = 0.0002) and in term newborns who have suffered from a congenital pneumonia (p = 0.0411), than in healthy full-term newborn infants. Premature infants who have undergone sepsis have significantly decreased Crs in relationship with those who did not have this complication (p = 0.0334). Preterm newborns who have suffered pneumonia during treatment of RDS have significantly frequent respiratory problems during the first 6 month of age (p = 0.043). Full-term infants after congenital pneumonia have more but not significantly frequent respiratory problems than healthy term newborns (p = 0.055) in this period. Decreased neonatal Crs wasn't significantly related to respiratory disorders in age of 6 month of life. CONCLUSION: Prematurity under 36 week of gestational age, low birth weight and suffering from sepsis in premature infants significantly decreased Crs in newborn. Decreased neonatal Crs in premature and full term infants after respiratory insufficiency wasn't significantly related to respiratory disorders during first 6 month of life. This study has showed significantly increase of respiratory problems in this period in preterm infants who have suffered from pneumonia during neonatal period.

AB  - Sleep disorders are common in the general population and even more so in clinical practice, yet are relatively poorly understood by doctors and other health care practitioners. These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines are designed to address this problem by providing an accessible up-to-date and evidence-based outline of the major issues, especially those relating to reliable diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A consensus meeting was held in London in May 2009. Those invited to attend included BAP members, representative clinicians with a strong interest in sleep disorders and recognized experts and advocates in the field, including a representative from mainland Europe and the USA. Presenters were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aimed to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was then circulated to all participants for comment. Key subsequent publications were added by the writer and speakers at draft stage. All comments were incorporated as far as possible in the final document, which represents the views of all participants although the authors take final responsibility for the document. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Background: A link between early mismatched nutritional environment and development of components of the metabolic syndrome later in life has been shown in epidemiological and animal data. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an early mismatched nutrition produced by catch-up growth after fetal protein restriction could induce the appearance of hypertension and/or atherosclerosis in adult male mice. Methodology/Principal Findings: Wild-type C57BL6/J or LDLr-/- dams were fed a low protein (LP) or a control (C) diet during gestation. Catch-up growth was induced in LP offspring by feeding dams with a control diet and by culling the litter to 4 pups against 8 in controls. At weaning, male mice were fed either standard chow or an obesogenic diet (OB), leading to 4 experimental groups. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed in conscious unrestrained wild-type mice by telemetry. Atherosclerosis plaque area was measured in aortic root sections of LDLr-/- mice. We found that: (1) postnatal OB diet increased significantly BP (P,0.0001) and HR (P,0.008) in 3-month old OB-C and OB-LP offspring, respectively; (2) that maternal LP diet induced a significant higher BP (P,0.009) and HR (P,0.004) and (3) an altered circadian rhythm in addition to higher plasma corticosterone concentration in 9 months-old LP offspring; (4) that, although LP offspring showed higher plasma total cholesterol than control offspring, atherosclerosis assessed in aortic roots of 6-mo old mice featured increased plaque area due to OB feeding but not due to early mismatched nutrition. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate a long-term effect of early mismatched nutrition on the appearance of hypertension independently of obesity, while no effect on atherosclerosis was noticed at this age. © 2010 Bol et al.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a key role in the neuroendocrine response to stress. Dynamic changes in HPA axis regulation and hence HPA responsivity occur over the lifetime of an animal. This article focuses on two extremes of the spectrum. The first occurs naturally during pregnancy when stress responses are dampened. The second, at the opposite end of the scale, occurs in offspring of mothers who were exposed to stress during pregnancy and display exaggerated HPA axis stress responses. Reduced glucocorticoid output in response to stress in pregnancy may have important consequences for conserving energy supply to the foetus(es), in modulating immune system adaptations and in protecting against adverse foetal programming by glucocorticoids. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning this adaptation in pregnancy may provide insights for manipulating HPA axis responsiveness in later life, particularly in the context of resetting HPA axis hyperactivity associated with prenatal stress exposure, which may underlie several major pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, cognitive decline and mood disorders. © 2010 The Author.

AB  - Little is known about the effect on the human foetus of long-term and acute exposure to caffeine. We studied the organisation of foetal sleep-wake states in 13 healthy near-term foetuses over a wide range of maternal plasma caffeine concentrations (0-13 μg/mL) reflecting normal lifestyle conditions (day 0) and again following intake of two cups of regular coffee (∼300 mg of caffeine) intermitted by 50 h of abstinence (day 2; acute effects). On either day, 2 h simultaneous recordings were made of foetal heart rate, general-, eye-, and breathing-movements. The recordings were analysed for the presence of each of four foetal behavioural states: quiet- and active-sleep, quiet- and active-wakefulness. There was a linear relationship between maternal caffeine content and the incidence of foetal general movements during active sleep on day 0 (R = 0.74; P < 0.02). After coffee loading on day 2, foetuses of non- or low-caffeine consumers showed increases in active wakefulness (P < 0.001), general movements (P < 0.05) and heart rate variation (P < 0.01) but lower basal heart rate (P < 0.01) compared with their day 0 values. The changes in foetal heart rate (variation) and behaviour occurred between 90 and 180 min post-consumption. In contrast, foetuses of habitual caffeine consumers remained unaffected suggestive of foetal tolerance to caffeine. The results indicate differential performance between foetuses regularly exposed to caffeine and those caffeine-naive, both under normal maternal lifestyle conditions and in response to maternal coffee ingestion. © The Author(s), 2010.

AB  - Although the mercury sphygmomanometer is widely regarded as the gold standard for office blood pressure measurement, the ban on use of mercury devices continues to diminish their role in office and hospital settings. To date, mercury devices have largely been phased out in United States hospitals. This situation has led to the proliferation of nonmercury devices and has changed (probably forever) the preferable modality of blood pressure measurement in clinic and hospital settings. In this article, the basic techniques of blood pressure measurement and the technical issues associated with measurements in clinical practice are discussed. The devices currently available for hospital and clinic measurements and their important sources of error are presented. Practical advice is given on how the different devices and measurement techniques should be used. Blood pressure measurements in different circumstances and in special populations such as infants, children, pregnant women, elderly persons, and obese subjects are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Overexposure to glucocorticoids has been proposed as a mechanism by which prenatal adversity 'programs' the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPAA), thereby increasing the risk of adult diseases. Glycyrrhizin, a natural constituent of licorice, potently inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, the feto-placental barrier to the higher maternal cortisol levels. We studied if maternal consumption of glycyrrhizin in licorice associates with HPAA function in children. Diurnal salivary cortisol and salivary cortisol during the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C) were measured in children (n=321, mean age. =8.1, SD. =0.3 years) whose mothers consumed varying levels of glycyrrhizin in licorice during pregnancy; exposure-level groups were labeled high (≥500. mg/week), moderate (250-499. mg/week) and zero-low (0-249. mg/week). In comparison to the zero-low exposure group, children in the high exposure group had 19.2% higher salivary cortisol awakening peak, 33.1% higher salivary cortisol awakening slope, 15.4% higher salivary cortisol awakening area under the curve (AUC), 30.8% higher baseline TSST-C salivary cortisol levels, and their salivary cortisol levels remained high throughout the TSST-C protocol (P-values <0.05). These effects appeared dose-related. Our findings lend support to prenatal 'programming' of HPAA function by overexposure to glucocorticoids. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A method commonly used to identify illness in dairy cows is measuring body temperatures with a rectal thermometer, but vaginal measures are becoming common in research. The primary objective of this study was to validate vaginal measures of body temperature by comparing them with rectal temperatures. Data loggers used to collect vaginal temperatures can be programmed to collect many readings per day, providing an opportunity to interpret effects of health in relation to diurnal differences in temperatures. Thus, a secondary objective was to compare the diurnal pattern in body temperatures for cows with and without retained placenta (RP). Body temperature was monitored for 8 d in 29 cows that had recently calved (enrolled 2 d after calving; 7 of these cows were diagnosed with RP) and in 13 cows in peak lactation (98 ± 8 d in milk). Rectal temperatures were taken at 0630, 0930, 1230, 1530, 1830, and 2130. h (±30. min) with a digital thermometer for 8 d consecutively. During the same period, vaginal temperatures were measured every 10. min with a microprocessor-controlled data logger attached to a modified vaginal controlled internal drug release insert. Values from the vaginal loggers were averaged over 1. h and paired with the corresponding rectal temperature. There was a relationship between rectal and vaginal temperatures for fresh cows (n = 1,393; r = 0.81) and for peak-lactation cows (n = 556; r = 0.46). Cows with RP had higher body temperatures (39.2 ± 0.01) compared with healthy cows (39.1 ± 0.01). Body temperature was higher at night, and lower between 0800 to 1000. h for healthy cows (39.0 ± 0.02) and between 1100 to 1300. h for RP cows (39.1 ± 0.02). In summary, vaginal temperatures were associated with rectal measures, and provided the advantage of capturing dirurnal changes in body temperature. © 2010 American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - Most women experience numerous sleep disturbances for the first time in their life during pregnancy, which dramatically changes sleep architecture. Sleep disturbances commence with the onset of pregnancy, and they increase in frequency and duration as pregnancy progresses. The most common sleep disturbances occurring during pregnancy are nausea, vomiting, frequent urination, and anxiety (especially in first-time or unplanned pregnancies) in the first trimester and backache, fetal movement, abdominal discomfort, leg cramps, frequent urination, shortness of breath, heartburn, and anxiety about delivery and the fetus at the end of the second and into the third trimester. As a result of these disturbances and pregnancy-related changes, women suffer from considerable daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Sleep-related disorders also occur or worsen during pregnancy, such as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), restless legs syndrome (RLS) and insomnia. SDB, including snoring and sleep apnea, can be induced by pregnancy-related changes in the upper airway, lung mechanics, and the control of breathing. Pregnancy-related RLS is considered a secondary form of RLS, which has been attributed to low iron and folate level at preconception. Complaints of nocturnal esophageal reflux and sleep-related leg cramps also increase during pregnancy. All these symptoms need to be seriously assessed, particularly in women with obesity and those who develop hypertension because of the potential adverse outcomes for maternal and fetal well-being and poor obstetric outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, or long labor. Nonpharmacologic interventions for sleep disturbances and disorders, including lifestyle modifications, should be considered as the first choice. If pharmacologic treatment is needed for severe conditions, medications should be used with caution due to their possible teratogenic effects. Most medications are lacking controlled trials in pregnant women. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This article reviews current data on pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy may cause harm, and explores biological pathways for associated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, especially pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. Recent Findings: Accumulating data indicate that snoring and sleep apnea during pregnancy are likely to increase the risk for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Several new studies have observed that sleep-disordered breathing and short sleep duration also increase the risk of gestational diabetes, similar to observations in the general population. There are varying levels of emerging evidence for potential mechanisms, including oxidative stress, increased sympathetic activity and inflammation, adipokine levels and insulin resistance, linking sleep-disordered breathing events during pregnancy to adverse outcomes. Summary: Sleep-disordered breathing and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes share a number of mechanistic pathways, and growing data in pregnant women indicate that snoring and sleep apnea increase the risk of these and other complications for both the mother and the fetus. Nevertheless, direct evidence of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy exerts negative effects remains sparse. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Aims: To perform a large and detailed epidemiologic study on restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy in a European country. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was distributed by the medical staff in different outpatient waiting rooms (obstetrics and gynecology department of the university hospital, obstetrics and gynecology department of a private clinic, private midwives, private obstetrician-gynecologists, radiological centers before fetal ultrasound examination and general practitioners) in a French town and its surrounding area (200,000 inhabitants): A woman was considered affected if she met the International RLS Study Group criteria for RLS diagnosis. Results: 1,022 pregnant women living in a French town were included. 24% of women were affected by RLS during their pregnancy. The disease was strongly related to the third trimester of pregnancy and had a significant impact on sleep leading to severe nocturnal and diurnal consequences with a high consumption of sleep medication. Conclusions: RLS affects one quarter of pregnant women, essentially during the third trimester and represents an important public health issue with sleep medication intake. © 2010 Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The prevalence of epilepsy is about 05-1.0%, and slightly less than half of those affected are women. Epilepsy is more frequent neurologocical disorder during pregnancy. Women with epilepsy that plan to become pregnant can in general look forward to uneventful pregnancies and to giving birth to normal children. Women with epilepsy do have an increased risk of certain obstetrical complications. There is an increased risk of vaginal bleeding, anemia, hyperemesis gravidarum, vitamine D and K deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, preeclampsia, eclampsia,premature labor, and postpartum bleeding. The effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable and unpredictable between patients. Approximately 25% of patients have an increase in their seizures. Pregnancy is associated with several physiologic and psychologic changes that can alter seizure frequency, including changes in sex hormone concentrations, changes in antiepileptic drug metabolism, sleep deprivation, and new stresses. The risk for congenital malformations is higher in women on antiepileptic drug regimens.These risks can be reduced with appropriate prepregnancy counseling. During pregnancy, important considerations include; therapeutic drug monitoring, surveillance for obstetric complications and vigilance for seizures during the intrapartum and postpartum period. The care of pregnant women with epilepsy requires attention and close cooperation between neurologist and gynecologist is recommended. In this article we answer the questions commonly asked by epileptic patients regarding pregnancy. Copyright © 2010 by Türkiye Klinikleri.

AB  - The current study explored the relationship between maternal subjective sleep quality and two factors that have been independently linked to maternal sleep: infant caretaking at night and maternal depressive symptom severity. Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD=4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD=1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD=33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman's sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period. © 2010 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.

AB  - Objective: To explore whether standardized survey instruments and objective performance measures differentiate traditional constructs of sleepiness and fatigue among a sample of postpartum mothers. Additionally, we wanted to explore the independent associations among these measures with actigraphically measured nocturnal sleep variables. Method: Seventy-nine postpartum mothers' subjective sleepiness, fatigue, and performance measures [Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Visual Analogue of Fatigue Scale (VAS), Profile of Mood States (POMS) subscale items, and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT)] and objective actigraphically measured sleep were collected during postpartum week 11. A principal components analysis was calculated, then regressions were calculated among resulting factors and among individual measures with total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Results: Three factors accounted for 83.84% of model variance. Factor 1 (41.41%) included the SSS, ESS, and the VAS. Factor 2 (28.13%) included only PVT variables. Factor 3 (14.30%) included the two POMS subscale items. Factor 1 was associated with nocturnal sleep time and Factor 2 was associated with sleep efficiency. The ESS was independently associated with nocturnal sleep time, whereas, POMS-Vigor subscale and median reaction time, together, were associated with sleep efficiency. Conclusion: Among postpartum mothers, standard instruments used to measure sleepiness, fatigue, and performance were distributed among three distinct factors that did not clearly identify traditional sleepiness and fatigue constructs. Objectively measured sleep time and sleep efficiency were associated with specific factors, as well as specific measures, that correspond to sleepiness and fatigue states. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The current study compared the performances of pregnant women with education- and age-matched controls on a variety of measures that assessed perceptual speed, short-term and working memory capacity, subjective memory complaints, sleep quality, level of fatigue, executive functioning, episodic and prospective memory, and crystallized and fluid intelligence. A primary purpose was to test the hypothesis of Henry and Rendell (2007) that pregnancy-related declines in cognitive functioning would be especially evident in tasks that place a high demand on executive processes. We also investigated a parallel hypothesis: that the pregnant women would experience a broad-based reduction in cognitive capability. Very limited support was found for the executive functioning hypothesis. Pregnant women scored lower only on the measure of verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, COWAT) but not on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task or on any working memory measures. Furthermore, group differences in COWAT performance disappeared after controlling for verbal IQ (Shipley vocabulary). In addition, there was no support for the general decline hypothesis. We conclude that pregnancy-associated differences in performance observed in the current study were relatively mild and rarely reached either clinical or practical significance. © 2010 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the impact of neonatal arthritis on adult pain threshold, sleep and general behaviours in rats and their lactating dams. Male pups were injected in the hind paw with complete Freund's adjuvant or saline on postnatal day (PN) 1. After weaning, dams were tested for anxiety, sleep recording or hormone profiling (ACTH, corticosterone and prolactin) and brain sampling (pineal melatonin and hippocampus serotonin). At adulthood (PN90), distinct subgroups of neonatal arthritic (AR) and control rats (CR) were also assessed for anxiety and pain thresholds, sleep recording, and blood/brain sampling. Compared to their respective controls at PN12, dams of arthritic rats (DAR) showed a longer latency in expressing pup retrieval and dam-pup interaction. DAR and AR showed a lower pain threshold, anxiety-like behaviour, and sleep fragmentation. Compared to controls, DAR displayed longer sleep latency, reduced paradoxical sleep latency and sleep efficiency, a decrease in prolactin and serotonin levels and increased melatonin levels. This model of unilateral hindpaw inflammation has a wide range of long-term effects in both lactating dams and their adult offspring. © 2010 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.

AB  - Objective: Bed sharing has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and may contribute to the racial disparity seen in infant mortality. It is unclear how bed sharing interacts with other factors to impact SIDS risk. We aimed to measure the effects of bed sharing on risk of SIDS in blacks and to determine whether the risk is modified by other characteristics of the sleep environment. Methods: Characteristics of 195 black infants who died of SIDS were compared with matched controls. The moderating influence of known SIDS risk factors on the effect of bed sharing on risk of SIDS was examined using logistic regression. Results: Almost half (47.4%) of the study population bed shared during the last/reference sleep (58% cases and 37% controls). Bed sharing was associated with 2 times greater risk of SIDS compared with not bed sharing. The deleterious effect of bed sharing was more pronounced with a soft sleep surface, pillow use, maternal smoking, and younger infant age. However, bed sharing was still associated with an increased risk of SIDS, even when the infant was not using a pillow or sleeping on a firm surface. The strongest predictors of SIDS among bed-sharing infants were soft sleep surface, nonuse of a pacifier, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Conclusions: Bed sharing is a common practice among black infants. It is associated with a clear and strong increased risk of SIDS, which is even greater when combined with other known risk factors for SIDS. This practice likely contributes to the excess incidence of SIDS among blacks, and culturally competent education methods must be developed to target this high-risk group. © 2010 by Academic Pediatric Association.

AB  - Although multiple sclerosis (MS) affects both women and men, women are more susceptible to MS than men. Accumulating evidence indicates that the incidence and prevalence of MS is increasing, more so in women than in men. Owing to pregnancy, differing hormonal states and distinct social roles, the impact of MS differs between women and men. Since Patricia K Coyle published a review on gender issues in MS, multiple studies have added to the body of knowledge. This update will summarize the current thinking on gender-related issues in MS and we will address incidence and prevalence, hormonal factors, pregnancy and breastfeeding, genetics, course and prognosis, imaging, treatment and psychosocial aspects. Future progression within this field will help elucidate the cause of and define the treatment of MS. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes that exposure to mass media (eg, television, movies, video and computer games, the Internet, music lyrics and videos, newspapers, magazines, books, advertising) presents health risks for children and adolescents but can provide benefits as well. Media education has the potential to reduce the harmful effects of media and accentuate the positive effects. By understanding and supporting media education, pediatricians can play an important role in reducing harmful effects of media on children and adolescents.

AB  - We aimed to analyse infant (birth characteristics, feeding type, faecal enzyme activities) and environmental (maternal smoking, nutrition and psychological status, mother-child bonding, family structure, support for the mother, familial atopy) risk factors for infant colic and to follow infants with respect to physical growth, sleeping status up to 8 months of age in a nested case-control study. 660 mothers who delivered at Dr Zekai Tahir Burak Maternity Hospital, were enrolled within 3-72h post delivery. Each infant with inconsolable persistent crying and four matched infants with no crying episodes were invited by phone to Hacettepe University Ihsan Doǧramaci Children's Hospital at 30-45 days post partum. At 40-55 days, we examined the infants and gave mothers a questionnaire, including crying characteristics of the infants; 47 infants were diagnosed with colic and 142 as non-colic. When the infants were 7-8 months old, another interview was done. The colic group had higher proportions of less-educated (≤8 years) and smoking mothers, extended family and families with domestic violence than the non-colic group. The colic group of mothers had significantly higher rates of 'impaired bonding' in the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire, higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, higher scores for hostility subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory and a more irregular sleep pattern than the non-colic group. No differences were revealed for faecal enzyme activities. At 7-8 months, the colic group was shorter than the non-colic group. Colic was associated with various perinatal factors (maternal education, smoking habits, cheese consumption, hostility scores and domestic violence) and having colic in infancy negatively affected the sleeping pattern and the height of the infant. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Aim To examine the incidence of paroxysmal epileptic and non-epileptic disorders and the associated prenatal and perinatal factors that might predict them in the first year of life in a population-based cohort.Method This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study from early fetal life onwards. Information about the occurrence of paroxysmal events, defined as suddenly occurring episodes with an altered consciousness, altered behaviour, involuntary movements, altered muscle tone, and/or a changed breathing pattern, was collected by questionnaires at the ages of 2, 6, and 12 months. Information on possible prenatal and perinatal determinants was obtained by measurements and questionnaires during pregnancy and after birth.Results Information about paroxysmal events in the first year of life was available in 2860 participants (1410 males, 1450 females). We found an incidence of paroxysmal disorders of 8.9% (n=255) in the first year of life. Of these participants, 17 were diagnosed with febrile seizures and two with epilepsy. Non-epileptic events included physiological events, apnoeic spells, loss of consciousness by causes other than epileptic seizures or apnoeic spells, parasomnias, and other events. Preterm birth (p<0.001) and low Apgar score at 1 minute (p<0.05) were significantly associated with paroxysmal disorders in the first year of life. Continued maternal smoking during pregnancy and preterm birth were significantly associated with febrile seizures in the first year of life (p<0.05).Interpretation Paroxysmal disorders are frequent in infancy. They are associated with preterm birth and a low Apgar score. Epileptic seizures only form a minority of the paroxysmal events in infancy. In this study, children whose mothers continued smoking during pregnancy had a higher reported incidence of febrile seizures in the first year of life. These findings may generate various hypotheses for further investigations. © The Authors. Journal compilation © Mac Keith Press 2010.

AB  - Importance of the field: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood psychiatric disorder and in at least 50% of cases persists into adulthood. Treatment of ADHD with stimulants is one of the oldest and most effective pharmacological treatments in psychiatry. Yet, there continues to be controversy over the safety of stimulant medications in the treatment of ADHD. Areas covered in this review: This paper is a continuation of an earlier paper that reviewed the safety profile of newer stimulant agents, especially in relation to special populations. This part II reviews, through essentially an organ-system approach, the various clinical concerns that have been raised over the safety of stimulant medications. This includes neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular effects on growth and development, and a number of other less common concerns. What the reader will gain: A thorough review of safety concerns in stimulants that emphasizes clinical information, case reports, open series or controlled trials relating to stimulant use in the treatment of ADHD. Take home message: While many safety concerns have been raised in the use of stimulants, the vast majority of treatment complications are either quickly reversible or easily manageable with appropriate clinical care. The negative consequences of untreated ADHD clearly outweigh the risks of the stimulant medicines when used in an appropriate and careful manner. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Abstinence from food and liquid during daylight hours is observed by Muslim individuals during the month of Ramadan. Even though the Koran exempts the sick from fasting, many people with diabetes still fast during this religious period. It is essential for patients, family and healthcare professionals to be aware of the religious attitude to and health implications of fasting. Major changes in dietary habits, daily physical activities and sleeping patterns during Ramadan have significant impact on the glycaemic control, lipid profile, weight and dietary intake. Hence, the patient is encouraged to have appropriate pre-Ramadan assessment and education in order to stratify and modify his or her risk with fasting. Dose and timing adjustments to insulin and to some oral hypoglycaemic agents, especially sulphonylureas, may well be necessary during Ramadan. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - It seems likely that some infants who die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have a brainstem abnormality of the serotonergic system. Evidence suggests that infants who died from SIDS had defective respiratory and/or autonomic responses that led to death instead of recovery after an acute insult. The serotonergic neuromodulator system has roles in the control of cardiac autonomic and respiratory function, as well as now being identified as abnormal in infants with SIDS. This manuscript reviews the multiple roles of serotonin with reference to the functional aspects of the relevant brain regions. Correlations with pre- or postnatal exposure to stressors, or an underlying genetic process are also reviewed. Together, these studies indicate that perturbed function of the serotonin system will have significant physiological impact during early development. Understanding the functional importance of these systems assists understanding of the pathogenesis of SIDS. In conclusion, whether an infant inherits serotonergic defects and is therefore "inherently vulnerable", or whether postnatal stressors can induce the abnormalities, any functional abnormalities of the serotonergic system that result are likely to be subclinical in the majority of cases and not easily detected with current medical tools.

AB  - Maternal circadian information has been reported to play an important role in fetal physiology and development. Hormones and nutrition have been mainly investigated as circadian cues from mother to fetus. However, the influences of circadian properties of the pregnant reproductive organs on fetuses have not been fully investigated. To gain an insight on the circadian functions of the reproductive organs, we examined molecular clocks in the pregnant rat uterus and placenta. By using a Period1-luciferase (Per1-luc) rat, whose tissues express luciferase corresponding to activation of Period1, a "key clock gene", we examined the uterus clock during non-pregnancy, on embryonic day 12 (E12), and on E22 (the end of pregnancy) in a light-dark (LD) cycle and constant darkness (DD). By in situ hybridization we further explored Per1 mRNA rhythms in the placenta on E12 and E22. The uterus in vitro showed clear circadian Per1-luc rhythms both in and out of pregnancy, having peaks at around the time corresponding to dusk in LD. Likewise, in DD, the uterus in vitro had the same Per1-luc rhythms. The decidua in LD showed circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms, peaking during night 6 h after dusk, while the decidua in DD showed the same Per1 mRNA rhythms only on E22. In contrast, the labyrinth showed no circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms in LD or DD during pregnancy. These results suggest that the uterus and decidua, a maternally-originated tissue of the placenta, but not the labyrinth, a fetus-originated tissue of the placenta, can provide the fetus with circadian information.

AB  - Background: Habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is an important indicator for a number of health problems in children. Compared to adults, large epidemiological studies on childhood habitual snoring and associated predisposing factors are extremely scarce. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of habitual snoring among Chinese school-aged children.Methods: A random sample of 20,152 children aged 5.08 to 11.99 years old participated in a cross-sectional survey, which was conducted in eight cities of China. Parent-administrated questionnaires were used to collect information on children's snoring frequency and the possible correlates.Results: The prevalence of habitual snoring was 12.0% (14.5% for boys vs. 9.5% for girls) in our sampled children. Following factors were associated with an increased risk for habitual snoring: lower family income (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.46), lower father's education (OR = 1.38 and 1.14 for middle school or under and high school of educational level, respectively), breastfeeding duration < 6 months (OR = 1.17), pregnancy maternal smoking (OR = 1.51), obesity (OR = 1.50), overweight (OR = 1.35), several respiratory problems associated with atopy and infection, such as chronic/allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.94), asthma (OR = 1.43), adenotonsillar hypertrophy (OR = 2.17), and chronic otitis media (OR = 1.31), and family history of habitual snoring (OR = 1.70).Conclusion: The prevalence of habitual snoring in Chinese children was similar to that observed in other countries. The potential predisposing factors covered socioeconomic characteristics, environmental exposures, chronic health problems, and family susceptibility. Compared to socioeconomic status and family susceptibility, environmental exposures and chronic health problems had greater impact, indicating childhood habitual snoring could be partly prevented by health promotion and environmental intervention. © 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops gradually during the prenatal and early postnatal period. In the rat, this period lasts from around the 15th day of gestation until the 10th day of postnatal development. The circadian system of fetuses and newborn pups is entrained mostly by nonphotic maternal cues during prenatal and early postnatal development. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether exposure of pregnant rats to a restricted feeding (RF) regime was able to entrain the circadian clock in the SCN of their fetuses during the prenatal period. The potency of RF as an entraining cue was tested under conditions when pregnant rats were entrained to an external light/dark (LD) cycle as well as under conditions when the external timing signal was lacking, i.e., under constant light (LL). The control groups were fed ad libitum and the experimental groups had restricted access to food for 6 h during their resting time throughout pregnancy. Daily profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression were examined by in situ hybridization in the SCN of 1-day-old pups. The data demonstrated that RF in pregnant rats kept under LD cycle did not notably affect the daily rhythms of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of pups. The SCN profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression did not exhibit circadian rhythms in pups born to mothers maintained in LL and fed ad libitum, likely due to desynchrony among the pups within a litter. However, RF in the pregnant rats kept under LL restored the circadian rhythmicity of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of their newborn pups. The results suggest that the fetal SCN clock is dominantly entrained by rhythmic signals from the maternal SCN. However, under conditions when the rhythmic signaling might be lacking, such as LL, regular food intake of the mothers may also play an important role in synchronization of the fetal SCN clock during prenatal ontogenesis. © 2010 Sage Publications.

AB  - Prolactin is a pulsatile, not a static, hormone. Prolactin secretion occurs episodically in 14 secretory pulses over 24 hours. It has a circadian fluctuation, with the highest levels achieving between 4 and 6 am and the lowest occurring between 10 am and noon. The nocturnal elevation is sleep entrained, especially in non-rapid eye movement sleep (REM). It is essential for human species survival by milk production during pregnancy and lactation. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common hypothalamic-pituitary disorder encountered in clinical endocrinology, obstetrics and gynaecology. Hyperprolactinemia may be due to a prolactinoma, secondary to other causes and physiologic hypersecretion. The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is prolactinoma. Secondary to other causes including drug effects, renal disease, liver disease, hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome should be ruled out before investigating prolactinoma. They present with clinical features of hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea, gonadal hypofunction). Headache and visual field defects due to optic chiasm compression are common in patients who have macroprolactinomas. Indications for treatment would contain the presence of confusing symptoms, such as menstrual disturbance, bothersome galactorrhea, infertility, impotence, long-lasting hypogonadism, and prevention of bone loss. Medical therapy with dopamine agonists is well responsive in achieving normoprolactinemia in most patients, and other methods of treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy currently have many limited indications. The pregnant women with prolactinomas need careful planning and close monitoring.

AB  - Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, likely encompassing multiple pathogenetic components. The aim of this study is to begin identifying at least some of these components and to assess their association with biological endophenotypes. To address this issue, we recruited 245 Italian patients with idiopathic autism spectrum disorders and their first-degree relatives. Using a stepwise approach, patient and family history variables were analyzed using principal component analysis ("exploratory phase"), followed by intra- and inter-component cross-correlation analyses ("follow-up phase"), and by testing for association between each component and biological endophenotypes, namely head circumference, serotonin blood levels, and global urinary peptide excretion rates ("biological correlation phase"). Four independent components were identified, namely "circadian & sensory dysfunction," "immune dysfunction," "neurodevelopmental delay," and "stereotypic behavior," together representing 74.5% of phenotypic variance in our sample. Marker variables in the latter three components are positively associated with macrocephaly, global peptiduria, and serotonin blood levels, respectively. These four components point toward at least four processes associated with autism, namely (I) a disruption of the circadian cycle associated with behavioral and sensory abnormalities, (II) dysreactive immune processes, surprisingly linked both to prenatal obstetric complications and to excessive postnatal body growth rates, (III) a generalized developmental delay, and (IV) an abnormal neural circuitry underlying stereotypies and early social behaviors. © 2010, International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - During the last decades non-invasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has evolved from a research tool of limited clinical use into an important method for stratifying cardiovascular risk and guiding therapeutic decisions. Until recently, clinical use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring focused on identifying patients with white-coat hypertension, but accumulated evidence now points to its greater prognostic significance in determining risk for target-organ damage compared with that of office blood pressure measurements. Ambulatory measurement of blood pressure using automated devices has also demonstrated benefit in other indications, such as treatment resistance and borderline hypertension, or in hypertension during pregnancy. Future directions for hypertension research and treatment will need to consider the circadian cycle of blood pressure, the effect of treatment on blood pressure variability, and the magnitude of blood pressure changes in daily life.

AB  - A host of animal studies have been used to model the effects of exposure to a low protein diet in utero on adult blood pressure. Collection of systolic blood pressure data by the indirect tail-cuff plethysmography method consistently shows increased pressures in low protein exposed rodent offspring compared to controls, but this technique has been criticised as the associated stress artefacts may confound the observed effects. Conversely, radiotelemetry systems allow unrestrained and continuous monitoring of blood pressure through the awake and sleep phases of the diurnal cycle. In this novel study, we directly compared blood pressure parameters in male offspring from low protein and control-fed dams measured simultaneously using tail-cuff and radiotelemetry systems. Control rats showed a good correlation between tail-cuff and radiotelemetry derived blood pressure data. Conversely, low protein males were relatively hypertensive at 8 weeks of age when measured by tail-cuff, but had significantly lower blood pressure than controls at 12 weeks of age when measured by telemetry. Heart rate and length of systole did not differ between the two groups. Individual stress protocols mimicking those imposed by tail-cuff plethysmography (novel environment, heat, restraint, inflation), caused similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate in control and low protein animals, ruling out an effect of enhanced pressor response to stress following prenatal protein restriction. Instead, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance in these animals is considered possible. Such a disparity between central and peripheral blood pressure measurements could have important clinical implications regarding cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - The physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose females to develop sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or protect against it. Studies evaluating outcomes of SDB symptoms in pregnancy are scarce. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SDB symptoms in pregnancy and their relationship with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. A cross-sectional survey of randomly selected immediate postpartum females was performed using the multivariable apnoea prediction index. Record review, including demographics and medical history, was performed. Main outcome measures included pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. 1,000 subjects were recruited. Mean±SD age was 29.1±6.1 yrs. Factors used in the regression analysis included age, body mass index, diabetes, chronic hypertension, multifetal gestations, smoking and renal disease. Snoring was present in 35.1% of subjects. Symptoms of SDB were associated with a higher likelihood of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-4.0), gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4) and unplanned Caesarean deliveries (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2) after multivariable regression analysis. Gasping may have been associated with a higher likelihood of preterm delivery, after adjusting for age and multifetal pregnancies (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) but this association appeared to be mediated by pre-eclampsia. Symptoms of SDB are common in pregnancy and associated with a higher likelihood of gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and unplanned Caesarean deliveries. Copyright©ERS 2010.

AB  - Study Objectives: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Clinic-based study. Participants: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women. Measurements and Results: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (≤ 6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting ≤ 6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (≥ 10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (&lt; 5 h) and long (≥ 10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short and long sleep duration.

AB  - Study Objectives: Because the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring. Design: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number of glomeruli per mm3 were evaluated. Measurements and Results: Offspring from SR had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced number of glomeruli per mm3 of renal tissue. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

AB  - Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the pathway leading to obesity among women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to examine predictors of moderate (1-10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months postpartum in this population was 9.4lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7lb (s.d. = 13.2), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race, employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology. © 2010 The Obesity Society.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to review the evidence for early-life (from conception to 5 years of age) determinants of obesity. The design is review of published systematic reviews. Data sources included Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO. Identification of 22 eligible reviews from a database of 12 021 independent publications. Quality of selected reviews assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews score. Articles published after the reviews were used to confirm results. No review was classified as high quality, 11 as moderate and 11 as low. Factors associated with later overweight and obesity: maternal diabetes, maternal smoking, rapid infant growth, no or short breastfeeding, obesity in infancy, short sleep duration, <30 min of daily physical activity, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Other factors were identified as potentially relevant, although the size of their effect is difficult to estimate. Maternal smoking, breastfeeding, infant size and growth, short sleep duration and television viewing are supported by better-quality reviews. It is difficult to establish a causal association between possible determinants and obesity, and the relative importance of each determinant. Future research should focus on early-life interventions to confirm the role of protective and risk factors and to tackle the high burden obesity represents for present and future generations. © 2009 International Association for the Study of Obesity.

AB  - Millions of individuals in the United States and around the world are overweight or obese. Bariatric surgery is now considered an evidenced-based choice for sustainable long-term weight loss and may reduce obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea. As bariatric surgical procedures increase, it can be expected that intensive care unit (ICU) admissions will increase as well. An emerging ICU population includes postbariatric patients either immediately after undergoing bariatric surgery or returning for subsequent surgical procedures. Massive weight loss following surgery leads to an excess of lax, overstretched skin, causing physical discomfort and psychosocial problems. It is important to understand the complex pathophysiological changes that occur in order to care for this growing population of patients. This review addresses the growing and evolving issues related to the complex nature of the postbariatric ICU patients. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem that causes more than 5 million deaths annually worldwide. Cigarette smoking is especially common among individuals with psychiatric comorbidity, including individuals with primary psychiatric disorders and other addictions. Effective behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation are available. Behavioral treatments including brief (< 3 min) counseling by physicians are effective. Seven first-line pharmacologic treatments are currently available: five nicotine replacement therapies, bupropion, and varenicline. In addition, clonidine and nortriptyline are second-line treatments for smoking cessation. These treatments increase the chances of quitting smoking by two- to threefold, supporting their use in smokers who are motivated to quit. However, effective treatments for many subpopulations, including smokers with psychiatric comorbidities as well as adolescent, pregnant, or postpartum smokers, remain to be developed and represent an important challenge. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis-related mortality and morbidity. In this document, the Hypertension Committee of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology provides new guidelines for hypertension management. The key messages are as follows. (1) The life-time risk for hypertension is 90%. (2) Both the increase in the prevalence rate and the relative risk of hypertension for causing cardiovascular events are higher in Asians than in Caucasians. (3) The control rate has been improved significantly in Taiwan from 2.4% to 21% in men, and from 5% to 29% in women in recent years (1995-2002). (4) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) = 130/80 mmHg are thresholds of treatment for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke, established coronary heart disease, and coronary heart disease equivalents (carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm). (5) Ambulatory and home BP monitoring correlate more closely with end-organ damage and have a stronger relationship with cardiovascular events than office BP monitoring, but the feasibility of home monitoring makes it a more attractive alternative. (6) Patients with masked hypertension have higher cardiovascular risk than those with white-coat hypertension. (7) Lifestyle changes should be encouraged in all patients, and include the following six items: S-ABCDE (Salt restriction; Alcohol limitation; Body weight reduction; Cessation of smoking; Diet adaptation; Exercise adoption). (8) When pharmacological therapy is needed, physicians should consider "PROCEED" (Previous experience of patient; Risk factors; Organ damage; Contraindication or unfavorable conditions; Expert or doctor judgment; Expense or cost; Delivery and compliance) to decide the optimal treatment. (9) The main benefits of antihypertensive agents are derived from lowering of BP per se, and are generally independent of the drugs being used, except that certain associated cardiovascular conditions might favor certain classes of drugs. (10) There are five major classes of drugs: thiazide diuretics; β-blockers; calcium channel blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Any one of these can be used as the initial treatment, except for β-blockers, which are only indicated in patients with heart failure, a history of coronary heart disease, and hyperadrenergic state. (11) A standard dose of any one of the five major classes of antihypertensive drugs can produce an ∼10-mmHg decrease in systolic BP (rule of 10) and a 5-mmHg decrease in diastolic BP (rule of 5), after placebo subtraction. (11) Combination therapy is frequently needed for optimal control of BP, and the amount of the decrease in BP by a two-drug combination is approximately the same as the sum of the decrease by each individual drug (∼20 mmHg in systolic BP and 10 mmHg in diastolic BP) if their mechanisms of action are independent, with the exception of the combination of ACEIs and ARBs. (13) An ACEI or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic (A + C or A + D) are reasonable two-drug combinations, and A+C + D is a reasonable three-drug combination, unless patients have special indications for β-blockers. (14) Single-pill (fixed-dose) combinations that contain more than one drug in a single tablet are highly recommended because they reduce pill burden and cost, and improve compliance. (15) Very elderly patients (> 80 years) should be treated without delay, but BP should be reduced gradually and more cautiously. Finally, these guidelines are not mandatory; the responsible physician's decision remains most important in hypertension management. © 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation and is characterized by neurodevelopmental anomalies. C-fos is a cellular marker of transcriptional activity in the stress-signal pathway. Previously, we showed the treatment with NAP (NAPVSIPQ)+SAL (SALLRSIPA) reversed the learning deficit after prenatal alcohol exposure in FAS. Our objective was to evaluate if the mechanism of actions of NAP+SAL involves the stress-signal pathway differentiating c-fos expression in mouse brains after prenatal alcohol exposure. C57Bl6/J mice were treated with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or placebo on gestational day 8. On postnatal day 40, in utero alcohol-exposed males were treated via gavage with 40 μg D-NAP and 40 μg D-SAL (n=6) or placebo (n=4); controls were gavaged with placebo daily (n=12). After learning evaluation, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex were isolated. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were performed. Statistics included analysis of variance and post hoc Fisher analysis. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos in the hippocampus after prenatal alcohol exposure (p<0.05), but not in the cerebellum. There was no difference in c-fos expression in the cortex. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos expression in hippocampus attenuating the alcohol-induced alteration of the stress-signal pathway.

AB  - Objective: This exploratory study examines the role of psychosocial-behavioral variables as predictors of elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) at 14-20 weeks of gestation. Method: One hundred and twenty women were enrolled into the study. Blood samples were collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH. Participants completed questionnaires that included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES) Depression Scale, the Pregnancy-Specific Anxiety (PAS) Scale, the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test, the Brief COPE scale, and questions regarding violence/abuse, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns. Results: Pregnant women with high CRH levels (15 pcg/ml and above) perceived their income to be inadequate, slept more hours at night, stood more hours during the day, and used the coping styles of disengagement or religion but not humor. Logistic regression identified three predictors for high CRH (accounting for 42.2% of the variance): perceived inadequacy of income and the use of "religion" and "disengagement" to cope with stress. Conclusions: These results are the first known to identify coping style and perceived income inadequacy as predictors of high CRH. Women with perceived inadequacy of income had almost three times the odds for high CRH. Women who used religion or disengagement to cope with stress had 14 times and 7 times the odds for high CRH levels, respectively. Higher CRH levels are associated with preterm birth (PTB). Thus, it may be important to include maternal coping style and perceptions of income inadequacy in future investigations of CRH levels and PTB. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Background: Circadian clocks guide the metabolic, cell-division, sleep-wake, circadian and seasonal cycles. Abnormalities in these clocks may be a health hazard. Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30 and over, living in Finland. Methodology/Principal Findings: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511 individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2 rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296 had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype experienced less seasonal variation of energy level. Conclusions/Significance: ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in humans. © 2010 Kovanen et al.

AB  - Mammalian retina contains a circadian clock that is composed of components similar to those of the master circadian clock within the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether, when, and where the transcripts of the clock genes Per1 and Per2 and the immediate early gene c-fos are spontaneously expressed and/or induced by light in the newborn rat retina. At postnatal day 1 (P1), P3, P5, and P10, Wistar rat pups were released into constant darkness, and a 30-minute light pulse was administered during the subjective day or during the first or second part of subjective night. Gene expression was determined 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours after the light pulse by in situ hybridization followed by emulsion autoradiography. Endogenous expression of Per1 was detected in the neuroblastic retina, and Per2 expression was detected in the inner part of the neuroblastic retina from birth. Light pulses induced c-fos expression in ganglion cells from P1. Until P5, the cells were localized in the dorsal part of the retina, but, at P10, they were already distributed across the entire retinal circumference. Light pulses also induced the expression of c-fos and Per1 in the retinal pigment epithelium until P3, but not afterward. Expression of the Per2 gene was not photoresponsive until P10. These data demonstrate that the rat retina is light-sensitive immediately after birth. During early postnatal development, the spatial distribution of spontaneous and light-induced gene expression within the retinal layers changes gradually. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) usually is considered as a protective 'nutrient and waste control' system for the brain. Recent findings suggest, however, that the composition of CSF is actively controlled and may play an influential role in the changes in brain activity, underlying different behavioral states. In the present review, we present an overview of available data concerning the release of oxytocin into the CSF, the location of the oxytocin-receptive brain areas and the behavioral effects of intracerebroventricular oxytocin. About 80% of the oxytocin-receptive areas are located close to the ventricular or subarachnoid CSF, including the hypothalamic 'Behavior Control Column' (L.W.Swanson, 2003). As a conclusion we suggest that 'CSF-oxytocin' contributes considerably to the non-synaptic communication processes involved in hypothalamic-, brainstem- and olfactory brain areas and behavioral states and that the flowing CSF is used as a 'broadcasting system' to send coordinated messages to a wide variety of nearby and distant brain areas. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The abdominal phonogram is a signal recorded by a sensitive acoustic sensor positioned on the maternal womb. The signal conveys information that is valuable for fetal surveillance (e.g., heart sounds), but hidden by maternal and environmental noises. To recover such information, earlier work successfully used single-channel independent component analysis (SCICA) to decompose the phonogram into independent components (ICs). After that, knowing that some ICs belong to the same process, similar ICs were grouped using K -means through similarities in their spectral content, a step that misclassified some fetal and maternal ICs, and consequently, distorted the recovered sources and made them virtually useless for studying fetal condition. Here, the rich time structure of the physiological components underlying the abdominal phonogram is exploited to automatically classify similar components and retrieve the independent sources corresponding to maternal activity (respiration and cardiovascular), fetal heart sounds, and noise. To do so, a periodicity-based analysis scheme is proposed and tested on a dataset composed of 750 ICs extracted by SCICA from segments of 25 single-channel phonograms recorded at fetal gestational ages between 29 and 40 weeks. Based on autocorrelation and power spectral density analysis, this scheme not only manages to quickly and automatically group similar ICs, but also correlates the recovered sources with specific physiological phenomena (either maternal or fetal), which is a further advantage. Further research will be conducted on more phonograms and explore alternatives for dimensional reduction and reconstruction of entire time series suitable for surveillance, not only for fetal well-being, but also for maternal condition. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - A Chinese woman had a first-episode of psychosis in the second trimester of pregnancy. The sudden onset of psychotic symptoms and fluctuating mental condition with visual hallucinations suggested an organic origin for the psychosis. Antipsychotic medication was started. Ultrasound investigation at 19 weeks of gestation revealed intrauterine growth retardation and she decided to terminate the pregnancy. Positive blood test results for antiphospholipid antibodies confirmed a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid syndrome. Psychosis is one of the neuropsychiatric syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus and can sometimes be the primary manifestation, antedating other evidence of the disease. Pregnancy can exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus. This report highlights the importance of considering an organic cause for psychosis, including systemic lupus erythematosus, especially when it occurs for the first time during pregnancy in a previously healthy woman. © 2010 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

AB  - This nationwide population-based study was carried out in Taiwan with the aim of comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women who received zolpidem treatment for insomnia during pregnancy with that in women who did not. The adverse outcomes identified and assessed were delivery of low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, preterm deliveries, delivery of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants, delivery of infants with congenital anomalies, and cesarean delivery. The incidences of these were compared between the groups after adjusting for other characteristics of the mothers and infants. The study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Dataset (NHIRD) and birth-certificate registry. In total, the data from 2,497 mothers who received zolpidem treatment during pregnancy and those from 12,485 randomly selected mothers who did not receive the drug were included in the analysis. The results show that the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for adverse pregnancy outcomesLBW infants, preterm deliveries, SGA infants, and cesarean deliverywere all higher in mothers who received zolpidem treatment during pregnancy, relative to the randomly selected controls (1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-1.64), 1.49 (95% CI = 1.28-1.74), 1.34 (95% CI = 1.20-1.49), and 1.74 (95% CI = 1.59-1.90), respectively). In conclusion, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was higher in women who received zolpidem during pregnancy than in those who did not. © 2010 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB  - Introduction: The most common test used in third-trimester of pregnancy in order to check fetal wellbeing is the non-stress test (NST).One of the disadvantages of NST is its high rate of false-positive results. The most common cause of a nonreactive test is a period of fetal inactivity or quiet sleep. Many different methods have been tried to decrease the number of nonreactive NSTs. Probably the most common method of provoking fetal reaction is maternal ingestion of fruit juice as a source of glucose. The aim of this study is to determine whether maternal oral glucose .ingestion influences non-stress test indices Methods: A clinical trial study was performed at Amir-al-momenin hospital in Ahvaz on 35 primiparous non-laboring healthy women with normal singleton pregnancy at 37-40 weeks of gestation. All women had a normal oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. The women were evaluated in a fasting state (last meal more than 3 hours before non-stress test). The NSTs were performed 1 hour after oral ingestion of 50g of glucose in 240ml of water in first day and an equal volume of water during second day. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired t-test and .chi-square test and p<0.05 was considered significant Results: There was no significant difference in fetal heart rate baseline, number and amplitude of fetal heart rate accelerations, beat to beat variability and number of variable decelerations .(among women whether receiving glucose or water (p>0.05).However, there was an increase in duration of fetal heart rate acceleration followed by oral ingestion of glucose (p<0.01 .Conclusion: Maternal oral glucose ingestion is not able to reduce the false-positive results of non-stress tests.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent in perinatal than general samples of women (68 vs. 45). To explore potential causes, we examined the symptom profiles of women belonging to two separate samples: a perinatal clinic sample (n1581) and a subsample of women in a similar age range from the U. S. National Women's Study (NWS) (n2000). Within the perinatal sample, risk ratios were higher for all 17 PTSD symptoms among women with current PTSD compared with unaffected women, suggesting that higher rates are not likely due to measurement error. The younger age and greater social disadvantage in the perinatal clinic sample contributed only a small proportion of variance in symptom levels compared with extent of trauma exposure and pre-existing PTSD. Compared with the national study sample's symptom profile, the perinatal sample had higher rates of occurrence of five symptoms: detachment, loss of interest, anger and irritability, trouble sleeping, and nightmares. This analysis confirms that PTSD rates are higher in perinatal samples, which is likely due to exacerbation of pre-existing PTSD among women of a younger age and greater social disadvantage. Further elucidation is warranted, including identifying triggers and determining if there are needs for pregnancy-specific interventions. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - To describe the characteristics, access, utilization, satisfaction, and outcomes of Healthy Start participants in eight selected sites, a survey of Healthy Start participants with infants ages 6-12-months-old at time of interview was conducted between October 2006 and January 2007. The response rate was 66% (n = 646), ranging from 37% in one site to >70% in seven sites. Healthy Start participants' outcomes were compared to two national benchmarks. Healthy Start participants reported that they were satisfied with the program (>90% on five measures). Level of unmet need was 6% or less for most services, except for dental appointments (11%), housing (13%), and child care (11%). Infants had significantly better access to medical care than did their mothers, with higher rates of insurance coverage, medical homes, and checkups, and fewer unmet needs for health care. Healthy Start participants' rates of ever breastfeeding (72%) and putting infants to sleep on their backs (70%) were at or near the Healthy People 2010 objectives, and considerably higher than rates among low-income mothers in the ECLS. The high rate of health education (>90%) may have contributed to these outcomes. Elimination of smoking among Healthy Start participants (46%) fell short of the Healthy People 2010 objective (99%). The low-birth weight (LBW) rate among Black Healthy Start participants (14%) was three times higher than the rate for Whites and Hispanics (5% each). Overall, the LBW rate in the eight sites (7.5%) was similar to the rate for low-income mothers in the ECLS, but both rates were above the Healthy People 2010 objective (5%). Challenges remain in reducing disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. Further attention to risk factors associated with LBW (especially smoking) may help close the gaps. The life course theory suggests that improved outcomes may require longer-term investments. Healthy Start's emerging focus on interconception care has the potential to address longer-term needs of participants. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Systemic autoimmune diseases may be progressive and lead to organ system dysfunction and premature death. Current treatment paradigms are usually predominantly based on the administration of immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory drug therapy. Such therapy can stabilize systemic manifestations of connective tissue disease (CTD) and may put the disease into remission, and many of these agents are commonly used to treat CTD-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD). Although these agents have largely revolutionized the treatment of the systemic autoimmune diseases, adverse reactions, which can be serious and life threatening, to the various immunosuppressive agents used in the treatment of CTD can occur. Treating physicians must be aware of mechanisms of action of various immunosuppressive agents and be able to recognize the potential adverse reactions that may occur with therapy as well as potentially harmful effects on fetal development. Appropriate monitoring may prevent or limit toxicity from these agents, and knowledge of drug-drug interactions is essential when these agents are prescribed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Health is not only not being ill or handicapped but also being in a mood of goodness in physically, mentally and socially. Physical activity is important as much as nutrition and sleep. Physical activity ,which is a concern of public health and one of the objectives of improving health, is known to sustain a steady body mass; support endurance, strength and agility; and lower the risk of getting sick. Although the benefits of physical activity on health is clearly understood recently, it is admitted that the uttermost effect on the reduction of physical activity is environmental factors. A moderate activity, approxiamately 30 minutes per day and 4-5 times per week will also affect the health in a favorable way. Physical activity, especially in childhood period; is vital for growth and maturation, courage and good habits, success at school, preventing from addiction to smoke and drugs. On the other hand in adolesence period; participation to competetive sports have a benefical influence on character development and is helpful for lowering the risk of chronic ilnesses at adulthood by hindering from putting on excessive weight. In addition moderate level activities performed at adulthood is rewarding for the losses related with aging. Moreover; physical activity is gaining importance at pregnancy, menopause and post-menopause period. It is acknowledged that motionless lifestyle has a substantial effect on the accumlative rise of obesity and for this reason, physical activity takes place in the prevention of obesity, treatment and sustaining the body mass after weight loss. The influence of physical activity is reasonably significant in the control of blood pressure, blood lipids, blood sugar, vessel and musculoskeletal system. Besides; it has positive effects on cancer, immunity system and mental health. As a result; like drug treatment, exercise treatment takes an important role to struggle with diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may cause peroxydation of lipids, proteins and deoxyribonucleic acids with subsequent cell damage. The hydroxyl radical (OH•) represents a measure of global oxidative stress. Hydroxyl radicals are short-lived; they form an important part of radical chemistry nonetheless. The measure of total antioxidant system (TAS) can give useful information about the extent of defence capable of counteracting the oxidative damage. Pregnancy is an important condition that favors oxidative stress in the fetus. Clinical studies indicate a protective mechanism against O2 toxicity in the human feto-placental unit. AIM: This study reports the OH• and TAS concentrations in mother and fetus at birth to evaluate the role of the placenta against fetal oxidative stress. METHODS: Blood samples were collected at delivery from 45 healthy women at term and from their newborns. The maternal and neonatal OH• and TAS concentrations were compared by paired Student t-test. RESULTS: OH• was higher in maternal blood than in cord blood (573.75±170.0 UCarr/l vs 40.08±33.37 UCarr/l) (p&lt;0.01); TAS concentrations did not differ between the two groups (1.11±0.09 mmol/l vs 1.17±0.12 mmol/l). Multiple regression analyses: maternal and neonatal OH• decreases with maternal age; only maternal TAS and OH• are related to gestational age in a nonlinear fashion. Female infants showed higher values of maternal and neonatal TAS as compared to male infants. CONCLUSION: TA protective role of the placenta against oxidative damage is in keeping with a large enough gradient of ROS (between mother and fetus) and the passage of TAS from mother to fetus. © 2010 Neuroendocrinology Letters.

AB  - Brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR) is associated with a deletion involving chromosome 2q37. BDMR presents with a range of features, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbance, craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities (including brachydactyly type E), and autism spectrum disorder. To date, only large deletions of 2q37 have been reported, making delineation of a critical region and subsequent identification of candidate genes difficult. We present clinical and molecular analysis of six individuals with overlapping deletions involving 2q37.3 that refine the critical region, reducing the candidate genes from &gt;20 to a single gene, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). Driven by the distinct hand and foot anomalies and similar cognitive features, we identified other cases with clinical findings consistent with BDMR but without a 2q37 deletion, and sequencing of HDAC4 identified de novo mutations, including one intragenic deletion probably disrupting normal splicing and one intragenic insertion that results in a frameshift and premature stop codon. HDAC4 is a histone deacetylase that regulates genes important in bone, muscle, neurological, and cardiac development. Reportedly, Hdac4-/- mice have severe bone malformations resulting from premature ossification of developing bones. Data presented here show that deletion or mutation of HDAC4 results in reduced expression of RAI1, which causes Smith-Magenis syndrome when haploinsufficient, providing a link to the overlapping findings in these disorders. Considering the known molecular function of HDAC4 and the mouse knockout phenotype, taken together with deletion or mutation of HDAC4 in multiple subjects with BDMR, we conclude that haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 results in brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome. © 2010 The American Society of Human Genetics.

AB  - Sleep is necessary for normal growth and development. Lack of sleep causes considerable personal impairment which can impose a substantial societal burden on productivity and quality of life. Insomnia, whether transient or chronic, responds to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Cognitive behaviour therapy can effect sustained improvement in insomnia but requires motivation and commitment on the part of the patient and a trained therapist to guide the process. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) and benzodiazepines (BZDs) reduce sleep latency and increase total sleep time in insomniacs, however their effects are not sustained after stopping the medication. Long-term safety of these medications has not been formally established. Combination of psychological and pharmacological therapies reduces the effects of psychological interventions thus, in determined patients, psychological therapy should precede drug therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence from both animals and humans suggests that maternal prenatal anxiety and stress can have adverse consequences on the offspring's development. Animal models also show that prenatal stress has programming effects on the physical health of the offspring, such as immune functioning. In human studies, however, physical health outcomes are often restricted to birth complications; studies on the effects of acquiring illnesses are scarce. This study aimed to examine whether maternal prenatal anxiety and stress, measured both by self-report and by cortisol physiology, are related to more infant illnesses and antibiotic use during the first year of life. METHODS: Participants in the study were 174 mothers with normal pregnancies and term deliveries (71 firstborns; 91 boys). The mothers filled out third-trimester questionnaires on general and pregnancyspecific anxiety and stress and provided saliva samples for circadian cortisol. Information on infant illnesses and antibiotic use was obtained through monthly maternal interviews across the infant's first year of life. RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that, even after controlling for many relevant confounders, prenatal anxiety and stress predicted a considerable amount of variance in infant illnesses and antibiotic use: 9.3% for respiratory, 10.7% for general, 8.9% for skin, and 7.6% for antibiotic use. Digestive illnesses were not related to prenatal anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: Although replication is warranted, to our knowledge, this is the first evidence linking maternal prenatal anxiety and stress to infant illnesses and antibiotic use early in life.

AB  - Preclinical challenges in the analysis of steroid hormones are primarily determined by biological factors involved in the physiology and pathophysiology of hormone secretion. Major biologically influencing factors like age, sex, pubertal stage, pregnancy, phase of the menstruation, and diurnal rhythm have to be considered in the definition of reference ranges for steroids and their clinical interpretation. Hitherto, in clinical routine laboratories steroids were mainly determined by direct immunoassays applied on automated platforms, which are simple, rapid and cheap if a high number of samples are measured. However, technical factors like cross-reactivity of related steroid metabolites or limited analytical ranges have to be taken in account and may impair accuracy and precision of these direct methods. The actual development of mass spectrometry based analytical platforms for the determination of single steroid or steroid patterns seems to be an alternative analytical approach combining multi-parametric analysis, high sensitivity and specificity as well simple sample pre-treatment, robustness and low running costs for steroid analysis.This short review will give an overview about biological influencing factors and technical disturbing factors of routinely used immunoassay for the analysis of steroids. The application of LC-MS/MS as an alternative routine high-throughput platform for steroid analysis and its perspective role in the standardization and harmonisation of steroid measurements in clinical routine application will be discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aims: To determine risk factors for miscarriage. Methods: A case control study was carried out at the gynaecological wards and antenatal clinics of the De Soysa Maternity Hospital in Sri Lanka. A case was defined as that of mothers with a confirmed diagnosis of partial or full expulsion of the fetus during the first 28 weeks of gestation. Controls comprised ante-natal clinic attendees whose period of gestation was <28 weeks and carrying a viable fetus. Two hundred and thirty cases and 504 controls were selected. A pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire and modified life events inventory were used to gather data. Multivariate logistic regression was applied separately for first and second trimester miscarriages and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and as 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: Sleeping ≤8 hday (OR:3.80, 95%CI:1.01-14.3) was found to be a risk factor for first trimester miscarriage controlling for the effect of period of gestation. Sleeping ≤8 hday (OR:2.04, 95%CI:1.24-3.37), standing ≤3 hday (OR:1.83, 95%CI:1.08-3.10), exposure to cooking smoke (OR:3.83, 95%CI:1.50-9.90) and physical trauma during the pregnancy (OR:43.2, 95%CI:4.55-411.4) were found to be risk factors for second trimester miscarriage controlling for the effect of period of gestation. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation, a sedentary lifestyle, exposure to cooking smoke and physical trauma during pregnancy were risk factors for miscarriage. Most of the risk factors are therefore modifiable. © 2010 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

AB  - Objectives: Psychotic disorders have a high rate of relapse in the postpartum period for reasons that are unclear, but may be related to changes in sleep patterns that occur during pregnancy and after birth. Understanding of the influence of sleep on postpartum psychosis presentation is limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in sleep/wake activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with a history of psychosis. Methods: Women with a history of bipolar disorder and/or postpartum psychosis (HxW) were recruited (n = 23) together with a control population (CtW) (n = 15). Data on demographic and psychosocial factors, mental health status, and sleep/wake activity were collected at seven timepoints-the last week of each trimester of pregnancy and four times during the postpartum (weeks 1, 4, and 8, and at month 6). Longitudinal data were analysed using an HLM version 6 repeated-measures multilevel model. Results: No significant differences were noted in sleep/wake activity between HxW and CtW. None of the HxW who were taking a mood stabilizer during their pregnancy, including at delivery, relapsed during the study. Of those taking an antidepressant or antipsychotic, or no medication, 3 relapsed within the first six months and 2 within the first two months. HxW were more likely to report a poor partner relationship than CtW. Conclusion: Results suggest that during the perinatal period, there is no difference in sleep/wake activity in women with a history of a psychotic disorder. Use of mood stabilizer during pregnancy and at delivery appears important in preventing psychotic relapse in the postpartum. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Objective. The aim of this prospective study was to identify latent phase predictors of active labor duration. Design. Prospective clinical study. Setting. Two delivery units in Sweden. Sample. Healthy nulliparous women with a normal pregnancy, spontaneous onset of active labor at term, and a cervical dilatation of 4 cm or more on admission to the delivery ward (n=2,072). Methods. The women were asked to answer questions concerning their food and fluid intake, amount of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours and to assess their labor pain, sense of security and expectations of the childbirth on a visual analog scale (VAS). Duration and intervals of contractions, cervical dilatation, and position of the fetal head were noted by the midwife. A multiple regression analysis was performed with active labor duration as the outcome variable. Main outcome measure. Predictive factors of active labor duration. Results. Normal food intake during the preceding 24 hours was associated with short labor duration. A long latent phase, low levels of assessed labor pain and few hours of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours were significant independent predictors of extended active labor duration, when high birth weight, long contraction intervals, slight cervical dilatation, intact membranes within 2 hours of admission, high maternal age and malposition of the fetal head were controlled for. Conclusion. New findings are that latent phase duration as well as food intake and the amount of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours are independent predictors of labor duration. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - In Thailand, more than 150,000 patients are currently treated with antiretroviral drugs under the support of the National AIDS Program (NAP). The appointed Adults and Adolescents Committee consisted of 28 members who are experts in HIV research, patient care or health care policy. Relevant published literature, guidelines, and the most recent relevant clinical trials presented internationally were reviewed. Several peer review and clinical studies conducted in Thailand were included in the review process. Special considerations for patients with co-infection of tuberculosis or hepatitis B were incorporated. Appropriate cut-off of CD4+ T-cell counts when to commence ART among Thai patients have been considered. It is now recommended to start ART at CD4+ T-cell count &lt;350 cells/mm3. For treatment-naive patients, the preferred initial therapy is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen containing lamivudine plus zidovudine or tenofovir. Stavudine will be phased out in a two-year plan at the national program level. Viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts should be monitored at least once and twice a year. To achieve long-term treatment success, enhancing adherence together with the proper management of antiretroviral-related toxicity is critical. In summary, the major changes from the Thai 2008 guidelines include commencing ART earlier. ART is recommended regardless of CD4+ T cell count if patients have an indication to treat their HBV co-infection. Preferred first regimen uses AZT or TDF, not d4T as the NRTI-backbone. Furthermore, efavirenz is now considered a preferred NNRTI, along with nevirapine.

AB  - Background. Household ownership of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) is increasing, and coverage targets have been revised to address universal coverage with ITNs. However, many households do not have enough nets to cover everyone, and the nets available vary in physical condition and insecticide treatment status. Since 2004, the Government of Tanzania has been implementing the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme (TNVS), which distributes vouchers for ITNs through antenatal clinics to target pregnant women and their infants. This analysis aimed to determine the following: (1) coverage patterns of bed nets within households according to physical condition and treatment status; (2) who might be at risk if mosquitoes were diverted from occupants of untreated nets to those not using nets? (3) the degree to which those at highest risk of malaria use the most protective nets. Methods. Data from the 2006 TNVS household survey were analysed to assess within-household distribution of net use. The associations between net characteristics and net user were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis was applied to the relationship between the number of holes per net and user characteristics while adjusting for confounders. Results. In households with a net:person ratio better than 1:4 (one net for every four household members), more than 80% of the people in such households reported using a net the previous night. ITNs were most likely to be used by infants, young children (1-4 y), and women of childbearing age; they were least likely to be used by older women (50 y), older children (5-14 y), and adult men. The nets used by infants and women of childbearing age were in better-than-average physical condition; the nets used by older women and older children were in worse-than-average condition; while young children and adult men used nets in intermediate (average) condition. When adjusted for confounders, the nets used by young and older children had more holes than nets used by infants. Conclusions. Infants and other vulnerable groups were most likely to sleep under the most protective nets. Nevertheless, more communication efforts are needed to increase use of intact ITNs within households for children. Further research is necessary to fully understand motivations influencing within-household net distribution. © 2010 Tsuang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Pain management remains a critical issue for hospitals and is receiving the attention of hospital accreditation organizations. The acute care setting of the hospital provides an excellent opportunity for the integration of massage therapy for pain management into the team-centered approach of patient care. Purpose and Setting: This preliminary study evaluated the effect of the use of massage therapy on inpatient pain levels in the acute care setting. The study was conducted at Flagstaff Medical Center in Flagstaff, Arizona-a nonprofit community hospital serving a large rural area of northern Arizona. Method: A convenience sample was used to identify research participants. Pain levels before and after massage therapy were recorded using a 0 - 10 visual analog scale. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used for analysis of this descriptive study. Participants: Hospital inpatients (n = 53) from medical, surgical, and obstetrics units participated in the current research by each receiving one or more massage therapy sessions averaging 30 minutes each. The number of sessions received depended on the length of the hospital stay. Result: Before massage, the mean pain level recorded by the patients was 5.18 [standard deviation (SD): 2.01]. After massage, the mean pain level was 2.33 (SD: 2.10). The observed reduction in pain was statistically significant: paired samples t52 = 12.43, r = 0.67, d = 1.38, p &lt; .001. Qualitative data illustrated improvement in all areas, with the most significant areas of impact reported being overall pain level, emotional well-being, relaxation, and ability to sleep. Conclusions: This study shows that integration of massage therapy into the acute care setting creates overall positive results in the patient's ability to deal with the challenging physical and psychological aspects of their health condition. The study demonstrated not only significant reduction in pain levels, but also the interrelatedness of pain, relaxation, sleep, emotions, recovery, and finally, the healing process.

AB  - Rationale: The long-term respiratory sequelae of infants born extremely preterm (EP) and now graduating from neonatal intensive care remains uncertain. Objectives: To assess the degree of respiratory morbidity and functional impairment at 11 years in children born EP (i.e., at or less than 25 completed weeks of gestation) in relation to neonatal determinants and current clinical status. Methods: Pre- and postbronchodilator spirometry were undertaken at school in children born EP and classroom control subjects. Physical examination and respiratory health questionnaires were completed. Multivariable regression was used to estimate the predictive power of potential determinants of lung function. Measurements and Main Results: Spirometry was obtained in 182 of 219 children born EP (129 with prior bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) and 161 of 169 classmates, matched for age, sex, and ethnic group. Children born EP had significantly more chest deformities and respiratory symptoms than classmates, with twice as many (25 vs. 13%; P < 0.01) having a current diagnosis of asthma. Baseline spirometry was significantly reduced (P<0.001) and bronchodilator responsiveness was increased in those born EP, the changes being most marked in those with prior BPD. EP birth, BPD, current symptoms, and treatment with β-agonists are each associated independently with lung function z-scores (adjusted for age, sex,and height) at 11 years. Fifty-six percent of children born EP had abnormal baseline spirometry and 27% had a positive bronchodilator response, but less than half of those with impaired lung function were receiving any medication. Conclusions: After extremely preterm birth, impaired lung function and increased respiratory morbidity persist into middle childhood, especially among those with BPD. Many of these children may not be receiving appropriate treatment.

AB  - Data collected from medical literature indicate that dopaminergic agonists alleviate Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms while dopaminergic agonists antagonists aggravate them. Dopaminergic agonists is a physiological regulator of thyroid-stimulating hor-mone. Dopaminergic agonists infusion diminishes the levels of thyroid hormones, which have the ability to provoke restlessness, hyperkinetic states, tremors, and insomnia. Conditions associated with higher levels of thyroid hormones, such as pregnancy or hyperthyroidism, have a higher prevalence of Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms. Low iron levels can cause secondary Restless Legs Syndrome or aggravate symptoms of primary disease as well as diminish enzymatic activities that are involved in dopaminer-gic agonists production and the degradation of thyroid hormones. Moreover, as a result of low iron levels, dopaminergic agonists diminishes and thyroid hormones increase. Iron therapy improves Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms in iron deprived patients. Medical hypothesis. To discuss the theory that thyroid hormones, when not counterbalanced by dopaminergic agonists, may pre-cipitate the signs and symptoms underpinning Restless Legs Syndrome. The main cause of Restless Legs Syndrome might be an imbalance between the dopaminergic agonists system and thyroid hormones. © 2010 CLINICS.

AB  - The successful and dramatic reduction in cot deaths has come about not so much because of a better understanding of causal mechanisms of sudden death but rather from identifying risk factors in the infant sleeping environment; in particular placing young infants on their front to sleep. More recently bed-sharing has been identified as a potential risk factor and similar efforts are being made in some countries to advise against this care practice. However prone sleeping is not a culturally widespread behaviour; introduced in the 20th century partly based on observations showing how premature infants thrived (and still do) when placed in this position in incubators. If we are going to advise against a behaviour such as bed-sharing that is common to many cultures over many thousands of years we need to address some basic questions. This review asks i) Is there any benefit to bed-sharing? ii) Is bed-sharing in itself a 'risk-factor' for SIDS? and iii) By advising against bed-sharing will we do any harm? © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Bed sharing is a major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome. This risk is increased when the mother smokes or smoked in pregnancy, or when the parent has drunk alcohol or taken drugs. This risk is further increased in younger infants. The mechanism of sudden infant death with bed sharing is unknown, but airway obstruction, thermal stress and head covering have all been suggested. The benefit from bed sharing has only been established for breastfeeding, although other benefits are claimed. There is a small group of infants that has been shown to be at no increased risk of SIDS with bed sharing, namely infants of mothers who do not smoke, who are aged 3 months or more, and whose mothers have not taken alcohol or drugs and do not co-sleep on a sofa. Recommendations on how to bed share safely are not evidence based. Without this knowledge parents cannot make an informed choice on whether or not to bed share. Parents should be advised to place the baby to sleep in its own cot next to the parents' bed for the first six months. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is reportedly increased in pregnancy and Cushing's syndrome, inducing a hypercoagulable state. In Cushing's syndrome, VWF gene promoter polymorphisms modulate cortisol-dependent VWF upregulation, haplotype 1 (GCAG) and short GT-repeats (GT)S being the susceptible, and haplotype 2 (CTGA) and long GT-repeats (GT)L the protective pattern. We report on a Cushing's syndrome patient who became pregnant under hypercortisolism, in whom we monitored the evolution of her hypercoagulable state. During the active phase of Cushing's syndrome, the patient's VWF and factor VIII concentrations were normal, despite high urinary-free cortisol levels consistent with the presence of haplotype 2 and (GT)L alleles in the VWF gene promoter. VWF and factor VIII increased significantly and progressively after she became pregnant and peaked just before delivery, returning to normal 5 months later, while her hypercortisolism persisted. Our data indicate that two different mechanisms upregulate VWF under hypercortisolism and pregnancy, the latter being independent of the VWF promoter haplotypes sensitive to cortisol excess. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - During times of energetic stress many small mammals reduce their body temperature and metabolic rate, a state known as torpor. Whereas torpor is effective in energy conservation it also entails costs, such as reduced foetal development in pregnant females. Because it is currently not known how subtropical bats deal with energetic challenges during the reproductive season, the thermal biology of free-ranging non-reproductive male and pregnant female Nyctophilus bifax was examined during spring. Males entered torpor much more frequently than pregnant females. However, night time activity periods were similar in both sexes. My results show that even in the subtropics torpor is used regularly during the reproductive period in spring by non-reproductive male N. bifax to conserve energy, but is used rarely by pregnant females likely to prevent slowed foetal development. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Women who have depressive and anxiety disorders are at a high risk for recurrence or exacerbation of their psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy and/or postpartum. This risk can be reduced by implementing preventive measures prior to conception. A systematic preconception clinical assessment can identify factors that may contribute to a womans risk for developing perinatal depression and/or anxiety. Each of these factors is amenable to interventions that could strengthen a womans resilience and reduce her likelihood of developing perinatal psychiatric complications. This article reviews the evidence base for specific risk factors that can be influenced by preventive interventions, and describes the components of effective preconception planning for women with depressive and anxiety disorders. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Both attachment insecurity and maternal depression are thought to affect infants' emotional and physiological regulation. In the current study, Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) attachment classifications, and cortisol stress reactivity and diurnal rhythm were assessed at 14 months in a prospective cohort study of 369 mother-infant dyads. Maternal lifetime depression was diagnosed prenatally using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Insecure-resistant infants showed the largest increase in cortisol levels from pre-to post-SSP; the effect was even stronger when they had depressive mothers. Disorganized children showed a more flattened diurnal cortisol pattern compared to nondisorganized children. Findings are discussed from the perspective of a cumulative risk model. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Hormone secretion often occurs in a pulsatile manner. In this review, we discuss two rhythms of in vivo prolactin release in female rats and the ongoing research that we and others have performed aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying them. The peptide hormone oxytocin appears to play an important role in both rhythms. One rhythm occurs during the first half of pregnancy, but can also be induced in ovariectomised rats. This is characterised by a circadian pattern with two prolactin surges per day. Two methods for triggering this rhythm are discussed, each utilising a unique physiological pathway that includes oxytocin action, presumably on pituitary lactotrophs. The second rhythm occurs during the oestrous cycle and is characterised by a surge of prolactin on the afternoon of pro-oestrus. We discuss recent findings that oxytocin is more effective at stimulating prolactin release from lactotrophs taken from animals on the afternoon of pro-oestrus than from those of animals on the morning of dioestrus 1, raising the possibility that this hormone plays a physiological role in the regulation of prolactin secretion during the oestrous cycle. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Mandibular retrognathia may cause upper airway obstruction in the pediatric patient due to tongue collapse and physical obstruction in the hypopharyngeal region. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. Patients and Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. Results: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. Conclusion: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth. © 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Objectives. - To provide a guide to the use and limitations of continuous opioid therapy (COT, or daily scheduled opioids) for refractory daily headache, based on the best available evidence and expert clinical experience. Background. - There has been a dramatic increase in opioid administration over the past 25 years, with limited evidence of efficacy for either pain reduction or increased function, and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including headache chronification. To date, there has been no consensus on headache-specific guidelines for selecting patients for COT, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring. Methods. - A multidisciplinary committee of physicians and allied health professionals with extensive experience and expertise in the administration of opioids to headache patients, undertook a review of the available evidence from the research and clinical literature (using the PubMed database for articles through December 2009) to develop headache-specific treatment recommendations. This guide reflects the opinions of its authors and is not an official document of the American Headache Society. Results. - The guide identifies factors that would qualify or disqualify the use of COT, including, determination of intractability prior to initiating COT, requisite experience of the prescriber, and requirements for a formal monitoring system to assess appropriate use, safety, efficacy, and functional impact. An appendix reviews the available evidence for efficacy of COT in chronic headache and noncancer pain, paradoxical effects (opioid-induced hyperalgesia, medication overuse headache, opioid-related reduction in triptan and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy), other adverse effects (nausea and constipation, insomnia and sleep apnea, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death, reductions in sex hormones, issues during pregnancy, neurocognitive functioning), and issues related to comorbid psychiatric disorders. Conclusions. - Only a select and very limited group (estimate of 10-20%) of refractory headache patients who meet criteria for COT respond with convincing headache reduction and functional improvement over the long-term. Conservative and empirically based guidelines will help identify those patients for whom a COT trial may be appropriate, while protecting their welfare and safety. © 2010 American Headache Society.

AB  - The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is involved in the activated states of waking and paradoxical sleep, forming part of the reticular activating system (RAS). The studies described tested the hypothesis that single unit and/or population responses of PPN neurons are capable of generating gamma band frequency activity. Whole cell patch clamp recordings (immersion chamber) and population responses (interface chamber) were conducted on 9- to 20-day-old rat brain stem slices. Regardless of cell type (I, II, or III) or type of response to the nonselective cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol (excitation, inhibition, biphasic), almost all PPN neurons fired at gamma band frequency, but no higher, when subjected to depolarizing steps (50 ± 2 Hz, mean ± SE). Nonaccommodating neurons fired at 18-100 Hz throughout depolarizing steps, while most accommodating neurons exhibited gamma band frequency of action potentials followed by gamma band membrane oscillations. These oscillations were blocked by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), suggesting that at least some are mediated by sodium currents. Population responses in the PPN showed that carbachol induced peaks of activation in the theta and gamma range, while glutamatergic receptor agonists induced overall increases in activity at theta and gamma frequencies, although in differing patterns. Gamma band activity appears to be a part of the intrinsic membrane properties of PPN neurons, and the population as a whole generates different patterns of gamma band activity under the influence of specific transmitters. Given sufficient excitation, the PPN may impart gamma band activation on its targets. Copyright © 2010 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and long-lasting insecticidal treated nets (LLIN) are important means of malaria prevention. Although there is consensus regarding their importance, there is uncertainty as to which delivery strategies are optimal for dispensing these life saving interventions. A targeted mass distribution of free LLINs to children under five and pregnant women was implemented in Zanzibar between August 2005 and January 2006. The outcomes of this distribution among children under five were evaluated, four to nine months after implementation. Methods. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in May 2006 in two districts of Zanzibar: Micheweni (MI) on Pemba Island and North A (NA) on Unguja Island. Household interviews were conducted with 509 caretakers of under-five children, who were surveyed for socio-economic status, the net distribution process, perceptions and use of bed nets. Each step in the distribution process was assessed in all children one to five years of age for unconditional and conditional proportion of success. System effectiveness (the accumulated proportion of success) and equity effectiveness were calculated, and predictors for LLIN use were identified. Results. The overall proportion of children under five sleeping under any type of treated net was 83.7% (318/380) in MI and 91.8% (357/389) in NA. The LLIN usage was 56.8% (216/380) in MI and 86.9% (338/389) in NA. Overall system effectiveness was 49% in MI and 87% in NA, and equity was found in the distribution scale-up in NA. In both districts, the predicting factor of a child sleeping under an LLIN was caretakers thinking that LLINs are better than conventional nets (OR = 2.8, p = 0.005 in MI and 2.5, p = 0.041 in NA), in addition to receiving an LLIN (OR = 4.9, p < 0.001 in MI and in OR = 30.1, p = 0.001 in NA). Conclusions. Targeted free mass distribution of LLINs can result in high and equitable bed net coverage among children under five. However, in order to sustain high effective coverage, there is need for complimentary distribution strategies between mass distribution campaigns. Considering the community's preferences prior to a mass distribution and addressing the communities concerns through information, education and communication, may improve the LLIN usage. © 2010 Beer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Study Objectives: Recent evidence has suggested that low socioeconomic status (SES), race, prematurity, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are associated with childhood sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We investigated (1) the association of SDB with a wide range of risk factors, including prenatal and perinatal complications; (2) the association of these complications with SES and race; and (3) the association of SDB with developmental milestones. Methods: Six hundred thirteen school-aged children (105 clinically referred and 508 community control subjects) underwent overnight polysomnography and had a complete history and physical examination. A comprehensive child development questionnaire was completed by a parent. We compared clinically referred children with SDB to population-based control children without SDB from The Penn State Children's Cohort. Results: Maternal smoking during pregnancy; maternal age and weight gain during pregnancy; prenatal complications, such as maternal high blood pressure and gestational diabetes; perinatal complications related to prematurity; delayed motor milestones; race and SES were significantly associated with the presence of childhood SDB. Most of the risk factors became nonsignificant when analyses controlled for race and SES. Delayed motor milestones remained significantly associated with SDB after controlling for race and SES. Conclusion: These data suggest that there is a significant association between children who experience prenatal or perinatal distress and the development of moderate to severe childhood SDB. SES and race may be mediating the impact on SDB through increased prenatal and perinatal risks. The significant delay in motor milestones suggests that prenatal and perinatal distress may result in neurologic insult, which could influence the development of SDB in later childhood.

AB  - Background: The study of potential factors associated with sleep bruxism (SB) may help in determining the etiology of such parafunction. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of children with SB by means of a generic scale, in addition to the association of sociodemographic characteristics and other parafunctional habits.Methods: This cross-sectional study included healthy children of both genders, aged 7.18 ± 0.59 years, with (n = 25) and without (n = 69) signs and symptoms of SB. Data were collected in caries-free children from public schools by applying a translated and validated version of the Autoquestionnaire Qualite de Vie Enfant Image (AUQUEI), clinical examination and interview with the parents. The psychometric properties evaluated for the scale referred to internal consistency (ceiling and floor effects, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, Items Correlation Matrix, and corrected Item-Total Correlation) and the discriminant validity (t-test). By means of logistic regression with stepwise backward elimination, associations were evaluated between SB and age, gender, body mass index, maternal use of alcohol/tobacco/medicine during pregnancy, maternal age at birth, parent's schooling, presence of sucking habit, nail biting, enuresis, number of children, child's order (first born), occurrence of divorce/parent's death, and AUQUEI scores.Results: The results of the AUQUEI psychometric analysis showed homogeneity of items and a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.65; no negative correlations between the items were found. The mean AUQUEI scores for children with SB did not differ significantly from those of children without the parafunction. Only the independent variable "maternal age at birth" showed a significant negative association with SB.Conclusions: In the studied sample, children with SB presented scores of QoL that were similar to those without the parafunction, and children from the youngest mothers were more likely to present SB. © 2010 Castelo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Although the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is unknown, it is precipitated in susceptible individuals by adverse events. This review examines the role of intrauterine factors resulting from exposure to stress hormones in the increased vulnerability of the organism to MDD. Severe maternal stress or alcohol intake during the second and third trimesters causes excess release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and cortisol. These hormones reduce birth weight; impair the feedback regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) axis and 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A signaling in key brain areas. Similar changes are seen in patients with MDD and in experimental animals after chronic inescapable stress, prenatal stress or alcohol, which also induce depressive-like behavior in rats, alterations in sleep and circadian rhythms reminiscent of those in humans with MDD. Clinical improvement of MDD by antidepressants is accompanied by normalization of the regulation of the HPA axis and of serotoninergic transmission.

AB  - Clinical observations in chronic inflammatory diseases have demonstrated the significant influence of neuroendocrine mechanisms on the immune system: (1) Amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy; (2) preponderance of women versus men with respect to autoimmune diseases; (3) negative effects of ovulation-inducing therapy, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy; (4) protective effect of hemiplegia; (5) influence of psychological stress on inflammation; and (6) influence of circadian rhythms on inflammatory symptoms. The effects of different hormones and neurotransmitters on the immune system are influenced by: (1) the immune stimulus (foreign antigens or autoantigens) and subsequent antigen-specific immune responses, (2) the cell types involved during different phases of the disease, (3) the target organ with its specific microenvironment, (4) the timing of hormone or neurotransmitter increase in relation to the disease course, (5) the concentration of hormones and neurotransmitters, (6) the variability in expression of receptors depending on the microenvironment and the cell type, and (7) the intra-and extracellular peripheral metabolism of hormones and neurotransmitters leading to important biologically active metabolites with quite different anti-and proinflammatory functions. The circadian rhythm of disease-related symptoms with a peak in the early morning hours confirms that the neuroendocrine system has a strong influence on these chronic immune/inflammatory diseases. The influence is transmitted by the circadian fluctuation in the activity of hormonal and neuronal pathways linking the brain to immune cell activation. These considerations could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for rheumatic diseases in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - Generation and cryopreservation of transgenic mice depend on reliable and continuous production of pre-implantation embryos. To suppress circannual and circadian rhythms driving the physiological and sexual behaviour of free living animals, laboratory animals are housed under standardized conditions. It remains to be elucidated if the artificial climate can cover all environmental effects. Here, we report that the humidity in an animal facility affects the embryo yield. The weather at the location of the facility, especially the temperature, influences the climate within an animal facility; weather peaks are obviously covered in part only, even if the facility is equipped with a powerful air-conditioning supply. Subsequently, external weather changes interact with the environment within the facility, influencing the production of embryos. Furthermore, noise and/or vibrations as generated by construction works, negatively affect the embryo yield. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adrenal insufficiency is caused by either primary adrenal failure, mostly due to autoimmune adrenalitis, or by hypothalamic-pituitary impairment of the corticotropic axis, predominantly by long-term pharmacodynamic glucocorticoid treatment or by pituitary tumour growth and related treatment. Despite optimized life-saving glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy, health-related quality of life in adrenal insufficiency is more severely impaired than previously thought and patients with adrenal insufficiency are also threatened by an increased mortality. Optimizing hormone replacement remains one of the most challenging tasks in endocrinology. Monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement quality is hampered by lack of objective assessment tools and therefore largely based on clinical grounds. Thus, long-term management of patients with adrenal insufficiency remains a continuous challenge asking for the experienced specialist. However, diagnosis and management of suspected acute adrenal failure is an important task for all physicians. This review explains the rationale behind the current hormone replacement scheme, points to the deficits and hints at possible future therapies.

AB  - Contents: The aim of this study was to monitor changes in cortisol levels in sows around the time of separation from their piglets, in two different intermittent suckling regimes, compared with that in conventionally weaned sows. Sows were either weaned at 21 days of lactation (CONT) or subjected to an intermittent suckling regime (IS) from 14 days of lactation onwards. Sows in the IS regimes were separated from their piglets for 12 h every day, either from 08:00 to 20:00 hours (IS12) or from 08:00 to 14:00 hours and 20:00 to 02:00 hours (IS6). Separation caused a transient increase in cortisol levels on the first (CONT and IS12) and second (IS12) day of separation, compared with a gradual decline from early morning when the sows were still continuously suckling. In IS6 sows, in contrast, the transient rise in cortisol levels after separation at 08:00 hours was observed on the first 3 days and also on day 7 of the IS regime. Cortisol parameters were correlated with peri-ovulatory characteristics like onset of oestrus, onset of the LH surge and time of ovulation. Onset of the LH surge was delayed in IS6 sows. In conclusion, increase in cortisol levels as a consequence of separation of sows and piglets, is an acute, incidental phenomenon in IS12 and CONT sows, but shows a repeated acute elevation in IS6 sows, possibly placing IS6 sows at a higher risk of influencing peri-ovulatory processes and developing cystic follicles. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women (n=245) completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester. Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between pregnancy physical discomforts experienced during the second trimester and late pregnancy depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effect of sleep quality on antenatal depressive symptomatology. Healthy pregnant women (N = 257) completed the Physical Symptoms Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Inventory at early-mid second trimester, and then again at late third trimester. Physical symptoms and sleep quality at the first time point were both correlated moderately with depressive symptoms at late pregnancy. Discomfort associated with physical symptoms was a better predictor of depressive symptoms than Frequency of symptoms, although a score combining Frequency, Discomfort and Effect of symptoms on life was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses of the mediation model indicated that physical symptoms at early-mid second trimester predicted depressive symptoms in the last trimester both directly, and via poor sleep quality (prospectively), which mediated the relationship. The clinical implications of these findings for antenatal care are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - QUESTION: A patient who just found out that she is pregnant and suffers from migraine headaches informs me that she has been taking naratriptan. She indicates that she is planning on breastfeeding her baby and might need to continue treatment. How safe are the medications from this class of drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding? ANSWER: Accumulated data suggest that exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy does not increase the risk of birth defects above the baseline rate. There are currently insufficient data to confirm the safety of other triptans; however, evidence to date is reassuring. Information regarding safety of triptans while breastfeeding is limited but also reassuring, as the minimal amounts excreted into the milk are insufficient to cause any adverse effects on the breastfeeding infant.

AB  - Introduction: Current data suggest that exacerbations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) during pregnancy worsen perinatal outcomes. However, patients' perceptions regarding the interaction between pregnancy and IBD management are unexplored. Aims: To (1) obtain pregnancy outcome data from local female IBD patients, and (2) to gain insight into patients' understanding of the interaction between IBD and pregnancy, and how this affects medication-taking behaviour. Methods: Female IBD subjects aged 18-50 years were surveyed by questionnaire. This large retrospective study sought patient who reported pregnancy outcomes and examined the relationship between major adverse outcomes, IBD activity and treatment. Subjective data regarding patients' perceptions about IBD management and pregnancy were sought. Results: 219 females were surveyed, 143 completing a questionnaire (68.1%). 342 pregnancies occurred, 298 of which outcome data were available. Overall IBD women reported adverse pregnancy outcome rates comparable to the local population. Major adverse outcomes were more frequent in the subgroup with severe disease during pregnancy (5 / 14 (35.7%)) than those with inactive disease (14 / 284 (4.9%)), (OR 6.8 (95% CI 1.7-26.3), p = 0.006). Adjusting for disease severity, neither corticosteroid, azathioprine nor 5ASA affected pregnancy outcome. Most female patients (84%) reported (unwarranted) concerns about the effect of IBD medications on pregnancy, free text responses indicating that this was of greater concern than any effect of IBD exacerbation. Conclusions: Unwarranted fear of adverse medication effect on pregnancy is highly prevalent in women with IBD, yet awareness of the harmful effect of IBD exacerbation during pregnancy is poor. This information gap between patients and their gastroenterologists warrants attention. © 2009 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.

We describe a unique case of an IABP placement in a pregnant woman in her third trimester with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The IABP allowed safe delivery of the fetus by cesarean section prior to a successful percutaneous intervention for complex two-vessel coronary artery disease. This case report also describes the first-time use of an IABP during cesarean section.

AB  - Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and social behavior deficits in adolescents and adults that have experienced prenatal exposure to adverse conditions. This study investigated whether sleep deprivation during the pre-implantation stage of development alters the physiological, behavioral and oxidative metabolic processes in adult male mouse offspring. One group of dams was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for 6. h on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3). After sleep deprivation, homocysteine, cysteine, corticosterone, estrogen and progesterone concentrations were measured from the experimental mothers and time-matched controls. The sizes and weights of the male pups were measured at various stages throughout the experiment. At PND 90, behavioral (Activity Box and Elevated Plus Maze) and biochemical parameters were assessed. The dams' plasma progesterone concentrations decreased in the PSD 72 group, and the levels of plasma estradiol increased in GH 2. Corticosterone levels were found to increase after all sleep-deprivation procedures. Homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 but decreased in the PSD 72 group. The offspring of GH 1 mothers exhibited decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Exposure to sleep deprivation had a long-lasting impact on tissue weight; in particular, there was a decrease in hemilateral epididymal fat weight in mature animals from the PSD 72 group. Although some of the alterations observed in the mothers (elevated estrogen and corticosterone levels and decreased progesterone) might have played a role in the permanent alterations in the adult offspring, they were not the main cause. The homocysteine changes detected in the sleep-deprived dams may contribute to redox changes, controlling gene expression and shaping epigenetic development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The suggestions that need to be considered by the people in the US to manage the problems associated with fatigue have been discussed. The fatigue can be both physical and mental. The physical fatigue, such as muscle weakness or lack of strength results in the inability to exert force with one's muscles to the degree that would be expected. The fatigue and irregular sleep patterns have been associated with a number of negative effects for pregnant women and fertility rates. A study by the International Labor Organization for the United Nations has found that Americans work longer hours than anyone else in the industrialized world that results in fatigue. Emergency responders must take advantage of opportunities for sleep, both on- and off-duty in order to mitigate the impact of fatigue on their health. Studies have shown that napping is an effective coping strategy that can be used in anticipation of a long night or during extended operations.

AB  - Obesity carries a unique disease burden on women and is influenced by a variety of biological, hormonal, environmental, and cultural factors. Reproductive transitions, such as pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk for obesity. Psychologically, obese women experience greater weight-related stigma and discrimination and are at increased risk for depression than obese men. Women are also particularly susceptible to psychological stress, sleep debt, and lack of physical activity, all of which are risk factors for the development of excess weight. Obesity risk is increased among women with psychiatric disorders and those who use certain psychotropic medications. Obesity treatment should take into consideration degree of obesity, health risks, past weight loss attempts, and individual differences in motivation and readiness for treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Valproic acid's well-known teratogenicity limits its use in women of childbearing age. Valnoctamide is an analog of valproate that does not undergo biotransformation to the corresponding free acid. In mice, valnoctamide has been shown to be distinctly less teratogenic than valproate. Valnoctamide is an anticonvulsant, and we hypothesized that valnoctamide is antimanic. Methods: We performed a double-blind, five-week, add-on, controlled trial of valnoctamide in mania. Patients were treated with risperidone at doses of the physician's discretion. Valnoctamide or placebo was begun at doses of 600 mg/day and increased to 1200 mg after four days. Weekly ratings by a psychiatrist blind to the study drug were conducted using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Results: Fifteen valnoctamide patients and 17 placebo patients completed at least one post-baseline week and were included in data analysis. In all efficacy measures valnoctamide was more effective than placebo as an add-on to risperidone, using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time as the within-subject factor. Two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of time (p < 0.001) and significant interaction between treatment and time (YMRS: p = 0.012; BPRS: p = 0.007; CGI: p = 0.003). Differences between valnoctamide and placebo were significant from week 3 to week 5. Conclusion: Valnoctamide could be an important valproate substitute for women of childbearing age with bipolar disorder who may become pregnant. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - The early-life environment affects risk of later metabolic disease, including glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and obesity. Changes in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathoadrenal function may underlie these disorders. To determine consequences of undernutrition in early gestation and/or immediately following weaning on HPA axis and sympathoadrenal function, 2- to 3-year-old Welsh Mountain ewes received 100% (C,= 39) or 50% nutritional requirements (U, n= 41) from 1-31 days gestation, and 100% thereafter. From weaning (12 weeks) to 25 weeks of age, male and female offspring were then either fed ad libitum (CC, n= 22; UC, n= 19) or were undernourished (CU, n= 17; UU, n= 22) such that body weight was reduced to 85% of their individual target, based on a growth trajectory calculated from weights taken between birth and 12 weeks. From 25 weeks, ad libitum feeding was restored for all offspring. At 1.5 and 2.5 years, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol concentrations were measured at baseline and in response to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) (0.5 μg kg-1) plus arginine vasopressin (AVP) (0.1 μg kg-1). At 2.5 years, HPA axis and sympathoadrenal (catecholamine) responses to a transport and isolation stress test were also measured. In females, post-weaning undernutrition reduced pituitary output (ACTH) but increased adrenocortical responsiveness (cortisol:ACTH area under curve) during CRF/AVP challenge at 1.5 years and increased adrenomedullary output (adrenaline) to stress at 2.5 years. In males, cortisol responses to stress at 2.5 years were reduced in those with slower growth rates from 12 to 25 weeks. Early gestation undernutrition was associated with increased adrenocortical output in 2.5-year-old females only. Pituitary and adrenal responses were also related to adult body composition. Thus, poor growth in the post-weaning period induced by nutrient restriction has sex- and age-specific effects on HPA and sympathoadrenal function. With altered glucose tolerance previously reported in this model, this may have long-term detrimental effects on metabolic homeostasis and cardiovascular function. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - This article presents a novel view on the diabetes aetiology from the standpoint of a single epidemiological factor. It has been observed that, irrespective of the type of diabetes, sufferers have a stable, persistent behavioural habit: to take a rest or to have a nap within two hours of a meal. Such habitual behaviour is termed as postprandial hypokinesia (PPH).The working hypothesis is that, after food intake and with the body in a recumbent/semirecumbent position on the back, the stomach replete with food places mechanical pressure against the pancreas. As a consequence, systematic disturbances in the microcirculatory flow of the islets of Langerhans (ischemia) cause hypoxia to develop which, ultimately, sets in train a pathological process (and later, an autoimmune reaction). The intensity and effect of structurally-functional disturbances are determined by the degree of hypoxia.Literature sources support the islets of Langerhans being physiologically susceptible to hypoxia. Moreover, the same effects of experimental hypoxia on the islets of Langerhans are also observed in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Accumulated scientific research makes possible to construct an ischemic/hypoxic model of diabetes development. The core pathological process then should involve all the following pathologies: inflammation of the islets of Langerhans, dysfunction of an insulin islet apparatus, apoptosis/necrosis of the cells in the insulin islets. All three are also observed in diabetes. From this perspective, conventional types of diabetes can be regarded as different states, apparently progressing, of a single pathological process attributed to the level reached in the compensatory capacity exhaustion.It follows that, with the elimination of PPH, conditions for the pathological process to be reversed are created: the reparation of injured tissues and the recovery of function to synthesise and secrete insulin are likely. Those patients under observation, who eliminated the PPH behaviour from their lifestyle, encountered a positive dynamic in terms of an increased capacity for work, improvement in general condition, normalization of glycemia level, a decrease in medication as well as remission.The major implication of the hypothesis, if correct and accepted, is that the use of medication on a stand-alone basis without alterations to a lifestyle would not be sufficient to produce successful treatment and cure of diabetes. Behavioural therapy should be used as a primary causal therapeutic action. Education on the consequences of the PPH factor should be used as a primary preventive measure. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose of review To review recent knowledge on mental health of parents of twins conceived via assisted reproductive technology (ART). Recent findings Mental health of mothers and fathers of twins conceived via ART is impaired when compared with that of ART singletons. Summary Existing studies are mainly cross-sectional and most of them focus on maternal mental health. It is evident that twin parenthood is the main factor impairing the mental health in parents with ART twins. This aspect should be taken into account when counseling the couples and deciding the number of embryos for transfer in ART. Well conducted prospective longitudinal studies are needed on both maternal and paternal mental health with twins conceived via ART from transition to parenthood to and beyond toddler age covering later life with school-aged and adolescent twins. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Medicalization is the process by which non-medical problems become defined and treated as medical problems, usually as illnesses or disorders. There has been growing concern with the possibility that medicalization is driving increased health care costs. In this paper we estimate the medical spending in the U.S. of identified medicalized conditions at approximately 77 billion in 2005, 3.9% of total domestic expenditures on health care. This estimate is based on the direct costs associated with twelve medicalized conditions. Although due to data limitations this estimate does not include all medicalized conditions, it can inform future debates about health care spending and medicalization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: to explore the strategies used by women to manage fatigue in the first six months following childbirth. Design: a qualitative study using an exploratory descriptive design. Data were collected using open-ended questions contained in surveys posted to participants six, 12 and 24 weeks after birth. Setting: Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Participants: 59 well women, 27 primipara and 32 multipara, aged 20-40 years, who gave birth in the Australian Capital Territory. Findings: three themes emerged from the analysis:'Looking after me' or self-care practices; 'Managing the load' or balancing the work to be done with the aim of managing the woman's fatigue; and 'How it worked', describing how useful the strategies had been in managing fatigue. From six weeks to six months, the women used self-care strategies (sleep/rest, relaxing, conserving energy) more often than strategies designed to manage the load (getting help, planning, lowering expectations). Most multiparas (24/32) conserved energy to manage fatigue, in contrast to primiparas (13/27). Women experiencing high fatigue conserved energy more often than women who were experiencing less fatigue. No differences in strategy choice were found between women who experienced a vaginal birth and those who had experienced a caesarean birth, or between those women who scored ≥13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as opposed to those who scored <13. Overall, women rated their chosen strategies as very useful or useful. Womens' comments also indicated that getting help from partners and family was sometimes difficult, reducing the usefulness of this strategy. Implications for practice: preparing women and their partners to manage postnatal fatigue more effectively is essential. Midwives should encourage women to identify sources of help and what particular help that individual could provide. Scenarios should be used in parenting classes to encourage women and their partners to negotiate issues surrounding the sharing of responsibilities after birth. After birth, ongoing assessment of fatigue and the strategies used to manage it is essential beyond the first six weeks. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Different classes of psychotropics can cause hyperprolactinemia to varying degrees. Among antipsychotics, typical agents and risperidone are the most frequent and significant offenders. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology, offending medications, assessment and management of hyperprolactinemia. Methods: We did a literature review between 1976 and 2008 using PubMed, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Cochrane database. Search terms used were prolactin, hyperprolactinemia, psychotropics, antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants and SSRIs. Results: Prolactin elevation is more common with antipsychotics than with other classes of drugs. Typical antipsychotics are more prone to cause hyperprolactinemia than atypical agents. Management options include discontinuation of offending medication, switching to another psychotropic, supplementing concurrent hormonal deficiencies and adding a dopamine agonist or aripiprazole. Conclusion: Clinicians need to be alert about the potential for hyperprolactinemia and its manifestations with these medications. Prolactin levels need to be monitored and other causes of hyperprolactinemia ruled out in suspected cases. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological condition, frequently idiopathic, sometimes associated with specific disorders such as iron deficiency. We investigated RLS prevalence in celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease characterized by several features such as malabsorption-related iron deficiency anemia and peripheral neuropathy. We screened a population of 100 adult CD patients for CD features, iron metabolism, clinical and neurological conditions, and enrolled 100 age- and sex-matched controls in the general population. RLS was ascertained in CD patients and controls by both the presence of the four essential International RLS Study Group diagnostic criteria and neurological examination. The International RLS Study Group rating scale was used to measure RLS severity. We found a 31% prevalence of RLS in the CD population that was significantly higher than the prevalence in the control population (4%; P < 0.001). The average severity of RLS in CD population was moderate (17 ± 6.5). In the CD population, no significant correlation was found between RLS and either gluten-free diet or iron metabolism, despite hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in CD patients with RLS than without RLS (P = 0.003). We found no correlation between RLS and other possible causes of secondary RLS, including signs of peripheral neuropathy, pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, and pharmacological treatments.Our study broadens the spectrum of neurological disorders associated with CD and indicates that RLS should be sought for in all patients with CD. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Background: Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, considered endemic in modern society, are associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.Methods: A cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records. Generalized linear models were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively.Results: After adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women sleeping ≤ 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR = 5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69). The corresponding RR for lean women (&lt;25 kg/m2) was 3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (≥ 25 kg/m2). Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94). The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who snored. Compared with lean women who did not snore, those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI 2.87-16.6).Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM. Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise estimates of observed associations. © 2010 Qiu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: According to an old Swiss proverb, "a new mother lazing in childbed is a blessing to her family". Today mothers rarely enjoy restful days after birth, but enter directly into the challenge of combining baby- and self-care. They often face a combination of infant crying and personal tiredness. Yet, routine postnatal care often lacks effective strategies to alleviate these challenges which can adversely affect family health. We explored how new mothers experience and handle postnatal infant crying and their own tiredness in the context of changing hospital care practices in Switzerland.Methods: Purposeful sampling was used to enroll 15 mothers of diverse parity and educational backgrounds, all of who had given birth to a full term healthy neonate. Using interpretive phenomenology, we analyzed interview and participant observation data collected during the postnatal hospital stay and at 6 and 12 weeks post birth. This paper reports on the postnatal hospital experience.Results: Women's personal beliefs about beneficial childcare practices shaped how they cared for their newborn's and their own needs during the early postnatal period in the hospital. These beliefs ranged from an infant-centered approach focused on the infant's development of a basic sense of trust to an approach that balanced the infants' demands with the mother's personal needs. Getting adequate rest was particularly difficult for mothers striving to provide infant-centered care for an unsettled neonate. These mothers suffered from sleep deprivation and severe tiredness unless they were able to leave the baby with health professionals for several hours during the night.Conclusion: New mothers often need permission to attend to their own needs, as well as practical support with childcare to recover from birth especially when neonates are fussy. To strengthen family health from the earliest stage, postnatal care should establish conditions which enable new mothers to balance the care of their infant with their own needs. © 2010 Kurth et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Evidence in humans and rodents suggests the importance of circadian rhythmicity in parturition. A molecular clock underlies the generation of circadian rhythmicity. While this molecular clock has been identified in numerous tissues, the expression and regulation of clock genes in tissues relevant to parturition is largely undefined. Here, the expression and regulation of the clock genes Bmal1, Clock, cryptochrome (Cry1/2) and period (Per1/2) was examined in the murine gravid uterus, placenta and fetal membranes during late gestation. All clock genes examined were expressed in the tissues of interest throughout the last third of gestation. Upregulation of a subset of these clock genes was observed in each of these tissues in the final two days of gestation. Oscillating expression of mRNA for a subset of the examined clock genes was detected in the gravid uterus, placenta and fetal membranes. Furthermore, bioluminescence recording on explants from gravid Per2::luciferase mice indicated rhythmic expression of PER2 protein in these tissues. These data demonstrate expression and rhythmicity of clock genes in tissues relevant to parturition indicating a potential contribution of peripheral molecular clocks to this process. © 2010 CSIRO.

AB  - Preterm delivery is the primary cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Labour at term occurs as a culmination of maturational events in both the fetus and maternal uterus. This process exhibits diurnal variation, with the onset of labour being more common at night. We have confirmed that this diurnal variation is present in gestations between 28 and 36 weeks, but is absent below 28 weeks. We hypothesise that this is because before 28 weeks of gestation, the onset of labour may result from a pathological rather than a physiological process. This may have important implications regarding any pharmacological approach to the prevention and/or treatment of very early preterm labour. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

AB  - The effects of maternal stress during pregnancy may depend, in part, on the timing in gestation of the occurrence of stress. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of stage of gestation on maternal psychophysiological responses to stress using a standardized laboratory paradigm and on the cortisol response to awakening (CAR). A longitudinal design was employed to quantify maternal psychophysiological stress reactivity [changes in heart rate (HR), blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and psychological distress in response to the trier social stress test (TSST)] and the CAR at approximately 17 and 31 weeks gestation in a sample of 148 women. To account for the possible effects of habituation when being exposed to the same stress protocol twice, a non-pregnant comparison group (CG, N 36) also underwent these assessments at two time points, with a comparable time interval between the assessments. In both groups, the TSST elicited significant changes in maternal HR, mean arterial pressure, and psychological distress levels but not a significant increase in cortisol levels. Among the pregnant women (pregnant group(PG)), the stressor-induced increases in HR, blood pressure, and psychological distress were significantly lower at the second (31 weeks gestation) compared to the first (17 weeks gestation) assessment of pregnancy (all p < 0.01). The maternal CAR was also significantly attenuated in later compared to earlier gestation (p 0.003). In the CG, there were no significant differences in psychophysiological stress responses and in the CAR across the two assessments. Among pregnant women there is a progressive attenuation of psychophysiological stress responses with advancing gestation. This attenuation is unlikely to be attributable to habituation. Individual differences in the degree of attenuation of stress responses over gestation may represent a novel marker of stress susceptibility in human pregnancy. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Pain exhibits temporal variations in intensity due to multiple factors, including endogenous neuroendocrine and various external influences that vary over the 24h. Also, medications can vary in potency andor toxicity according to the time when they are administered. However, there is no consensus among studies regarding the 24-h pattern of analgesia during labor. Taking into account the time-of-day when labor analgesia is administered, this study aimed to answer two questions: (i) Is there diurnal variation in visual analogue scale (VAS)rated pain relief and duration of intrathecal analgesia in patients undergoing labor analgesia? (ii) If there is, what is the influence of the duration of labor on the diurnal variation of the level of pain relief and duration of intrathecal analgesia? This prospective cohort included 41 healthy, nulliparous women in the first stage of labor undergoing spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia using fentanyl combined with bupivacaine. Subjects had an epidural catheter fitted for additional, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) if their pain relief was unsatisfactory. The number of VAS assessments (n558) was divided into six time periods of the 24h. The adjusted coefficient of determination (r2), the proportion of the variance explained by the association between the duration of labor and the temporal pattern of the outcomes variable, was 58 (r20.58) for pain relief and 44 (r20.44) for duration of intrathecal analgesia. The peak effect of labor analgesia occurred between 02:00 and 05:59h. However, the duration of intrathecal analgesia showed two peaks, i.e., at ∼00:00 and ∼12:00h. These results demonstrate that labor analgesia achieved by fentanyl combined with bupivacaine shows a diurnal pattern in pain relief and duration of spinal analgesia. However, part of these temporal patterns was explained by the association with duration of labor. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Subclinical thyroid dysfunction occurs when peripheral thyroid hormone levels are within the normal laboratory reference range and the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) level is greater than normal (subclinical hypothyroidism) or less than normal (subclinical hyperthyroidism; TSH normal laboratory reference range: 0.3-5.0 mIU/l). For patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (serum TSH levels >10 mIU/l), thyroxine therapy is prescribed if other causes of TSH elevation and transient conditions have been excluded. For serum TSH levels between 5.0 and 10.0 mIU/l, selective therapy should be considered. For patients with sustained subclinical hyperthyroidism (serum TSH levels <0.1 mIU/l), therapy is recommended, especially in older patients. Observation or selective therapy should be considered for patients with serum TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.3 mIU/l. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Environmental factors can influence the acute and longer-term risks of developing diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Increasing evidence suggests that these effects can be achieved by modification of metabolic gene expression. These include acute changes in histone methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination and longer-term DNA silencing elicited by DNA methylation. Thus, an increased risk of disease may reflect acute or chronic stable modification of genes that regulate nutrient handling, leading to altered nutrient utilization (increased lipid oxidation at the expense of glucose utilization) and/or changes in the balance between nutrient storage and energy production, thereby favoring the development of obesity. The review addresses the hypothesis that early-life epigenetic programming of gene expression could be mirrored by changes in acute function of nuclear receptors, in particular the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, achieved by enzymes that are more conventionally involved in regulating DNA methylation and post-transcriptional modification of histones. Emphasis is placed on the potential importance of the protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 as a central co-ordinator. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) assay provides a reliable measure of chronic glycemia and correlates well with the risk of long-term diabetes complications, so that it is currently considered the test of choice for monitoring and chronic management of diabetes. Recently, HbA1c testing has been included within the diagnostic criteria recommended for diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The emerging concept that HbA1c can be used rather than blood glucose in the diagnosis of diabetes is highly appealing for a variety of reasons, including less sensitivity to preanalytical variables, lower within subject biological variablity, little to null interference from diurnal variations, acute stress and common drugs which are known to influence glucose metabolism, as well as the fact that one single measurement might provide information for both diagnosing diabetes and tracking glycemic control. On the other hand, the use of HbA1c for screening and diagnosing diabetes also carries some limitations, including the worse diagnostic performance in different populations (i.e., pregnancy, elderly and non-Hispanic blacks), the risk of overdiagnosis in subjects with iron deficiency anemia, in subjects genetically predisposed to hyperglycation, and in those with increased red blood cell turnover. There is also a higher risk of misdiagnosis in patients with end-stage renal disease and heavy alcohol consumption. Finally, HbA1c testing might be biased due to the interference from several hemoglobin variants, is characterized by a higher imprecision than blood glucose measurement, and is more expensive. This paper will critically summarize the potential advantages and limitations of HbA1c as a recommended test for diagnosing diabetes. © 2010 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.

AB  - Objective: To examine the associations between sleep problems and prenatal exposure to cocaine, opiates, marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine in children aged 1 month to 12 years. Design: Sleep data were collected by maternal report in a prospective longitudinal follow-up of children participating in the Maternal Lifestyle multisite study. Setting: Hospital-based research centers in Providence, Rhode Island; Miami, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and Memphis, Tennessee. Participants: There were 808 participants, 374 exposed to cocaine and/or opiates, and 434 comparison subjects. Main Exposure: Prenatal cocaine, opiate, marijuana, alcohol, and/or nicotine exposure. Outcome Measure: Sleep problems in early, middle, and/or late childhood, assessed as composites of maternal report items. Results: Of the 5 substances, prenatal nicotine exposure was the only unique predictor of sleep problems (B=0.074, R2 change=0.008, P=.01), with adjustment for covariates, including socioeconomic status, marital status, physical abuse, prenatal medical care, and postnatal cigarette smoke exposure. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to nicotine was positively associated with children's sleep problems persisting throughout the first 12 years of life. Targeting of this group of children for educational and behavioral efforts to prevent and treat sleep problems is merited given that good sleep may serve as a protective factor for other developmental outcomes. ©2010 American Medical Association.

AB  - Objective: Insufficient sleep in children is associated with adverse health effects. We examined the associations of early life risk factors with infant sleep duration. Methods: We studied 1676 mother-infant pairs in a prebirth cohort study. Main outcomes were mothers' report of their infants' average 24-hour sleep duration at ages 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Results: Infants slept mean standard deviation [SD] durations of 12.2 (2.0) hours/day at age 6 months, 12.8 (1.6) hours/day at age 1 year, and 11.9 (1.3) hours/day at age 2 years. In multivariable regression models, maternal antenatal depression, introduction of solids at age <4 months, and infant TV/video viewing were associated with shorter sleep durations at both 1 and 2 years of age. Estimates were 0.36 fewer hours/day of sleep for maternal antenatal depression, 0.39 fewer hours/day of sleep if infant was introduced to solids at age <4 months, and 0.11 fewer hours/day of sleep for each 1 hour of TV viewed per week. Attendance at child care outside the home was associated with 0.18 fewer hours/day of sleep at age 2 years. At age 2 years, black, Hispanic, and Asian infants slept 0.40, 0.82, and 0.95, respectively, fewer hours per day than white infants. Conclusions: Maternal depression during pregnancy, early introduction of solid foods, infant TV viewing, and attendance of child care were associated with shorter infant sleep duration. Racial/ethnic minority children slept fewer hours in the first 2 years of life than white children. Our results suggest that various risk factors, some potentially modifiable, are worthy of clinical consideration when addressing infant sleep duration.

AB  - Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) provides us with a method of assessing brain activity in critically ill neonates. In extremely premature neonates, the aEEG trace is predominantly discontinuous, making it difficult to distinguish between a "normal" and "abnormal" trace. We measured aEEG activity in the first 48 h of life in neonates born before 29-wk gestation and used both visual and quantitative analysis of the aEEG data to assess differences in neonates with poor short-term outcome [death or peri/intraventricular hemorrhage (P/IVH)] compared with those who survived without P/IVH to identify features of an abnormal aEEG. On quantitative analysis, EEG continuity <80% at 10-μV level was a sensitive and specific marker of poor short-term outcome. By using this marker, we identified 83% of neonates who died or developed grade 3 or 4 IVH and 60% of neonates who developed grades 1 or 2 IVH, with a positive predictive value for death or any IVH of 73% and a negative predictive value of 86%. Absence of sleep-wake cycling with baseline variability <2 μV was the strongest predictor of outcome using visual analysis alone. © 2010 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To fully ascertain the familial aggregation of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and to characterize the clinical features of familial RLS (fRLS) cases. Design: A case series survey with a high response rate. Setting: Academic research center. Participants: Consecutive RLS probands (n=249) were followed up in a specialized sleep center for 15 years. A total of 671 cases of fRLS met the current standard diagnostic criteria, including 192 probands characterized using multidimensional clinical assessments and 479 affected family members assessed by their responses to a structured questionnaire telephone diagnostic interview. Main Outcome Measures: Sibling and offspring relative risk ratio and clinical and genetic features of patients with fRLS and families. Results: Our data showed that RLS aggregates in families with a familial rate of 77%, a sibling relative risk of 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-4.4), and an offspring relative risk of 1.8 (1.0-2.7). Familial RLS is a chronic disorder with a mean (SD) disease duration of 24(16) years and a wide range of age of onset (mean [SD], 28[15] years), with most family members having early-onset disease but mild to moderate RLS symptoms. Our clinical data also indicated that fRLS is more prominent among women who also had increased incidence of anemia/iron deficiency, arthritis, and number of pregnancies. Pregnancy-related RLS seems to be a characteristic feature of fRLS, and afflicted women tend to have a much younger age of onset. Conclusions: Restless legs syndrome significantly aggregated in families with variable phenotypic expressivity, and the siblings of severely affected individuals have an increased risk of developing the disease. ©2010 American Medical Association.

AB  - The first step in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to identify, and if possible to treat any condition which might cause or worsen RLS, such as iron deficiency or some drug treatments.The patients suffering from RLS should be prompted to keep a healthy sleep schedule.Drug treatment should be restricted to patients with a clear clinical diagnosis, decided on an individual basis, when the clinical impact is serious.Four drug classes are central to the treatment of RLS: dopaminergic agents, some antiepileptics, opioids, and benzodiazepines.Dopaminergic agonists are the treatment of choice, especially when daily treatment is indicated, or if the symptoms are severe. Two dopaminergic agonists are licensed in France for the treatment of RLS: ropinirole (Adartrel®) and pramipexole (Sifrol®).After initiation of treatment, the patients should benefit from a regular follow-up in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to identify possible side-effects. Special care should be given to the detection of augmentation, a phenomenon characterized by a paradoxical worsening of the symptoms with treatment. Some particular conditions, such as RLS comorbid with renal insufficiency, during pregnancy, and in the child are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Three hundred-forty-eight out of a regional population of 1272 newborn infants were randomly chosen and followed neurologically until age of two years to study the epidemiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, and to reveal the main factors influencing outcome. The most frequent neonatal pathologies were low Apgar scores - 45 (3.5%), neonatal sepsis - 28 (2.2%), neonatal seizures - 26 (2.0%), neonatal sepsis complicated with bacterial meningitis - 13 (1.0%), traumatic injury of peripheral nerves - 7 (0.6%), intracranial hemorrhages - 4 (0.3%) and CNS malformations - 3 (0.2%). At the age of 24 months abnormal development was identified in 29 cases (8.5%) of children, comprising global developmental delay in five (1.5%), unclassified motor problems (hypotonia without ataxia) in four (1.2%), cerebral palsy in three (0.9%), behavioral/sleep disorders in 12 (3.5%) and epilepsy in five (1.5%). The most significant single risk factors for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome were maternal age, chorioamnionitis, gestational age <37 weeks, pathological delivery, and a low (<5) Apgar score at 5 min after birth. Coexistence of several risk factors increased the probability of an adverse outcome. © 2009 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

AB  - Traditionally, male contraception has consisted of either barrier methods, such as condoms, or vasectomy. However, in recent years, we have made great strides in the basic science and clinical medicine to better understand the feedback mechanisms and physiology of the male reproductive system. These advances have enabled the development of several nonsurgical, hormonal, reversible, well-tolerated alternatives for male contraception. Men are more likely now than ever to participate in the choice of contraceptive techniques. This review will discuss the current status and recent developments in nonsurgical hormonal male contraception, a field that has been historically limited by social, financial and physiological challenges. © 2010 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

AB  - We describe a 18-year-old female with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome characterized by an alteration of SHANK3/PROSAP2 and severe mental retardation, intense psychomotor agitation and aggressive behaviour. When the patient was given risperidone, different therapeutic results were observed: at a 6. mg dose, risperidone had no therapeutic effect and the patient's behavioural problems increased; at a low dose (1. mg), risperidone treatment resulted in rapid improvement of mood and behaviour. Recent findings suggest that risperidone exerts dose-dependent effects on Glu receptors in developing rats. An altered preset of the glutamate receptors, due to the presence of a haploinsufficiency of SHANK3/PROSAP2, could explain the different results of risperidone therapy observed in our patient with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Following the pioneering work of C. Dreyfus-Brisac and N. Monod, research into neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) has developed tremendously in France. French neurophysiologists who had been trained in Paris (France) collaborated on a joint project on the introduction, development, and currently available neonatal EEG recording techniques. They assessed the analytical criteria for the different maturational stages and standardized neonatal EEG terminology on the basis of the large amount of data available in the French and the English literature. The results of their work were presented in 1999. Since the first edition, technology has moved towards the widespread use of digitized recordings. Although the data obtained with analog recordings can be applied to digitized EEG tracings, the present edition, including new published data, is illustrated with digitized recordings. Herein, the reader can find a comprehensive description of EEG features and neonatal behavioural states at different gestational ages, and also a definition of the main aspects and patterns of both pathological and normal EEGs, presented in glossary form. In both sections, numerous illustrations have been provided. This precise neonatal EEG terminology should improve homogeneity in the analysis of neonatal EEG recordings, and facilitate the setting up of multicentric studies on certain aspects of normal EEG recordings and various pathological patterns. À la suite des travaux pionniers de C. Dreyfus-Brisac et N. Monod, une école d'EEG néonatal s'est développée en France. Des neurophysiologistes français issus de cette formation ont collaboré à la rédaction d'une mise au point, publiée en 1999, sur la naissance et l'évolution de la technique d'enregistrement de l'électroencéphalogramme en néonatalogie. Ils ont aussi fait la synthèse des critères d'analyse des différents stades maturatifs et précisé la terminologie de l'EEG néonatal à partir des nombreuses données de la littérature francophone et anglophone. Depuis la première édition, la technologie a évolué et la numérisation des enregistrements est très largement utilisée. Bien que les données obtenues à l'aide des enregistrements analogiques puissent être appliquées aux enregistrements numérisés, cette nouvelle édition, qui rapporte aussi les données publiées récemment, est illustrée à l'aide d'enregistrements numérisés. Le lecteur pourra trouver dans cet ouvrage la description des aspects électroencéphalographiques et des états de vigilance du nouveau-né selon l'âge gestationnel, mais aussi la définition des principaux aspects et figures EEG normaux et pathologiques rassemblés sous la forme d'un glossaire. Ces deux chapitres sont étayés d'une abondante iconographie. Une terminologie EEG précise en néonatalogie devrait aussi améliorer l'harmonisation dans l'analyse des tracés et faciliter la réalisation d'études multicentriques sur certains aspects de l'EEG normal ou lors de différentes pathologies. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Migraine is a very common disorder characterized by the combination of typical headache with associated autonomic symptoms and/or the presence of aura. Considerable advances have been made in recent years to understand the pathophysiology of migraine, which has led to improved treatment options for the acute migraine attack as well as migraine prophylaxis. Unfortunately, preventive treatment is often insufficient to decrease migraine frequency substantially or is not well tolerated. Topiramate is an antipileptic drug with a complex mode of action which has proven its efficacy and safety in the prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine in a number of randomized controlled clinical trials. Topiramate is also effective in treating patients with chronic migraine. It has little pharmacological interaction with other drugs and is generally well tolerated by patients. © 2010 Naegel and Obermann, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes. © 2010 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - A number of mammals undergo hibernation during their lifespan. The euthermal condition that occurs prior to hibernation is characterized by inhibition of cellular proliferation, reduction of stress reactivity, a decrease in metabolism, and changes in the immune system (seasonal thymus involution). Analysis of data of young red voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), common shrews (Sorex araneus), and fat dormice (Glis glis) while entering into the euthermal condition shows characteristic biphasic growth with a delay that can vary in its periods. A biological mechanism for reversible growth arrest effectively "stops the clock" of these animals. It is suspected that this mechanism is triggered by an increase in somatostatin synthesis with inhibition of growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and melatonin, and with a loss of circadian function in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The mechanisms linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with adulthood obesity and diabetes are unclear. These studies investigated energy homeostasis in 8- and 20-wk-old male and female mice subjected to protein deficiency in utero. Pregnant C57BL/6J female mice were fed a protein-deficient diet (6% protein). Undernourished offspring (UO) and controls (CO) were cross-fostered to lactating dams fed a 20% control diet. The 24-h profiles of energy expenditure, feeding behavior, physical activity, and whole-body substrate preference was assessed using 8-wk UO and CO weaned onto control diet. Blood chemistries, glucose tolerance,andexpression of genes involved in hepatic lipidand glucose metabolism were analyzed in 8- and 20-wk-old CO and UO fed control or a high-fat diet. UO exhibited IUGR with catch-up growth at 8wk of age and increased severity of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by 20 wk of age. Therefore, fetal malnutrition in the C57BL/6J mouse increases sensitivity to diet-induced obesity. Abnormal daily rhythms in food intake and metabolism, increased lipogenesis, and inflammation preceded obesity in the UO group. Arrhythmic expression of circadian oscillator genes was evident in brain, liver, and muscle of UO at 8 and 20 wk of age. Expression of the clock-associated nuclear receptor and transcription repressor Rev-erbα was reduced in liver and muscle of UO. Altered circadian physiology may be symptomatic of the metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR, and altered feeding behavior and substrate metabolism may contribute to the obese phenotype.

AB  - Oxidative stress is implicated as one of the key causes underlying many diseases. Free radicals are important constituents of basal physiology. Assessment of free radicals or the end products of their action has proved to be difficult. Consequently, authentication of the contribution of free radicals to physiology and pathology has usually been equivocal. Isoprostanes are biosynthesized in vivo, predominantly through free radical attack on arachidonic acid and are now regarded as robust biomarkers of oxidative stress in vivo. Isoprostanes are associated with many human diseases, and their concentration is altered over the course of normal human pregnancy, but their (patho)physiological roles have not yet been clearly defined. Measurement of F2-isoprostanes in body fluids could offer a unique analytical opportunity to study the role of free radicals in physiology and pathophysiology in order to comprehend both oxidative strain and oxidative stress. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using daily diary methods, mothers of adolescents and adults with ASD (n = 86) were contrasted with a nationally representative comparison group of mothers of similarly-aged unaffected children (n = 171) with respect to the diurnal rhythm of cortisol. Mothers of adolescents and adults with ASD were found to have significantly lower levels of cortisol throughout the day. Within the ASD sample, the son or daughter's history of behavior problems interacted with daily behavior problems to predict the morning rise of the mother's cortisol. A history of elevated behavior problems moderated the effect of behavior problems the day before on maternal cortisol level. Implications for interventions for both the mother and the individual with ASD are suggested. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Background: First-generation H1-antihistamines obtained without prescription are the most frequent form of self-medication for allergic diseases, coughs and colds and insomnia even though they have potentially dangerous unwanted effects which are not recognized by the general public. Aims: To increase consumer protection by bringing to the attention of regulatory authorities, physicians and the general public the potential dangers of the indiscriminate use first-generation H1-antihistamines purchased over-the counter in the absence of appropriate medical supervision. Methods: A GA2LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network) task force assessed the unwanted side-effects and potential dangers of first-generation H1-antihistamines by reviewing the literature (Medline and Embase) and performing a media audit of US coverage from 1996 to 2008 of accidents and fatal adverse events in which these drugs were implicated. Results: First-generation H1-antihistamines, all of which are sedating, are generally regarded as safe by laypersons and healthcare professionals because of their long-standing use. However, they reduce rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep, impair learning and reduce work efficiency. They are implicated in civil aviation, motor vehicle and boating accidents, deaths as a result of accidental or intentional overdosing in infants and young children and suicide in teenagers and adults. Some exhibit cardiotoxicity in overdose. Conclusions: This review raises the issue of better consumer protection by recommending that older first-generation H1-antihistamines should no longer be available over-the-counter as prescription- free drugs for self-medication of allergic and other diseases now that newer second- generation nonsedating H 1-antihistamines with superior risk/benefit ratios are widely available at competitive prices. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

AB  - Small endotherms must change roosting and thermoregulatory behaviour in response to changes in ambient conditions if they are to achieve positive energy balance. In social species, for example many bats, energy expenditure is influenced by environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature, and also by social thermoregulation. Direct measurements of daily fluctuations in metabolic rates in response to ambient and behavioural variables in the field have not been technologically feasible until recently. During different reproductive periods, we investigated the relationships between ambient temperature, group size and energy expenditure in wild maternity colonies of Bechstein's bats (Myotis bechsteinii). Bats used behavioural and physiological adjustments to regulate energy expenditure. Whether bats maintained normothermia or used torpor, the number of bats in the roosts as well changed with reproductive status and ambient temperature. During pregnancy and lactation, bats remained mostly normothermic and daily group sizes were relatively large, presumably to participate in the energetic benefits of social thermoregulation. In contrast, smaller groups were formed on days when bats used torpor, which occurred mostly during the post-lactation period. Thus, we were able to demonstrate on wild animals under natural conditions the significance of behavioural and physiological flexibility for optimal thermoregulatory behaviour in small endotherms. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Sleep duration in the population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women's daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this experimental pilot study was to measure the effects of a mindfulness-based yoga intervention on sleep in pregnant women. Methods: Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. Results: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention. Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. Conclusions: Mindful yoga shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - The prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is low in the general population in Turkey. To assess the prevalence of RLS in pregnancy, a hospital-based survey assessing symptoms of RLS and other sleep problems was performed through face-to-face interviews and physical examination on 983 pregnant women from 11 hospitals in the two urban and four suburban areas of Kayseri, Turkey, at the time of delivery and 6 months after delivery. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International RLS Study Group. A total of 103 women reported the occurrence of RLS symptoms during pregnancy, giving an RLS prevalence rate of 10.48%, with presence of symptoms more than three times per month, which decreased to 2.9% after 6 months. A significant relationship was observed between RLS and the number of previous pregnancies: women who had one child were compared with women who had 2-3 children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.441, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.894-2.324), and women who had ≥4 children (OR = 2.530, 95% CI, 1.377-4.650). Patients with and without the RLS syndrome were similar in respect to distributions of age, income level, career, iron and folate therapy, sleep habits, and sleep problems. The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women is low, like the low prevalence in the general population in Eastern European and/or Asian populations. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Study Objectives: This study investigated whether there was a relationship between disrupted sleep and postpartum mood disturbances in women during the week after delivery. Design: Sleep and mood were measured during the third trimester (Time-1) and one week postpartum (Time-2) in a 2-stage longitudinal design. Setting: Participants were recruited from an antenatal clinic in a regional Melbourne hospital. Participants: Forty-four healthy women at low risk for postpartum depression. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy and subjective sleep by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; mood was assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Sleep and mood questionnaires were administered at Time-1 and Time-2. Wrist actigraphy was collected for one week at both times. After delivery, both objective and subjective nighttime sleep significantly worsened with decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, while daytime napping behavior significantly increased. On average, mood improved across all scales after delivery, although 45.95% of the sample experienced deterioration of mood. Regression analyses showed little relationship between Time-1 and Time-2 objective nighttime sleep, and postpartum mood. Variables that related to both Time-1 and Time-2 subjective perception of sleep, including subjective nighttime sleep, sleep-related daytime dysfunction, and daytime napping behavior, were significant predictors of postpartum mood. Conclusions: The perception of poor sleep, and the conscious awareness of its impact during wake-time, might share a stronger relationship with the occurrence of immediate postpartum mood disturbances than actual sleep quality and quantity.

AB  - Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are of increasing use in pregnant women, but their long-term effects on the child are largely unknown. On the basis of our recent experimental data in mice, our hypothesis is that in utero SSRI treatment will induce life-long sleep alterations through the hyper-activation of 5-HT1A receptors during the prenatal period. The demonstration of such a mechanism could open the way to novel pharmacological issues for the treatment of depression during pregnancy. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - During pregnancy, physiological changes occur that can potentially compromise the respiratory system by increasing the incidence and the severity of sleep-disordered breathing. The main change is the increased incidence of snoring (11 to 47% depending on the series) which is seen more often in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension complicated or not by pre-eclampsia. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of the main symptoms of the sleep apnea syndrome (which comprise snoring) during pregnancy and secondarily to seek a link with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Thus, we performed a prospective study on 144 women who responded to a predetermined questionnaire 24 hours after giving birth in a maternity. Results: One hundred and thirty women had a normal pregnancy and 14 a pathological one (pregnancy induced hypertension and/or pre-eclampsia). The mean age was 27.2 ± 4.7 years and the Epworth score was 7.6 ± 1.8. Snoring occurred in 48.6% of the patients while 75% of them did not snore before pregnancy. The Epworth score was increased in the snoring population (10.0 ± 1.34). In the group with pregnancy-induced hypertension, 78.5% of the patients snored (p = 0.0001), the Epworth score was 11,57 ± 1,55 (p = 0,0001) and 28.6% reported breathing pauses (p = 0.018). Conclusion: The symptoms of the sleep apnea syndrome appear frequent during pregnancy and seem to be correlated with the pregnancy-induced hypertension. The results underline the relevancy of polysomnographic recordings to support the diagnosis and to develop a treatment that will prevent the pathology. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objectives: To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry) newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born to abstainers (n = 14) or light (≤0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers (controls). Methods: Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least 1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Results: There were no between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group. Conclusions: Both cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress reactivity measures suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns. This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

AB  - Aim: To determine the effect of physical activity and psychosocial stress on low birthweight (LBW). Methods: A prospective study was carried out in a district of Sri Lanka between May 2001 and April 2002. A total of 885 pregnant mothers were recruited at ≤16 weeks of gestation and followed up until partus. Trimester-specific exposure statuses along with potential confounding factors were gathered on average at the 12th, 28th, and 36th weeks of gestation. Physical activities were assessed by inquiring about the duration of specific postures adopted per day by housewives during each trimester at home and both at home and during working hours for those who were engaged in paid employment. Psychosocial stress was assessed using the Modified Life Events Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire 30. LBW was defined as a birthweight of less than 2500 g. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied for controlling confounders and the results were expressed as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: Standing &gt; 2.5 h/day (OR 2.26; 95%CI 1.10, 4.69) during the second trimester and sleeping 8 h or less/day (OR 2.84; 95%CI 1.49, 5.40) either during the second, third or both trimesters together, an increase in maternal age in years (OR 0.92; 95%CI 0.87, 0.98), and body mass index &lt; 19.8 kg/m2 (OR 2.2; 95%CI 1.17, 4.22) had a statistically significant association with LBW. Psychosocial stress was not associated with LBW. Conclusions: Standing &gt; 2.5 h/day and sleeping ≤8 h/day were risk factors for LBW, whereas psychosocial stress was not. © 2010 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - Cluster headache (CH) is a neurovascular headache syndrome characterized by headache attacks that occur with a circadian and circannual periodicity. The calculated prevalence of CH in reproductive-aged women is 7.5 of 100,000 women. Although data suggest that CH during pregnancy is a relatively rare condition, when it does occur, attacks remain unchanged in character and severity in the majority of patients. Thus, treatment of CH in pregnant and lactating women may remain a significant therapeutic challenge. This manuscript briefly reviews the epidemiology of CH in women, and then focuses on treatment options for both acute and preventative management of CH in pregnant and lactating women. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - Treatment of mood disorders in pregnant or nursing women can carry significant risks for the mother and the developing infant. For patients and physicians, it may be difficult to obtain current information to make the proper decisions regarding pharmacologic and alternative treatments. Thus, this paper discusses the risks and benefits of pharmacologic treatment and the risks of not treating depression and bipolar disorder in the pregnant woman. The safety of treatment options is reviewed. Alternative treatment options are also discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - Background: Perinatal anxiety and depression constitute one of the long term major public health issues in Australia and for too long they has been bundled under the over-arching term of 'postnatal depression'. However, the generation, funding, and implementation of the National Perinatal Depression Plan (NPDP) (Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, 2008), across all Australian States and Territories, are proving to be wide-reaching and influential. Not only does the NDPD move from the umbrella term of 'postnatal depression' to establish the reality of perinatal anxiety and depression which women can experience from conception to the first year of the infant's life but also all States and Territories have made Individual Investment Plans for the implementation of the NPDP. Implementation: In these Investment Plans, each State and Territory will address the following three major goals of the NPDP differently and mainly within a primary health care setting: (1) Psychosocial assessment in addition to screening of women antenatally and postnatally; (2) Education of health professionals about the complexity of perinatal depression and the need for early assessment and intervention; (3) Development of quality pathways of care for follow-up support and care of women who are depressed and who are assessed as being at the risk for depression. Implications for nurses and midwives: General nurses, maternal child health nurses, midwives, and mental health nurses are spread throughout primary health care settings. Three essential aspects of the NPDP are pertinent to their practice: (1) the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); the 2008 beyondblue National Action Plan for Perinatal Mental Health (NAP); and the Draft beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines for depression and related disorders - anxiety, bipolar disorder, and puerperal psychosis - in the perinatal period (March 2010). The author addresses these three aspects of the NPDP by citing two personal accounts by women who have experienced perinatal anxiety and depression; these accounts are available in the public domain. © 1992-2011 eContent Management.

AB  - Objective: Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs a malaria control project in Bo and Pujehun districts (population 158 000) that includes the mass distribution, routine delivery and demonstration of correct use of free, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). In 2006/2007, around 65 000 LLINs were distributed. The aim of this follow-up study was to measure LLIN usage and ownership in the project area. Methods: Heads of 900 randomly selected households in 30 clusters were interviewed, using a standardized questionnaire, about household use of LLINs. The condition of any LLIN was physically assessed. Results: Of the 900 households reported, 83.4% owning at least one LLIN. Of the 16.6% without an LLIN, 91.9% had not participated in the MSF mass distribution. In 94.1% of the households reporting LLINs, the nets were observed hanging correctly over the beds. Of the 1135 hanging LLINs, 75.2% had no holes or 10 or fewer finger-size holes. The most common source of LLINs was MSF (75.2%). Of the 4997 household members, 67.2% reported sleeping under an LLIN the night before the study, including 76.8% of children under 5 years and 73.0% of pregnant women. Conclusion: Our results show that MSF achieved good usage with freely distributed LLINs. It is one of the few areas where results almost achieve the new targets set in 2005 by Roll Back Malaria to have at least 80% of pregnant women and children under 5 years using LLINs by 2010. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: To use radiation exposure rate measurements to determine patient-specific radiation safety instructions with the aim of reducing unnecessary precaution times and to evaluate potential doses to members of the public. Methods and Materials: Radiation exposure rate measurements were obtained from 1279 patients with Stage T1-2 prostate cancer who underwent transperineal 125I or 103Pd seed implantation from January 1995 through July 2008. An algorithm was developed from these measurements to determine the required precaution times to maintain public effective doses below 50% of the limits for specific exposure situations. Results: The median air kerma rates at 30 cm from the anterior skin surface were 4.9 μGy/h (range: 0.1-31.5) for 125I and 1.5 μGy/h (range: 0.02-14.9) for 103Pd. The derived algorithms depended primarily on the half-life Tp, the measured exposure rate at 30 cm, and specific exposure situation factors. For the typical 103Pd patient, no radiation safety precautions are required. For the typical 125I patient, no precautions are required for coworkers, nonpregnant adults who do not sleep with the patient, or nonpregnant adults who sleep with the patient. Typical 125I patients should only avoid sleeping in the "spoon" position (i.e., in contact) with pregnant adults and avoid holding a child for long periods of time in the lap for about 2 months. Conclusions: The large number of cases available for this study permitted the development of an algorithm to simply determine patient-specific radiation safety instructions. The resulting precaution times are significantly less restrictive than those generally prescribed currently. © 2010 American Brachytherapy Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity. METHODS: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic motherchild pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother's reported child's race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. RESULTS: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy. CONCLIISIOiS: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life.

AB  - Pediatric solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients and their parents are often challenged to cope with new transplant regimens as well as common situations in the context of organ transplantation. Health care professionals will receive questions from parents and children regarding clinical transplant care as well as general pediatric concerns that seem unfamiliar to families now that their child has a transplant. The literature is limited in some areas of pediatric care after SOT, and there is little guidance for the health care practitioner. To help address gaps in the literature and provide guidance for health care professionals, this article reviews some of the most commonly asked questions regarding general care after SOT, parenting the child with a chronic illness, and growth and development. The answers provided stem from the literature in part but also the combined clinical experiences of transplant centers that over time have moved toward decreased limitations and full social integration. © 2010.

AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-L-iduronidase. MPS I has a chronic progressive evolution with multisystemic symptomatology and wide clinical variability, with its main manifestations in the skeletal, respiratory, cardiac and neurological systems. Until recently, therapeutic options for MPS I were limited to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe cases, and palliative care. Laronidase (Aldurazyme®, BioMarin/Genzyme, CA, USA), a synthetic variant of the human α-L-iduronidase, is a specific treatment for MPS I. Enzyme replacement therapy with intravenous infusion of laronidase aims to reduce and/or prevent the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (dermatan and heparan sulfate), which is probably the most important, although possibly not the only, cause of the clinical manifestations of MPS I. This article reviews the data published to date on the clinical indications and user experience of laronidase in patients with MPS I. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Background: The rising global prevalence of asthma and other allergic conditions has been linked to potential aetiological factors influencing the developing immune system. Objective: To investigate the prevalence and associated risk factors for wheeze and eczema in 1-year-old children in a birth cohort from Butajira, Ethiopia. Methods: In 2005/6, a population-based cohort of 1065 pregnant women was established. At 1 year of age, data on wheeze and eczema in the children were collected from the mother via an interview-administered questionnaire, along with numerous demographic and lifestyle factors. A stool sample was also obtained from the child for geohelminth analysis. Results: The prevalence of wheeze was 11.5% (103/899) and eczema 8.6% (77/899). Independent predictors of wheeze were maternal allergic history [adjusted OR (AOR)=3.00, 95% CI 1.23-7.36], paternal allergic history (AOR=2.59, 95% CI 1.08-6.25), increasing household size (P for trend=0.023; AOR=3.54, 95% CI 1.31-9.56 for 7+ vs. 1-3 individuals) and paracetamol use by the child (overall P<0.001; AOR 11.04, 95% CI 4.30-28.31 for 4+ tablets in past month vs. never). Factors independently associated with eczema were maternal allergic history (AOR=3.68, 95% CI 1.54-8.77), household size (overall P=0.035; AOR=0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.87 for 4-6 individuals relative to 1-3) and place of sleeping (overall P<0.001; AOR=0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.82 for floor vs. bed/platform). Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis that eczema in early life in these children is a manifestation of allergy, while wheezing is probably due to infection as well as allergy. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The objectives were to describe the association between body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), body composition and risk factors to metabolic diseases; observe the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and list the characteristics of overweight and obese women. Voluntaries (n=50; BMI=31±6; age=36±11 years old), were evaluated regarding clinical examination, anthropometrics measurements, samples of blood and urine, resting energy expenditure and food register. Phases in which they become obese in descending order: adulthood, pregnancy, adolescence, over 40 years old and after marriage. The odds to have one or more obese family members were 316%. They were anxious (60%), depressives (12%), compulsives (34%) and had sleep disturbance (32%). The odds to dyslipidemia was 28%, to hypertension was 25% and to glucose over 100 mg/dL 35%. They were in caloric deficit, but, nitrogen balance was positive. The metabolic syndrome was present in 25% of these women and was positively correlated with body fat indicators and age. The obesity of these women seems to be multifactorial with a family influence that could be caused by genetics and environment contributions. The emotional/physical balance should be influenced on this process.

AB  - Background: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is characterized by alveolar hypoventilation and autonomic dysregulation. Purpose: (1) To demonstrate the importance of PHOX2B testing in diagnosing and treating patients with CCHS, (2) to summarize recent advances in understanding how mutations in the PHOX2B gene lead to the CCHS phenotype, and (3) to provide an update on recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of patients with CCHS. Methods: Committee members were invited on the basis of their expertise in CCH Sand asked to review the current state of the science by independently completing literature searches. Consensus on recommendations was reached by agreement among members of the Committee. Results: A review of pertinent literature allowed for the development of a document that summarizes recent advances in understanding CCHS and expert interpretation of the evidence for management of affected patients. Conclusions: A PHOX2B mutation is required to confirm the diagnosis of CCHS. Knowledge of the specific PHOX2B mutation aids in anticipating the CCHS phenotype severity. Parents of patients with CCHS should be tested for PHOX2B mutations. Maintaining a high index of suspicion in cases of unexplained alveolar hypoventilation will likely identify a higher incidence of milder cases of CCHS. Recommended management options aimed toward maximizing safety and optimizing neurocognitive outcome include: (1) biannual then annual inhospital comprehensive evaluationwith (i)physiologic studies during awake and asleep states to assess ventilatory needs during varying levels of activity and concentration, in all stages of sleep, with spontaneous breathing, and with artificial ventilation, and to assess ventilatory responsiveness to physiologic challenges while awake and asleep, (ii) 72-hour Holter monitoring, (iii) echocardiogram, (iv) evaluation of ANS dysregulation across all organ systems affected by the ANS, and (v) formal neurocognitive assessment; (2) barium enema or manometry and/or full thickness rectal biopsy for patients with a history of constipation; and (3) imaging for neural crest tumors in individuals at greatest risk based on PHOX2B mutation.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in Taiwan.Design: Cross-sectional.Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 third-trimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale.Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0% for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0% for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3% to 36.0%) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women.Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression.Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder. © 2009 Sigma Theta Tau International.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to determine if duration of daily bull exposure influences length of postpartum anestrus in primiparous, anovular, suckled, beef cows. The null hypotheses were that intervals from calving or the start of bull exposure (D 0) to resumption of ovulatory activity (OA), and proportions of cows that resumed OA during the experiment does not differ among cows exposed to bulls for 0 h, 6 h, or 12 h daily, and that there is no relationship between the duration of bull exposure and interval to resumption of OA in cows exposed to bulls for 0 h, 6 h, or 12 h daily. At 51.5 ± 2.3 d (±SE) after calving, cows were assigned randomly to be exposed for 12 h (BE12; n = 15) or 6 h daily (BE6; n = 14) to bulls, or not exposed to bulls (NE; n = 10) for 45 d. Interval from calving or from D 0 to resumption of OA was shorter (P &lt; 0.05) and the proportion of cows that resumed OA during the experiment was greater (P &lt; 0.05) for BE12 than for NE cows. Interval from D 0 to resumption of OA did not differ (P &gt; 0.10) between BE6 cows and either BE12 or NE cows. However, interval from calving to resumption of OA was shorter (P &lt; 0.05) for BE6 than NE cows. The proportion of cows that resumed OA did not differ (P &gt; 0.10) between BE6 cows and BE12 cows; however, the proportion of cows that resumed OA during the experiment tended (P = 0.08) to be greater for BE6 cows than for NE cows. There was a linear relationship between intervals from calving (b1 = -7.64 d/h; P &lt; 0.05) and D 0 (b1 = -3.3 d/h; P &lt; 0.05) to resumption of OA and duration of daily bull exposure. Thus, the duration of bull-pheromone stimuli that cows perceive each day is related to when primiparous, postpartum, anestrous, suckled cows respond to this stimulus and undergo the physiological changes necessary to resume ovulatory activity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To study the normal ranges of sleep-wake cycles in normal fetuses. Materials and methods: A total of 600 fetal heart rate. (FHR) tracings were studied from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at a gestational age between 30 and 40 weeks with a 1-h recording. Two obstetricians interpreted all the FHR recordings independently. Results: The mean baseline FHR was 141.6. (7.6) beats/min. The median relative percentage time spent in a quiet state was 26%. (0-88.6). The median duration of time spent in a quiet state was 15.7 min. (0-53.2) within a 1-h recording. Both quiet and active states were established in 84% of cases. The number of FHR accelerations per hour in an active state increased with advancing gestational age, whereas the baseline FHR gradually decreased. Conclusions: Normal ranges of fetal sleep-wake cycles were established. Fetuses between 30 and 40 weeks had wide variations in the percentage of time spent in sleep-wake states.

AB  - Background: The article was designed to estimate the effect of active and passive household cigarette smoke exposure on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with asthma. Methods: We used a secondary observational analysis of pregnant women with mild and moderate-severe asthma enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study of asthma in pregnancy and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing inhaled beclomethasone and oral theophylline. A baseline questionnaire detailing smoking history and passive household smoke exposure was given to each patient. Smoking status was confirmed in the RCT using cotinine levels. Data on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected and analyzed with respect to self-reported tobacco smoke exposure. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson χ2 statistics were used to test for significance. Results: A total of 2,210 women were enrolled: 1,812 in the observational study and 398 in the RCT. Four hundred and eight (18%) women reported current active smoking. Of the nonsmokers, 790 (36%) women reported passive household smoke exposure. Active smoking was associated with more total symptomatic days (P&lt;.001) and nights of sleep disturbance (P&lt;.001). Among the newborns of active smokers, there was a greater risk of small for gestational age&lt; 10th percentile (P&lt;.001), and a lower mean birth weight (P&lt;.001). There were no differences in symptom exacerbation or outcome between nonsmokers with and without passive household cigarette smoke exposure. Conclusions: Among pregnant women with asthma, active but not passive smoking is associated with increased asthma symptoms and fetal growth abnormalities. © 2010 American College of Chest Physicians.

AB  - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology often encountered in neurologic practice. It produces nonlocalizing symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure and, when left untreated, can result in severe irreversible visual loss. It most commonly occurs in obese women of childbearing age, but it can also occur in children, men, nonobese adults, and older adults. Although it is frequently associated with obesity, it can be associated with other conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea and transverse cerebral venous sinus stenoses. Recent identification of subgroups at high risk for irreversible visual loss, including black patients, men, and patients with fulminant forms of IIH, help guide the optimal management and follow-up. Ongoing studies of venous anatomy and physiology in IIH patients, as well as a recently begun randomized clinical treatment trial, should provide further insight into this common yet poorly understood syndrome. © 2010 MedReviews®, LLC.

AB  - Background: Children who were born prematurely are at higher risk for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) compared to their same-age peers who were born fullterm. Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of SDB symptoms and effects on growth among preterm infants while they are still infants, with a goal of identifying risk factors to facilitate prevention and early intervention. Methods: The Louisville pediatric SDB risk survey was administered to the primary caretakers of prematurely born infants attending the Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic at West Virginia University Children's Hospital. Results: Participation was 100% among 173 consecutive patients invited to participate in the study. At 9.13 months corrected age, 8.1% of infants born at a mean of 31.6 weeks gestation were reported to snore ≥3 days/week, a rate consistent with diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing among older children. A composite of nine parent-reported symptoms was created based on factor analysis. Birth weight and size for gestational age at birth did not differ between snoring groups or correlate with the composite score. But a significant negative correlation between the composite risk for SDB score and current weight for adjusted age percentile score indicate that infants with higher SDB symptom profiles have lower weight for age (r = -.18, p = .028). Conclusions: SDB symptoms are detectable among infants born preterm, while they are still infants. Because of their preferential risk for SDB and its somatic consequences, a primary research goal should be description of the natural history of SDB and identification of modifiable risk factors and treatment options. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the involvement of peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity in the ventilatory pattern during sleep in preterm neonates exposed in utero to maternal smoking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral chemoreceptor activity was measured at thermoneutrality in neonates (postmenstrual age: 36.1± 1.2 weeks) born to nonsmoking (n=21) or smoking (n=16) mothers by performing a 30-second hyperoxic test during active and quiet sleep. Blood oxygen saturation, baseline ventilatory parameters, and central apnea were monitored. RESULTS: Prenatal smoking exposure did not modify baseline ventilation. It was interesting to note that prenatal smoking exposure decreased the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity during active sleep and increased the response time during quiet sleep. These changes could explain the increase in the time spent in apnea (both with and without blood oxygen desaturation) and in the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation found in neonates exposed to smoking in utero. The involvement of a change in the chemoreceptor function is supported by the fact that the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity was negatively correlated with the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation in the control group only. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that prenatal smoking exposure does not directly modify baseline ventilatory parameters in the neonate but has a negative impact on peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity. These alterations may increase the risk of sleep respiratory disorders, especially via apnea with desaturation. Copyright © 2010 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Introduction:Spontaneous abortion is the most common complication of pregnancy. However, the effects of abortion on mental health remain controversial. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between spontaneous abortion and general health outcomes. Methods: In this cohort study, the General health questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) were administered for 500 women in early stage of pregnancy referring to state clinics of Semnan city between 2007-2008. These women were fallowed afterwards on a monthly schedule. 98 abortions have occurred among these women who were once more fulfilling the GHQ-28 one month after abortion. Another 98 women were randomly selected from those who experienced no abortion until 20th week of gestational age to answer the GHQ-28 as control group. Statistical analyses were performed using t-test, Chi Square, Fisher exact tests and Logistic regression. Results: Mean (±SD) age in abortion group was 26.3±6.1, whereas in control group was 25.4±5.8 years, which were not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between two groups in their number of previous pregnancies, living children, previous abortions and education levels. Abortion has significant effect on incidence of somatic disorder (OR=34.7, P=0.027), anxiety and sleep disorder (OR=5.0, P=0.043), depression (OR=11.5, P=0.027) and general health condition after-abortion (OR=10.2, P&lt;0.001). While on the contrary, abortion did not have any significant effect on social function. GHQ-28 mean score in the case group before abortion and after abortion was 22.6 and 29.4 respectively. However, mean score in the control group was 22.5 and 21.5, respectively before and after 20th weeks of gestational age. Changes in mean health scores of two group were significant (P&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Psychological support of women with abortion for improve their quality of life is a necessity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal limb reduction defects may be caused by exposure to an external agent. The azole derivatives are used in the treatment of systemic and dermal mycoses. Their relative teratogenic risk is still controversial. CASES: We describe two newborns with severe limb defects who were exposed to high doses of oral (an unacceptable route) and/or intravaginal bifonazole during the entire first trimester of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Although only two cases are insufficient to establish a relationship, our data suggest that maternal intake of bifonazole in early pregnancy poses a risk of morphogenic malformations. The literature suggests several possible mechanisms. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Isolated submandibular sialadenitis is extremely rare in the neonatal period. All reported cases had predisposing factors such as prematurity, dehydration, anatomic deformities, calculi, and long-term oro-gastric tube feeding. Here, we present a case of neonatal isolated submandibular sialadenitis without any known risk factors and who was diagnosed later with hyperthyroidism secondary to maternal Graves' disease. Both sialadenitis and hyperthyroidism resolved with appropriate treatment. While both conditions are rare and important in neonatal emergency care, the possibility of neonatal hyperthyroidism should be explored in cases with isolated sialadenitis if there is no other risk factor. Possible mechanisms for this uncommon association are discussed. © Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology, Published by Galenos Publishing.

AB  - Newborn infants of smokers show symptoms of cardiovascular stress hyperreactivity. Persistent hyperreactivity could increase the risk of short-and/or long-term complications, such as hypertension. Here we determined whether incipient dysfunction in a smoker's infant persists or worsens with age, by comparing cardiovascular reflex function of control and tobacco-exposed infants longitudinally from birth to 1 year. We compared infants born at term to nonsmoking couples (controls; n=19) and mothers who smoked moderately (average consumption=15 cigarettes per day; n=17). All were tested at 1 to 3 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year during sleep. We recorded blood pressure and heart rate noninvasively during passive repositioning (60° head-up tilt). Tilting control infants raised blood pressure slightly above baseline at 1 week (+2%) and much more at 1 year (+10%). This trend was reversed in the tobacco-exposed cohort (+10% at 1 week but only +4% at 1 year). At 3 months and 1 year, the heart rate response of tobacco-exposed infants to tilt was also abnormal (highly exaggerated). Our study reveals that maternal smoking leads to long-lasting "reprogramming" of infant blood pressure control mechanisms. The underlying dysfunction in a smoker's infant could plausibly be a precursor or early marker of long-term susceptibility to complications, such as raised blood pressure.

AB  - Studies have shown that asthma in children is caused by environmental and genetic factors. In adult asthma, risk factors were less well recognized. Likewise, in Thailand, data in adult asthma is limited. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors, determine skin reactivities to allergens, and assess concomitant allergy among adult asthma in Phitsanulok, a major city in the lower northern Thailand. Five hundred and thirteen Naresuan University staff members and students completed 2 sets of questionnaires and underwent allergy skin prick tests. The first set of questionnaires was standardized Thai version of ISAAC questionnaire for identifying asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema. The second set was modified from ISAAC phase II questionnaire to identify asthma risk factors. Fif-ty-eight subjects (11.6%) were identified as having physician's diagnosed asthma and 89 subjects (17.7%) wheezed in the past 12 months. Among 89 subjects, 14.4% wheezed more than once a month, 45.6% had wheez-es interfering with sleep. Concomitant allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema among these asthma subjects were 82.5%, 67.9%, and 14.9%, respectively. Eighty seven point nine percent of asthmatic subjects had positive skin reactivities to at least one allergen. Two of the most common allergens were house dust mites and cockroaches. Maternal smoking during pregnancy, smoking among family members, and family history of allergy were statistically significant risks for developing asthma, while having a rice field around the residence represented a significant protective factor. In conclusion, high prevalence of asthma presented in Phitsanulok and many asth-matic subjects were partly controlled or uncontrolled. The environment such as a rice field could protect against asthma, however atopy and smoking exposure were significant risks for asthma development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the effect of labor on the risk and course of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) in term neonates from a contemporary, population-based cohort. METHODS: We analyzed perinatal characteristics of term singleton newborns (gestational age [GA] of ≥37 completed weeks) who were born between January 2001 and December 2005 in the federal states of Hesse and Saarland (Germany). TTN was diagnosed on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes. RESULTS: Of a total of 275 459 births, 239 971 fulfilled the inclusion criteria of GA of ≥37 completed weeks and singleton live birth. Among those, 13 346 term infants were admitted for neonatal care and 1423 were diagnosed as having TTN. The overall incidence of TTN was 5.9 cases per 1000 singleton live births in our study cohort. Elective cesarean section, low GA, male gender, and low birth weight were associated with TTN. The duration of oxygen supplementation for newborns with TTN was associated inversely with the duration of labor (r= -0.151; P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that TTN is strongly related to elective cesarean section and low GA. Furthermore, the absence of exposure to labor contractions is associated with increased risk and severe course of TTN at term, with longer duration of oxygen supplementation.

AB  - New medicines are launched, and for several years are protected by patent laws. Once the patent has expired, any pharmaceutical manufacturer may develop, register and sell a copy or 'generic' of the product. The generic medicine is manufactured without incurring the expenses of clinical research and development of the original product. Generic companies are required only to demonstrate that their product has the same bioavailability as the original product and is therefore 'bioequivalent'. Once a generic medicine is registered, the usually lower price may drive down the price of similar products. The availability of generic products, therefore, should allow for more cost-effective management of disease conditions. A number of generic medicines were launched in 2009, some of which were the first generics for the original product. The South African Medicines Control Council policy on generic substitution requires the pharmacist to inform the patient of the availability of a generic alternative and where the originator product has been prescribed, pharmacists should discuss the availability of these generics with their patients. Pharmacists, in turn, need to keep up to date with generic product launches to the market. This article discusses the first- or second-generic product launches in South Africa in 2009. Prices used as those from Mims November/December 2009 and are single exit price inclusive of VAT.

AB  - Aim and background: An important part of maternity service provision is the care provided by midwives in the immediate postpartum period. Evidence suggests that postpartum morbidity and its impact on women's health after childbirth is an area of genuine concern. In Western Australia there is limited information on women's postpartum health needs and/or the quality of midwifery care provided in hospital and at home. This paper describes Western Australian (WA) women's perceptions of midwifery care in the early postpartum period. Method: A cross-sectional, self report survey was used to describe the practical, emotional and informational support provided by midwives in the initial postpartum period. A questionnaire, specially designed for this population, was posted at 8 weeks postpartum to every woman with a registered live birth in WA between February and June 2006. Completed questionnaires were received from 2699 women. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t-tests and chi-squared. Results: Results indicate that overall, women were happy with most aspects of midwifery care related to practical advice and assistance in relation to baby care and their immediate physical recovery. Areas that received a less positive rating were related to providing consistent advice, availability of the midwife, emotional care and information on maternal health needs, immunisation and contraception. In general, first time mothers rated both the style and quality of care more negatively than multiparous women. There was a trend by women accessing private hospital care to rank their care less favourably. There were minimal differences noted between women in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Midwifery care at home was rated very positively and significantly better than hospital care (p ≤ 0.002). Conclusion: Although the majority of women in this study were satisfied with the components of physical care and information and assistance with infant feeding and sleep and settling provided in the short-term, there was less satisfaction with emotional care and preparation for life at home with a new baby. This study adds to our understandings of women's experiences of the early postnatal period and provides information on which to base improvements in postnatal care and maternity services in WA and across Australia. © 2009 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - In the ongoing effort to improve public health in France, schools have become a priority in recent years, after it emerged that France is the EU country where behavior-related mortality is highest (accidents, risk-taking, suicide, alcohol, smoking, lack of exercise). These harmful behaviors begin during adolescence but are conditioned by mental construction during early childhood. The current situation of health education in schools is worrying, for two reasons. First, there is no coherent doctrine. The concepts on which it is based have greatly evolved since 1975 (especially with the introduction of the Ottawa Charter for health promotion in 1986). We have simply accumulated different approaches rather than redefining our goals and adapting the available means accordingly. Second, the impact of health programs is not sufficiently evaluated. Circulars and guidelines have been written, studies have been conducted, but we have learned next to nothing from our failures and successes. In 2010, at a time when teacher training is being reconsidered - and thus also the school curriculum -it is crucial to clarify our objectives and to seek how to adapt to the current situation "on the ground". A series of French and international studies, including the OECD report (2009), are highly critical of the situation in France and show that further efforts are needed. While France devotes substantial resources to adolescent programs, those set aside for early childhood are totally inadequate. Yet sociological research, and advances in neuroscience, show that while physical and mental development is a continuous process from the womb to adulthood, the early years of life are critical. Intellectual stimulation during infancy used to be a role assumed by the family. Unfortunately, in contemporary France, many parents are unaware of their necessary contribution to their children's education, or are simply confused. Furthermore, France has become a heterogeneous country. The insecurity and marginalization of certain families can undermine the parents' mental health and thus that of their children. Differences in culture and lifestyle introduce specific health problems and make it difficult to develop a comprehensive strategy. A considerable effort is needed. We must educate and inform parents, starting from pregnancy, for example through obligatory antenatal courses to teach expectant mothers, and possibly their partners, that they must provide intellectual stimulation for their children, starting in the first weeks of life. The OECD report shows that French parents are among those who spend the least time with their children. There are multiple reasons for this alarming situation, which must be analyzed and remedied, notably by strengthening the partnership between parents and the directors of kindergartens and nurseries. Resistance must be overcome and the necessary structures created. The place of health during early childhood has considerably evolved. It used to be considered that, for small children, the main issue was physical health (vision, hearing, mobility, etc.). Today, the accent is increasingly placed on their psychosocial well-being. Nursery and kindergarten staff and teachers are best-placed to identify children with psychological problems, such as those who find it difficult to establish relationships with other children and to find playmates. Interventions are all the more effective the earlier they begin. Psychosomatic evaluation of children thus identified, by a pediatrician and child psychiatrist (or psychologist), must include an assessment of living conditions and individual needs. International comparisons show that French young people are among those most pessimistic about their future, those most likely to feel they are not integrated into society, and those who feel they have little way of influencing their future, thinking it depends above all on other people ; they feel that society is frozen, leaving them little opportunity for advancement. It is tempting to think that these attitudes are shaped by informy and early childhood experiences. The school curriculum must be appropriate for age, with the main objective of giving small children confidence in themselves and in their capacity to improve their own well-being. It must focus on the simplest functions and activities, such as sleep, diet, and physical education (among the countries included in the OECD survey, France is the country where physical education and sport are the least developed). Education must help young people to acquire social skills, to become aware of their emotions and those of other people, with all their differences. Role-play exercises in schools may be one way of developing this awareness. Teaching experience must be taken into account, through voluntary participation by schools and teachers (as successfully implemented in the "Hands-on" (Main à la Pâte") program); these studies must be backed up by the necessary means, and their results must be monitored and analyzed. Teacher education has a key role to play, in two respects: i) initial training in universities should include a Masters module in health education, whose contents should be harmonized; and ii) continuous training, which has a major impact and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. These two training courses must be coherent with each other, and the available resources must be compatible with the objectives. It should be recalled, as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, that the goals of health education, and of education in general, should apply to all. This implies a need to bring both flexibility and rigor to teaching methods and the school curriculum. It will require a partnership between parents and teachers, mother-child health structures, and pediatricians. Rational division of responsibilities for infants and young children between the State, local authorities, health facilities, medicosocial structures, and health professionals, including school physicians and nurses, should be able to provide the coordination necessary to deal with the more difficult situations.

AB  - Bright light therapy is a rapid and effective treatment. It has been demonstrated that the size of the effect is the same as with antidepressants of reference in seasonal affective disorders (first choice indication), but occurs sooner. The contraindications are rare and adverse events mild. It can be used in other different pathologies such as major depression, and many other disorders of the circadian rhythm (e.g. luteal phase dysphoric disorder = premenstrual dysphoric disorder, dementia, addiction and depression in children, pregnancy and old age), whether they are of primary or secondary origin. In this article we summarize the mode of action of bright light and data about efficacy and safety with regards to evidence-based medicine. Bright light therapy can also be viewed as an alternative to the pharmacological approach especially when this is of high risk, not tolerated or not accepted by the patient.

AB  - Changes in circadian rhythms of dROMs, Oxy-ads and SHp during reproductive stages were studied in Comisana ewes. Twelve ewes were divided in two equal groups. The experimental group consisted of ewes undergoing gestation and lactation following artificial insemination and the control group consisted of non-pregnant ewes. Blood samples were collected every 3 h over a 24 h period, 20 days before insemination, on days 100 and 140 of pregnancy, on days 10, 30 and 200 post-partum and during the dry period. In the control group, blood samples were collected on the same days and with the same procedures as those used for the experimental group. A significant effect of time on all parameters studied was observed in the experimental group. Daily rhythms of the parameters studied were observed in the control group in all experimental conditions, and in the experimental group during pre-pregnancy and dry periods. We conclude that the reproductive status of sheep affects oxidative stress markers in blood and their circadian rhythms. © 2010 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Task2 K+ channel expression in the central nervous system is surprisingly restricted to a few brainstem nuclei, including the retrotrapezoid (RTN) region. All Task2-positive RTN neurons were lost in mice bearing a Phox2b mutation that causes the human congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. In plethysmography, Task2-/- mice showed disturbed chemosensory function with hypersensitivity to low CO2 concentrations, leading to hyperventilation. Task2 probably is needed to stabilize the membrane potential of chemoreceptive cells. In addition, Task2-/- mice lost the long-term hypoxia-induced respiratory decrease whereas the acute carotid-body-mediated increase was maintained. The lack of anoxia-induced respiratory depression in the isolated brainstem - spinal cord preparation suggested a central origin of the phenotype. Task2 activation by reactive oxygen species generated during hypoxia could silence RTN neurons, thus contributing to respiratory depression. These data identify Task2 as a determinant of central O2 chemoreception and demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the activity of a small number of neurons located at the ventral medullary surface.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to identify the characteristics of sleep behaviors assessed from activity data among very low-birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants in comparison to full-term infants at the age of around 12 corrected months, due to the possibility that sleep behaviors of preterm infants may be different from those of full-term infants. Method: Cross-sectional study. Infant sleep measures were obtained through actigraphs (Micro-mini RC, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY), which were attached to the infants' ankles during a week-long period. The subjects were 14 preterm infants and 14 full-term infants in which the mean ages were 13.3 ± 2.1 corrected months and 12.3 ± 2.4 month, respectively. Results: Preterm infants showed significantly less sleep duration during nighttime than full-term infants. The mean activity score and ACTX (Activity Index: percentage minutes with more than 0 activity score) of preterm infants during nighttime were significantly higher than those of full-term infants. No significant differences in total sleep duration, daytime sleep duration, the number of night-wakings, and sleep efficiency were found between the two groups. Conclusion: Preterm infants slept less and had a larger percentage of less restful sleep during nighttime. The results indicated that prematurity at the time of birth remained throughout the developmental course of sleep behaviors among preterm infants at around the age of 12 corrected months. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent studies in rabbits suggest that insulin resistance and reduced brain insulin contribute to impaired baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) during pregnancy; however, the mechanisms are unknown. The rat model is ideal to investigate these mechanisms because much is known about rat brain baroreflex neurocircuitry and insulin receptor locations. However, it is unclear in rats whether pregnancy impairs the HR baroreflex or whether insulin resistance is involved. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that in rats pregnancy decreases HR baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and that this decrease is related to concurrent decreases in insulin sensitivity (IS). BRS was quantified before, during, and after pregnancy using complementary methods: 1) spontaneous BRS (sBRS) derived from sequence method analysis of telemetric, continuous arterial pressure recordings; and 2) maximal BRS of complete sigmoidal baroreflex relationships. IS was measured (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) to determine whether BRS and IS change in parallel. sBRS was reduced at midgestation [pregnancy day 10 (P10)], returned to nonpregnant (NP) levels on P18, and fell again at late gestation (P20) (sBRS in ms/mmHg: NP, 1.66 ± 0.04; P10, 1.17 ± 0.11; P18, 1.55 ± 0.12; P20, 1.31 ± 0.05; n = 5; P &lt; 0.05). Similar triphasic patterns were observed for both maximal BRS [in beats·min-1·mmHg-1: NP, 4.45 ± 0.52 (n = 10); P11-12, 2.76 ± 0.11 (n = 7); P17-18, 3.79 ± 0.14 (n = 5); P19-20, 2.32 ± 0.40 (n = 8); P &lt; 0.0001] and previous and current measurements of IS (in mg glucose·kg-1·min -1: NP, 32 ± 2; P19-20, 15 ± 1; P &lt; 0.0005). Furthermore, during pregnancy, the standard deviation (SD) of MAP increased, and the SD of HR decreased, indirectly suggesting baroreflex impairment. sBRS increased transiently during parturition, and sBRS, maximal BRS, and IS normalized 3-4 days postpartum. In conclusion, pregnancy decreases HR BRS in rats. The parallel temporal changes in BRS and IS suggest a mechanistic link.

AB  - Dysregulation of diurnal cortisol secretion patterns may explain the link between adversities early in life and later mental health problems. However, few studies have investigated the influence of social disadvantage and family adversity on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis early in life. In 366 infants aged 12-20 months from the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort from fetal life onwards, parents collected saliva samples from their infant at 5 moments over the course of 1 day. The area under the curve (AUC), the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and the diurnal cortisol slope were calculated as different composite measures of the diurnal cortisol rhythm. Information about social disadvantage and early adversity was collected using prenatal and postnatal questionnaires. We found that older infants showed lower AUC levels; moreover, infants with a positive CAR were significantly older. Both the AUC and the CAR were related to indicators of social disadvantage and early adversity. Infants of low income families, in comparison to high income families, showed higher AUC levels and a positive CAR. Infants of mothers who smoked during pregnancy were also significantly more likely to show a positive CAR. Furthermore, infants of mothers experiencing parenting stress showed higher AUC levels. The results of our study show that effects of social disadvantage and early adversity on the diurnal cortisol rhythm are already observable in infants. This may reflect the influence of early negative life events on early maturation of the HPA axis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects 11 per cent of pre-menopausal women though it often remains undetected. Women may present differently than men, and the classic findings of snoring, witnessed apnoeas and sleepiness may not be observed. Factors which predispose to OSA include polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, retromicrognathia, and hypothyroidism. OSA may contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction, depression, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Emerging evidence indicates that snoring and OSA increase during pregnancy. For normal women with normotensive, low-risk pregnancies the prevalence of OSA is very low. Among normotensive pregnant women with high risk pregnancies, the prevalence of OSA is high and is even higher among those with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia during pregnancy. Incident snoring, which is a marker for OSA, is associated with an increased risk of developing gestational hypertension. Recent studies indicate that OSA per se is an independent risk factor for gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and may contribute to other poor obstetrical outcomes. The diagnostic test of choice for OSA is a polysomnography with electroencephalogram. Milder degree of disease than what is usually considered clinically significant among men or non-pregnant women appears to be relevant for foetomaternal outcomes. There seems to be benefit for blood pressure control to treating even milder degrees of OSA with CPAP, both acutely and over the 9 months of pregnancy. Chronic hypertensive women should be strongly considered for diagnosis and treatment of OSA prior to or beginning as early as possible in pregnancy to help maintain blood pressure control. Increasing awareness of OSA among maternal health care providers is important given the potential benefits for pregnancy and other health-related outcomes associated with identification and treatment of OSA.

AB  - The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Premature rupture of membranes is a normal occurrence of labor and can occur before or after the onset of contractions. The clinical factors associated with premature rupture of membranes include: low socioeconomic status, low body mass index, prior preterm pregnancies, smoking, sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract, conization, cervical cerclage and amniocentesis. Objective: To evaluate whether prolonged release of the vaginal insert of PGE2 is superior to dinoprostone gel to achieve cervical ripening in patients with term pregnancy that occur with premature rupture of membranes. Material and method: Randomized clinical trial in the surgical unit of play in a period of 6 months, with an estimated sample of 50 patients was randomized by block table. After assessment confirming rupture of membranes, Bishop Score and meeting inclusion criteria, group A was applied PGE2 intracervical gel 0.5 mg with a maximum of 3 doses, every 6 hours. Group B was administered at vaginal insert of PGE2 single dose for 24 hours, the patient was left to sleep 30 minutes cardio toco-monitoring chart for at least 2 hours after application. Results: The average time to maturity was 310.59 minutes with a standard deviation of 198.7 and concluded that there was no significant difference between the onset of uterine activity and the onset of labor among the prolonged release dinoprostone and alternatives such as the gel cervical for cervical ripening. Conclusions: Either this is a good choice to ripen the cervix in patients with term pregnancy and premature rupture of membranes.

AB  - Background and Objective: Allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic urticaria (CU) are common diseases with symptoms that impair quality of life. Secondgeneration antihistamines (e.g. cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, loratadine and mizolastine) are recommended first-line treatment for both conditions; however, studies of clinically relevant differences among these agents are lacking. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of desloratadine 5mg once daily in four postmarketing surveillance studies in subjects with seasonal AR (SAR) or chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in real-world clinical practice settings. Methods: This programme of prospective surveillance studies was conducted in Germany between February 2001 and March 2002 in allergy; dermatology; ear, nose and throat; or general practice settings. Subjects (total number 77 880) were aged ≥12 years and met the requirements for treatment of SAR or CIU with desloratadine as outlined in the package insert. ll subjects received oral desloratadine 5mg once daily for a mean duration of up to 40.4 days. Adverse events (AEs) were reported throughout the studies; serious AEs were recorded for up to 30 days after treatment. Investigators and subjects both rated tolerability at the end of treatment. Symptom severity and sleep and daily activity impairment were evaluated at baseline and after treatment using 4-point scales (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). A post hoc subanalysis assessed desloratadine efficacy and onset of symptom relief in subjects who had received monotherapy with another secondgeneration antihistamine. Results: A total of 386 AEs were reported by 287 subjects (0.37%) in the four studies. The most commonly reported treatment-related AEs were fatigue (0.07%), headache (0.07%), dry mouth (0.04%) and nausea (0.03%). Tolerability was rated as excellent/good by 99.1% of investigators and 98.5% of subjects. Desloratadine therapy significantly reduced nasal and ocular symptom severity, itching and wheals, and sleep and activity disruption (p < 0.0001), as indicated by a reduction in mean total and individual symptom scores, and reported impairment of sleep and daily activities. The efficacy of desloratadine was rated as significantly greater by 59.4-88.0% of subjects who had previously received monotherapy with cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine or mizolastine (p < 0.01 for all). The percentage of subjects who rated onset of symptom relief with desloratadine as faster than previous treatment ranged from 51.6% to 82.4%. Conclusion: Desloratadine was safe, well tolerated and efficacious in this series of surveillance studies. A post hoc analysis of subjects who had received previous monotherapy with a second-generation antihistamine found that most subjects rated efficacy as higher than their previous treatment, with a faster onset of symptom relief. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by chronic anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, which can be associated with altered insulin action. Symptoms usually begin around menarche, but onset after puberty may also occur as a result of environmental modifiers such as weight gain. The consequences of PCOS extend beyond the reproductive axis; there is a substantial risk for development of metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities similar to the metabolic syndrome. Currently, the treatment is targeted to the patients primary complaint such as hirsutism, restoration of regular menses or pregnancy. Pharmacological agents available for the treatment of hirsutism include androgen suppressors and peripheral androgen blockers. Recently, our understanding of the role of insulin resistance has led to the use of insulin-sensitizing medications as first-choice therapy. In conjunction with weight reduction and exercise, a pharmacologic reduction in insulin levels by either metformin or thiazolidinediones ameliorates both hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Our aim was to examine the characteristics of EEG findings and epilepsy in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and the associated clinical and familial risk factors. Fifty-seven children (86% male) with ASD, mean age 82 ± 36.2 months, were included in the study. Thirty-nine (68.4%) children had the diagnosis of autism, 15 (26.3%) had Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and 3 (5.3%) had high-functioning autism. One hour of sleep and/or awake EEG recordings was obtained for each child. All patients were evaluated with respect to clinical and familial characteristics and with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The frequency of interictal epileptiform EEG abnormalities (IIEAs) was 24.6% (n = 14), and the frequency of epilepsy was 14.2% (n = 8). IIEAs were associated with a diagnosis of epilepsy (P = 0.0001), Childhood Autism Rating Scale Activity scores (P = 0.047), and a history of asthma and allergy (P = 0.044). Epilepsy was associated with a family history of epilepsy (P = 0.049) and psychiatric problems in the mother during pregnancy (P = 0.0026). Future studies with larger samples will help to clarify the possible associations of epilepsy/IIEAs with asthma/allergy, hyperactivity, and familial factors in ASD. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety-related disorders. These drugs target the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and increase serotonin signalling. Although chronic SSRI administration has few reported side effects, recent observations suggest that it could have long-term effects on neurodevelopment. First, 5-HTT is transiently expressed in many brain areas during development. Second, 5-HTT blockade during development causes wiring defects in these areas. These effects are seen most clearly in the sensory systems. Third, the behavioural effects of 5-HTT blockade during development are sometimes dramatically different from the effects of 5-HTT blockade during adulthood. Most of this evidence was collected from studies with 5-HTT knockout mice and rats. However, the phenotypes associated with low or high functioning 5-HTT alleles in humans can result from similar developmental alterations in 5-HT levels. Here, we review the existing evidence on the long-term effects of developmental SSRI exposure. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 1998, the American Medical Association Scientific Counsel wrote that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is "one of the best researched disorders in medicine". Since then, rapidly emerging research coupled with increased interest by clinicians and the public have advanced the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in patients of all ages. In treating patients with ADHD and their families, we hope that symptoms are reduced throughout the day leading to improved functioning, enhanced self-confidence, and better quality of life for all involved. Because of the volume of information, there is a need for clinicians to have rapid access to up to date reviews of clinically relevant information to assist in the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of ADHD and associated psychiatric comorbidities. For the clinician, satisfaction comes from playing an instrumental role in facilitating this optimal outcome. This educational review presents information in brief text and tables for quick reference for the busy practitioner. © MBL Communications Inc.

AB  - We studied the effects of adverse conditions such as constant light (LL) on the circadian rhythm of malate (MDH, EC 1.1.1.37) and lactate (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) dehydrogenase activities of the testes of male Wistar rats on postnatal day 28 (PN28), anxietylike behavior (elevated plus-maze test) at PN60 and sexual behavior at PN120. The rats were assigned to mother groups on day 10 of pregnancy: control (12-h light/dark), LL (light from day 10 to 21 of pregnancy), and LL+Mel (LL and sc injection to the mothers of a daily dose of melatonin, 1 mg/kg body weight at circadian time 12, from day 17 to 21 of pregnancy). LL offspring did not show circadian rhythms of MDH (N = 62) and LDH (N = 63) activities (cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher). They presented a 44.7% decrease in open-arm entries and a 67.9% decrease in time (plus-maze test, N = 15, P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test), an increase in mounting (94.4%), intromission (94.5%) and ejaculation (56.6%) latencies (N = 12, P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test) and lower numbers of these events (61, 59 and 73%, respectively; P < 0.01, N = 12) compared to controls. The offspring of the LL+Mel group presented MDH and LDH circadian rhythms (P < 0.05, N = 50, cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher), anxiety-like and sexual behaviors similar to control. These findings supported the importance of the melatonin signal and provide evidence for the protective effects of hormones on maternal programming during gestation. This protective action of melatonin is probably related to its entrainment capacity, favoring internal coupling of the fetal multioscillatory system.

AB  - The risk of depression in women is greatest during the child-bearing years. Considering that about 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, women may become pregnant while on antidepressants, may have their depression or anxiety relapse during pregnancy or postpartum, or may be unwell and untreated before and during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The impact of the symptoms of depression and anxiety can cause risk to the mother and also have a negative effect on child development. This presentation is intended to assist in understanding the impact of untreated maternal depression and anxiety on fetus, neonate, child and mother; to review the effects of fetal exposure to psychotropic medications (antidepressants); and to summarize general management of perinatal mood/anxiety disorders. © 2010 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medications administered into the epidural or intrathecal space for labor analgesia may demonstrate variable effects dependent on time of day, and this may affect clinical research trials investigating the pharmacology of specific drugs. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the effect of time of day of administration of intrathecal fentanyl and systemic hydromorphone labor analgesia from data collected as part of a randomized clinical trial examining the influence of analgesia method on labor outcome. METHODS: Six hundred ninety-two healthy parturients were randomized early in labor to receive combined spinal-epidural (intrathecal fentanyl 25 μg followed by a lidocaine and epinephrine containing epidural test dose) versus systemic (hydromorphone 1 mg IV and 1 mg IM) labor analgesia at first analgesia request. No further analgesics were administered until the patient requested additional analgesia (second analgesia request). Subjects were assigned to the daytime group (DAY) if initial analgesia (neuraxial or systemic) was administered between the hours of 07:01 and 23:00 and to the nighttime group (NIGHT) if it was administered between 23:01 and 07:00. Within each mode of analgesia study arm (neuraxial or systemic), the DAY and NIGHT groups were compared. The primary outcome variable was analgesia duration, defined as the time interval from administration of labor analgesia until the second analgesia request. Cervical dilation at first and second analgesia requests, pain score at first analgesia request, and average amount of pain between analgesia administration and second analgesia request were also compared between DAY and NIGHT groups. Rhythm analyses for duration of analgesia, cervical dilation, and pain scores were performed. RESULTS: There was no difference in the median duration of either neuraxial or systemic analgesia in DAY versus NIGHT subjects, and no harmonic variation was observed for analgesia duration. Rhythm analysis demonstrated a 24-h harmonic cycle for cervical dilation at first analgesia request with maximum values occurring near 17:00 and minimum values near 05:00, but the amplitude of the difference was very small. Rhythm analysis demonstrated a 24-h harmonic cycle with maximum values occurring near 22:00 and minimum values near 10:00 for the average amount of pain between analgesia administration and second analgesia request in neuraxial group patients, but amplitude was small. CONCLUSIONS: Time of day of administration did not seem to influence combined spinal-epidural or systemic labor analgesia duration under these study conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of analgesia from epidural administration of local anesthetics to parturients has been shown to follow a rhythmic pattern according to the time of drug administration. We studied whether there was a similar pattern after intrathecal administration of bupivacaine in parturients. In the course of the analysis, we came to believe that some data points coincident with provider shift changes were influenced by nonbiological, health care system factors, thus incorrectly suggesting a periodic signal in duration of labor analgesia. We developed graphical and analytical tools to help assess the influence of individual points on the chronobiological analysis. METHODS: Women with singleton term pregnancies in vertex presentation, cervical dilation 3 to 5 cm, pain score >50 mm (of 100 mm), and requesting labor analgesia were enrolled in this study. Patients received 2.5 mg of intrathecal bupivacaine in 2 mL using a combined spinal-epidural technique. Analgesia duration was the time from intrathecal injection until the first request for additional analgesia. The duration of analgesia was analyzed by visual inspection of the data, application of smoothing functions (Supersmoother; LOWESS and LOESS [locally weighted scatterplot smoothing functions]), analysis of variance, Cosinor (Chronos-Fit), Excel, and NONMEM (nonlinear mixed effect modeling). Confidence intervals (CIs) were determined by bootstrap analysis (1000 replications with replacement) using PLT Tools. RESULTS: Eighty-two women were included in the study. Examination of the raw data using 3 smoothing functions revealed a bimodal pattern, with a peak at approximately 0630 and a subsequent peak in the afternoon or evening, depending on the smoother. Analysis of variance did not identify any statistically significant difference between the duration of analgesia when intrathecal injection was given from midnight to 0600 compared with the duration of analgesia after intrathecal injection at other times. Chronos-Fit, Excel, and NONMEM produced identical results, with a mean duration of analgesia of 38.4 minutes (95% CI: 35.4-41.6 minutes), an 8-hour periodic waveform with an amplitude of 5.8 minutes (95% CI: 2.1-10.7 minutes), and a phase offset of 6.5 hours (95% CI: 5.4-8.0 hours) relative to midnight. The 8-hour periodic model did not reach statistical significance in 40% of bootstrap analyses, implying that statistical significance of the 8-hour periodic model was dependent on a subset of the data. Two data points before the change of shift at 0700 contributed most strongly to the statistical significance of the periodic waveform. Without these data points, there was no evidence of an 8-hour periodic waveform for intrathecal bupivacaine analgesia. CONCLUSION: Chronobiology includes the influence of external daily rhythms in the environment (e.g., nursing shifts) as well as human biological rhythms. We were able to distinguish the influence of an external rhythm by combining several novel analyses: (1) graphical presentation superimposing the raw data, external rhythms (e.g., nursing and anesthesia provider shifts), and smoothing functions; (2) graphical display of the contribution of each data point to the statistical significance; and (3) bootstrap analysis to identify whether the statistical significance was highly dependent on a data subset. These approaches suggested that 2 data points were likely artifacts of the change in nursing and anesthesia shifts. When these points were removed, there was no suggestion of biological rhythm in the duration of intrathecal bupivacaine analgesia. Copyright © 2010 International Anesthesia Research Society.

AB  - Fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) concentrations are reliable, non-invasive indices of physiological stress that provide insight into an animal's energetic and social demands. To better characterize the long-term stressors in adult members of a female-dominant, seasonally breeding species - the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) - we first validated fecal samples against serum samples and then examined the relationship between fGC concentrations and seasonal, social, demographic, genetic, and reproductive variables. Between 1999 and 2006, we collected 1386 fecal samples from 32 adult, semi-free-ranging animals of both sexes. In males and non-pregnant, non-lactating females, fGC concentrations were significantly elevated during the breeding season, specifically during periods surrounding known conceptions. Moreover, group composition (e.g., multi-male versus one-male) significantly predicted the fGC concentrations of males and females in all reproductive states. In particular, the social instability introduced by intra-male competition likely created a stressor for all animals. We found no relationship, however, between fGC and the sex, age, or heterozygosity of animals. In reproducing females, fGC concentrations were significantly greater during lactation than during the pre-breeding period. During pregnancy, fGC concentrations were elevated in mid-ranking dams, relative to dominant or subordinate dams, and significantly greater during the third trimester than during the first or second trimesters. Thus, in the absence of nutritional stressors, social dominance was a relatively poor predictor of fGC in this female-dominant species. Instead, the animals were maximally challenged by their social circumstances and reproductive events-males by competition for mating opportunities and females by late-term gestation and lactation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction The demand for oocyte donation (OD) has increased substantially over recent years. This has imposed the need for centers for assisted reproductive therapy (ART) to set up their own banks of donor eggs in order to meet the needs of patients participating in in vitro fertilization (IVF) programs. The main clinical indications for entering the donor egg program are premature ovarian failure, failed embryo implantations after several rounds of ART, and advanced maternal age. Premature ovarian failure is characterized by hyperandrogenic amenorrhea before 35 years of age. Women of advanced maternal age may decide to resort to OD because of low ovarian response after ovarian stimulation treatment. A further indication for OD is for patients with genetic abnormalities, in particular X-linked abnormalities such as Turner syndrome and gonadal dysgenesis. It is also important to highlight other factors that have resulted in changes in reproductive expectations, such as the changing role of women in society, their professional development, and their financial position in the household. In other words, women in the 21st century are delaying motherhood and this has detrimental implications for a successful natural pregnancy as their biological clocks do not stop. A high percentage of women complaining of infertility belongs to this older age group, 38-45 years of age, and are considered candidates for OD.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the contributions of central and peripheral leptin to hyperphagia in lactation. Lactating rats were mated at 7-8 weeks of age and housed singly with their litters. In experiment 1, food intakes were significantly (P<0.01) greater (350% on average) in lactation than in non-lactation throughout a day. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leptin levels remained constant despite plasma leptin levels being significantly (P<0.05) greater in non-lactation than in lactation. In experiment 2, CSF leptin levels were not altered by i.v. injections of leptin (0.2 and 0 .4 mg/kg body weight) despite that plasma leptin levels were dose dependently (P<0.01) increased. Moreover, i.v. administration of leptin significantly (P<0.05) decreased food intake in non-lactating rats but not in lactating rats. In experiment 3, nocturnal food intakeswere temporarily (P<0.05) reduced in non-lactating and lactating rats. I.c.v. administration of a leptin antagonist (15 μg) blocked the reductions of food intakes. I.c.v. administration of leptin (10 μg) significantly (P<0.05) decreased cumulative food intakes during 24 h in both the physiological states. In conclusion, this study has presented new evidence that the hyperphagia of lactating rats could be partly due to depressed sensitivity of neurons contacting blood leptin. In contrast, the responsiveness of leptin receptors contacting CSF leptin may not differ between non-lactating and lactating rats. Furthermore, the levels of CSF leptin remained constant independent of those of blood leptin. Therefore, the expression of hypothalamic leptin receptors contacting CSF could be involved in the difference in food intake between non-lactating and lactating rats. © 2010 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - Background: Previous studies indicate that children may experience disrupted cortisol secretion in child care. The extent to which this is a transient or long-term disruption is not known, as most studies have relied on cross-sectional designs, and age-heterogeneous small sample sizes. This study aims to (a) compare cortisol secretion measured at home and in child care at 2 and 3 years of age, (b) investigate cortisol changes from 2 to 3 years of age, (c) examine whether age at initiation of child care is associated with cortisol secretion, and (d) investigate whether cortisol secretion in child care is linked to behavioural problems. Methods: Saliva samples were collected in a cohort of children recruited at 2 years of age from a larger population sample composed of women seen for the first time during pregnancy. Saliva was sampled twice a day (morning and afternoon) over two consecutive days at home and in child care at 2 (n = 155) and 3 years of age (n = 116). Interviews regarding the familial socioeconomic background and child care history were conducted with the mothers. Results: At 2 years of age, children showed a flat diurnal cortisol pattern in child care and a decreasing pattern at home. At age 3 years, children showed decreasing patterns both at home and in child care. Also at 3 years, children with less child care experience (i.e., entry after 16 months) had higher cortisol levels in child care and lower levels at home. In contrast, those with more experience (i.e., entry prior to 8 months) had lower cortisol in child care and higher cortisol at home. Conclusion: The different patterns of diurnal secretion observed in child care as compared to home is transient for most children, diminishing as they get older, whereas home and child care overall levels later on may be influenced by the cumulated experience with child care. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of sleep disorders during pregnancy. To identify in which moment of gestation they occur and the different factors related to their appearance. People and method: Transverse prospective observational study, performed in the Hospital Virgen de la Luz of Cuenca from December 2006 to May 2008. A specific questionnaire was designed for the data collection of the above study. All the full term expectant mothers who attended the fetal pathophysiology consultation of the hospital during the months of April to July 2007 were included. Results: A total of 290 pregnant mothers have been studied, an 86.6% of the surveyed women referred changes in their sleeping patterns since they were pregnant. The sleeping disorder that showed most prevalence was the insomnia symptomatology: sleep wakefulness, nocturnal awakening and non-refreshing sleep. The symptomatology of the restless legs syndrome was the second most frequent: affecting 67%, followed by snoring which affected 50.7%, excessive diurnal somnolence to the 39% and sleeping apnea to 5.9%. These disorders appeared throughout the whole gestation period, being the third quarter the one of most prevalence. Relation among several sleep disorders and non-modifiable variables such as age and multiparity was observed; and others modifiable like sedentary lifestyle and overweight, as well as other disorders and habits related to sleep. Conclusions: Sleep disorders are very common in mothers to be. However, either women or doctors who treat them do not consider them as actual health problems.

AB  - Objective: To assess features of sleep among pregnant women. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of low-risk pregnant women in a tertiary perinatal centre (CHUS) in Eastern Townships, Quebec. Sleep was assessed during the second trimester (mean gestational age 16.1 ± 3.0 weeks) (T2) and third trimester (mean gestational age 27.5 ± 1.8 weeks) (T3) using a validated self-administered questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Scores in this index range from 0 to 21, representing the cumulative scoring of seven sleep components. Subjects with a score > 5 were identified as "poor sleepers." Descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses were performed. Results: Among 260 consenting women, 192 (73.6%) had a term delivery without any adverse outcome. There were no differences in sleep parameters between pregnancies with adverse outcome and without adverse outcome. Mean overall PSQI scores showed evidence of deterioration in sleep quality from T2 (5.26 ± 3.16) to T3 (6.73 ± 4.02; P < 0.01). This deterioration was displayed in five of seven sleep components (P < 0.01). Scores in the "poor sleeper" range were recorded by 36% of women in T2 and 56%, of women in T3 (P < 0.01). "Poor sleep" in T2 and T3 was associated with low or high weight gain (P < 0.01), annual family income < $40 000 (P = 0.03), and single motherhood (P < 0.01). There was a trend for a seasonal influence on sleep scores (P = 0.08). The only predictor of poor sleep using multivariate analysis was single motherhood (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Sleep is disturbed in early pregnancy and is worse in the third trimester. Interventions to improve sleep should be sought to optimize quality of life for pregnant women. © 2010 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances during pregnancy among healthy nulliparous women. Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study of healthy nulliparous women, recruited between 6 and 20 weeks of gestation, who completed a baseline sleep survey at enrollment with follow-up in the third trimester. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: Berlin Questionnaire for Sleep Disordered Breathing, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, National Institutes of Health/International Restless Legs Syndrome Question Set, Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Differences in sleep characteristics between the baseline and third trimester were compared using the paired t test or McNemar test for continuous or categorical data, respectively. Results: One hundred eighty-nine women completed both baseline and follow-up sleep surveys. The mean gestational age was 13.8 (±3.8) and 30.0 (±2.2) weeks at the first and second surveys, respectively. Compared with the baseline assessment, mean sleep duration was significantly shorter (7.4 [±1.2] hours compared with 7.0 [±1.3] hours, P<.001), and the proportion of patients who reported frequent snoring (at least three nights per week) was significantly greater (11% compared with 16.4%, P=.03) in the third trimester. The percentage of patients who met diagnostic criteria for restless leg syndrome increased from 17.5% at recruitment to 31.2% in the third trimester (P=.001). Overall poor sleep quality, as defined by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score greater than 5, became significantly more common as pregnancy progressed (39.0% compared with 53.5%, P=.001). CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are prevalent among healthy nulliparous women and increase significantly during pregnancy. © 2009 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common among pregnant women and safe treatments to improve sleep are needed. Generally, physical activity improves sleep, but studies are lacking on the associations of physical activity with sleep among pregnant women. Our aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association of various modes of physical activity and activity clusters with sleep quality and duration among 1259 pregnant women. Participants were recruited into the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study from prenatal clinics at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. Women self-reported sleep quality and duration and physical activity in the past week. We used cluster analysis to create seven physical activity profiles and multivariable logistic regression analysis, with adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, parity, self-rated general health, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Women with higher levels of occupational physical activity were more likely to report either short or normal sleep duration than longer duration. Women with higher levels of indoor household physical activity were less likely to report normal sleep duration than shorter duration. Women in the recreational-indoor household activity cluster were less likely than women in the inactivity cluster to report normal sleep duration as compared with longer duration. Our data suggest weak associations of physical activity with sleep duration and quality in late pregnancy. Physical activity is recommended to pregnant women for health benefits, yet more research is needed to understand if physical activity should be recommended for improving sleep. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Migraine has been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints among pregnant migraineurs. A cohort of 1,334 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. At the time of interview we ascertained participants' migraine diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration before and during early pregnancy, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during early pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress associated with a history of migraine. Approximately 19.4% of the cohort (n = 259) reported having a medical diagnosis of migraine prior to the study pregnancy. Compared with women without migraine, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CI) among migraineurs for short sleep duration before and during early pregnancy were 1.51 (1.09-2.09), and 1.57 (1.11-2.23), respectively. The corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration before and during pregnancy were 1.33 (0.77-2.31) and 1.31 (0.94-1.83), respectively. A modest and statistically insignificant association between migraine history and excessive daytime sleepiness in early pregnancy was noted (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.94-2.26). Migraineurs had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.52-2.76) and elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.06-2.31). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight migraineurs. These data support earlier research documenting increased risks of sleep disorders among migraineurs; and extends the literature to include pregnant women. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent migraine-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

AB  - Both obesity and excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy contribute to increased difficulties and risks of general and regional anesthesia techniques. In the pregnant woman, cardiovascular changes due to an increase in oxygen demand include increased cardiac output and blood volume expansion coupled with reduced systemic vascular resistance. Obstructive sleep apnea is not uncommon in the obese parturient, and these patients are at increased risk of systemic and pulmonary hypertension, and coronary artery disease. In the obese parturient there is a higher risk of other delivery and post-partum complications. Analgesia during the labour is demanded more often due to the more painful uterine contractions in obese patients. Spinal anesthesia is often used for elective Cesarean delivery. The peri-operative management of the mobidly obese (MO) parturient is associated with increased risks and difficulties hence demanding a multidisciplinary approach. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

AB  - Background: Physiological structure and hormonal changes in women during pregnancy may alter physical activity behavior and sleep quality, both of which are factors that influence the method of fetal delivery. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the relationships between physical activity, sleep quality, and unplanned cesarean section. Methods: This study employed a prospective and descriptive correlational design. A total of 184 pregnant women in their third trimester at 2 medical centers participated in the study. A 3-day physical activity scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to evaluate, respectively, physical activity-related energy expenditures and sleep quality. Results: Subjects had a comparatively low level of energy expenditure on physical activity and performed a lower than normal amount of moderate-to-heavy physical activity. Three-quarters (77.2%) of subjects had poor sleep quality, and 40.7% reported being unsatisfied with their sleep quality. The main cause of poor sleep quality was sleep disturbance. Using logistic regression, results indicated that the odds of undergoing cesarean section increased to 1.22 (95% CI = 1.01 -1.48) when sleep quality was "poor". By contrast, odds decreased to 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60-0.97) when physical activity energy expenditures rose. Conclusions / Implications for practice: Results support the need to obtain physical activity and sleep quality data on women during pregnancy. Appropriate assistance and health education are important during perinatal care to reduce the incidence of unplanned cesarean sections.

AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves episodic nocturnal apneas. Using polysomnography, we examined the predictive capacity of screening questionnaires (Berlin) in pregnancy. Incorporating simultaneous fetal heart rate monitoring (FHM), we examined the association of maternal apnea with FHM abnormalities. Study Design: We enrolled 100 pregnant women at 26-39 weeks of gestation with OSA screening and baseline data ascertainment who underwent polysomnography and FHM for ≥3 hours. The relationship between maternal characteristics, OSA, and FHM was explored with multivariate analyses that were controlled for potential confounders. Results: When compared with polysomnography, sensitivity and specificity by Berlin screening was 35% and 63.8%, respectively; the snoring component of the Berlin correlated better with oxygen desaturation &lt;95% (P = .003). Body mass index was a significant confounder (rs = 0.44; P &lt; .0001). No association was observed between FHM abnormalities and OSA parameters. Conclusion: In pregnancy, the Berlin questionnaire poorly predicts OSA. It is unclear whether fetal compromise during maternal apnea is a mechanism in OSA that is related to pregnancy outcome. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: We sought to evaluate the impact of short sleep duration (SSD) and frequent snoring (FS) on glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Study Design: We conducted a prospective cohort study of healthy nulliparas who participated in a sleep survey study. SSD was defined as <7 hours of sleep per night and FS, as snoring <3 nights per week. Outcomes included 1-hour oral glucose tolerance results and the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: A total of 189 women participated; 48% reported an SSD and 18.5% reported FS. SSD and FS were associated with higher oral glucose tolerance values: SSD (116 ± 31 vs 105 ± 23; P = .008) and FS (118 ± 34 vs 108 ± 25; P = .04). Both SSD (10.2% vs 1.1%; P = .008) and FS (14.3% vs 3.3%; P = .009) were associated with a higher incidence of GDM. Even after controlling for potential confounders, SSD and FS remained associated with GDM. Conclusion: SSD and FS are associated with glucose intolerance in pregnancy. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. Study Design: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. Results: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P < .05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P < .05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P > .05). Conclusion: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. Study Design: Women delivering between 2000-2008 with confirmed OSA in an academic center were included. Normal-weight and obese controls were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio. Maternal and neonatal morbidities were compared between the groups. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate maternal morbidity and preterm birth (PTB). Results: The analysis included 57 pregnancies complicated by OSA. Compared with normal-weight (n = 114) controls, OSA patients had more preeclampsia (PET) (19.3% vs 7.0%; P = .02) and PTB (29.8% vs 12.3%; P = .007). Controlling for comorbid conditions, OSA was associated with an increased risk of PTB (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-6.6), mostly secondary to PET (63%). Cesarean delivery (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.9-22.1) and OSA were associated with maternal morbidity (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-13.7). Conclusion: Pregnancies complicated by OSA are at increased risk for preeclampsia, medical complications, and indicated PTB. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A 6 month pregnant, 28 year-old patient comes to the sleep specialist consultation for an excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring and possible sleep apneas. She is overweight and has a history of pregnancy with preeclampsia, at the origin of a caesarean. Polysomnography finds an apnea/hypopnea index at 35 per hour, with a micro-arousal index at 40 per hour. Thus, continuous positive pressure (CPAP) therapy starts, the symptoms regress and the pregnancy ends without complication. Far from the birth, the control polysomnography without CPAP finds an apnea/hypopnea index at 18 per hour, with upper résistance airway syndrome. So, a treatment by mandibular advancement device is decided. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To review the evidence and provide recommendations for the counselling and management of obese parturients. Outcomes: Outcomes evaluated include the impact of maternal obesity on the provision of antenatal and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Evidence: Literature was retrieved through searches of Statistics Canada, Medline, and The Cochrane Library on the impact of obesity in pregnancy on antepartum and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, obstetrical anaesthesia, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to April 2009. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. Values: The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by the Maternal Fetal Medicine and Clinical Practice Obstetric Committees of the SOGC under the leadership of the principal authors, and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Benefits, Harms, and Costs: Implementation of the recommendations in this guideline should increase recognition of the issues clinicians need to be aware of when managing obese women in pregnancy, improve communication and consultation amongst the obstetrical care team, and encourage federal and provincial agencies to educate Canadians about the values of entering pregnancy with as healthy a weight as possible. Recommendations: 1. Periodic health examinations and other appointments for gynaecologic care prior to pregnancy offer ideal opportunities to raise the issue of weight loss before conception. Women should be encouraged to enter pregnancy with a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2, and ideally &lt; 25 kg/m2. (III-B)2. BMI should be calculated from pre-pregnancy height and weight. Those with a pre-pregnancy BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 are considered obese. This information can be helpful in counselling women about pregnancy risks associated with obesity. (II-2B)3. Obese pregnant women should receive counselling about weight gain, nutrition, and food choices. (II-2B). 4. Obese women should be advised that they are at risk for medical complications such as cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. Regular exercise during pregnancy may help to reduce some of these risks. (II-2B). 5. Obese women should be advised that their fetus is at an increased risk of congenital abnormalities, and appropriate screening should be done. (II-2B). 6. Obstetric care providers should take BMI into consideration when arranging for fetal anatomic assessment in the second trimester. Anatomic assessment at 20 to 22 weeks may be a better choice for the obese pregnant patient. (II-2B). 7. Obese pregnant women have an increased risk of Caesarean section, and the success of vaginal birth after Caesarean section is decreased. (II-2B). 8. Antenatal consultation with an anaesthesiologist should be considered to review analgesic options and to ensure a plan is in place should a regional anaesthetic be chosen. (III-B). 9. The risk of venous thromboembolism for each obese woman should be evaluated. In some clinical situations, consideration for thromboprophylaxis should be individualized. (III-B). © 2010 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - To investigate the relationship between sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) and preeclampsia and the possible pathogenesis of the latter. Twenty-five healthy pregnant women, 43 pregnant women with preeclampsia, and 27 with preeclampsia complicated by SAHS were enrolled in this study. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the lowest arterial oxygen saturation (LSaO2) were measured through a 7-hour polysomnography (PSG), and the maternal age, gestational age, body mass index and 24-hour urine protein were recorded. All the indexes except for the maternal age and gestational age showed significant differences between the 3 groups. The two groups of preeclampsia patients showed a significant difference in BMI from the control cases. Significant positive correlations of AHI to BMI, MAP and 24-hour urine protein were noted; LSaO2 was found to inversely correlate to BMI, MAP, and 24-hour urine protein. In spite of the significant correlation of BMI to the other indexes, we found that BMI was less important than AHI and LSaO2. SAHS may induce or aggravate preeclampsia. Greater attention should be given to the presence of SAHS in pregnant women with obesity, but obesity is not the predominant predisposing factor for preeclampsia.

AB  - Introduction: This article is a review of literature data concerning the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed pregnant women. Literature findings: The adverse effects for the foetus, the newborn and the child were evaluated. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy is of around 10 to 20% of the population of childbearing women. Depression is often misdiagnosed and underestimated in pregnant women. Starting a pharmacological treatment for depression in these women is not easy because data concerning the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy are still unclear. The non-treated pathology is associated with higher risk of maternal morbidity, including arterial hypertension, which could lead to preeclampsia or eclampsia, ideation and suicide attempts, and postpartum depression. Foetal development is also affected and adverse outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight, irritability, and sleep disorders are frequent. Pharmacological therapy is necessary when non-pharmacological treatment is insufficient. Suicide attempts and relapse of depression have been described when depressive women stopped their pharmacological treatment during pregnancy. Pregnant women diagnosed with depression must be treated. Selective SSRIs are now largely used in this pathology and have replaced tricyclic antidepressants because of fewer side effects. In general, drugs have a low teratogenic potential, only 4 to 5% of malformations are iatrogenic. Teratogenic risk is high between conception until the end of the second month of gestation. Safety of SSRIs treatment during pregnancy and potential risk for the foetus and newborn were unquestioned before publication, in the late 2005, of some alarming data concerning a possible teratogenic effect. Studies showed an increased risk for all congenital malformations with SSRIs and particularly with paroxetin. A few studies after 2005 have also found an association between prenatal exposure to SSRIs (especially paroxetin) and congenital malformations. However, other studies failed to demonstrate this association and the risk for cardiovascular malformations also does not seem to be significantly increased. Numerous studies in pregnant women have shown that SSRI treatments are associated with a significant increase of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy has been associated with a three-fold increased risk of neonatal behavioural syndrome, including signs of withdrawal or serotonin impregnation. Restlessness, poor tone, respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia were the most frequent signs. These symptoms occur during the first days of life and are usually brief and not serious. Recent studies have also documented an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and cases of cerebral haemorrhage have been described. Data concerning a possible effect on motor and cognitive development at school age in children prenatally exposed to SSRIs are limited. Discussion: Although a number of studies revealed that SSRIs are not teratogenic, some of them showed congenital malformations associated with use of these antidepressants; in particular an increased risk of cardiac defects with paroxetin. In practice, the potential risk implies that the decision to treat a pregnant woman with SSRIs (notably paroxetin) should be taken carefully; this means double-checking the diagnosis, the potential benefits, adverse effects and possible alternatives. Neonatal toxicity seems to be relatively frequent when SSRIs are prescribed during late pregnancy. For all depressed pregnant women, the severity of the depression must be taken into consideration before introducing a pharmacological treatment. When depressive women are already treated, studies have shown that antidepressants must be maintained during pregnancy to prevent relapse and suicide attempts. © 2009 L'Encéphale, Paris.

AB  - The respiratory drive increases in pregnancy, but as the arterial PCO2 falls, physiological central sleep apnoeas appear. The upper airway resistance increases and the diaphragm becomes elevated. A restrictive defect appears mainly due to the enlarged uterus and intraabdominal hypertension. The reduction in lung volume also leads to ventilation–perfusion mismatching and hypoxia. Ventilatory failure is most commonly seen in neuromuscular and skeletal disorders and obesity hypoventilation. It is important to identify high-risk patients before or early in pregnancy and to monitor their progress, particularly with respiratory sleep studies. There is limited clinical experience of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in this situation but it is capable of relieving ventilatory failure and enabling the foetus to be successfully delivered. There is insufficient evidence to compare different ventilatory modalities. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological sleep/wake disorder that is diagnosed according to clinical criteria proposed by the International RLS Study Group [1] (for the list of criteria see Chapter 46). RLS occurs frequently with an estimated prevalence of 2-10%in patients with a wide spectrumof complaints [2]. The essential criteria for RLS are found in both idiopathic (often familial) RLS with early onset and clinically similar secondary RLS associated with various conditions, including low serum ferritin levels, kidney failure, and pregnancy. In general, the course of this disorder is slowly progressive with age. In most patients with RLS, sleep disturbances and periodic limb movements (PLM) during sleep (PLMS) and wakefulness (PLMW) can be documented with overnight polysomnography. The firstline treatment for RLS includes dopaminergic agents, which are effective in low tomoderate doses. Higher doses of dopaminergic drugs may induce augmentation - a paradoxical worsening of symptoms - which forces one to reduce the dose or to switch to another drug. Alternative treatments here include opioids and anticonvulsants [3]. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - Definition, symptoms, and management Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder of the sleep/ wake cycle with the key feature being an urge tomove the legs. [1]. Four essential criteria for RLS, as well as supportive and associated diagnostic features, have been established by the International RLS Study Group (Table 46.1) [2]. With an estimated prevalence of 7- 9%, RLS is a very common sleep disorder [3]. Primary or idiopathic RLS is distinguished from secondary or symptomatic RLS which is associated with various conditions (e.g., iron deficiency, chronic kidney failure, and pregnancy) [4]. Two different phenotypes of RLS are defined on the basis of age at symptom onset: in patients with early-onset RLS, symptoms appear before the age of 45 years (possibly even before 30 years [5]) and they usually have a positive family history. Late-onset RLS starts after 45 years, often consists of a secondary form, shows a more rapid progression, and is often accompanied by neuropathy [2]. However, the two groups certainly overlap and are modified by genetic factors [4]. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - Universally, 50-70% pregnant women have experienced lower back pain (LBP). The pain can interfere with work, daily activities and sleep. Among various pain relief interventions, support garment such as the belt/binder is a common part of the treatment for LBP during pregnancy. However the effect of garment treatment on pain relief is inconclusive due to limited research evidence. Moreover, little studies have examined the design principles for the development of maternity support garments. This medical device has the potential to offer a safe, low cost, and easily accessible biomechanical solution for pregnant women with LBP. The researchers hypothesize that the mechanical properties in these garments can redistribute the fetal weight to diminish the spinal loading. This research project aims to establish design principles for the development of maternity support garment, and to evaluate the effect of a prototype garment in the relief of LBP during pregnancy. The research was conducted in three phases: Exploratory Phase, Developmental Phase, and Experimental Phase. The Exploratory Phase consisted of three parts: (1) A wearing trial to determine the factors that influence wearer's acceptability through evaluation of commercially-available maternity support garments; (2) A semi-structured interview to explore the psychological needs of pregnant women with LBP, their attitudes and expectations towards the use of support garment; and (3) A biomechanical study to measure the anthropometric changes during pregnancy. In the Developmental Phase, a prototype garment was developed based on the new knowledge of psychological considerations and biomechanical model. In the Experimental Phase, a clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of the prototype garment. The research deliverables not only improve back pain and quality of life, but will also impact on the future design of support garments. © 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Frequently occur emotional changes during pregnancy and postpartum. These changes can produce feelings of sadness, anxiety, or fear. In most women, these feelings called "maternity blues" or "baby blues" disappear quickly, if they do not disappear or worsen, they are catalogued as postpartum depression. Objective: To determine the prevalence of maternity blues and the associated factors. Material and method: In a cross-sectional study, women at immediate postpartum were recruited. It was applied face-to face the Edinburgh test for determining maternity blues. Other registered data were: maternal age, education level, parity, death sons, history of depressive episodes, sleeping disorders, and if the pregnancy was planned or unplanned. The statistical analysis included arithmetic mean, percentages, Chi2, Student t test; and logistic regression analysis for determining the associated factors with the maternity blues. An alpha value was set at 0.05. Results: Overall 1,134 women, 21 of them (1.8%) were diagnosed as maternity blues. The significant factors associated with maternity blues were: the history of death sons, p &lt; 0.002; depressive episodes, p &lt; 0.001; and sleeping disorders, p &lt; 0.003. Conclusion: The frequency of maternity blues is low in our population. The associated factors with this disease should be identified during antenatal care in order to offer special care to these women, in order to avoid the complications associated with this entity.

AB  - MAIN RESULTS: Of the 25 trials (3689 mothers and 793 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2868 mothers and 613 fathers) reported useable data. Educational interventions included: four on infant sleep enhancement, 13 on infant behaviour, two on general post-birth health, two on infant care, three on infant safety, and one on father involvement/skills with infants. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only six were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these six meta-analyses, only two were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education on sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. Education on infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education on sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep and education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm this.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided by an educator to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post birth related to the care of an infant or parent-infant relationships. We excluded studies of educational interventions for parents of infants in neonatal intensive care units.
BACKGROUND: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for their newborns during this time.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered by an educator to an individual or group on infant general health and parent-infant relationships.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to July 2009), ERIC (1966 to July 2009), HealthSTAR (1966 to July 2009), PsycINFO (1806 to July 2009), Sociological Abstracts (1974 to July 2009), ClinicalTrials.gov (August 2009), Current Controlled Trials (August 2009), and Trialscentral.org (August 2009).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports.

AB  - Parents experiencing early parenting difficulties often seek support through parenting programs. Characteristics of mothers seeking parenting support and information at an early parenting center in Victoria, Australia and the relationships between these factors and parenting behavior were explored using an observational measure of parent-child interaction. Participants were 43 mothers and children attending a 5-day residential parenting program at the Queen Elizabeth Centre. Maternal and sociodemographic data as well as an observational mother-child interaction task from the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Parent Child Interaction Teaching scale were completed and scored on the first day of the program. Certain maternal factors and experiences were associated with observed parenting behavior. Poorer maternal sleeping quality, unplanned pregnancy and preterm birth were all associated with less optimal parenting behavior in certain domains. Findings are discussed with reference to the impact of past experiences around pregnancy and birth as well as the current context and well-being of mothers attending early parenting centers. © 2010 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - Objective: Interest in herbal treatments has increased without data on safety, efficacy, or rates of use in pregnancy. We examined antenatal herbal and natural product use among mothers of nonmalformed infants in 5 geographic centers. Study design: We used data on nonmalformed infants from the Slone Epidemiology Center's case-control surveillance program for birth defects to examine rates and predictors of herbal use. Exposures were identified through maternal interview. In addition to overall use, 5 categories based on traditional uses and 2 natural product categories were created; topical products and herbal-containing multivitamins were excluded. Results: Among 4866 mothers of nonmalformed infants, 282 (5.8%) reported use of herbal or natural treatments. Use varied by study center and increased with increasing age. Conclusion: Although rates of use are low, there remains a need for investigation of the safety of these products. Given sparse data on efficacy, even small risks might well outweigh benefits. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is one of the most common neurological diseases characterized by an urge to move the legs, often associated with unpleasant sensations relieved by movement. It is engendered by rest, and is worse in the evening or at night. Patients affected by severe RLS should be treated pharmacologically. Dopamine-agonists represent the first-line treatment for RLS symptoms. Pramipexole is a non-ergot derived dopamine agonist with a high selectivity for D2 and D3 receptors. At doses comprised between 0.125 and 0.75 mg, pramipexole improves subjective symptoms and objective signs of primary RLS even after the first administration. In addition, pramipexole seems to be safe and well tolerated. However, physicians should be aware that augmentation and compulsive behaviours might occur in their RLS patients treated with pramipexole. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of pramipexole in uremic RLS and in children affected by the sleep disorder. © the author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.

AB  - Objective To determine the functional development of children born after treatment of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension with labetalol versus methyldopa, and no antihypertensive treatment. Design Historical cohort study. Setting Twelve Dutch hospital departments of obstetrics. Population Live-born children born in these hospitals and prenatally exposed to labetalol, methyldopa, or bed rest because of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension. Methods Central nervous system development was measured with standard tests at 4-10 years of age. Linear regression techniques and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to compare the groups with regard to the outcome measures. Main outcome measures Intelligence quotient (IQ), concentration, motor development, and behaviour at primary school age. Results A total of 202 children were included in the analyses. More children exposed to labetalol had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than those exposed to methyldopa (OR 2.3; 95% CI 0.7-7.3), or those born to women who had been admitted for bed rest (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.2-13.9). Sleeping problems seemed to be reported more frequently after prenatal methyldopa exposure than after exposure to labetalol (OR 3.2; 95% CI 0.6-16.7) or bed rest (OR 4.5; 95% CI 0.9-23.2), although the differences were not statistically significant. Test scores on other aspects of functional development did not differ between the three groups. Conclusions In this hypothesis-generating study, labetalol exposure in utero seemed to increase the risk of ADHD among children of primary school age, whereas prenatal methyldopa exposure might influence sleep. Further studies with appropriate sample sizes are warranted to determine the long-term effects of antihypertensive medications. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

AB  - We examined background information and course of labour from a cohort of 2,810 low-risk nulliparas to identify possible lifestyle and anthropometrical risk indicators for dystocia. Criteria for dystocia: cervical dilatation <2cm over 4h during labour's active phase, or no descent during 2h (3h with epidural) in the descending phase, or no progress for 1h during the expulsive phase. After adjustments, athletics or heavy gardening ≥4h per week appeared protective for dystocia (OR 0.63, CI 0.45-0.89), contrary to a non-significant finding of intensive physical training (OR 1.57, CI 0.84-2.93). Caffeine intake of 200-299mg/day was associated with dystocia (OR 1.37, CI 1.04-1.80); also high maternal age (OR 2.25, CI 1.58-3.22), small stature (OR 2.18, CI 1.51-3.15) and pre-pregnancy overweight (OR 1.28, CI 1.02-1.61). No association was found between dystocia and alcohol intake, smoking, night sleep and options for resting during the day.

AB  - Background: Asthma is among the most common serious medical problems in pregnancy, and its prevalence may be increasing. Management is problematic because asthma may harm the fetus, yet little is known about fetal risks of asthma medications. Objective: To examine the prevalence, symptom control, and pharmacologic treatment of asthma in pregnancy. Methods: Study participants were a random sample of 3,609 mothers of nonmalformed infants born in Massachusetts between 1998 and 2006. Interviewed within 6 months of delivery, participants were asked specific asthma-related questions and classified as having physician-diagnosed, possible, past, or no asthma; those with physician-diagnosed asthma were classified as having well-controlled, not well-controlled, or poorly controlled asthma. Drug treatments were grouped into corticosteroids, β2-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, combination products, and others. Results: Physician-diagnosed asthma was present in 502 women (13.9%) and possible asthma in an additional 578 (16.0%). Higher rates of asthma were observed among women who were younger, white, obese, and less well educated, had lower income, and smoked during pregnancy. Secular changes were unremarkable: leukotriene modifiers were used by only 3.4% of asthmatic women; inhaled steroid use increased only from 19.0% during 19971999 to 23.3% in 20032005, whereas use of inhaled β2-agonists exceeded 50% in both periods. Less than 40% of women with poorly controlled asthma symptoms reported use of a controller medication. Conclusions: High rates of asthma and asthma symptoms, together with the low rates of use of controller medications, underscore the need to better understand the risks and safety of asthma medications during pregnancy. © 2010 American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.
Indications:An unspecified number of patients with asthma. Coexisting disease: an unspecified number with obesity.
Results:The results are given for the whole group of patients receiving Asthma medications without separate data for corticosteroids, β2-agonists (including Foradil), leukotriene modifiers, combination products, and others (primarily mast cell stabilizers). Physician-diagnosed asthma was most prevalent among the youngest women and decreased with age. Higher prevalences were observed in women who were white, were obese, had less than a high school education, smoked during pregnancy, and lived in households with 5 or more members. Possible asthma was more prevalent among women who were young, were less well educated, and smoked during pregnancy, but, in contrast to physician-diagnosed asthma, possible asthma was most common among underweight women and was not associated with household size. Restricting patients to those with physician-diagnosed asthma, women classified as having poorly controlled asthma tended to be older, to be less well educated, to smoke during pregnancy, to have lower family incomes, and to live in larger households than women with well-controlled asthma, although only the relationships with lower income and larger household size were statistically significant. Women in the not well-controlled category were more likely to be older than 24 years and in the lowest income group. There was no significant trend over time in the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma, but the proportion of women with possible asthma decreased from 21% to 10% between 1997 and 2005. Overall, approximately half (53%) of women with physician-diagnosed asthma reported no change in symptoms, the proportion varied from 41% among those with poorly controlled asthma to 69% among those with well-controlled asthma. Those whose symptoms changed were almost equally divided between those who improved (24.6%) and those who worsened (22.4%). Women with poorly controlled asthma were more likely to report improvement (34.9%) than women with not well-controlled (23%) or well-controlled asthma (16.7%). Worsening of symptoms was almost equally likely to occur in any trimester (6.7%-7.9%), whereas improvement was noted more often in the 1st trimester (11.8% vs. 8.3% or 4.5%). For indication-based medication use and class-based medication use, rates were highest among those with physician-diagnosed asthma, and within that category use decreased with better symptom control; there was little use among study participants with possible or past asthma. 63.3% of women whose asthma symptoms were poorly controlled did not use a controller medication during pregnancy. In women classified as not having asthma, none reported using a medication to treat asthma, although 4.1% reported use of a recognized asthma medication for other indications. Among the drug classes, no significant trends were found in use of any asthma drug, any steroid, any β2-agonist, or any other asthma medication, and use of steroids by a specific route did not change significantly. Virtually all β2-agonist use was via inhalation. According to lunar month of pregnancy, rates of use of inhaled steroids and β2-agonists were nearly constant for the period beginning 2 months before the last menstrual period (LMP) through the fourth lunar month. Inhaled steroid use decreased from 5% before pregnancy to 4.5%, and for β2-agonists the corresponding rates were 16% and 14%. Use of other asthma medications, including leukotriene modifiers and combination products was generally low, but use of leukotriene modifiers increased consistently over time, and use of combination products increased significantly, consistent with their recent introduction to the market. The most commonly reported specific asthma medications were albuterol (53%), fluticasone (9.4%), beclomethasone (5.2%), and budesonide (3.0%).
Patients:3609 pregnant females; an unspecified number were on corticosteroids, β2-agonists (including Foradil), leukotriene modifiers, combination products, and others (primarily mast cell stabilizers). Physician-diagnosed asthma group: n=502; 126 were ≤24 years, 122 were 25-29 years, 149 were 30-34 years and 103 ≥35 years; 418 white, 23 black, 48 Hispanic, 6 Asian and 7 other; 84 obese; 51 > high school education, 227 high school education and 224 college education; 153 were well controlled, 202 not well controlled and 147 poorly controlled. Possible asthma group: n=578; 110 were ≤24 years, 116 were 25-29 years, 214 were 30-34 years and 137 ≥35 years; 468 white, 28 black, 63 Hispanic, 13 Asian and 6 other; 77 obese; 53 > high school education, 260 high school education and 265 college education. Past asthma group: n=13. No asthma group: n=2392.
TypeofStudy:A retrospective study examining the prevalence of asthma, levels of asthma control, the use of asthma medications (including Foradil) among pregnant women, and the relationship between pregnancy and asthma symptoms.
DosageDuration:Dosage and duration not stated. Given inhalationally.
AdverseEffects:No adverse events were mentioned.
AuthorsConclusions:In summary, this study confirms that asthma is a common condition in pregnant women in Massachusetts; we found that nearly 14% of mothers of nonmalformed newborns reported having been told by a health care professional that they had asthma within the 5 years before the pregnancy, and 50% of these reported using at least 1 medication for their asthma during pregnancy. An additional 16% reported symptoms consistent with asthma, and almost 10% of those were treated with an asthma medication. Given the NAEPP guidelines and the introduction of new medications, we expected to see appreciable changes in the drug management of asthma. Although we observed a small increase in use of inhaled steroids to 23%, it remains well below that of β2-agonists (50%-60%). Leukotriene modifiers and combination drugs appear to have had little impact on the pharmacologic treatment of asthma during pregnancy in the current study. Of concern, among women whose symptoms were poorly controlled, only approximately 37% reported use of controller medications, suggesting inadequate treatment of potentially severe asthma symptoms. These rates of asthma, asthma symptoms, and asthma medication use underscore the need to better understand the risks and safety of these medications in pregnancy, as well as the risks of asthma itself.

FreeText:All patients were interviewed using a series of questions related specifically to asthma diagnosis, symptoms, and management. The level of asthma control was also evaluated: whether asthma required unscheduled medical visits, prednisone or cortisone, hospitalization, or intubation. Women were asked questions relating to the extent to which their symptoms interfered with activities or sleep. Physician-diagnosed asthma was defined as health care professional-diagnosed asthma that was present within the past 5 years. Possible asthma was defined as either bronchitis, wheezing, chest tightness, or persistent cough within the past 5 years, or shortness of breath in the past 5 years with at least 1 positive response (other than only during pregnancy) to the questions about timing of symptoms. Past asthma was defined as physician-diagnosed asthma that was not present within the past 5 years. A scale reflecting the degree of symptom control for physician-diagnosed asthma was used. Drug treatments were grouped into 5 major classes: corticosteroids, β2-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, combination products, and others (primarily mast cell stabilizers). Corticosteroids and β2-agonists were further subdivided according to route of administration. Asthma medications as either controller or reliever drugs: controllers included inhaled steroids, salmeterol, cromolyn, nedocromil, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and Foradil; relievers included all other asthma medications.

AB  - Introduction The advent of diagnostic modalities like transesophageal echocardiography and transcranial Doppler sonography has made the once considered uncommon diagnosis of paradoxical embolism now a rather common and important cause of systemic embolism. The term paradoxical embolism was first used by Conheim in 1877 to describe venous emboli reaching the systemic arterial circulation through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) [1]. The diagnosis was rarely attempted until noninvasive (or minimally invasive) technology like contrast enhanced echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler made it much easier and also shed light on its true incidence. Currently, transesophageal echocardiography is probably the gold standard for the diagnosis of right-to-left intracardiac shunts, and less reliably, intrapulmonary shunts [2–7]. Among the conditions that cause paradoxical embolism, the communications between the atria are the most frequent; the most common of the atrial communications is the PFO. Unfortunately, the working definitions of clinical studies of PFO are extremely variable, and it is possible that several types of intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunts are included in the mostly noninvasive studies. Embryologically, the common atrium begins to divide into right and left atria in the fifth week of gestation [8]. A membrane, the septum primum, grows caudally from above, fusing with the endocardial cushion and closing a gap known as the ostium primum. From partial resorption of the septum primum, a small defect named the ostium secundum forms. Another septum, the septum secundum, grows from the superior aspect of the common atrium, descending on the right of the septum primum and incompletely covering the ostium secundum. The foramen ovale therefore consists of the incomplete fusion of the septum primum and septum secundum that leaves a cave- or tunnel-like opening that allows oxygenated blood to bypass the lungs during intrauterine life [8] (Figure 7.1). © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - The case A 39-year-old gravida 10 para 9 (G10P9) is admitted for treatment and evaluation to the obstetrics floor for abdominal pain. The obstetricians are telling you that the patient probably has placenta accreta and placenta previa on ultrasound. Furthermore, the obstetricians relate to you that the baby has no heart rate and no movement is visualized on ultrasound at 36 weeks' gestation. The patient has no significant past medical history. Her obstetric history is extensive, including five vaginal births and four previous cesarean sections. Her cesarean sections were complicated by uterine atony after each procedure, requiring blood transfusions and an intensive care unit stay for the last one. It is recommended to the patient that she undergo bilateral uterine artery embolization as well as abdominal hysterectomy to remove the dead fetus and to prevent postpartum hemorrhage from previa and accreta. The patient is devastated at the loss of her child and is refusing all medical care. She just wanted to be given some sedation and sleep. After extensive discussion with the patient and the obstetrician, it is determined that an initial attempt to perform a cesarean section will be made; if, however, the patient begins to have bleeding of any kind, no further attempts will be made to deliver the placenta, and the patient will then undergo abdominal hysterectomy. The patient is brought to the operating room and an epidural catheter is placed successfully with a T5 thoracic level obtained using 2% lidocaine with 1:200, 000 epinephrine, approximately 20 mL. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

AB  - Obesity is a growing problem. In England in 2008, 66% of men and 57% of women had a BMI >25 kg/m2; within this 24% of men and 25% of women were obese with a BMI >30 kg/m2. Obesity is a major contributing cause of disease. The relative risk (RR) of diabetes in overweight men is 2.40 and in obese men 6.74 compared with men with a BMI in the normal range. The respective RR values in women are 3.92 and 12.41. There is a 40% increased risk of death from CVD for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI above 25 kg/m2. Obesity is also associated with a raised risk of: fertility problems, cirrhosis, osteoarthritis, pregnancy complications, obstructive sleep apnoea and asthma. Patients should be offered advice on dietary change and increasing physical activity which includes behavioural components. Encouragement to make small changes in a sustained way can make significant differences to energy balance. Physical activity should be of moderate intensity (increased heart rate and breathing but still able to converse). Drug treatment is a useful addition when lifestyle measures alone are not effective. Evidence is increasing for the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in treating obesity-related disease, particularly diabetes.

AB  - The rising prevalence of obesity is a worldwide problem affecting not only the developed world but also developing nations such as South Africa. Excess body fat deposition is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure and there are many genetic and environmental factors that can influence this balance. The present article will describe these factors and discuss the complex interaction between the environment and the human genome that may underlie the current obesity epidemic.

AB  - Bariatric surgery is intended for subjects with BMI≥40kg/m2 or ≥35kg/m2 with comorbidities. In any case, the indication can only be envisaged in patients who have had access to specialized medical care, and agree with a prolonged medical follow-up. After 60 years old, physiological age and comorbidities need to be highly considered. In genetic obesity and craniopharyngioma, surgery is exceptional. Main contraindications consist in severe disorders in feeding behaviour, non-stabilized psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug addiction, inability to participate in prolonged medical follow-up. Surgical process includes many important stages: preparation and information by a multidisciplinary team (identify contraindication, give optimal information, look for and treat comorbidities [as sleep apneoas syndrome, diabetes, cardiopulmonary disease], assess nutritional and psychological status and feeding behaviour); the decision of intervention during a concerted analysis by a multidisciplinary team; follow-up (for life) led to screen for nutritional deficiencies and surgical complications, to reinforce diet and physical activity counselling, to adapt to new situations (as pregnancy), and advise psychological care if necessary. © 2010.

AB  - Objective: To develop and validate a prediction model for psychosocial problems in preadolescence using data on early developmental factors from routine Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH). Study design: The data come from the 1692 participants who take part in the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal study. Information on early developmental factors (ages 0 to 4 years) was collected from the PCH file. Parents complete the Child Behavior Checklist when their child is age 11. To examine the predictive value of PCH-registered developmental factors on preadolescent problems, several multiple logistic regression analysis were performed, in a derivation sample (n = 1058). The predictive performance of the models was then assessed with area under the curve (AUC) in a validation sample (n = 643) to evaluate the validity of these models. Results: PCH-registered behavioral problems, attention/hyperactivity problems, enuresis, education level of the father, and being male were found to significantly predict externalizing problems (odds ratios [OR] between 1.4 and 3.7). Internalizing problems were predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, sleep problems, and being male (ORs between 1.7 and 3.0). The model for externalizing problems had a modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.72). However, for internalizing problems the AUC was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.60), indicating poor discriminatory power. Conclusions: Findings on early development as registered by PCH are modestly predictive for externalizing problems in preadolescents, but only slightly for internalizing problems.

AB  - The postpartum period is a time of increased risk of new-onset psychiatric illness, hospital admissions and out-patient psychiatric care for new mothers. Research into postpartum mood disorders has focused primarily on major depressive disorder, and has overlooked the study of bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar II disorder and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Failure to properly diagnose postpartum bipolar disorder may delay the initiation of appropriate treatment, lead to inappropriate treatment-thereby precipitating (hypo)mania, rapid cycling or a mixed episode-or result in polypharmacy and treatment refractoriness. The most serious consequence, however, is the high risk of infanticide and suicide among women with postpartum bipolar disorder. While no specific screening tools have been validated for postpartum mania or bipolar depression, symptoms of hypomania, atypical depression, a family history of bipolar disorder and a rapid onset of depressive symptoms following delivery may suggest a bipolar diathesis. In the absence of any pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatments to guide clinical decision-making, it is recommended that the treatment of postpartum bipolar depression follow the same guidelines as the treatment of non-postpartum bipolar depression, using medications that are compatible with lactation. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - There are currently two clinically and molecularly defined forms of myotonic dystrophy: (1) myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), also known as 'Steinert's disease'; and (2) myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), also known as proximal myotonic myopathy. DM1 and DM2 are progressive multisystem genetic disorders with several clinical and genetic features in common. DM1 is the most common form of adult onset muscular dystrophy whereas DM2 tends to have a milder phenotype with later onset of symptoms and is rarer than DM1. This review will focus on the clinical features, diagnosis and management of DM1 and DM2 and will briefly discuss the recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases with particular reference to new treatments using gene therapy.

AB  - Given that anxiety disorders are common and chronic and often co-morbid with both medical and psychiatric conditions, effective and safe anxiolytic drugs are in great demand. Serotonergic agents, in particular the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, have an established track record for the pharmacological treatment of a wide range of anxiety disorders. Despite their slow onset of therapeutic action, their initial exacerbation of anxiety and some of their long-term unwanted effects, they remain the drugs of first choice in primary care. They are relatively safe and exhibit both anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Other antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, reboxetine and agomelatine, and the 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone, are alternative agents, although the evidence of their efficacy covers a narrower spectrum of anxiety disorders. Patients with anxiety disorders who are resistant to these drugs may benefit from second-line (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or even specialist initiated third-line (benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant or antipsychotic) therapy. None of the currently available drugs are ideal for every patient and the advantages and disadvantages of each are best considered when treatment is individualised. © SAAFP.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to collect data on thermal care practices in rural Ghana to inform the design of a community newborn intervention. METHODS: All 635 women who delivered in six districts in Ghana in the first 2 weeks of December 2006 were interviewed about immediate newborn care. Qualitative data on thermal care practices and barriers and facilitators to behaviour change were collected from recently deliveredpregnant women, birth attendantsgrandmothers, and husband through birth narratives, in-depth interviews and focus group discussion. RESULTS: Respondents knew that keeping the baby warm was essential for health but 71% of babies born at home had delayed drying, 79% delayed wrapping, 93% early bathing and 10% were placed skin-to-skin. Birth attendants were usually in charge of mother and baby immediately after birth. Delays in dryingwrapping were linked to leaving the baby unattended until the placenta was delivered. Early bathing was linked to reducing body odour in later life, shaping the baby's head, and helping the baby sleep and feel clean. Respondents thought that changing bathing behaviours would be difficult, especially as babies are bathed early in facilities. The concept of skin-to-skin care was easily understood and most women said they would try it if it was good for the baby. CONCLUSION: Thermal care is a key component of community newborn interventions, the design of which should be based on an understanding of current behaviours and beliefs. Formative research can help select focus behaviours, decide who to include in interventions, ensure consistent messages and determine what messages and approaches are needed to overcome behaviour change barriers. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered first-line therapy for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); however, about one half of patients stop therapy within one year. Initial CPAP use has been shown to predict long-term adherence, and strategies to maximize initial use could reduce the eventual abandonment of therapy. Prescribing a short-term course of a nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic when initiating CPAP therapy is one potential strategy. Lettieri and colleagues conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine if an initial short course of eszopiclone (Lunesta) would improve long-term CPAP adherence. The Study: The authors recruited patients newly diagnosed with OSA who were initiating CPAP therapy. All patients received formal mask-fitting, and were randomized to receive 3 mg of eszopiclone or a placebo nightly for the first 14 nights of CPAP therapy. During the next six months, CPAP use was monitored by a smart card adherence-monitoring device that was integrated into the CPAP units. Patients were excluded if they had a long-term history of taking hypnotic medications, drank more than two alcoholic beverages per night, were pregnant, or had been diagnosed with a hepatic disease or a psychiatric condition that would preclude completion of the study. Results: A total of 154 patients with similar baseline traits were randomized to receive eszopiclone or placebo. The eszopiclone group used their CPAP machines more often than the control group (64.4 versus 45.2 percent of nights), and for a longer period on average (4.05 versus 3.02 hours per night. Patients using placebo were nearly twice as likely to discontinue CPAP therapy (hazard ratio = 1.90) as patients using eszopiclone. Results were unrelated to apnea severity, age, or baseline sleepiness scores. Conclusion: The authors conclude that an initial two-week course of eszopiclone in patients with OSA increases their CPAP adherence, and significantly decreases discontinuation rates within the first six months of use. © 2010 by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

AB  - A Puzzle About Physical Education Although Aristotle says that Plato's educational recommendations in the Laws are pretty much the same as in the Republic (PoliticsII.6.1265a6–8), one striking difference in the Laws is its emphasis on a lifelong regime of gymnastics or prescribed physical movement: the Athenian says that pregnant mothers are to take exercise so that the fetus they are carrying is moved about (789a–93e); from the age of three to six, children must play at wrestling and dancing (814e–16e); thereafter, they are to dance (as well as sing) in the chorus of the Muses until the age of twenty, when they graduate to the chorus of Apollo (664c), in which they participate until they reach old age and retire to the chorus of Dionysus (653d, 665a, 666b, 670b, 812b–c). They also train in fighting (813d–e). But what is the value of all this physical activity? The answer to this question is surprisingly elusive, and trying to answer it takes us to the heart of the psychology of Plato's late dialogues. Let us begin with two passages in the Laws that suggest a direction for our investigation. In the first, the Athenian is commending the practice of rocking distressed babies to calm them. whenever mothers want their children to sleep when they are having trouble falling asleep, they bring to them not rest but, the opposite, motion, always shaking them in their arms, not in silence but with a song, exactly as if they were charming their children with flute-playing as in the cures of ecstatic Bacchics, using this dance of motion and the Muse … Both these affections [viz. the crying child's and the Bacchics'] are fear, and fear comes through some bad disposition of the soul.

AB  - We present four patients, in whom we identified overlapping deletions in 5q14.3 involving MEF2C using a clinical oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). In case 1, CMA revealed an ∼140 kb deletion encompassing the first three exons of MEF2C in a 3-year-old patient with severe psychomotor retardation, periodic tremor, and an abnormal motor pattern with mirror movement of the upper limbs observed during infancy, hypotonia, abnormal EEG, epilepsy, absence of speech, autistic behavior, bruxism, and mild dysmorphic features. MRI of the brain showed mild thinning of the corpus callosum and delay of white matter myelination in the occipital lobes. In case 2, an ∼1.8Mb deletion of TMEM161B and MEF2C was found in a child with severe developmental delay, hypotonia, and seizures. Patient 3 had epilepsy, hypotonia, thinning of the corpus callosum, and developmental delay associated with a de novo ∼2.4Mb deletion in 5q14.3 including MEF2C and five other genes. In case 4, a de novo ∼5.7Mb deletion of MEF2C and five other genes was found in a child with truncal hypotonia, intractable seizures, profound developmental delay, and shortening of the corpus callosum on brain MRI. These deletions further support that haploinsufficiency of MEF2C is responsible for severe mental retardation, seizures, and hypotonia. Our results, in combination with previous reports, imply that exon -targeted oligo array CGH, which is more efficient in identifying exonic copy number variants, should improve the detection of clinically significant deletions and duplications over arrays with probes spaced evenly throughout the genome. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - • Every patient who has chest pain warrants a thorough evaluation. Usually, the history and physical examination are sufficient to diagnose the cause of the pain. • Based on strong research evidence, musculoskeletal chest pain is the most common cause of chest pain in the pediatric population. (3) Educating and reassuring both the patient and the family about the benign nature of chest pain is of utmost importance. • Based on some research evidence as well as on consensus, a cardiac cause for chest pain is more likely if the pain occurs during exertion. (3) Any coexisting symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia or an abnormal cardiac finding should prompt immediate referral to a pediatric cardiologist.

AB  - Background: This study investigated the effects of the low-dose combined oral contraceptive (COC) 2.0 mg chlormadinone acetate (CMA)/0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (EE) (Belara®, Balanca®) on cycle-related physical and emotional disorders in women ≥25 years of age. Study Design: A prospective, non-interventional, observational study of 3772 women over six cycles was conducted in 303 office-based gynecological centers throughout Germany. Results: CMA/EE provided high contraceptive efficacy with a Pearl index of 0 (95% confidence interval=0.00-0.22) and was generally well tolerated, with no statistically significant weight changes during the observation period (p=.147). CMA/EE intake resulted in a statistically significant improvement in cycle-related physical and emotional symptoms, with a 67% overall reduction in sum score for number and intensity of cycle-related symptoms per patient. Conclusions: The results of this study in women ≥25 years of age support previous findings that 2.0 mg CMA/0.03 mg EE is an effective low-dose COC, with an excellent tolerability profile, with the additional benefits of significantly reducing both cycle-related physical and emotional symptoms (p≤.001); women with the respective preexisting symptoms may, therefore, benefit from CMA/EE contraceptive treatment. Further research is warranted. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Within the same context of pollution by human activity, it is interesting to know that retreatment with anacardic acids reduced lung inflammation upon exposure to diesel exhaust particles in experimental animals (Carvalho, A.L.N, et al., A1729), suggesting ways to improve human health. Along with pollution, which in New Orleans during the days of the meeting was largely washed away by the heavy rains, smoking remains a major health threat of specific interest for respiratory tract disease specialists. Although effective, well-tolerated treatments are available for smoking cessation in patients willing to quit, including, as reported during this year's ATS meeting in New Orleans, varenicline (Bolliger, C.T. et al., A2648; Tashkin, D.P. et al., A2858), smoking habits persist across cultures, countries, genders and geographical areas, and relapses are remarkably common even after successful pharmacological treatment (Ponnuswamy, A. et al., A2651). Effective smoking cessation certainly requires more than drugs, as the overall effectiveness has been shown to depend on the subjects' education level (Santos, S.R. et al., A2653), and psychobehavioral/ cognitive interventions may help obtain successful outcomes. However, in addition to the already known but repeatedly confirmed negative impact of smoke on respiratory tract health, an interesting observation among this year's discussions was that use of olive oil throughout pregnancy results in a reduced likelihood for wheezing during the first year of life in the offspring (Castro-Rodriguez, J.A. et al., A1865) (an effect probably not dependent on the observed ability of oleanoic acid for preventing experimental acute lung injuries through inflammatory pathway modulation [Santos, R. et al., A2156]), whereas use of antibiotics during pregnancy was associated with an increased likelihood of wheezing in the offspring from the third year of age, peaking in the early school age and waning slowly up to young adulthood (Garcia-Marcos, L. et al., A4144). However, many other therapeutic issues of interest competed with all the attractions in New Orleans for the attention of congress attendees, and are briefly summarized in the following report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder is unclear. There are several factors unique to the perioperative period that may increase a patient's risk of perioperative seizures, including medications administered, timing of medication administration, missed doses of antiepileptic medications, and sleep deprivation. We designed this retrospective chart review to evaluate the frequency of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with a documented history of a seizure disorder who received an anesthetic between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2007. Patients excluded from this study include those who had an outpatient procedure or intracranial procedure, ASA classification of V, pregnant women, and patients younger than 2 years of age. The first hospital admission of at least 24 hours during which an anesthetic was provided was identified for each patient. Patient demographics, character of the seizure disorder, details of the surgical procedure, and clinically apparent seizure activity in the perioperative period (within 3 days after the anesthetic) were recorded. RESULTS: During the 6-year study period, 641 patients with a documented seizure disordr were admitted for at least 24 hours after an anesthetic. Twenty-two patients experienced perioperative seizure activity for an overall frequency of 3.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%-5.2%). The frequency of preoperative seizures (P < 0.001) and the timing of the most recent seizure (P < 0.001) were both found to be significantly related to the likelihood of experiencing a perioperative seizure. As the number of antiepileptic medications increased, so did the frequency of perioperative seizures (P < 0.001). Neither the type of surgery nor the type of anesthetic (general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care) affected the frequency of perioperative seizures in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the majority of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder are likely related to the patient's underlying condition. The frequency of seizures is not influenced by the type of anesthesia or procedure. Because patients with frequent seizures at baseline are likely to experience a seizure in the perioperative period, it is essential to be prepared to treat seizure activity regardless of the surgical procedure or anesthetic technique.
